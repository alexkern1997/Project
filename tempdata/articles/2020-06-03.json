      "bodyText": "A world without cheques, fewer ATMs and a regulatory push to lower electronic transaction fees as fewer people use cash are some of the likely impacts of Covid-19 on payments, the Reserve Bank has said. RBA assistant governor Michele Bullock told a Morgan Stanley disruption conference on Wednesday that cash was now the payment method for just 25% of transactions, or around 10% of their value. The long-term decline of cash has been accelerated by merchants and consumers concerned about hygiene during the Covid-19 pandemic, with many putting up signs asking for card payments or rejecting cash altogether, she said. As shoppers flocked instead to online shopping, where cash was not an option, ATM withdrawals in April were down 30% from the month before and more than 40% lower than the year before. Bullock said it was \u201clikely that a large part of this will become a permanent change in behaviour\u201d and add to pressure on banks to reduce the number of ATMs in their networks \u2013 a consolidation that will be \u201cmore urgent\u201d and occur \u201cmore quickly\u201d as a result. But Bullock said there was \u201cstill a significant minority of the population that continue to use cash for face-to-face payments\u201d. \u201cWhile a third of survey respondents did not use cash for any payments, around 10% used cash for all their payments. Cash users tended to be older or people on lower incomes.\u201d Bullock said the reduction in ATMs would have to be managed to prevent disadvantaging those remaining cash users. It was now \u201cmore important than ever that we ensure competitive pressure remains on the costs of electronic payments to merchants\u201d. Merchants would likely grapple with payment providers by threatening to apply surcharges if they did not lower their fees, and would need \u201cleast-cost routing\u201d such as access to Eftpos. Bullock said the RBA had so far \u201cnot mandated\u201d providers offer least-cost routing to all merchants but it \u201cremains an option\u201d under consideration, as well as improving transparency of payment plans. \u201cBut ultimately, if banks or other stakeholders are acting in ways that prevent downward pressure on merchant fees, we may need to consider regulatory options for keeping the cost of electronic payments low.\u201d Bullock said banks were considering closing the cheque system because electronic conveyancing was now the norm and there were few remaining uses of cheques. Covid-19 had led to banks encouraging their remaining customers without internet banking to sign up, which \u201cmay bring the efficiency implications of maintaining the cheque system into even sharper focus\u201d. Bullock said that \u201cthe shift to electronic is perhaps not as difficult as many had thought\u201d, citing outages in banks\u2019 electronic payments system as one of the pitfalls. With so few shoppers carrying cash, disruptions forced people to \u201cleave goods at the counter\u201d and merchants had \u201cto close until the systems were restored\u201d. Bullock said the sector must \u201cidentify and mitigate risks of reliance on supporting infrastructure that can be single points of failure, such as the telecommunications and energy sectors\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets in Asia have risen to their highest level for almost three months on the back of renewed optimism that the global economy will recover strongly from the coronavirus crisis. Despite the rising markets, in Australia the treasurer has announced the country is in its first recession for 29 years because of the pandemic. The spread of the virus has become increasingly alarming in Brazil, which registered another record number of fatalities from Covid-19 on Tuesday, the health ministry said. The situation also worsened elsewhere in Latin America. After shares on Wall Street shrugged off another night of unrest on the streets of American cities to post a third straight day of gains, markets soared upwards from Seoul to Sydney and Tokyo to Hong Kong. The optimistic mood was rooted in a belief among investors that central banks and governments will unleash more fiscal and monetary stimulus in the coming months \u2013 especially in Europe \u2013 to ward off the economic impact of virus-related lockdowns. Figures released from China on Wednesday showing a strong bounce in its services sector. The monthly purchasing managers\u2019 index for the sector came in at 55 points for May compared with 44 in April. Any figure above 50 means the sector is growing. One company that has seen rapid increase in its share price is Zoom, the videoconferencing provider. Its financial results on Tuesday night showed it made $27m in the first quarter of the fiscal year compared with just $198,000 a year ago. It expects sales to double in the coming year as people around the world flock to its video service despite concerns about security. Shares in Zoom have tripled in value this year and it is worth more than the major US airlines combined. Figures out on Wednesday showed that the Australian economy shrank 0.3% in the quarter to March with the June quarter expected to show another slump. In South Korea the government on Wednesday proposed its biggest stimulus package yet. The virus has already thrust the world\u2019s 12th-largest economy into a 1.3% quarter-on-quarter contraction in the January-March period, the biggest drop in gross domestic product since the 2008 global financial crisis. The 35.3tn won ($29bn) package is the third announced by the government of Moon Jae-in in response to the virus, after boosts of 11.7tn and 12.2tn won in March and April. The objectives include the creation of 550,000 jobs and providing \u201cemergency funds\u201d to business owners. The virus has infected 6.37 million people globally and more than 380,000 have died, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University. Brazil registered 28,936 additional cases of the novel coronavirus in the 24 hours to Tuesday evening, the ministry said, and 1,262 deaths. There are now 555,383 total confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil and 31,199 coronavirus deaths. It is the second worst affected country behind the United States. The fresh record came as the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to belittle the threat of the virus, warning that the economic fallout from quarantine measures would be worse than the pandemic itself. \u201cI regret each of the deaths but that\u2019s everyone\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capital, Bras\u00edlia. Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000. Rio de Janeiro has Brazil\u2019s second-highest death toll with 5,686 deaths followed by the north-eastern state of Cear\u00e1 where 3,421 people have died. Scientists and medical experts believe the situation is dire and likely to get worse. \u201cNot even in our most dreadful nightmare could we have imagined the situation we are now in,\u201d Drauzio Varella, a doctor and broadcaster, wrote in one of Brazil\u2019s top newspapers. Mexican health authorities reported on Tuesday an additional 3,891 cases of Covid-19, a new record of daily cases, and 470 more deaths. This took the total number of known cases to 97,326 and 10,637 deaths. Health authorities have previously said the real number is higher. Other developments around the world include: Britain\u2019s opposition leader, Keir Starmer, has called on Boris Johnson to \u201cget a grip\u201d on the coronavirus pandemic or risk a second wave of infections. Health experts in the UK have cast doubt on hopes for \u201cair bridges\u201d to enable people to take holidays abroad this summer. At least 100,000 people including coronavirus patients were being evacuated as India\u2019s west coast braced for a cyclone \u2013 the first such storm to threaten Mumbai in more than 70 years. London\u2019s famous West End theatre is set to defy the lockdown and go ahead with an opening of The Great Gatsby in October.",

Martin Lewis, the TV presenter and chair of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, is behind a campaign to halt the threatening letters, which stem from rules in the Consumer Credit Act (1974) that compel lenders to send a warning once a borrower has failed to make two payments in a row. Lewis said: \u201cThe fact that lenders are forced by a decades-old law to send thuggish letters to people with debt problems is staggering.

Some lenders have taken steps to circumvent the rules with \u201cwraparound\u201d letters that tell borrowers they can ignore the letters lenders are legally obliged to send. Nationwide building society told payment holiday applicants at the outset of the coronavirus crisis that the warning letters would be sent, but could be safely ignored. But borrowers from other institutions might be distressed and intimidated when the threatening letters arrived, said Lewis. Even those who have never had financial problems but have been granted mortgage or other official payment holidays, should by law receive one of these \u201cfrightening\u201d letters after two missed payments, Lewis said.

The charity is calling on the government to update the advice by urgently amending the 1974 Act, and to change the tone and style of debt warnings. It said its research indicated that in England, as many as 100,000 people in problem debt considered taking their own lives each year, and that the debt letters were a key contributing factor. Lewis added: \u201cAt such a sensitive stressful time, the government needs to change the rules on debt letters. It\u2019s a simple change to get rid of a rule that benefits neither lender, borrower, nor the economy \u2013 and at this time, without exaggeration, it could save lives.\u201d UK Finance, which represents Britain\u2019s banks, said it recognised that the wording of statutory notices was dated and could lead to customer distress, in particular where alternative arrangements had been agreed with the customer, but it confirmed that the law required the notices to be sent.

About 350,000 Hongkongers already hold \u201cBritish National Overseas\u201d passports and more than 2.5 million are believed eligible to apply. Johnson wrote in the Times that if new security laws were pursued by Beijing, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/britain-could-change-immigration-rules-for-hong-kong-citizens\">uphold our profound ties of history and friendship</a> with the people of Hong Kong\u201d.</p> \n<p>The prime minister wrote: \u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship \u2026&nbsp;This would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history.\u201d Johnson may face cabinet resistance to the idea but it was welcomed by the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. Johnny Patterson, its director, said: \u201cNo sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover.

Boris Johnson has opened the path to UK work and residency visas for stricken Hong Kong people if China goes ahead and imposes a national security edict on the territory. About 350,000 Hongkongers already hold \u201cBritish National Overseas\u201d passports and more than 2.5 million are believed eligible to apply. Johnson wrote in the Times that if new security laws were pursued by Beijing, \u201cBritain would have no choice but to uphold our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong\u201d. The prime minister wrote: \u201cIf China imposes its national security law, the British government will change its immigration rules and allow any holder of these passports from Hong Kong to come to the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and be given further immigration rights including the right to work which would place them on the route to citizenship \u2026 This would amount to one of the biggest changes to our visa system in history.\u201d Johnson may face cabinet resistance to the idea but it was welcomed by the human rights NGO Hong Kong Watch. Johnny Patterson, its director, said: \u201cNo sitting PM has made a statement as bold as this on Hong Kong since the handover. It reflects first the severity of the situation on the ground, and second the fact that the British government genuinely, and rightly, feel a sense of duty to citizens of Hong Kong.\u201d * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of causing a collapse in public confidence over the government\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader accuses the PM of \u201cwinging it\u201d over the easing of the lockdown and making a \u201cdifficult situation 10 times worse\u201d by carrying out \u201can exit without a strategy\u201d. On the Cummings furore, Starmer said: \u201cIt\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack [him].\u201d Starmer\u2019s intervention came as Prof Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist who formerly advised the government, warned that if coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes keep spilling into the community they will sustain the outbreak for months; while an inquiry confirmed that people of black and Asian origin are disproportionately affected by coronavirus; the head of UK Statistics accused the government of continuing to mislead the public over the number of tests carried out; and it emerged that England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was responsible for vetoing the government\u2019s wish for England\u2019s official coronavirus alert level to be reduced. Nearly 10 years of progress in narrowing the attainment gap in England between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates has probably been wiped out in a few months due to the pandemic, a study by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) has found. The EEF, Sutton Trust, Impetus and Nesta have been in talks with the government over plans for a national tutoring pilot helping 1,600 pupils in disadvantaged communities over coming weeks. The EEF says only urgent and sustained support can give disadvantaged pupils hope of catching up. The virus has infected 6.37 million people globally and more than 380,000 have died, according to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University. Asian markets have rallied although Australia has entered recession for the first time in 29 years.

Anger and grief over Floyd\u2019s killing continues to fuel demonstrations across the United States despite unprecedented curfews. In some cities police have sought to show solidarity and seek reconciliation by marching and kneeling alongside demonstrators. Stemming the disorder that has several times turned deadly has preoccupied the president to the extent of threatening military action \u2013 but there have been many examples of peaceful participation including clergy who were among people violently swept out of the way by police so Donald Trump could pose in front of St John\u2019s church opposite the White House. \u201cThey turned holy ground into a battleground,\u201d the Rev Gini Gerbasi said. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The Northern Ireland assembly has voted to call for an extension to the Brexit transition period, arguing the UK government cannot impose complex border checks down the Irish Sea while Britain is occupied with coronavirus. &gt; More homes for families would be freed up for sale by investing in purpose-built housing to which older people could downsize, according to new research published today.

China is also in the FT\u2019s sights, from another perspective: \u201cBrussels seeks to curb takeovers by state-subsidised foreign rivals\u201d. The i warns of the \u201cBiggest crisis UK universities have ever seen\u201d with \u201cevery area of academic life\u201d affected by Covid-19 fallout. The Sun has \u201cTipple whammy\u201d saying pubs are getting ready to open the taps. The Express goes with \u201cExtra penny on tax to fix care crisis\u201d and says \u201cangry Britons\u201d are prepared to pay. It is left unclear whether more mild-mannered Britons are positively disposed towards the idea.

Factory farming is linked to the rise of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/29/antibiotic-resistance-as-big-threat-climate-change-chief-medic-sally-davies\">antibiotic resistant superbugs</a>, which threaten human health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we do not do things differently, we are finished,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on very much longer like this.\u201d</p> \n<p>She called for people to be lifted out of poverty, pointing to its strong impact on the natural world, as people with no alternatives and who are desperate to feed their families will cut down forests to survive, and in urban areas will choose the cheapest food whatever the harm caused by its production, because they have little other choice.</p> \n<p>War and violence also fuelled the destruction of nature, she warned, and so did our overweening consumerism and urge for \u201cstuff that we accumulate\u201d, as well as our diets.</p> \n<p>The wealthy should put pressure on leaders and take care over what they buy to avoid adding to the problem, she said. \u201cWe have got to stop buying their products,\u201d she said, of companies that use factory farming and exploit nature.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have come to a turning point in our relationship with the natural world,\u201d she warned, saying there was only a small window of opportunity to make drastic changes before facing disaster. \u201cOne of the lessons learnt from this crisis is that we must change our ways. Scientists warn that to avoid future crises, we must drastically change our diets and move to plant-rich foods. For the sake of the animals, planet and the health of our children.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stella Kyriakides, the EU\u2019s commissioner for health and food safety, said the EU was responding to concerns through its newly unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/eu-plan-for-3bn-trees-in-10-years-to-tackle-biodiversity-crisis\">agriculture and biodiversity strategies</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/what-is-the-european-green-deal-and-will-it-really-cost-1tn\">European Green Deal</a>.

The parts that don\u2019t work are ethically questionable and socially and environmentally unacceptable. Our citizens expect more and we will deliver a better balance to ensure farming practices are sustainable and food is affordable.\u201d</p> \n<p>Janusz Wojciechowski, commissioner for agriculture, added: \u201cWe will constantly support sustainable farming and breeding practices as an alternative to intensive industrial farming.\u201d</p> \n<p>Concern about the links between coronavirus and the exploitation of the natural world is growing. Eighteen conservation groups have joined together in the Campaign to End Wildlife Trading, which is urging Boris Johnson to call for a global wildlife trade ban when the G20 leaders meet this November.</p> \n<p>The groups say that such a ban is needed to end the exploitation of wildlife for traditional medicine, exotic pets, tourism and other purposes. Currently, the trade in some endangered species is banned but still rife. It is one of the biggest forms of illegal trafficking in the world, after people and drugs. The legal trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, according to the campaign.</p> \n<p>Intensive farming\u2019s links to disease outbreaks were examined <a href=\"https://www.fairr.org/\">by the FAIRR global investor network in a new report</a>, which found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics owing to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics.</p> \n<p>Meat companies have been under pressure in the US, where the spread of Covid-19 has led to plant closures and disruption of the supply chain. In the longer term, according to FAIRR, the meat supply chain is likely to come under further pressure because of increased scrutiny and regulation needed to improve biosecurity.</p> \n<p>Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR and CIO of Coller Capital, said: \u201cFactory farming is both vulnerable to pandemics and guilty of creating them. It\u2019s a self-sabotaging cycle that destroys value and risks lives. To avoid causing the next pandemic, the meat industry must tackle lax safety standards for food and workers alike, closely confined animals, and overused antibiotics. Covid could be the straw that breaks the meat industry\u2019s back.\u201d</p>",

Factory farming is linked to the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs, which threaten human health. \u201cIf we do not do things differently, we are finished,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on very much longer like this.\u201d She called for people to be lifted out of poverty, pointing to its strong impact on the natural world, as people with no alternatives and who are desperate to feed their families will cut down forests to survive, and in urban areas will choose the cheapest food whatever the harm caused by its production, because they have little other choice. War and violence also fuelled the destruction of nature, she warned, and so did our overweening consumerism and urge for \u201cstuff that we accumulate\u201d, as well as our diets. The wealthy should put pressure on leaders and take care over what they buy to avoid adding to the problem, she said. \u201cWe have got to stop buying their products,\u201d she said, of companies that use factory farming and exploit nature. \u201cWe have come to a turning point in our relationship with the natural world,\u201d she warned, saying there was only a small window of opportunity to make drastic changes before facing disaster. \u201cOne of the lessons learnt from this crisis is that we must change our ways. Scientists warn that to avoid future crises, we must drastically change our diets and move to plant-rich foods. For the sake of the animals, planet and the health of our children.\u201d Stella Kyriakides, the EU\u2019s commissioner for health and food safety, said the EU was responding to concerns through its newly unveiled agriculture and biodiversity strategies and the European Green Deal. These strategies would cut the use of pesticides and encourage biodiversity, she said. \u201cHighly intensive farming systems have created an abundance of food but in Europe, at least, there is also significant waste and at times animal suffering,\u201d she told the conference. \u201cThese phenomena deeply worry me. The parts that don\u2019t work are ethically questionable and socially and environmentally unacceptable. Our citizens expect more and we will deliver a better balance to ensure farming practices are sustainable and food is affordable.\u201d Janusz Wojciechowski, commissioner for agriculture, added: \u201cWe will constantly support sustainable farming and breeding practices as an alternative to intensive industrial farming.\u201d Concern about the links between coronavirus and the exploitation of the natural world is growing. Eighteen conservation groups have joined together in the Campaign to End Wildlife Trading, which is urging Boris Johnson to call for a global wildlife trade ban when the G20 leaders meet this November. The groups say that such a ban is needed to end the exploitation of wildlife for traditional medicine, exotic pets, tourism and other purposes. Currently, the trade in some endangered species is banned but still rife. It is one of the biggest forms of illegal trafficking in the world, after people and drugs. The legal trade is estimated to be worth $7bn to $23bn a year, according to the campaign. Intensive farming\u2019s links to disease outbreaks were examined by the FAIRR global investor network in a new report, which found that more than 70% of the biggest meat, fish and dairy producers were in danger of fostering future zoonotic pandemics owing to lax safety standards, closely confined animals and the overuse of antibiotics. Meat companies have been under pressure in the US, where the spread of Covid-19 has led to plant closures and disruption of the supply chain. In the longer term, according to FAIRR, the meat supply chain is likely to come under further pressure because of increased scrutiny and regulation needed to improve biosecurity. Jeremy Coller, founder of FAIRR and CIO of Coller Capital, said: \u201cFactory farming is both vulnerable to pandemics and guilty of creating them. It\u2019s a self-sabotaging cycle that destroys value and risks lives. To avoid causing the next pandemic, the meat industry must tackle lax safety standards for food and workers alike, closely confined animals, and overused antibiotics. Covid could be the straw that breaks the meat industry\u2019s back.\u201d",

A car scrappage scheme introduced after the financial crisis in 2009 led to hundreds of thousands of extra vehicle sales. The UK car industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown. Production was halted at plants across the UK during April, when just 197 vehicles came off production lines and sales collapsed by 97.3%, making it the industry\u2019s worst month since 1946.

However, a scheme that would incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars would run counter to government net-zero commitments and plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles over the next two decades. Earlier this year the transport secretary, Grant Shapps \u2013 who appears not to have been copied-in on the correspondence \u2013 mooted bringing forward the target date for banning sales of new diesel and petrol cars from 2040 to as early as 2032.

Asked about the SMMT proposals by the Guardian, Hawes said: \u201cLike many sectors, we have been in constant communication with government, highlighting the situation and what support might be needed when the immediate crisis eases.\u201d He said that while there appeared to be a positive response to the opening of car showrooms on Monday, and some pent-up demand, \u201cthe effect on underlying consumer confidence will be unclear and we may need to work with government to identify ways of boosting demand, especially given the contribution this sector makes to the economy and jobs. That time is not now but industry, and government, need to be prepared for all eventualities\u201d. The government was approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of causing a collapse in public confidence over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying No 10 will be directly responsible if the infection rate starts to rise again. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader launched a stinging attack on the the prime minister, accusing him of \u201cwinging it\u201d over the easing of the lockdown and making an already \u201cdifficult situation 10 times worse\u201d. He also questioned whether the timing of some decisions over the relaxation of the lockdown rules had been taken \u201cto try to deflect attention away\u201d from the Dominic Cummings affair \u2013 an episode, he said, that showed Johnson was too weak to sack his chief adviser. In a significant hardening of his language, Starmer said Johnson had to \u201cget a grip\u201d of the crisis. \u201cMy [worry] is that after a week or more of mismanagement, I\u2019m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve called for an exit strategy. What we appear to have got is an exit without a strategy. We want to see society reopen, we want to see more children back at school, obviously people want to see their families and we want to see businesses open. \u201cBut like many people across the country, there is a growing concern the government is now winging it. At precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence has collapsed,\u201d he said. Starmer blamed the fall in public trust on the \u201cCummings factor, the sense of one rule for them and one rule for everyone else\u201d \u2013 a referenceto the furore provoked when the Guardian revealed Johnson\u2019s chief adviser had breached the lockdown. But he also cited \u201cmismanagement\u201d in the government\u2019s sudden decision to lift shielding restrictions for 2.2 million people without advance notice for public health directors or GPs, and concerns about the test and trace system that councils do not believe will be ready until the end of the month at the earliest. In addition, the Labour leader said there had been a failure of leadership over the decision to get schools to reopen without consulting widely enough with unions, teachers and parents. \u201cI am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic \u2026 if we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. \u201cWe all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government.\u201d Starmer\u2019s intervention came on another difficult day for the government as it emerged that: The death toll surpassed 50,000 for the first time, according to official figures, 10 weeks after the nation went into lockdown. Prof Neil Ferguson, the leading epidemiologist who advised the government until he quit over breaking the lockdown rules, warned that coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes are spilling into the community and sustaining the outbreak to the point that cases will remain steady until September. An inquiry found that people of black and Asian origin are disproportionately affected by coronavirus, leading to calls for the government to take action to protect these groups. The head of the UK Statistics Authority accused the government of continuing to mislead the public over the numbers of tests carried out for Covid-19. It emerged that England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, was responsible for vetoing the government\u2019s wish for England\u2019s official coronavirus alert level to be reduced, ruling that it should remain at four \u2013 meaning \u201ctransmission is high or rising exponentially\u201d. No 10 said it would be cutting back its daily press conference to just weekdays to secure bigger television audiences. Speaking from his parliamentary offices, the Labour leader said he would continue to engage constructively with the government, defending his approach of not making criticism for its own sake. However, he said he had become increasingly concerned about mistakes made by Johnson\u2019s administration in the last week. On Johnson\u2019s handling of the Cummings furore, Starmer said Johnson\u2019s plans to loosen restrictions were laid out as the government was in the grip of a crisis. Last Thursday, Johnson was under pressure to sack Cummings over revelations he had driven from London to his parents home in Durham during the height of the lockdown \u2013 and then taken a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot to test his eyesight. \u201cThey obviously took a decision to try and deflect attention away from the Cummings affair,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cThere are questions that the government needs to answer about the precise timing of the measures it put in place. \u201cIt\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack [Cummings].\u201d Starmer added that this \u201closs of trust and confidence\u201d was the \u201cmost troubling aspect of the whole Cummings affair\u201d. \u201cIf you had said which is the week the government needed maximum trust and confidence, the answer is the week in which you start easing restrictions \u2026 that\u2019s where you need maximum trust and confidence. That\u2019s the thing the government has burned in the last few weeks,\u201d he said. The Labour leader said he would now be asking for more meetings with Johnson, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, to address his concerns about the mismanagement of the last few weeks. He also revealed he wrote a \u201cprivate and confidential\u201d letter to the prime minister two weeks ago offering to work constructively together to gain consensus for reopening schools, but Johnson has not replied.",

Some universities derive up to 36% of their revenues from international students.</p> <p>The other universities on the high risk list are Monash, RMIT, University of Technology Sydney, Central Queensland, Southern Cross and Canberra universities.</p> <p>Another 13 universities are assessed as at \u201cmedium financial risk,\u201d and include the University of NSW, University of Queensland and University of Adelaide.</p> <p>The analysis is based on predicted falls in revenue through to 2024, against the cash and investment reserves of the universities.</p> <p>The academics modelled two scenarios: an optimistic one, which sees the sector\u2019s revenue fall by $11.5bn, and a pessimistic one which sees revenue fall by $18bn by 2024.</p> <p>The optimistic scenario sees a 40% fall in international student fees in 2020 as international travel is curtailed, but improvements through the following years. The pessimistic scenario sees the pandemic continue, travel curtailed for much longer, and international student revenue cut in 2021 by 55%.</p> <p>The model assumed that two-thirds of cash reserves of each university would be available to deal with the downturn, because there would be other calls on the reserves as well.</p> <p>\u201cEven under the conservative assumptions on which the optimistic scenario is based, the sector would exhaust 85% of available reserves, thereby compromising the capacity for major investment in programs or capital works,\u201d the academics said.</p> <p>\u201cUnder the pessimistic scenario, major institutional and sectoral restructuring would be required,\u201d they said. In other words, mergers and possibly closures.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/four-private-australian-universities-allowed-to-access-jobkeeper-payments\">Four private Australian universities allowed to access jobkeeper payments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the pessimistic scenario, the sector would have a shortfall of $4.6bn by 2024.</p> <p>The universities are in very different positions and the shortfalls are not evenly spread.</p> <p>The seven universities at high risk have insufficient available cash and investment reserves to offset predicted losses in international fee revenue for 2020 alone, the academics found.</p> <p>Of these, Monash University, RMIT and UTS have very large numbers of international enrolments. Revenue from international student fees constitutes 34% for Monash, 36% for RMIT and 35% for UTS.</p> <p>Central Queensland and Southern Cross University have above average levels of international fee income as a proportion of total revenue but their problems stem from very low levels of available cash and investment reserves \u201cthat adds to their financial vulnerability\u201d, the academics said</p> <p>In the case of RMIT, the academics said: \u201cThis university will be one of the most financially challenged universities because of the potential fee losses. It is very dependent financially on overseas fee revenue (at 36%) \u2026 and reports relatively modest levels of cash and investment reserves.</p> <p>\u201cIt is facing potentially large short term and longer term shortfalls of $137m for 2020, $505m (optimistic case) and $853m (pessimistic case).:</p> <p>The academics said RMIT\u2019s vulnerability profile may be mitigated to the extent its offshore programs \u2013 it has a campus in Vietnam \u2013 which has not been as heavily impacted by Covid-19.</p> <p>In the case of UTS, the academics said the predicted shortfalls are $77m for 2020, $336m under the optimistic scenario to 2023 (32% of total revenue) and $608m under the pessimistic scenario to 2024 (58% of total revenue).</p> <p>The analysis explains why the university sector, which was cut out of eligibility for jobkeeper, is becoming increasingly desperate to cut costs.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/deakin-uni-to-shed-300-jobs-as-tertiary-sector-s-covid-19-woes-grow-20200525-p54w5a.html\">Deakin University,</a> which has been rated as medium risk by the academics, announced last week that it would cut 400 positions in a multi- staged restructure. The Deakin vice-chancellor, Prof Iain Martin, announced that hundreds of positions would be cut in a multi-staged restructure.</p> <p>The National Tertiary Education Union took the unprecedented step of negotiating an agreement with Universities Australia to take pay cuts of 5% to 15% in a bid to stave off up to 12,000 job cuts.</p> <p>But the sector\u2019s exclusion from any government bailouts or assistance has meant that some universities have said they will still need to make cuts and lay off casual staff.</p> <p>The National Tertiary Education Union president, Alison Barnes, said she was \u201cjust astounded\u201d that the sector\u2019s pleas for help had fallen on deaf ears, particularly as re-skilling would be central to the recovery.</p> <p>\u2018The universities play a role in finding cures for Covid-19, developing new technologies and re-skilling the workforce,\u201d she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seven Australian universities, including La Trobe University, are at \u201chigh financial risk\u201d and could face a cash crisis as a result of the downturn in revenue from international students, according to analysis by two Melbourne University academics. The warnings come as La Trobe acknowledged it was in talks with banks over a lifeline, while also talking to staff about redundancies and pay cuts. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in the entire higher education sector facing financial shortfall and uncertainty, and La Trobe is no exception,\u201d the institution said in a statement on Wednesday. The university said it was in \u201cproductive and on-going discussions\u201d with its three banks on increasing its access to money, which it believes will meet its funding needs in the short term. It is also taking steps to find cost savings and balance its books in the longer term, including a voluntary redundancy program expected to save $20m in 2020 and $40m each year in 2021 and 2022. Under a job protection framework drafted with the tertiary education union, La Trobe is also asking ask staff to agree to a 10% pay cut, with the first $30,000 of their salary excluded. Staff are due to vote on the proposal on 15-16 June. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d and would look at other measures Victoria could provide to the universities sector, which has been largely excluded from jobkeeper. \u201cIt\u2019s too important an institution to have coronavirus undermine what is a very important future,\u201d Andrews told reporters. The work by Ian Marshman and Frank Larkins, honorary fellows of the Melbourne Centre for the Study of Higher Education, was released last week and paints a dire picture for some universities which do not have sufficient cash reserves to weather a prolonged downturn. The report highlights the issue for universities: that they have relatively slim cash reserves to weather a major downturn in revenue due to a falloff in international students. Some universities derive up to 36% of their revenues from international students. The other universities on the high risk list are Monash, RMIT, University of Technology Sydney, Central Queensland, Southern Cross and Canberra universities. Another 13 universities are assessed as at \u201cmedium financial risk,\u201d and include the University of NSW, University of Queensland and University of Adelaide. The analysis is based on predicted falls in revenue through to 2024, against the cash and investment reserves of the universities. The academics modelled two scenarios: an optimistic one, which sees the sector\u2019s revenue fall by $11.5bn, and a pessimistic one which sees revenue fall by $18bn by 2024. The optimistic scenario sees a 40% fall in international student fees in 2020 as international travel is curtailed, but improvements through the following years. The pessimistic scenario sees the pandemic continue, travel curtailed for much longer, and international student revenue cut in 2021 by 55%. The model assumed that two-thirds of cash reserves of each university would be available to deal with the downturn, because there would be other calls on the reserves as well. \u201cEven under the conservative assumptions on which the optimistic scenario is based, the sector would exhaust 85% of available reserves, thereby compromising the capacity for major investment in programs or capital works,\u201d the academics said. \u201cUnder the pessimistic scenario, major institutional and sectoral restructuring would be required,\u201d they said. In other words, mergers and possibly closures. In the pessimistic scenario, the sector would have a shortfall of $4.6bn by 2024. The universities are in very different positions and the shortfalls are not evenly spread. The seven universities at high risk have insufficient available cash and investment reserves to offset predicted losses in international fee revenue for 2020 alone, the academics found. Of these, Monash University, RMIT and UTS have very large numbers of international enrolments. Revenue from international student fees constitutes 34% for Monash, 36% for RMIT and 35% for UTS. Central Queensland and Southern Cross University have above average levels of international fee income as a proportion of total revenue but their problems stem from very low levels of available cash and investment reserves \u201cthat adds to their financial vulnerability\u201d, the academics said In the case of RMIT, the academics said: \u201cThis university will be one of the most financially challenged universities because of the potential fee losses. It is very dependent financially on overseas fee revenue (at 36%) \u2026 and reports relatively modest levels of cash and investment reserves. \u201cIt is facing potentially large short term and longer term shortfalls of $137m for 2020, $505m (optimistic case) and $853m (pessimistic case).: The academics said RMIT\u2019s vulnerability profile may be mitigated to the extent its offshore programs \u2013 it has a campus in Vietnam \u2013 which has not been as heavily impacted by Covid-19. In the case of UTS, the academics said the predicted shortfalls are $77m for 2020, $336m under the optimistic scenario to 2023 (32% of total revenue) and $608m under the pessimistic scenario to 2024 (58% of total revenue). The analysis explains why the university sector, which was cut out of eligibility for jobkeeper, is becoming increasingly desperate to cut costs. Deakin University, which has been rated as medium risk by the academics, announced last week that it would cut 400 positions in a multi- staged restructure. The Deakin vice-chancellor, Prof Iain Martin, announced that hundreds of positions would be cut in a multi-staged restructure. The National Tertiary Education Union took the unprecedented step of negotiating an agreement with Universities Australia to take pay cuts of 5% to 15% in a bid to stave off up to 12,000 job cuts. But the sector\u2019s exclusion from any government bailouts or assistance has meant that some universities have said they will still need to make cuts and lay off casual staff. The National Tertiary Education Union president, Alison Barnes, said she was \u201cjust astounded\u201d that the sector\u2019s pleas for help had fallen on deaf ears, particularly as re-skilling would be central to the recovery. \u2018The universities play a role in finding cures for Covid-19, developing new technologies and re-skilling the workforce,\u201d she said.",

      "body": "<p>The latest coronavirus rules, from Monday 1 June, are plentiful and complicated. This is your ultimate guide.</p> \n<h2>Socialising</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. Can I visit other people\u2019s homes?</strong></p> \n<p>You can spend time in private gardens or other outdoor spaces in groups of six from different households if you live in England or Northern Ireland \u2013 but you must adhere to 2-metre distancing. Those considered clinically extremely vulnerable can meet one person from outside their household if they live alone.</p> \n<p>Bring your own chairs and wipe them down carefully with household cleaner before and after use. You can go inside the property only for the purpose of accessing the garden or outdoor space.</p> \n<p>In Scotland, two households can meet outdoors, in groups no larger than eight, or visit close family in their gardens,&nbsp;with people urged to stay local and distance at all times. In Wales, two households can meet outdoors but should avoid travelling more than five miles.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Can I use the lavatory?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes, but avoid touching surfaces, wash your hands thoroughly, wipe down surfaces and use separate towels, or paper ones. However, Scotland\u2019s&nbsp;First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that if the distance travelled to meet someone means you have to use their bathroom, then \u201cperhaps you shouldn\u2019t be doing it\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Can I stay away from home?</strong></p> \n<p>You cannot stay overnight away from your home except for in a limited set of circumstances, such as for work.</p> \n<h2>Face coverings</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. Should I wear a mask or visor and when?</strong></p> \n<p>The UK government advises people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport and in shops, or anywhere that physical distancing is not always possible. The Scottish government has urged people to wear face coverings in all shops.</p> \n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/risk-of-infection-could-double-if-2-metre-rule-reduced-study-finds\">evidence</a> suggests that wearing a face covering does not entirely protect you, it is likely to prevent others from becoming infected \u2013 especially important if you have not yet developed symptoms and are not self-isolating.</p> \n<p>Conversely, scientists say it is possible that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/face-visors-may-protect-wearer-but-not-other-people-against-covid-19\">visors protect the wearer</a> but not those around them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"933481ff-c85f-469f-be45-982d1efceb9a\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Q. Who should not wear a face covering?</strong></p> \n<p>Face coverings should not be used by under-twos or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly, such as unassisted primary-age children or those with respiratory conditions.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Does it matter what type of mask I wear?</strong></p> \n<p>Different types of face covering offer different levels of protection, with surgical grade N95 respirators offering the highest, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these are costly, in limited supply and contribute to landfill waste. Even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested surgical masks be reserved for health workers and those at high risk. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/make-non-medical-coronavirus-face-mask-no-sewing-required\">You can make your own</a> face covering, or use a scarf, shawl, or old T-shirt.</p> \n<h2>Shopping and retail</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. What shops can I visit?</strong></p> \n<p>Essential outlets, which range from supermarkets to homeware shops, have remained open and car showrooms and outdoor markets opened on Monday in England.</p> \n<p>High street shops in the non-essential category will reopen in England from 15 June if the government\u2019s five tests for coping with the virus are met, and provided that the shops are \u201cCovid-secure\u201d. Shops that expect to open from 15 June include those selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets. </p> \n<p>Welsh high streets may open later than in England, while Scottish retailers will open on a phased basis, based on monitoring of the virus.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. What remains closed?</strong></p> \n<p>Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues. While no dates have been given, the UK government has said they will reopen on a phased basis.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. When can I get my hair cut and go to a pub?</strong></p> \n<p>Ministers have an \u201cambition\u201d to&nbsp;open at least some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and beauty salons, restaurants and pubs, but it will be no earlier than 4 July in England, and subject to the government\u2019s five tests.</p> \n<h2>Working</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. Who can go to work?</strong></p> \n<p>Employers should make \u201cevery effort\u201d to support working from home, according to the government in advice for England, but anyone who cannot do so is expected to return to work if it is safe.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. What provisions are in place in workplaces?</strong></p> \n<p>Government guidance emphasises that the risk of transmission can be lowered by reducing the number of people workers come into contact with and avoiding face-to-face meetings.</p> \n<p>Employers can support this by changing shift patterns and rotas, and splitting people into smaller, contained teams. Workers should avoid sharing equipment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"523fff1d133644528e86c87e34746650f35f1b8a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/523fff1d133644528e86c87e34746650f35f1b8a/0_31_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"children distancing at primary school\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It is not easy for schools to keep children at a physical distance.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Education</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. What is open?</strong></p> \n<p>Primary schools in England have been asked to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as nursery children, from 1 June. In secondary schools, year 10 and 12 pupils are due to have some face-to-face time with teachers before the end of the summer term.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s \u201chope\u201d is that all other primary children in England will return to school before the summer break. Secondary school pupils will not return before September.</p> \n<p>In Scotland,&nbsp;teachers can return to prepare for&nbsp;the start of the new school year on 11 August,&nbsp;when pupils will begin a \u201cblended\u201d model of at-home and in-school learning. Childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries are reopening while some councils are allowing older primary school pupils to begin the transition to secondary school.</p> \n<p>In Wales, all schools&nbsp;will reopen on June 29 with a four-week term ending on July 27 intended to give pupils, staff and parents time to prepare for a \u201cnew normal\u201d. Some pupils in Northern Ireland will return to school in late August, with a phased return for the remainder.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. How </strong><strong>can schools open safely?</strong></p> \n<p>Amid concerns from unions and some parents, the UK government\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings/coronavirus-covid-19-implementing-protective-measures-in-education-and-childcare-settings\">guidance on reopening schools</a>&nbsp;states that constant physical distancing of 2-metres is, in effect, impossible in schools.</p> \n<p>Its recommendations emphasise the importance of regular handwashing and cleaning of surfaces, and maintaining distance as much as possible, for example with different classroom layouts and staggered break times.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2>Transport and travel</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. How far can I travel?</strong></p> \n<p>While people in England and Northern Ireland can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, those in Wales are being asked to stay within five miles from their homes. Guidelines in Scotland require people to stay within five miles except when visiting close family.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. When, where and how can I travel?</strong></p> \n<p>Reduce demand on the public transport network by walking or cycling wherever possible, or driving, and by reducing trips. Use less busy routes where possible.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/make-non-medical-coronavirus-face-mask-no-sewing-required\">How to make a non-medical coronavirus face mask \u2013 no sewing required</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Q. Can I share a car with someone else?</strong></p> \n<p>Taxi services are operating, subject to advice such as passengers sitting in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. Those who have to share private cars with people outside of their household group have been advised to keep to the same small groups.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Can I travel within the UK and go abroad?</strong></p> \n<p>The UK government advises against all but essential travel abroad. People in England can now go as far as they want for exercise.</p> \n<p>Despite an easing of lockdowns around the UK, people are advised not to travel between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> \n<h2>Sports</h2> \n<p><strong>Q. What sports can I do and where?</strong></p> \n<p>Basketball and tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses are open in England. Physical distancing must apply, with no more than five other people from outside one\u2019s household allowed to take part.</p> \n<p>In Scotland, outdoor activities such as golf, bowls, tennis and fishing have restarted, with distancing caveats, while in Northern Ireland outdoor activities and sports including golf, water sports, tennis and those that don\u2019t involve shared contact with hard surfaces are permitted.</p> \n<p>Outdoor gyms, playgrounds and outdoor and indoor swimming pools remain closed, though there are plans for pools to reopen, possibly without changing rooms.</p> \n<p><strong>Q. Are professional sports people treated differently?</strong></p> \n<p>Yes.

In Wales, only golfers and professional footballers have been allowed to play again.</p> \n<p>* Key workers and those needing access to childcare have not been subject to the same lockdown rules as others.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to include the position in Scotland about lavatory use.</p>",

The UK government advises people to wear a face covering in enclosed spaces, such as on public transport and in shops, or anywhere that physical distancing is not always possible. The Scottish government has urged people to wear face coverings in all shops. While evidence suggests that wearing a face covering does not entirely protect you, it is likely to prevent others from becoming infected \u2013 especially important if you have not yet developed symptoms and are not self-isolating. Conversely, scientists say it is possible that visors protect the wearer but not those around them. Q. Who should not wear a face covering? Face coverings should not be used by under-twos or those who may find it difficult to manage them correctly, such as unassisted primary-age children or those with respiratory conditions. Q. Does it matter what type of mask I wear? Different types of face covering offer different levels of protection, with surgical grade N95 respirators offering the highest, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these are costly, in limited supply and contribute to landfill waste. Even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested surgical masks be reserved for health workers and those at high risk. You can make your own face covering, or use a scarf, shawl, or old T-shirt. Shopping and retail Q. What shops can I visit? Essential outlets, which range from supermarkets to homeware shops, have remained open and car showrooms and outdoor markets opened on Monday in England. High street shops in the non-essential category will reopen in England from 15 June if the government\u2019s five tests for coping with the virus are met, and provided that the shops are \u201cCovid-secure\u201d. Shops that expect to open from 15 June include those selling clothes, shoes, toys, furniture, books and electronics, plus tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets. Welsh high streets may open later than in England, while Scottish retailers will open on a phased basis, based on monitoring of the virus. Q. What remains closed? Hairdressers, nail bars and beauty salons, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues. While no dates have been given, the UK government has said they will reopen on a phased basis. Q. When can I get my hair cut and go to a pub? Ministers have an \u201cambition\u201d to open at least some remaining businesses such as hairdressers and beauty salons, restaurants and pubs, but it will be no earlier than 4 July in England, and subject to the government\u2019s five tests. Working Q. Who can go to work? Employers should make \u201cevery effort\u201d to support working from home, according to the government in advice for England, but anyone who cannot do so is expected to return to work if it is safe. Q. What provisions are in place in workplaces? Government guidance emphasises that the risk of transmission can be lowered by reducing the number of people workers come into contact with and avoiding face-to-face meetings. Employers can support this by changing shift patterns and rotas, and splitting people into smaller, contained teams. Workers should avoid sharing equipment. Education Q. What is open? Primary schools in England have been asked to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 classes, as well as nursery children, from 1 June. In secondary schools, year 10 and 12 pupils are due to have some face-to-face time with teachers before the end of the summer term. The government\u2019s \u201chope\u201d is that all other primary children in England will return to school before the summer break. Secondary school pupils will not return before September. In Scotland, teachers can return to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will begin a \u201cblended\u201d model of at-home and in-school learning. Childminding services and fully outdoor nurseries are reopening while some councils are allowing older primary school pupils to begin the transition to secondary school. In Wales, all schools will reopen on June 29 with a four-week term ending on July 27 intended to give pupils, staff and parents time to prepare for a \u201cnew normal\u201d. Some pupils in Northern Ireland will return to school in late August, with a phased return for the remainder. Q. How can schools open safely? Amid concerns from unions and some parents, the UK government\u2019s guidance on reopening schools states that constant physical distancing of 2-metres is, in effect, impossible in schools. Its recommendations emphasise the importance of regular handwashing and cleaning of surfaces, and maintaining distance as much as possible, for example with different classroom layouts and staggered break times. Transport and travel Q. How far can I travel? While people in England and Northern Ireland can travel as far as they want to take exercise and spend time outside, those in Wales are being asked to stay within five miles from their homes. Guidelines in Scotland require people to stay within five miles except when visiting close family. Q. When, where and how can I travel? Reduce demand on the public transport network by walking or cycling wherever possible, or driving, and by reducing trips. Use less busy routes where possible. Q. Can I share a car with someone else? Taxi services are operating, subject to advice such as passengers sitting in the back left-hand seat if travelling alone. Those who have to share private cars with people outside of their household group have been advised to keep to the same small groups. Q. Can I travel within the UK and go abroad? The UK government advises against all but essential travel abroad. People in England can now go as far as they want for exercise. Despite an easing of lockdowns around the UK, people are advised not to travel between Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Sports Q. What sports can I do and where? Basketball and tennis courts, bowling greens and golf courses are open in England. Physical distancing must apply, with no more than five other people from outside one\u2019s household allowed to take part. In Scotland, outdoor activities such as golf, bowls, tennis and fishing have restarted, with distancing caveats, while in Northern Ireland outdoor activities and sports including golf, water sports, tennis and those that don\u2019t involve shared contact with hard surfaces are permitted. Outdoor gyms, playgrounds and outdoor and indoor swimming pools remain closed, though there are plans for pools to reopen, possibly without changing rooms. Q. Are professional sports people treated differently? Yes. Elite athletes, as defined by specific guidance, can train and compete using specified gyms, pools and sports facilities. In Wales, only golfers and professional footballers have been allowed to play again. * Key workers and those needing access to childcare have not been subject to the same lockdown rules as others. \u2022 This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to include the position in Scotland about lavatory use.",

Several companies, including Google, Apple and Citymapper, make public de-identified data from their mapping and other location-based apps to track traffic flow across cities, states and countries. Researchers have been using this data to model the massive traffic reductions seen as public health orders were put in place, businesses closed and some people began working from home. Citymapper, for example, shows a dip in regular traffic levels in Melbourne commencing around 12 March, dropping right down to a low of 10% of regular traffic levels in mid-April.

The treasurer, <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>, when explaining the impacts of the bushfires and Covid-19,<strong> </strong>conceded a recession was inevitable given Treasury advice the June quarter would be worse. </li> \n   <li>The <strong>New South Wales police</strong> commissioner, <strong>Mick Fuller</strong>, said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by footage of an officer slamming an Indigenous boy face-first onto the pavement during an arrest, but said the officer might have been having \u201ca bad day\u201d when apologising for the boy\u2019s treatment.<br></li> \n   <li>The family of the teenager said they plan to privately prosecute the officer responsible for the arrest if the officer is not charged after an internal investigation.</li> \n   <li>The deputy chief medical officer,<strong> Paul Kelly</strong>, said he is \u201cvery certain\u201d of the proposed travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand eventuating provided both countries continue to keep the virus under control.</li> \n   <li>There have been <strong>eight </strong>new Covid-19 cases recorded across Australia in the 24-hour period leading up to Wednesday afternoon. There are <strong>less than 500 active cases</strong> nationally, with 25 people in hospital, five in intensive care units, with two on ventilators.</li> \n   <li><strong>Universities Australia </strong>has claimed institutions will lose up to $16bn by 2023 due to the impact of Covid-19, according to new modelling.</li> \n   <li>Police have arrested the stepmother of the Brisbane girl <strong>Willow Dunn</strong> and charged her with murder after the four-year-old\u2019s severely malnourished body was found at a Cannon Hill house last week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>From me,<strong> Elias Visontay</strong>, have a great evening.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T08:21:23.090Z\">at 9.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed754f38f08f5e3730138e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:45:15.303Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Tasmania</strong> is bringing forward billions of dollars of infrastructure spending to stimulate its economy amid the Covid-19 pandemic, AAP reports.</p> \n  <p>The plan, which has been flagged for several weeks, will be detailed by the state government on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong>Peter Gutwein</strong> on Wednesday revealed <strong>$3.1bn </strong>will be spent on housing, roads, irrigation and other infrastructure over the next two years.</p> \n  <p>The projects are part of a $3.7bn infrastructure spend announced last year which was originally planned across four years.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis will be a construction blitz and it will be far-reaching,\u201d Gutwein said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese are challenging times but now is not the time to sit idle.\u201d</p> \n  <p>According to updated figures from treasury, Tasmania\u2019s gross state product will decline by 1.75% in 2019-20 after last year\u2019s budget predicted 3% growth.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:53:27.831Z\">at 8.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed750488f084df971c8eb81\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/calla-wahlquist\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:31:02.126Z\">8.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Defence Force</strong> is considering putting some of its members through Rural Fire Service bushfire training, the bushfire royal commission has heard.</p> \n  <p>Vice Admiral <strong>David Johnston</strong> AO, the vice chief of the defence force, told the royal commission that the firefighters in the ADF are not trained to fight bushfires, which is why army personnel were not put on the fireline this summer.</p> \n  <p>But Johnson said that RFS basic training, which was a 26-hour course, would only get a person to a level where they could work on a fire ground under the supervision of more experienced firefighters, and because ADF personnel are moved around they may not be able to gain that experience. </p> \n  <p>That meant the ability for the ADF to build up bushfire fighting experience in its personnel was \u201centirely dubious and variable\u201d, he said.</p> \n  <p><em>\u201cSo the capacity of the ADF to be able to pick up ancillary skills that are not at our core role is a very complicated issue for us.\u201d</em></p> \n  <p>The ADF began helping out with the Queensland fires on 6 September, mainly by providing air support to help firefighters carry out aerial mapping, and in logistics. </p> \n  <p>The ADF was officially called out, under the inventively named Operation Bushfire Assist, on 31 December. </p> \n  <p>From then they began helping with relief and recovery, which included dropping off food and fuel to cut-off communities. On Kangaroo Island that included providing reverse osmosis machines to create drinking water for livestock and to fly in 65,000 litres of drinking water for humans. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said it was the first time the ADF has been called out to assist with bushfire recovery. In previous years, there had been a call for the ADF to assist, which meant it was a voluntary rather than compulsory service.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:49:29.342Z\">at 8.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed74f008f08f5e3730138b4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:23:44.380Z\">8.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions,<strong> Sally McManus</strong>, laid down a few pretty big red lines for the union movement at today\u2019s doorstop: <em>\u201cWe won\u2019t be supporting any idea where jobs become less secure or where there\u2019s pay cuts.\u201d</em></p> \n  <p>Of course, the government can always push on with changes without the ACTU, but that\u2019s a pretty robust starting point. McManus said the principle behind the Better Off Overall Test \u201cis a good one\u201d \u2013 that awards are the minimum conditions and enterprise agreements should therefore improve on that base line.</p> \n  <p>She said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to see Australian workers get fair pay rises. This is something that\u2019s always been cherished in this country: a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work \u2026 We\u2019re not a movement that will be accepting pay cuts. We\u2019re about making sure working people get their fair share of the nation\u2019s wealth, because we all know that\u2019s been a problem in the past, and coming out of this crisis we can take the time so it can be fixed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>McManus said the industrial relations system will \u201cnever be under pressure like it has been in the last eight weeks\u201d \u2013 and yet it had been flexible, despite \u201cpretty robust checks and balances\u201d.</p> \n  <p>McManus suggested improvements to bargaining including allowing workers to bargain with the \u201creal decision-makers\u201d such as the bodies that determine funding in sectors like childcare and companies at the top of supply chains.</p> \n  <p>She also opposed the <strong>NSW government\u2019s attempt to freeze public sector pay rises</strong>, arguing the economy will \u201crely on domestic demand\u201d and Australia needs \u201ceveryone with a job to be spending\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:36:41.286Z\">at 8.36am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed74c988f087122eca548ea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:11:30.436Z\">8.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For more on <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong>\u2019s announcement earlier today that Australia will enter recession this year, here is the treasurer explaining the economic impacts of the bushfire season and Covid-19:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d9a7f3c8-9790-47cb-ba3b-a0b4d48ac958\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lpQ7Dr1KZ_o?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:30:23.469Z\">at 8.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed74aea8f087122eca548e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:02:38.175Z\">8.02am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to leave you in the hands of my colleague <strong>Elias Visontay</strong>, who will steer you through to stumps.

Seems clear that suggestions like that will be heard out but are not core to the process.</p> \n  <p>Porter also played down what will be achieved in the award simplification group \u2013 rather than changes to all 122 modern awards, it\u2019s targeted at the hardest-hit industries. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at a discrete small number of awards in the industries where there has been the greatest damage wrought by Covid-19 and the necessary health responses. So the point that I make is that the hospitality award is a very complicated award. And when you listen to employers and employees who work in the system, they will note the demarcation between tasks \u2013 the 61 different pay-points and 14 different permutations creates regulatory barriers to the hiring and preservation of employees. So we are looking at ways that you can potentially simplify awards in a very narrow range of what are at the moment very distressed industries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Porter reiterated that Morrison had been clear the ensuring integrity bill will not be put for a vote in the Senate, but still took a swipe at the construction union:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would hope that in a time where Australia is facing the greatest economic challenge outside of a world war that it has ever faced, that people on construction sites who have been behaving in an unlawful way dial it the hell down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:28:33.467Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed747038f084df971c8eb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:45:53.833Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>AAP has an update on the stock market:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The Australian share market has rallied to its highest level since 6 March, with gains across nearly every sector on a wave of optimism about Australia\u2019s economic prospects.</p> \n   <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Wednesday close to the highs of the day, up 106.5 points, or 1.83%, at 5,941.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 104.8 points, or 1.76%, at 6,064.9.</p> \n   <p>One Australian dollar was buying 69.36 US cents, up from 68.02 US cents at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p> \n   <p>The Aussie reached 69.84 US cents earlier on Wednesday, its highest point since early January. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:29:21.413Z\">at 8.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed73f298f087122eca548b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:14:59.568Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the ABC, Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, is asked by <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> what should happen to the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>It is currently at about $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement, but that will be halved from the end of September. </p> \n  <p>He says it shouldn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d to the old rate, but declines to give a figure, saying \u201cwe need to be really responsible with the budget.

general, <strong>Christian Porter</strong>, was on Perth radio station 6PR earlier today and was asked about the robodebt fiasco. </p> \n  <p>He made some notable comments, particularly that the government remains convinced some of the debts that were unlawfully raised as part of the scheme were in fact valid.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSimply because the method which had been used to calculate a debt was held to be legally insufficient doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t debts in existence,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThat applies we argue to this class of plaintiffs at large and if you have a look at the individual plaintiffs on the Gordon Legal website, you know, it\u2019s been reported in the Guardian as well, people did actually owe debts.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Given this, and what Porter claimed was the \u201cenormous money overpaid to people\u201d over many years, he flagged the government had not lost hope of recouping the money. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are still debts and that\u2019s why we have to, notwithstanding this litigation and its ultimately conclusion, <strong>go back to the drawing board and work out ways to in a legally sufficient way</strong> calculate and recoup that debt because it can\u2019t be let going on as it is.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Guardian reported yesterday the government has not <a

Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened in Australia today: Australia has entered its first recession for 29 years after the economy went backwards by 0.3% in the March quarter. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, when explaining the impacts of the bushfires and Covid-19, conceded a recession was inevitable given Treasury advice the June quarter would be worse. The New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by footage of an officer slamming an Indigenous boy face-first onto the pavement during an arrest, but said the officer might have been having \u201ca bad day\u201d when apologising for the boy\u2019s treatment. The family of the teenager said they plan to privately prosecute the officer responsible for the arrest if the officer is not charged after an internal investigation. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he is \u201cvery certain\u201d of the proposed travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand eventuating provided both countries continue to keep the virus under control. There have been eight new Covid-19 cases recorded across Australia in the 24-hour period leading up to Wednesday afternoon. There are less than 500 active cases nationally, with 25 people in hospital, five in intensive care units, with two on ventilators. Universities Australia has claimed institutions will lose up to $16bn by 2023 due to the impact of Covid-19, according to new modelling. Police have arrested the stepmother of the Brisbane girl Willow Dunn and charged her with murder after the four-year-old\u2019s severely malnourished body was found at a Cannon Hill house last week. From me, Elias Visontay, have a great evening. Tasmania is bringing forward billions of dollars of infrastructure spending to stimulate its economy amid the Covid-19 pandemic, AAP reports. The plan, which has been flagged for several weeks, will be detailed by the state government on Thursday. Premier Peter Gutwein on Wednesday revealed $3.1bn will be spent on housing, roads, irrigation and other infrastructure over the next two years. The projects are part of a $3.7bn infrastructure spend announced last year which was originally planned across four years. \u201cThis will be a construction blitz and it will be far-reaching,\u201d Gutwein said. \u201cThese are challenging times but now is not the time to sit idle.\u201d According to updated figures from treasury, Tasmania\u2019s gross state product will decline by 1.75% in 2019-20 after last year\u2019s budget predicted 3% growth. The Australian Defence Force is considering putting some of its members through Rural Fire Service bushfire training, the bushfire royal commission has heard. Vice Admiral David Johnston AO, the vice chief of the defence force, told the royal commission that the firefighters in the ADF are not trained to fight bushfires, which is why army personnel were not put on the fireline this summer. But Johnson said that RFS basic training, which was a 26-hour course, would only get a person to a level where they could work on a fire ground under the supervision of more experienced firefighters, and because ADF personnel are moved around they may not be able to gain that experience. That meant the ability for the ADF to build up bushfire fighting experience in its personnel was \u201centirely dubious and variable\u201d, he said. \u201cSo the capacity of the ADF to be able to pick up ancillary skills that are not at our core role is a very complicated issue for us.\u201d The ADF began helping out with the Queensland fires on 6 September, mainly by providing air support to help firefighters carry out aerial mapping, and in logistics. The ADF was officially called out, under the inventively named Operation Bushfire Assist, on 31 December. From then they began helping with relief and recovery, which included dropping off food and fuel to cut-off communities. On Kangaroo Island that included providing reverse osmosis machines to create drinking water for livestock and to fly in 65,000 litres of drinking water for humans. Johnson said it was the first time the ADF has been called out to assist with bushfire recovery. In previous years, there had been a call for the ADF to assist, which meant it was a voluntary rather than compulsory service. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, laid down a few pretty big red lines for the union movement at today\u2019s doorstop: \u201cWe won\u2019t be supporting any idea where jobs become less secure or where there\u2019s pay cuts.\u201d Of course, the government can always push on with changes without the ACTU, but that\u2019s a pretty robust starting point. McManus said the principle behind the Better Off Overall Test \u201cis a good one\u201d \u2013 that awards are the minimum conditions and enterprise agreements should therefore improve on that base line. She said: We want to see Australian workers get fair pay rises. This is something that\u2019s always been cherished in this country: a fair day\u2019s pay for a fair day\u2019s work \u2026 We\u2019re not a movement that will be accepting pay cuts. We\u2019re about making sure working people get their fair share of the nation\u2019s wealth, because we all know that\u2019s been a problem in the past, and coming out of this crisis we can take the time so it can be fixed. McManus said the industrial relations system will \u201cnever be under pressure like it has been in the last eight weeks\u201d \u2013 and yet it had been flexible, despite \u201cpretty robust checks and balances\u201d. McManus suggested improvements to bargaining including allowing workers to bargain with the \u201creal decision-makers\u201d such as the bodies that determine funding in sectors like childcare and companies at the top of supply chains. She also opposed the NSW government\u2019s attempt to freeze public sector pay rises, arguing the economy will \u201crely on domestic demand\u201d and Australia needs \u201ceveryone with a job to be spending\u201d. For more on Josh Frydenberg\u2019s announcement earlier today that Australia will enter recession this year, here is the treasurer explaining the economic impacts of the bushfire season and Covid-19: I\u2019m going to leave you in the hands of my colleague Elias Visontay, who will steer you through to stumps. Stay well. My colleague Martin Farrer reports: Councils around Australia have seen a huge increase in volumes of household rubbish and dumping of waste triggered by a combination of more online shopping, home improvements, international workers returning to their home countries and a clearing out of unwanted possessions during the coronavirus lockdown. A few more details from the attorney general Christian Porter\u2019s doorstop about the first industrial relations roundtable. There was this tidbit: What we did discuss today was that people aren\u2019t going to be stopped or dissuaded from raising larger social issues, but we are looking in five working groups at five known, discrete problems where everyone \u2013 no matter who they represent \u2013 recognises there is a problem and what we are trying to divine is the highest level of agreement that is conceivable on certain options to solve those problems. This is interesting because the ACTU\u2019s first response when Scott Morrison announced the IR consultation was that a surer way to create jobs is not to cut off wage subsidies. Seems clear that suggestions like that will be heard out but are not core to the process. Porter also played down what will be achieved in the award simplification group \u2013 rather than changes to all 122 modern awards, it\u2019s targeted at the hardest-hit industries. He said: We are looking at a discrete small number of awards in the industries where there has been the greatest damage wrought by Covid-19 and the necessary health responses. So the point that I make is that the hospitality award is a very complicated award. And when you listen to employers and employees who work in the system, they will note the demarcation between tasks \u2013 the 61 different pay-points and 14 different permutations creates regulatory barriers to the hiring and preservation of employees. So we are looking at ways that you can potentially simplify awards in a very narrow range of what are at the moment very distressed industries. Porter reiterated that Morrison had been clear the ensuring integrity bill will not be put for a vote in the Senate, but still took a swipe at the construction union: I would hope that in a time where Australia is facing the greatest economic challenge outside of a world war that it has ever faced, that people on construction sites who have been behaving in an unlawful way dial it the hell down. AAP has an update on the stock market: The Australian share market has rallied to its highest level since 6 March, with gains across nearly every sector on a wave of optimism about Australia\u2019s economic prospects. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Wednesday close to the highs of the day, up 106.5 points, or 1.83%, at 5,941.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 104.8 points, or 1.76%, at 6,064.9. One Australian dollar was buying 69.36 US cents, up from 68.02 US cents at the close of trade on Tuesday. The Aussie reached 69.84 US cents earlier on Wednesday, its highest point since early January. On the ABC, Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, is asked by Patricia Karvelas what should happen to the jobseeker payment. It is currently at about $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement, but that will be halved from the end of September. He says it shouldn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d to the old rate, but declines to give a figure, saying \u201cwe need to be really responsible with the budget. We don\u2019t know what the budget looks like.\u201d Look, it needs to be \u2013 you know, a reasonable increase. It can\u2019t just be a token \u2013 you know, increase. It can\u2019t snap back to what it was. It can\u2019t just be a sort of \u2013 you know, some kind of sop. We need to come at this from what\u2019s reasonable and responsible and affordable. But the most important thing is to be able to support people enough through a difficult time now, but also when they\u2019re looking for work. The federal attorney general, Christian Porter, was on Perth radio station 6PR earlier today and was asked about the robodebt fiasco. He made some notable comments, particularly that the government remains convinced some of the debts that were unlawfully raised as part of the scheme were in fact valid. \u201cSimply because the method which had been used to calculate a debt was held to be legally insufficient doesn\u2019t mean that there weren\u2019t debts in existence,\u201d he said. \u201cThat applies we argue to this class of plaintiffs at large and if you have a look at the individual plaintiffs on the Gordon Legal website, you know, it\u2019s been reported in the Guardian as well, people did actually owe debts.\u201d Given this, and what Porter claimed was the \u201cenormous money overpaid to people\u201d over many years, he flagged the government had not lost hope of recouping the money. \u201cThere are still debts and that\u2019s why we have to, notwithstanding this litigation and its ultimately conclusion, go back to the drawing board and work out ways to in a legally sufficient way calculate and recoup that debt because it can\u2019t be let going on as it is.\u201d The Guardian reported yesterday the government has not ruled out legislating to allow a reboot of mass scale debt recovery. And just on the figures from today: There have been 7,229 cases Eight new cases confirmed in the past 24 hours There have been 102 deaths There are less than 500 active cases, with 25 people in hospital, five in ICU, and two on ventilators Kelly is asked about which countries are of most concern now \u2013 and he lists Brazil and Russia. Those are the two leaders in terms of the large numbers of increasing cases over the last couple of weeks, but many parts of Europe, including the UK and North America are also a problem as is other parts of South America. On the likelihood of a travel bubble with New Zealand, he says: When we get to that point and we\u2019re absolutely sure that we both pretty much have the problem under control, then there\u2019ll be an arrangement, I\u2019m very certain, to allow such a travel bubble to occur. It is about the timing of that and what, if any, extra tests or screening or so forth would need to happen either prior to boarding or after arrival is a matter for discussion between the two countries and those discussions are happening right now. Asked about the possibility of sports stadiums being reopened as competitions get back under way, Kelly says the principles taken into account could include a \u201csmaller than usual capacity situation\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t want to pre-empt national cabinet. On outbreaks, Kelly says \u201cwe will be seeing this ripple effect of small numbers, isolated outbreaks very quickly recognised through our test, trace and respond way of dealing with these and brought under control\u201d. The outbreaks will become less and less common, but he suspects this will change when Australia starts to think about opening its borders again. In fact, it\u2019s the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, providing the update. Kelly notes overseas \u201cthis virus still is out of control\u201d. \u201cThere is large epidemics, large numbers of cases and deaths happening every day. So we have to keep that vigilance going around people coming from overseas.\u201d Just a reminder we are expecting Dr Nick Coatsworth to provide the daily coronavirus update shortly. Hi everyone, thanks to Amy for her work today. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. If you want to get in touch: luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or @lukehgomes My wonderful colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes will take you through that, and the rest of what is happening today. Thank you again for joining me. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. In the meantime, take care of you. We will be getting a national Covid update today (they are only doing them now and then, now). Dr Nick Coatsworth will take you through that in about 3o minutes. Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann have put out their official statement on the GDP figures: The position of strength from which we entered the crisis together with this unprecedented support has seen the Australian economy perform better than almost every developed economy in the world. In April, the government indicated that it would provide an update on the economic and fiscal outlook in June. Since then, Australia\u2019s continued success in flattening the curve means we have been able to begin reopening our economy more quickly than initially expected. Treasury has also since commenced its review of the jobkeeper program, which is not expected to be concluded until the end of June. As a result, the government has taken the decision to defer the economic and fiscal update to 23 July 2020, so that it can incorporate the outcomes of the jobkeeper review. Delivering the update in July will also enable the economic and fiscal outlook to take account of progress made under the three step plan outlined by national cabinet in early May which had the objective of seeing a sustainable Covid-safe Australia in July 2020. The government will continue to provide updates on the fiscal position through the release of the Australian Government General Government Sector Monthly Financial Statements. Adam Bandt has responded to today\u2019s GDP figures: Australia is in recession and Scott Morrison has no plan to get us out of it. Depression-era job queues demand a Depression-era response, which means massive public investment in nation-building, planet-saving projects, not granite benchtop grants. We need a 15-year plan to build 500,000 new public housing homes and create 44,000 new jobs and apprenticeships, not a mansion extension fund that will use public money for private benefit. As bad as these figures are, they will get worse when Scott Morrison pushes everyone off a cliff over the next few months by cutting jobseeker, jobkeeper and childcare support. With nearly four in 10 young people with no jobs or not enough work, it is time for a green new deal and a jobs guarantee to provide meaningful work to people and deliver lasting benefits to the Australian population. Alannah MacTiernan, who is the Western Australian agriculture minister, is speaking about the federal agriculture department\u2019s decision to allow the Al Kuwait an exemption to transport livestock past the 1 June cutoff date: We note that the federal regulator has decided that it is unable to grant an exemption to the vessel to take sheep out into the moratorium period. Now, we were open to that exemption being granted, but we understand that the commonwealth regulator has been looking in detail at all of the data, and they\u2019ve clearly made the decision that it is not safe to allow that exemption to apply. I\u2019m presuming, from what we gather, that there has been the meteorological data is showing more severe weather than usual in the Middle East, and that the vessel could not be here probably ready to go until about the 10th or 11th of June, and that obviously is well into the moratorium period. So, look, we accept that the regulator has looked at the science. We\u2019re presuming that they\u2019ve made a rational decision, they haven\u2019t issued their reasons yet, but we do understand that, to a significant extent, it was made on the analysis of the meteorological data. The national crisis committee held just two meetings over the 2019-2020 bushfire season, the royal commission has heard. The first meeting was held on 11 November, 2019, and the second on 10 January, 2020. Dominique Hogan-Doran SC, the leading senior counsel for the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements, asked why there were only two such meetings. Robert Cameron, the director general of Emergency Management Australia, which is a division of the home affairs department said \u201cit wasn\u2019t particularly needed\u201d. There was frequent and ongoing engagement at operational level, including at commissioners and chief officers level with each of the jurisdictions involved and the situation was well understood. Ministers were engaged. State governments, of course, were engaged. And there wasn\u2019t a particular need for a rolling series of national crisis committees to share information\u2026 governments were in frequent and routine contact.\u201d Cameron said the role of that committee overlapped with the Commissioners and Chief Officers Strategic Committee (COSC) on which sit the heads of all fire and emergency services in Australia, but there was no formal or structural link between the two committees. He suggested that while COSC \u201cworks very well\u201d he has some \u201creservations about the authorising environment in which agreements to share [resources] are created\u201d. Currently, those arrangements are brokered by the National Resource Sharing Centre, which is managed by the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council (AFAC), a non-government organisation.Cameron said it was his view that those arrangements \u201cprobably should be the province of governments, rather than the province of a not-for-profit company\u201d. He said there was \u201cunequivocal\u201d evidence that Australia would face more severe and more frequent natural hazards, and national governance arrangements around resource-sharing needed to be \u201csafe in a governance sense\u201d. \u201cIf you take the impact of the changing climate into account we\u2019re going to have, again regrettably, more disaster impacts which will stretch our capacity and if you take that to its ultimate end, we could be faced at some future point with a decision that needs to be made collectively where resource element A can be applied to incident B or not C, but not both. And that requires very safe governance arrangements to make those sorts of decisions because the impacts on the community to which the capability is not deployed could be dire. And indeed are likely to be so.\u201d Christian Porter has released his statement on today\u2019s IR roundtable: The Morrison government has appointed former West Australian under treasurer, Tim Marney, to help lead its efforts to regrow jobs lost during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Marney, now a principal at Nous Group, will serve as deputy chair of the five industrial relations working groups that were announced by the prime minister last month. The working groups will aim to tackle known problems within the IR system which inhibit job growth and creation. Attorney general and minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, who will chair the working groups, announced Mr Marney\u2019s appointment today following an IR roundtable meeting in Sydney to map out the consultative process over the coming months. \u201cMr Marney is a highly respected economist and problem solver who worked successfully under both Labor and Liberal governments during almost three decades of public service,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cHaving worked closely with Tim during my time as WA treasurer, his skillset and ability to bridge the political divide makes him the ideal choice to facilitate negotiations between employers and unions to get Australian working again. \u201cLike me, Tim also understands the urgency of this task and the need for all sides to put old animosities aside and work together like never before to deliver fair and workable solutions to the problems that threaten to hold back our economic recovery. \u201cToday\u2019s roundtable agreed that jobs needed to be everyone\u2019s central focus as we move into the Covid-19 recovery phase, whilst remaining conscious of the continuing health challenges posed by the virus. \u201cI was very heartened by the cooperative approach of all participants at today\u2019s meeting and the commitment all participants made to working consultatively on the five working group topics, which are: \u00b7 Casuals and fixed-term employees \u00b7 Award simplification (covering Awards in industry sectors heavily impacted by Covid) \u00b7 Enterprise agreement making \u00b7 Compliance and enforcement \u00b7 Greenfields agreements for new enterprises If you have to keep telling people what your strategy is, chances are, it isn\u2019t coming across as you want it to. Jim Chalmers on how Labor has handled the past few months: What we\u2019ve shown in the last few months, Labor has shown, in being constructive and responsible, but not being silent, that approach has been vindicated by events. We said too [many] people were excluded from the jobkeeper payments and that turned out to be the case. We said there were issues with the construction sector and particularly social housing, that unfortunately looks like that would be the case. We said there was a reason to increase social security payments. In many cases what we proposed the government initially dismissed, including some of the things we think they may be announcing in the next day or two. The country would be better off if the coalition matched their rhetoric of co-operation with reality. Because we have had a constructive role to play, we\u2019ve had pointed out where there may be issues, including in superannuation early access, but in other areas as well, and in every case, as far as I\u2019m aware, the warnings that we have made or the suggestions that we have made have proven to be sensible. Q: What do you make of the treasurer\u2019s words \u201cremarkably resilient\u201d when he talks about how the economy was? Jim Chalmers: That kind of spin is cold comfort for the 800,000 Australians who signed up for unemployment benefits in the last couple of months. The treasurer was at it again today, trying to pretend that slogans and marketing is a substitute for quality economic management in uncertain times like these. That sound you hear is \u201cback in black\u201d mugs being smashed at Liberal HQ. This is what it comes down to, for Labor. Josh Frydenberg: The treasurer was at it again today, trying to pretend he had already delivered a surplus when we now know that wasn\u2019t the case. This is a treasurer that printed the mugs saying the budget was back in black and the reality proved to be something very different. Clearly in times like these, there\u2019s a role for the government to intervene in the economy in the ways we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of months, so the highest priority is people\u2019s jobs, rather than clinging to the arbitrary and political goal the government announced some time ago. I think it\u2019s humiliating for Josh Frydenberg as the first treasurer in nine treasurers to oversee a recession. The only treasurer to print mugs saying the budget was back in the black well before it was. The prime minister claimed during the course of the last election campaign he had already delivered a budget surplus. This government\u2019s record on managing the budget even before this crisis, if you look at the facts, has been a failure. They had more than doubled debt even before the crisis, they have delivered six deficits after promising only surpluses, and now we enter difficult times, where there\u2019s a case of government spending and there\u2019s a case for government intervention, where our highest priority is jobs in the economy and doing what is necessary there, we approach that from a position of weakness rather than strength, because of what the government has failed to achieve in the last seven years. Jim Chalmers: In this context, it\u2019s absolutely unacceptable to hear today, buried in an answer from a question the treasurer does not intend to keep his commitment to update the budget in June. It\u2019s an absolute disgrace that the budget update has been delayed once again in these uncertain times. It shows this treasurer and this government wants to keep Australians in the dark about what is happening in the economy, what we are expect to happen in the coming months, and what the impact has been on all the blunders and bungles the government has made so far with jobkeeper and other key programs. And I think the many Australians will be suspicious that their intention is to drop it out again, late on a Friday afternoon, like they did with the jobkeeper debacle, like they did with robodebt, in the hope that no one notices. We need the government to level with people for once. There is a lot of understandable anxiety in the community about this recession. Back to Jim Chalmers: Much of what we are seeing today is an acceleration of challenges that have been in the economy for some time. Weak growth, stagnant private economy, sluggish consumption, declining business and dwelling investment and weak wages growth. In terms of wages, we\u2019re conscious the industrial relations processes the government set up begin today. It shouldn\u2019t have taken a once-in-a-century pandemic for this government to realise the benefits of bringing business and unions together to try and find some common ground. That should be thoroughly unremarkable. We want to see this process work. We want to see sensible outcomes come out of it, and if they do, we\u2019ll support those outcomes. But we don\u2019t think the answer to years of insecure work and stagnant wages is even more job insecurity or even more downward pressure on wages. It would be disappointing in the extreme if this process, at the end of it, the government said to all those Australians who made so many sacrifices and dealt with stagnant wages for so long, the answer to all of this is more of the same. From AAP: Victoria\u2019s two biggest suburban football competitions have cancelled their seasons due to the Covid-19 pandemic, casting further doubt on any community leagues taking to the field in 2020. The Eastern and Northern leagues intend to push ahead with their junior competitions, but all senior football and netball has been abandoned this year. The EFNL and NFNL confirmed it would be too difficult financially and logistically to stage games amid coronavirus restrictions, and club volunteers needed certainty. Almost all community football leagues and clubs agree it would be impossible to run a season without crowds contributing to canteen and bar sales. \u201cBoth the EFNL and NFNL believe that cancelling their competitions is the only viable decision that will ensure the long-term sustainability of their clubs and the leagues,\u201d a joint statement read. \u201c[The leagues] are both committed to working closely with AFL Victoria ... and will now begin working with clubs towards a return to the field in 2021.\u201d The powerful metropolitan leagues join country competitions Kyabram District, Heathcote District and Millewa in pulling the pin for 2020. Jim Chalmers: Now, while the pandemic came without warning, long standing weakness in the economy did not. Even before the worst of this virus, even before the bushfires, we had issues with weak growth, and stagnant wages, and weak business investment, and productivity, and net debt in the budget had already more than doubled. So we entered this very difficult crisis from a position of weakness rather than strength. Jim Chalmers is responding, officially, to the GDP figures: Australia\u2019s remarkable run of three decades of continuous growth has come to an end. This unparalleled period of continuous growth which was set up by Labor, was defended by Labor, when it was last most at risk, has now come to an end under the Liberals as a consequence of this pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have already been sacrificed to the first recession in 29 years. And the recovery will be patchy and it will take some time. Linda Burney and Mark Dreyfus have put out a statement, calling for clear targets to address the over-representation of First Nations people in Australian\u2019s prison systems, and child removal. Here is part of it: There have been 432 Indigenous deaths in custody since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991. First Nations people are still grossly overrepresented in prison \u2013 making up 29% of those in jail, but just 3% the broader population. In some places, over 80% of those in jail are Indigenous. Indigenous children are still 10 times more likely to be in out-of-home-care. In some places, 90% of children in out-of-home-care are Indigenous. We also remain deeply concerned by the Morrison government\u2019s decision to reverse decades of self-determination in the provision of legal services to Indigenous Australians by abolishing the standalone, specific purpose funding program for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services. We in Labor also reiterate our call for the Morrison Ggovernment to reinstate funding to the existing self-determined structure of the National Family Violence Prevention Legal Services Forum which, for years, has worked with and on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survivors of family violence and sexual assault. It is critical that the government continues to work with the Coalition of Peaks in determining the targets, policies and programs to reduce Indigenous incarceration and child removal rates. I doubt we\u2019ll be seeing \u201cback solidly in the red\u201d mugs for sale anytime soon though. The June quarter figures are going to be rough. Waking up after the whitest bachelorette party in the history of the world, rough. (But yes, the promised surplus was in doubt before the pandemic hit.) Josh Frydenberg finishes with this on this question: \u201cGiven these numbers are largely based on the bushfires, does this show that your promised surplus was in doubt before the pandemic?\u201d Frydenberg: Well, firstly, these numbers reflect the pandemic - the impact on consumption as a result of this once-in-a-century event. When it comes to the bushfires, as you know, Treasury, RBA, others, talked about, 0.2% of an impact on the national accounts but that was over the December and March quarters. This story today is the result of very difficult health decisions that have had a very severe economic impact. This is the economic consequences of the health decisions that we\u2019ve had to take. And we were on track to deliver a surplus even after the bushfires. We delivered the first balanced budget in 11 years. But clearly, with this once-in-a-century pandemic, the impact on the economy has been very severe, the impact in the June quarter will be even more severe, we\u2019ve climbed this mountain before, we\u2019ll climb it again. So from that, you can take away that we are going to get a mini-budget in July. The budget was put off until October, but the start of the new financial year will demand some answers about where the economy is going, and the government has to respond earlier than October. Q: Are you now anticipating that, following that June review of jobkeeper, there\u2019ll be a major overhaul of that program? Or do you think you\u2019ll just be doing tweaking? Josh Frydenberg: Well, again, the governor of the Reserve Bank has said it\u2019s very sensible to do a review at the midway point. What we want to do, is understand where businesses are in the recovery stage. We want to understand whether the quantum \u2013 that $1,500 payment \u2013 continues to be the right amount. Also bearing in mind that some people are getting paid more than they would otherwise get by virtue of having a flat payment. But, in the context of an economy where the restrictions are being eased and people are getting back into work, we need to assess - and particularly being of focus to certain sectors as well - we need to assess the continuation of that jobkeeper program in that context, and it\u2019s too early to pre-empt what the outcomes of that review will be, but any government decisions about the review will be incorporated into that statement that the finance minister and I will make in July. Q: What do you need to do to get us out of this recession - to reverse consumption. Are you advising Australians to spend more? Josh Frydenberg: I think we will see consumption come back in accordance with the improvements we\u2019ve seen in consumer confidence. So, as I said, nine consecutive weeks of consumer confidence rising, making up 95% of those losses that we saw in March. Consumption will pick up as the restrictions are eased. And that is really important to understand. As restrictions are eased, people can start to go out to the pub or to their shopping centre. Just a couple of days ago, I was in a pub in Hawthorn. There were 11 people in that pub who were on jobkeeper - workers, whether they were in the kitchen or whether they were at the front bar. The fact that those restrictions are now being eased and they can have customers come through the door will mean that that transition off that support will be easier for a business like that, as well as we will see an increase in consumption as a result of those restrictions being eased. Just heard someone walk past on the street saying \u201cOh great, we are in recession\u201d. That was quick. From an emotional sense, we have been feeling it for a while Everyone and their cat knew this was coming. But here is Josh Frydenberg confirming it: Q: Is Australia in recession today? Frydenberg: Well, the answer to that is yes. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be. Josh Frydenberg continues: Based on what we know from Treasury, we\u2019re going to see a contraction in the June quarter which is going to be a lot more substantial than what we have seen in the March quarter. The finance minister and I will be providing a detailed update on the economic numbers now in July as opposed to June, and we\u2019re doing so because we\u2019re going to announce, at the same time, the outcomes of our jobkeeper review. As you know, that is being conducted through the course of this month. And we want the outcomes of that review to be within the numbers that we announce in July. We also have that three-step process, that has been agreed by national cabinet, and the intention was for those three steps to be completed by July, and that should allow us to get a better sense of where the economy is at that point in time. Josh Frydenberg: Well, as I was saying, we were on the edge of the cliff. What we were facing was an economist\u2019s version of Armageddon. We have avoided the economic fate, and the health fate, of other nations because of the measures, that we have taken as a nation \u2013 the social-distancing requirements, the work that we\u2019ve done on isolation and quarantine, the travel bans \u2013 that has seen the number of cases reduce dramatically. As a result of our success on the health front, we are now starting to see the restrictions being eased. And as you know, national cabinet set out a three-step plan for for removing those restrictions, which Treasury forecasts - once done - will deliver about $1.4bn delivered to the economy and see 50,000 people get back to work. The June quarter, the economic impact will be severe. Far more severe than what we have seen today. That\u2019s what Treasury\u2019s advice to me is. And on the household savings ratio, Jo Masters says: Households have already moved to boost precautionary savings, with the savings rise jumping to 5.5% from 3.5% in Q4 2019 even as income was boosted by social assistance benefits. This shift reflects the intensifying headwinds to spending. Households are absorbing higher unemployment, elevated job insecurity, falling house prices, concerns about a second Covid-19 outbreak, all against a backdrop of already high debt levels. Jo Masters, the chief economist at EY has taken a look at the national accounts for March: There was never any doubt that Australia is in the midst of a recession when you consider the broader definition, being a prolonged period of weak or negative real GDP growth associated with a sharp rise in unemployment. Today\u2019s data showed that the economy contracted by 0.3% in the March quarter setting Australia up to meet the technical definition of recession, and ending Australia\u2019s near 30 year run of economic expansion. The key takeaway from the data, though, is the speed, intensity and widespread nature of the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and consequent move to enforce social distancing and travel restrictions. While these measures only impacted a few weeks out of the whole quarter, the impact was laid bare for all to see in the data.\u201d Josh Frydenberg: Today\u2019s national accounts show, once again, that in the face of a 1-in-100-year global pandemic, the Australian economy has been remarkably resilient. We entered this economic crisis, and this health crisis, from a position of economic strength. Growth was rising, unemployment had fallen to 5.1% in January, 5.1m jobs had been created, and the budget was back in balance for the first time in 11 years. Around $260bn in economic support, or the equivalent of more than 13% of GDP. We are not through this crisis as yet. And there will be some difficult days ahead. But our nation \u2013 working across geographical and political boundaries \u2013 has made great progress. Having withstood flood, fire, drought, and now the coronavirus pandemic, Australians have shown a unity and purpose which has enabled us to make significant progress and for which all Australians can be very proud and very confident about their future. Josh Frydenberg says the 0.3% drop in GDP, in context, shows \u201cremarkable resilience\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that it was quite early on in the March quarter that the health restrictions were starting to be implemented. Australia had its first coronavirus case confirmed on January 25 and, a week later, on the 1st of February, Australia became one of the first countries to act in bringing in a travel ban on China. It was soon extended to Iran, South Korea and Italy, and then to all non-residents on the 20 March. Social-distancing restrictions were also implemented progressively in that quarter. On 15 March, outdoor gatherings were limited to 500. On 18 March, indoor gatherings were limited to 100. On 20 March, the 4-sq-metre rule came into place. And on 24 March, overseas travel was banned and limits placed on the size of gatherings at weddings and funerals. It was in this quarter \u2013 the March quarter \u2013 that consumer and business confidence fell to its lowest level on record. That the ASX 200 lost a third of its value. And on 16 March, saw its biggest daily fall of 9.7% on record. When combined with the ongoing drought, which saw farm GDP fall by 2.4% in the quarter, and the devastating impact of the fires that were raging across many states, one looks back on the March quarter, and there wasn\u2019t much good news. Seen in this context, the fact that the Australian economy only contracted by 0.3% shows the Australian economy\u2019s remarkable resilience. This also shows you where we are headed as a global economy. Spoiler - it ain\u2019t good. This is what those savings look like - people are not feeling overly confident, so they are trying to hold on to their cash. The ABS says the increase in social security spending has also helped increase people\u2019s disposable income, so in some cases, people who have never been able to save before, now have a buffer. Plus, we didn\u2019t have a lot to spend our money on. But still. Jim Chalmers has responded to the latest national accounts: And by jurisdiction Josh Frydenberg will hold a press conference to discuss the GDP figures at 12.15pm. Right, I am not an economist, so this is all a little whoosh whoosh. You\u2019ll find all the data here, and you can read Greg Jericho\u2019s analysis to find out more. But the takeaways, as I see them are: We are all saving more, showing we are not feeling overly optimistic about the economy \u2013 the household saving ratio was up to 5.5%. At the same time, it follows that we are spending less. A lot less \u2013 household final consumption expenditure fell 1.1%, the first decline since December 2008, detracting 0.6 percentage points from GDP. Discretionary spending is down 3.9%. GDP per capita is down 0.7%. And this is just the beginning. Forget the \u2018technical\u2019 recession. We are in one. The ABS has released the latest national accounts: The Australian Gross Domestic Product fell 0.3% in seasonally adjusted, chain volume terms in the March quarter 2020 and growth slowed to 1.4% through the year, according to figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today. Chief economist for the ABS, Bruce Hockman, said: This was the slowest through-the-year growth since September 2009 when Australia was in the midst of the Global Financial Crisis and captures just the beginning of the expected economic effects of Covid-19. The Australian economy was impacted by a number of significant events this quarter, starting with bushfires and other natural disasters, followed by the outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent imposition of restrictions. The government responded with the introduction of economic stimulus and support packages. The ABS has published a series of spotlight articles highlighting some areas in the economy where these events had more significant impacts. Public demand contributed 0.3 percentage points to GDP, driven by a 1.8% rise in government final consumption expenditure. With community transmission of Covid-19 down in NSW, that state is resuming roadside breathe tests. Via AAP: NSW police, meanwhile, have resumed stationary random alcohol breath testing after halting the roadside practice in March due to Covid-19 safety concerns. RBT sites will be re-established from Wednesday morning and an enhanced police presence on NSW roads has been promised for the June long weekend. \u201cIrresponsible or reckless behaviour that endangers others will not be tolerated \u2013 there\u2019s no excuse for not abiding by the road rules,\u201d police minister David Elliott said in a statement. \u201cThe community has already been through enough \u2013 we\u2019ve had enough trauma.\u201d AAP reports the ASX is slightly up, ahead of the latest GDP data: The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index was higher by 52.7 points, or 0.90%, at 5887.8 points after the first 30 minutes of trade on Wednesday. The All Ordinaries index was 54.4 points, or 0.91% higher, at 6014.5. All sectors were higher except for health. The biggest gains were in energy and property, up 2.08% and 1.98% respectively. The AUD is also on an upward trend buying 69.33USD. There is consensus among experts that the GDP figures for the March quarter will show a contraction of between 0.1% and 0.5%. But given the optimism in the markets, maybe prepare for the forecasts to be wrong. There is always the possibility of growth. We\u2019ll know for sure in about 10 minutes. The Queensland government has been in negotiations with airlines to increase intrastate tourism bookings. As part of one deal, Queensland residents will be able to fly from Brisbane to the Whitsunday\u2019s from $99. Alliance Airlines will fly that route four times a week from 22 June. The state\u2019s borders will remain closed until at least July, with an update expected at the end of June. A reminder that \u2018Karen\u2019 isn\u2019t a name, but a state of mind. The high court has ruled on the use of tear gas at the NT\u2019s Don Dale youth detention centre: NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller, who received an $87,000 pay increase early last month, bringing his salary to $649,500 (about $100,000 more than the prime minister) told Sydney radio 2GB he was \u201cconcerned\u201d by the footage of a NSW police officer sweeping an Indigenous boy to the ground during an arrest, but that the officer might have been having \u201ca bad day\u201d \u2013 but he did apologise for the boy\u2019s treatment. He says the investigation comes down to whether the force used was excessive or not: The fact that this officer doesn\u2019t have a chequered history and he has been in for three and a half years, for mine, if there certainly is complaint sustained against him, you would have to say he has had a bad day and I am sure most of the community wouldn\u2019t want to see someone who has made a mistake sacked after making such a commitment to the community. Fuller continued: From my perspective, we know the young boy attends the local PCYC, which is a positive thing for me, which means regardless of what his history is with police, he is someone who is trying to make better and we don\u2019t want to sacrifice that either, we want young people whether they\u2019ve got a clean history or a chequered history with police to be able to go to the PCYCs and rehabilitate themselves into employment and give them a future. I guess for mine, whether police have got this right or wrong don\u2019t throw away your relationship with the community because of it. ...Regardless of whether he should or shouldn\u2019t have been arrested, regardless of whether he has committed a crime or not, we certainly could have handled that situation better. Again, it is about how do you deal with this going forward? I am sure people don\u2019t want the officer sacked, I am sure they want some sense some accountability, but at the same time, I imagine there are people who would say you can\u2019t just go around swearing at police or threatening them either. Gladys Berejiklian says NSW has the health response to Covid-19 fairly underhand, attention needs to turn to the economy: Whilst we have the health consequences under control to an extent, although we can\u2019t be complacent, we have to be vigilant, the economic consequences have come to the fore. The easing of restrictions means come businesses can come back to a level of normality but we it has to be done in a Covid-safe way. There needs to be a checklist in place. Depending on your business, there are extra measures you\u2019ll need to take to keep your patrons safe. Similarly for us as individuals we need to make sure we follow the rules, and keep an eye out for people who are not doing the right thing. Children sport or community sport under 18 years of age does start on 1 July. We\u2019re obviously looking at adult sport. As you appreciate, what has underpinned our success is the social distancing. So we\u2019re saying to everybody \u2013 make sure you maintain 1.5 metres, a four-square metre rule. That\u2019s very difficult to apply to adult sport. We need to be very careful how to do that. We need to get it right. In every part of the world, I think every jurisdiction we\u2019ve looked at except for one, has had to shut things down or reverse decisions once restrictions ease. We don\u2019t want to do that. Victorian health authorities have reported seven new cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed in the last 24 hours. Those people are all recently returned travellers, who have been in quarantine. David Elliott has been to protests. Some of his best friends are protesters: Well, I mean, one of the great things about Australia is that we\u2019re free and democratic and that we allow and in fact we encourage freedom of speech and freedom of protest. I\u2019ve been to protests myself. And I think that we need to make sure that that is something that is, indeed, celebrated. Protesting against a cause or for a cause is something that should be celebrated in Australia. I just want people to be reminded that what happened in the United States is not what happens here. And even though we have had deaths in custody, even though we have had a rocky past in our race relations over 120-odd years, I think we need to be reminded that that occurred in the United States and our government and our police officers have a slightly different approach to community engagement. NSW police minister David Elliott, who said he would be happy for his children to be stripped searched by police - \u2013 on teenagers being \u201clippy\u201d: As somebody who has two teenage boys at home myself, I know what it can be like, but I think probably one of the secondary messages here is that we do need to remind our young people that there are levels of authority there that really command respect and that we need to ensure that all those institutions that are in positions of authority, whether it be a parliamentarian or a police officer or even, you know, media personalities, we have to make sure that we uphold the standards that demands that respect. Respect should never be freely given. It has to be earned, minister. I have often thought we are a nation of Ned Flanders thinking we\u2019re Ned Kelly. Add this story from Shane Wright at the SMH and the Age to the exhibit list. Australia outperformed the world dealing with the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and the nation\u2019s consumers out-shopped their international counterparts when it came to panic buying. New research by two University of New South Wales academics into coronavirus-related panic shopping shows that Australian consumers were the quickest in the world to raid supermarket aisles in search of toilet paper and canned soup. The charity sector is also on the brink in Australia. Social Ventures Australia (SVA) and the Centre for Social Impact (CSI) are launching a report today, detailing the concerns for the not-for-profit and charity sector, in the face of increased demand after Australia\u2019s bushfires, floods, drought and now pandemic. Andrew Leigh says the report found the sector is struggling both for funds and volunteers: They found that a 20% fall in revenue to the sector would put nearly 250,000 charity workers out of a job and see as many as one in six charities at high risk of closing down. Even before the coronavirus crisis, 60% of charities were in a vulnerable financial position, with one in four operating with a surplus of less than five per cent. Another survey of the sector found that by mid-April, 78% of charities reported a downturn in revenue, with more than one in six reporting a drop of more than 30%. In addition to falling funds, the sector\u2019s volunteer base has shrunk to one third its previous size. Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus, more than three million volunteers provided more than $12.7bn of unpaid labour each year. But more than half of all charities have seen a drastic drop in volunteer activity since the crisis began. New South Wales police minister David Elliott was asked about the young Indigenous boy who was tripped by a police officer and slammed face-first on the ground. He said that he would \u201csee what the professional standards review comes up with\u201d. I was just as disturbed about the threat from a young person to physically assault a police officer as I was with the response from the police officer. Elliott: It\u2019s an unfortunate situation. I don\u2019t want to see any young person physically apprehended for doing anything and I certainly don\u2019t want to see any police officer physically threatened with violence. I\u2019m happy that the commissioner has taken ownership of this. He\u2019s going to ensure there is a thorough investigation and review and if ... If I can do anything to assist either the family reinstate their relationship with the local police \u2013 which I understand is very strong, because the boy is involved with PCYC \u2013 then I\u2019ll happily do that. In case you missed it last night, Ben Butler has an update on where the Virgin bid is at. The two remaining contenders to buy stricken airline Virgin Australia now face a race against time to secure a binding deal \u2013 and potentially a government bailout \u2013 before the end of the month. On Tuesday Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, said they wanted to receive binding bids from US private equity group Bain Capital and investment group Cyrus Capital Partners. The two were among five groups that on Friday lodged non-binding bids for the airline, which collapsed beneath a $6.8bn pile of debt in April after being paralysed by the coronavirus crisis. For all your global Covid-19 updates, head here. It\u2019s hard to withstand global shocks when your supply is kept offshore, but sure, go off. (And also, our big \u201cboost\u201d is five days\u2019 worth of supply.) Meanwhile, the Canadian prime minister was asked about Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the United States protests, and what he thought Canada\u2019s issues were. Justin Trudeau was silent for 22 seconds before answering. Does Anthony Albanese, who called for an \u201cinvestigation\u201d into how US police treated an Australian Seven News camera operator and journalist, believe Australia has the same issues when it comes to racism? He tells the Nine Network: Certainly, there are issues here but nothing like the United States. It is important that leaders seek to unite the nation. And I think here in Australia, if you compare with what\u2019s going on in the US, I just look over there, I think about, there\u2019s more than 100,000 former US citizens who have made Australia their home and I know that many of them will be worried about what\u2019s occurring in their nation. It doesn\u2019t look great to me. It looks extremely troubling and a deeply divided society. And I just hope that this great democracy is able to unite and come together as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Australia\u2019s universities say they are on the brink \u2013 as Paul Karp reports: Universities claim they will lose up to $16bn by 2023 due to the impact of Covid-19, according to new modelling. Universities Australia has raised the stakes in lobbying for an industry assistance package or relaxed visa conditions to facilitate international students by revealing it now expects members to lose between $3.1bn and $4.8bn this year alone. The peak body had previously estimated losses of up to $4.6bn, warning of 21,000 job losses in the sector. The warning prompted the government to guarantee its $18bn contribution to universities but it refused to kick in extra funding. Thinking of taking Greece up on its quarantine free holiday offer? Well, learn from the story of Troy. Look deeper. Labor\u2019s Andrew Giles wants the government to support an anti-racism campaign, now that lockdowns are easing and the initial panic over Covid-19 is passing: Racism has been on the rise during the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been reports of some shocking incidents of abuse directed at Chinese-Australians. This is why Labor has been calling for a new national anti-racism campaign, as part of a strategy to confront racism. This call is supported by multicultural organisations \u2013 and through the actions of the NSW Liberal government. But the Morrison government has refused to act. Indeed, on the weekend the member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu was reported as saying that the \u201cracism has died down\u201d. Really? What evidence does Ms Liu have to support this statement? Do the prime minister and the acting minister for multicultural affairs agree with her? Labor is not convinced that coronavirus-related racism has died down, and we share the concern of many stakeholders that racism is being under-reported. While the vast majority of Australians abhor racism, we need to stand against the actions of an unrepresentative minority so that we can all get through this together. It\u2019s time for the Morrison government to support a national anti-racism campaign. Asked what she thought when she saw the footage attached to this story: Gladys Berejiklian said: I think I thought what most Australians thought, and that is \u2013 we still have a long way to go in our country. And I appreciate the actions the police have taken in relation to that in terms of restricting the duties of the officer involved. They\u2019re investigating the matter. I think what happened in the US is a good wakeup call for all of us, and I think that all of us have our hearts breaking as to what\u2019s happening in the United States. And we have to ensure that we can do what we can in our own country to protect all of our citizens. Gladys Berejiklian had a quick chat to ABC News Breakfast this morning. Asked about the NSW upper house blocking the public servant pay freeze: Look, we know that it is a big ask for the public servant, but we\u2019re saying to every single one of the 410,000 public service working for the New South Wales government - we\u2019ve said to each and every one of them, you will have a job guarantee for the next 12 months. And all we\u2019re asking you to do is not take a pay rise for the next 12 months. As I mentioned earlier, we literally have hundreds of people who have left the workforce. In 90% of the population that don\u2019t work for the New South Wales public service, 221,000 of those people lost their jobs in April. We literally have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of others, and I think we\u2019re getting sop updated figures today, who are on jobkeeper. Once jobkeeper runs out, we don\u2019t know how many of those employees will stay employed and how many will join the Centrelink queues. And it\u2019s a very difficult time. None of us could have foreshadowed horrific bushfire seasons, storms, deep drought and a pandemic. I don\u2019t think that any one of us could have foreseen that and that\u2019s why we need to take decisions which are not decisions we\u2019d usually take. Not decisions we are happy to take, but that we have to take. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing what we have to do. We\u2019re thinking and looking to the future, because literally, by the end of the year, I shudder to think how many people in New South Wales will be without a job. David Littleproud\u2019s department has decided to NOT grant a live export exemption for the Al Kuwait vessel, which docked in Western Australia after a Covid outbreak among crew members. The exporter, Rural Export and Trading (WA) Pty Ltd, had asked to be able to make the trip after the 1 June deadline which has been imposed to protect animals from heat stress during the journey to the Middle East. The ag department has said no. It will give its reasons later in the week. The exporter submitted an application to the department for exemption from the June 1 export deadline under the Australian Meat and Live\u2011stock Industry (Prohibition of Export of Sheep by Sea to Middle East\u2014Northern Summer) Order 2020, including an Animal Welfare Management Plan. Following consideration of all relevant matters under the legislation, including animal welfare and trade implications, the department has taken the decision not to grant an exemption to the exporter. The livestock that was to be exported in this consignment remain at registered premises and the department is satisfied there are no welfare concerns. Today is Mabo Day. It has been 28 years since Eddie Koiki Mabo\u2019s fight for Native Title rights for Indigenous land rights culminated in a high court win, which also dismissed \u2018terra nullius\u2019 from legislation. Eddie Mabo had mounted the fight, after learning the Meriam people had no ownership over the Murray Islands, where he grew up, because it had been deemed the property of Queensland. In 1981, he made a speech declaring that the land was \u201cmy fathers &amp; grandfather\u2019s, grandmother\u2019s land, I am related to it, it is my identity. That\u2019s why I need to fight for it, so I don\u2019t loose my identity to the land\u201d. Eddie Mabo died five months before the high court handed down its decision. The industrial relations roundtables announced by Scott Morrison at the National Press Club last week begin today in Sydney. Depending who you ask this is either an Extremely Big Deal because unions, employers and government are negotiating reforms which has a bit of a (Prices and Incomes) Accord flavour - OR - all the government has done is book a room, with no guarantee anyone will agree to anything out of it. There are five reform committees dealing with: award simplification; enterprise agreement making; casuals and fixed term employees; compliance and enforcement; and greenfields agreements for new enterprises. On the employee side, ACTU secretary Sally McManus and president Michele O\u2019Neil on the employer side, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Ai Group, the Business Council of Australia, Australian Resources and Energy Group, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy (WA) and Master Builders Australia. While the aim is to reach consensus, the government hasn\u2019t ruled out pushing on without it - and this could be done by legislation, regulation, or via the budgetary process in October. Industrial relations minister Christian Porter said: As the prime minister said, it is critical that all sides of the debate lay down their arms and commit to work together during this process to find ways to get our economy moving again and urgently regrow the jobs so many Australians have lost as a result of Covid-19 ... The problems within each of the five areas we have chosen to focus on are well known and I am confident that if we can work cooperatively, an opportunity exists to make meaningful progress at developing solutions that will make a significant difference to how quickly we can recover from this crisis. While participants will no doubt want to raise other issues outside of the five priority areas, all participants will be encouraged to leave the traditional \u2018shopping wish lists\u2019 at the door and focus on getting results that can be achieved in the shortest possible timeframe.\u201d Welcome to Roundtable Wednesday \u2013 the first of the government\u2019s attempts to bring in representatives from all sides of the work debate and iron out Australia\u2019s IR laws. So far, everyone seems to be going in with clear eyes and, if not full hearts, open ones, but unlike the pandemic changes, any alterations made here, would have lasting impacts. This is not the accords. There is no Medicare on the table, no widespread societal change. Just IR awards and the potential to make something worse, if not everyone is in the mood to make it better. If there is no agreement, the government will still be pressing forward with what it thinks it should do. What that is, will come from the conversations, but it has already said there doesn\u2019t need to be consensus. So we will bring you that, as well as everything else which happens today, including the national accounts which should be out mid-morning. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day.

I feel guilty but also angry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I knew something was wrong. I had a high heart rate, which I thought was strange. I managed to get a private test done which came back positive for Covid-19. I was ultra-worried because I\u2019d seen my parents before I had symptoms. My father had otherwise been isolating because of his age, like I had told him to.</p> <p>Assuming a median <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200402-sitrep-73-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=5ae25bc7_4\">incubation period of five to six days</a> as the medical papers suggest, followed by seven days of symptoms, I must have caught Covid-19 at the end of February. On 13 March, over a week before lockdown was introduced, the scientific advisory group of emergencies (Sage) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/sage-minutes-reveal-how-uk-advisers-reacted-to-coronavirus-crisis\">concluded</a> \u201cthere are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve\u201d.</p> <p>Even though he was 80, my dad was very fit. When I took him in to hospital, the ward was half-empty. A few days later it was packed. Staff were off because they had symptoms and couldn\u2019t get tested. There were so many bank nurses who were stretched and not used to working in an environment of infection. I could see how things would escalate.</p> <p>My dad didn\u2019t want to die. He survived for weeks on the ventilator but his doctors and I knew that if he ever came off it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to lead the life he had done before. He would have hated that. I went into a side room with the consultant\u2019s permission in full personal protective equipment which I had bought; Dad was unconscious and heavily sedated. I held his hand and said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m really sorry that I couldn\u2019t keep the promise I made you four weeks ago saying you\u2019d be home by the end of the week.\u201d I said I should have been more wary, that it should be me in that bed.</p> <p>It was so painful and surreal. Sometimes I still can\u2019t acknowledge it happened, I think I\u2019m having a bad dream.</p> <p>I believe the health secretary did not do all that could reasonably be expected to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which he had knowledge.</p> <p>Why did the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/absolutely-wrong-how-uk-coronavirus-test-strategy-unravelled\">government stop testing</a> in those early days? Why didn\u2019t it inform us when it knew there was community transmission in February? The UK doesn\u2019t have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">second highest mortality rate in the world</a> for no reason. If the government and PHE had put this information in the public domain, and people still broke the rules of lockdown, that would have been different. It would have been because they\u2019d disobeyed something the government had done to protect us.</p> <p>Lives would have been lost under Covid-19 but I believe if the government and PHE had acted sooner with the information that they had, the death rate would have been substantially lower.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/20/society-weekly-email-newsletter-sign-up\">Sign up for Society Weekly: our newsletter for public service professionals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once these matters are addressed hopefully we can prevent this from ever happening again.

I rang NHS 111 and waited 40 minutes for them to tell me it was a cold because I didn\u2019t have a cough, one of the main symptoms of coronavirus. I knew something was wrong. I had a high heart rate, which I thought was strange. I managed to get a private test done which came back positive for Covid-19. I was ultra-worried because I\u2019d seen my parents before I had symptoms. My father had otherwise been isolating because of his age, like I had told him to. Assuming a median incubation period of five to six days as the medical papers suggest, followed by seven days of symptoms, I must have caught Covid-19 at the end of February. On 13 March, over a week before lockdown was introduced, the scientific advisory group of emergencies (Sage) concluded \u201cthere are more cases in the UK than previously thought and we may therefore be further ahead of the epidemic curve\u201d. Even though he was 80, my dad was very fit. When I took him in to hospital, the ward was half-empty. A few days later it was packed. Staff were off because they had symptoms and couldn\u2019t get tested. There were so many bank nurses who were stretched and not used to working in an environment of infection. I could see how things would escalate. My dad didn\u2019t want to die. He survived for weeks on the ventilator but his doctors and I knew that if he ever came off it, he wouldn\u2019t be able to lead the life he had done before. He would have hated that. I went into a side room with the consultant\u2019s permission in full personal protective equipment which I had bought; Dad was unconscious and heavily sedated. I held his hand and said, \u201cDad, I\u2019m really sorry that I couldn\u2019t keep the promise I made you four weeks ago saying you\u2019d be home by the end of the week.\u201d I said I should have been more wary, that it should be me in that bed. It was so painful and surreal. Sometimes I still can\u2019t acknowledge it happened, I think I\u2019m having a bad dream. I believe the health secretary did not do all that could reasonably be expected to avoid a real and immediate risk to life of which he had knowledge. Why did the government stop testing in those early days? Why didn\u2019t it inform us when it knew there was community transmission in February? The UK doesn\u2019t have the second highest mortality rate in the world for no reason. If the government and PHE had put this information in the public domain, and people still broke the rules of lockdown, that would have been different. It would have been because they\u2019d disobeyed something the government had done to protect us. Lives would have been lost under Covid-19 but I believe if the government and PHE had acted sooner with the information that they had, the death rate would have been substantially lower. Once these matters are addressed hopefully we can prevent this from ever happening again. There will be more clusters of coronavirus and there may well be a second wave. We need to learn from the mistakes now, rather than later. More information can be found here: www.crowdjustice.com/case/holding-the-government-to-account/",

An alternative approach, for example, of loosening lending restrictions for mortgages, might boost GDP but would do so by increasing debt and raising house prices, benefitting the already wealthy while hurting people without wealth. The recovery must involve a reconsideration of what is valuable in society. The pandemic has put into stark relief the extraordinary contribution of health and care workers, many of whom are women and migrants, and the essential support of key workers across the economy. The recovery must recognise that contribution in higher pay and better working conditions. So, too, the pandemic has caused conversations up and down the country about unpaid care work and who performs it. But the easing of lockdown has prioritised marketised activity over human relationships, which don\u2019t require cash. You can visit your parents at home, but only if you want to purchase their house or clean it. The recovery should recognise and reflect what is important to people and valuable \u2013 not just economic activity. These goals are not in conflict but instead are inextricably linked. Achieving them requires and provides an opportunity to rethink an economy that doesn\u2019t work for so many across the country or for future generations. We estimate that close to a million good jobs could be created in this new, green economy, with many more if we choose to invest in our social care system. Talking about and targeting the \u201ceconomy\u201d as an abstraction masks the underlying shape and nature of the activity taking place underneath. It means we miss people: who loses out, and who benefits from the status quo being restored. Lockdown has found us in a collective moment of reimagining, but this will not last for ever: we should use it to ask what economic activity we want to rebuild, and what we could do without. \u2022 Carys Roberts is executive director of the Institute for Public Policy Research.

      "bodyText": "Almost three-quarters of Australians believe class action lawsuits are a good thing, either because they provide compensation for people ripped off by corporate misconduct or because they keep companies honest, polling shows. The polling, conducted for class action law firm Maurice Blackburn by Essential last week, also reveals that despite heavy campaigning by the business lobby and sections of the media, a similar proportion of Australians believe laws governing whether class actions can be launched should either be loosened or are about right. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has launched two salvos against class actions in the past fortnight by announcing litigation funders are to require a licence and using emergency coronavirus powers to water down rules governing what companies have to tell the stock market. Litigation funding and class actions are also to be probed by a parliamentary committee chaired by the Victorian Liberal senator James Paterson. Business groups have also raised concerns about moves in Victoria to allow law firms to charge contingency fees if they win, a move that would let them bypass litigation funders and instead take the risk of running class action lawsuits on to their own balance sheets. According to Essential, 42% of people agreed that class actions were \u201cgood for the economy because they keep big business and government honest and accountable\u201d and another 30% said they were good for \u201cshareholders and workers because they get compensated when someone does the wrong thing\u201d. Just 11% agreed that they were \u201cbad for the economy overall because they make life too hard for businesses and governments that do the right thing\u201d while 17% agreed that \u201cclass actions are unfair because lawyers make too much money when they win a case\u201d. Asked whether laws governing class actions should be tightened or loosened, 36% said it should be made easier to launch them, 43% said the current laws were about right and 20% said it should be made harder to sue a company or government as part of a class action. Attacks on class actions also appear to have little purchase with Coalition voters, with 67% of Liberal or National voters saying they were a good thing. Victorian legislation allowing law firms to charge contingency fees is currently before the state\u2019s upper house, where it will be supported by crucial crossbencher Rod Barton, of the Transport Matters Party. Barton, a former hire car driver, is himself a member of a class action Maurice Blackburn is running against Uber that has been bankrolled by a litigation funder. \u201cIf it gets through and we were bringing our class action now, those 7,000 registrants would be better off,\u201d he told an Australia at Home online forum on Wednesday. He said he expected the litigation funder would take between 25% and 30% of any winnings, while Maurice Blackburn\u2019s costs would eat up another 10%. \u201cIf we were in the new system, if it gets up, if Maurice Blackburn had a fair contingency fee of 25%, 75% would go to those registrants, those people who have been wronged,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist and the architect of its light-touch approach to the coronavirus has acknowledged that the country has had too many deaths from Covid-19 and should have done more to curb the spread of the virus. Anders Tegnell, who has previously criticised other countries\u2019 strict lockdowns as not sustainable in the long run, told Swedish Radio on Wednesday that there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement in what we have done\u201d in Sweden. Asked whether too many people in Sweden had died, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d adding that the country would \u201chave to consider in the future whether there was a way of preventing\u201d such a high toll. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita was the highest in the world over the seven days to 2 June, figures suggest. This week the government bowed to mounting opposition pressure and promised to set up a commission to look into its Covid-19 strategy. \u201cIf we were to encounter the same disease again knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would settle on doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,\u201d Tegnell said. It would be \u201cgood to know exactly what to shut down to curb the spread of infection better\u201d, he added. In an interview with the Dagens Nyheter daily, Tegnell subsequently said he still believed \u201cthe basic strategy has worked well. I do not see what we would have done completely differently \u2026 Based on the knowledge we had then, we feel we made the appropriate decisions.\u201d According to the scientific online publication Ourworldindata.com, the number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Sweden was the highest in the world in a rolling seven-day average to 2 June. The country\u2019s rate of 5.29 deaths per million inhabitants a day was well above the UK\u2019s 4.48. The Swedish prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, told the Aftonbladet daily that the country\u2019s overall approach \u201chas been right\u201d, but it had failed to protect care homes where half of all Sweden\u2019s Covid-19 deaths have occurred. Social affairs minister Lena Hallengren told Reuters the government had been \u201cat all times prepared to introduce wider, further measures recommended by the expert authority\u201d. Relying on its citizens\u2019 sense of civic duty, Sweden closed schools for all over-16s and banned gatherings of more than 50, but only asked \u2013 rather than ordered \u2013 people to avoid non-essential travel and not to go out if they were elderly or ill. Shops, restaurants and gyms have remained open. Although there are signs that public opinion is starting to shift, polls have shown a considerable majority of Swedes support and have generally complied with the government\u2019s less coercive strategy, which is in stark contrast to the mandatory lockdowns imposed by many countries, including Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours. But the policy, which Tegnell has said was aimed not at achieving herd immunity but at slowing the spread of the virus enough for health services to cope, has been increasingly and heavily criticised by many Swedish experts as the country\u2019s death toll has increased. Sweden\u2019s 4,468 fatalities from Covid-19 represent a death toll of 449 per million inhabitants, compared with 45 in Norway, 100 in Denmark and 58 in Finland. Its per-million tally remains lower than the corresponding figures of 555, 581 and 593 in Italy, Spain and the UK respectively. Norway and Denmark announced last week that they were dropping mutual border controls but would provisionally exclude Sweden from a Nordic \u201ctravel bubble\u201d because of its much higher coronavirus infection rate. Tegnell told Swedish Radio it was not clear yet exactly what the country should have done differently, or whether the restrictions it did impose should have been introduced simultaneously rather than step by step. \u201cOther countries started with a lot of measures all at once. The problem with that is that you don\u2019t really know which of the measures you have taken is most effective,\u201d he said, adding that conclusions would have to be drawn about \u201cwhat else, besides what we did, you could do without imposing a total shutdown.\u201d Annike Linde, Tegnell\u2019s predecessor as chief epidemiologist from 2005 to 2013, said last week that she had initially backed the country\u2019s strategy but had begun to reassess her view as the virus swept through the elderly population. \u201cThere was no strategy at all for the elderly, I now understand,\u201d Linde told the Swedish state broadcaster. \u201cI do not understand how they can stand and say the level of preparedness was good, when in fact it was lousy.\u201d She said another key mistake was to assume that the coronavirus would behave like seasonal flu. \u201cIt does not behave like the flu at all,\u201d she said. \u201cIt spreads more slowly and has a longer incubation time. This makes it more difficult to detect, and to build immunity in the population.\u201d A study last month found that only 7.3% of Stockholm\u2019s inhabitants had developed Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.",

      "bodyText": "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Matos Pinto was young, gifted and black, and he died last month with an assault rifle shot to his back. \u201cHe had dreams. He wanted to be a top lawyer,\u201d said Neilton da Costa Pinto, the father of the Brazilian teenager, whose shooting during a botched police raid has drawn comparisons to the killing of George Floyd, 9,000km north in Minneapolis. \u201cHe always used to say: \u2018Dad, one day I\u2019ll make you proud\u2019,\u201d remembered Pinto, a driver from S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, a city just east of Rio. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019ve no doubt about it, son.\u2019 Because he was such a dedicated boy. He really knew what he wanted in life.\u201d Jo\u00e3o Pedro, who was 14, was far from the first young black Brazilian man to meet a premature death at the hands of the police. Thousands have been killed in recent years \u2013 and 75% of the victims were black. But his killing has sparked an unusually loud public outcry, amid growing fury over an upsurge in deadly police violence that continues unabated despite a government-ordered shutdown designed to combat Covid-19. On Sunday, demonstrators will march for the second time in a week to denounce the police assaults on the favelas and what they call a state-sponsored \u201cgenocide\u201d of Brazil\u2019s black youth. \u201cThis must stop,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s father. \u201cThe police should be protecting us, not killing us.\u201d When the coronavirus quarantine was declared in mid-March activists and observers hoped police incursions into Rio\u2019s redbrick favelas might subside \u2013 and at first that seemed to be happening. \u201cIn the first 15 days of social isolation there was a sharp drop in the number of operations and armed confrontations in the city of Rio which was really welcomed \u2013 because it\u2019s not the time for this,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Oliveira, a leading black journalist and broadcaster. But by April the shooting had resumed. Rio state police killed 177 people that month alone, or one person every four hours \u2013 the second-highest tally since records began more than 20 years ago. In May, as Brazil\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose above 6,000, the repression continued, with 13 people killed in a single police raid on 15 May. Three days later, Jo\u00e3o Pedro set off for his cousin\u2019s home in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo\u2019s Complexo do Salgueiro as police prepared to storm the favela in search of drug traffickers. His aunt, Denize Roza Matos Pinto, recalls becoming increasingly agitated as she watched police helicopters hovering over the seaside community from a nearby beach where she was working. Her son and Jo\u00e3o Pedro were among six teenagers hanging out at her home and, despite the shooting, Pinto raced back hoping to protect them. Huddles of armed officers surrounded the residence, and when they finally allowed her inside she felt dread. \u201cThe front window was full of bullet holes. The television was all shot up, the sitting room, the bedroom, everything \u2026 It was horrible \u2026 the grass was burned from the grenade they\u2019d thrown,\u201d said Pinto, 42. On the floor she spotted a pool of blood where Jo\u00e3o Pedro appeared to have been shot. But there was no sign of his body which, for reasons which remain murky, had been flown 25 miles across the bay to Rio by helicopter, and was only located by the family the next day. \u201cAll I could think of was the scene of horror those children had witnessed,\u201d said Pinto as she reflected on her nephew\u2019s terrifying final minutes in a building left pockmarked with more than 70 bullet holes. Oliveira, the journalist, said she was appalled by the upswing in \u201cgratuitous, insane, excessive and asymmetric violence against a group of people who are even more defenseless than usual\u201d because of the pandemic. \u201cThe favelas are already dealing with a lack of work, income and food,\u201d she said \u2013 now they were needlessly coming under fire too. Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s killing is under investigation. Police have reportedly claimed he was caught in the crossfire as they pursued fleeing gang members. Those close to him believe he was a victim of either police malice or gross incompetence. \u201cThey used these kids for target practice,\u201d claimed Gl\u00e1ucio Ribeira, a family friend. Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s aunt \u2013 whose son, like the other four teens, emerged physically, if not mentally, unscathed \u2013 said she was certain race played a role in such bloodshed. \u201cLike it or not, there is a racial side to this \u2026 and it shouldn\u2019t be like this. We\u2019re all supposed to be equal \u2026 [But] if you\u2019re on the bus and the police get on, they\u2019ll search the people of colour first \u2026 If a black man runs, he\u2019s guilty. We\u2019re tired of seeing this kind of thing happen,\u201d she said. Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s father said: \u201cThe police need to understand that the favelas are home to good people. Decent black people. But unfortunately when they come into a community they treat us all like criminals. They are wrong.\u201d As protesters prepared to return to Brazil\u2019s streets to shout \u201cVidas negras importam\u201d (\u201cBlack lives matter\u201d), Jo\u00e3o Pedro\u2019s family was adjusting to his absence. \u201cWe\u2019re in a bad way,\u201d said his aunt. \u201cWe look at the sofa and it reminds us of him.

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

      "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. Please follow our new live blog for continuing coverage: Tens of thousands attended a memorial for George Floyd in his home town of Houston. Members of Floyd\u2019s family were in attendance, alongside the mayor, the police chief and a group of protesters on horseback, with attendees paying respects to a \u201cgentle giant\u201d Although details of each incident are still unclear, the death toll from the protests in the US has reached at least 11. Protests in Washington were responded to more peacefully than in recent days, however, the capital remains on high alert, with about 1,600 US soldiers moved to the DC region, according to the Pentagon. Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), has written for the Guardian saying: \u201cThe expendability of Black lives is not a flaw in the system; it is the system. We are meant to die or, at the very least, we are not meant to be protected, to be respected, to be valued, to be considered fully human. The NFL has been accused of hypocrisy with its public anti-racism statements after the high profile treatment of Colin Kaepernick\u2019s protests. Inspired by the US demonstrations, 20,000 people defy a ban to rally in the streets of French capital Paris, with a focus on justice for Adama Traore, whose death four years ago has been a rallying cause against police brutality in France. The US Park Police (USPP) has defended its forceful clearing of protesters for a controversial Trump photo-op on Monday. In a statement, the agency accused \u201cviolent protestors\u201d of \u201cthrowing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles and caustic liquids\u201d. It denied that tear gas was used and said officers instead \u201cemployed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls\u201d. The statement does not tally with multiple reports on the ground that day. This nearly-two hour video from Reuters shows a peaceful protest pushed back. An investigative reporter in DC, Nathan Baca, also picked up a canister at the scene that does appear to cause irritation. Germany\u2019s foreign minister has criticised Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use the US military against protesters in his own country, saying \u201cdemocrats must never escalate \u2013 even with their words\u201d. \u201cInstead of pouring oil into the fire, we should seek reconciliation\u201d, Heiko Maas told Der Spiegel news website. \u201cInstead of allowing ourselves to be divided, we should stand shoulder to shoulder against radical extremists.\u201d Earlier in the week, the Social Democrat politician had described the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police as \u201ccruel and shocking\u201d. One remarkable aspect of these protests has been images of both police and officials \u201ctaking the knee\u201d at demonstrations. The latest high-profile person to do so was Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who knelt with a crowd outside a police headquarters. As demonstrators yelled that the city\u2019s law enforcement budget should be cut, the mayor told demonstrators: \u201cI hear you. I hear what you are saying about the police.\u201d No doubt these actions are hugely symbolic \u2013 they stem from athletes, notably NFL star Colin Kaepernick, kneeling during the national anthem in 2016 to protest police brutality. Trump and his supporters have painted those taking the knee as unpatriotic. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was moved by seeing NYPD Chief of Department Terry Monahan take the knee (video below): Blasio tweeted about it, saying: \u201cMoments like that are how I know we will find a way through.\u201d However, it is unclear what effect these actions of some police and public figures will have on protesters, who want to end systemic and institutionalised racism \u2013 rather than simply convince individuals. For example, in Los Angeles, after Garcetti\u2019s knelt, hundreds still gathered outside his house and protested. For those of you just joining us after a news break, it\u2019s worth taking a look this photo of camouflaged and masked US troops at the Lincoln Memorial in the capital. No doubt this picture, taken on Tuesday evening, will become one of the many defining images of the protest movement. Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), has written a very blunt piece in the Guardian, which is worth reading in full but here\u2019s an extract: The expendability of Black lives is not a flaw in the system; it is the system. We are meant to die or, at the very least, we are not meant to be protected, to be respected, to be valued, to be considered fully human. That is how racism works, and it has operated efficiently throughout American history. It is no accident that we disproportionately work in the lowest paying jobs, and live in communities where the water is unsafe to drink and the air unfit to breathe, where polluters ply their trades, where schools are starved of resources, where green space or even a grocery store can be hard to find. All of this has led us to a new statistic on dying: we are 3.5 times more likely to die of Covid-19 than white people. Although Black people are only 13% of the population, we constitute about twice that percentage of US coronavirus cases. This is not because the coronavirus seeks us by color; it is because we suffer from an underlying condition. For the column, click below: Protesters in Seattle can be clearly heard in this video shouting, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot\u201d. Footage posted by Shauna Sowersby, a local reporter and photographer, on Twitter. It is after midnight now in the city. More from Seattle: Protesters are running away from police, according to a Seattle Times reporter at the scene. Good day/night, Oliver Holmes here again, blogging deep into the night across the US. I\u2019m logging on as police in Seattle have begun dispersing protests there, which had apparently been peaceful all day. Casey Martin, an NPR reporter, is tweeting from the city, where he says protests dwindled in size over the evening before police started using pepper spray and flashbacks. The crowds threw water bottles. Earlier, Martin had filmed a large group of marchers: We will keep following. As always, please do get in contact with me if you think something is worth sharing, and also for any questions or feedback. You can reach me via Twitter or on email: oliver.holmes [at] theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you for following along and, as always for the tips and feedback on Twitter and via email. My colleague Oliver Holmes is picking up the live coverage \u2013 as we\u2019re hearing more reports of police dispersing protestors in Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington. Police are dispersing crowds in Portland using teargas, the Oregonian reports: Arial footage from KATU ABC 2 news: The District of Colombia National Guard is investigating the use of helicopters that flew over protesters in Washington, DC yesterday in what appeared to be an attempt to disperse the crowds. The DCNG announced in a statement on its website: DCNG is conducting an investigation into the June 1 low-flying maneuvers by its helicopters to ensure all involved complied with applicable procedures and safety regulations. ... As part of the investigation, the DCNG is looking into the use of the medical evacuation helicopter as part of the Joint Task Force DC operation. In the announcement, DCNG commanding general William J Walker is quoted as saying, \u201cI hold all members of the District of Columbia National Guard to the highest of standards. We live and work in the District, and we are dedicated to the service of our nation,\u201d \u201cI have directed an immediate investigation into the June 1 incident.\u201d Here is the video of that incident: New York City police officers surrounded, shoved and yelled expletives at two Associated Press journalists covering protests Tuesday in the latest aggression against members of the media during a week of unrest around the country, AP reports. Portions of the incident were captured on video by videojournalist Robert Bumsted, who was working with photographer Maye-E Wong to document the protests in lower Manhattan over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The video shows more than a half-dozen officers confronting the journalists as they filmed and took photographs of police ordering protesters to leave the area near Fulton and Broadway shortly after an 8pm curfew took effect. Both journalists were wearing AP identification and identified themselves as media. NYPD officials said they would review the incident as soon as possible. Journalists have faced aggressive police and protesters during demonstrations across the US over the killing of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck. Here is the full story on the Paris protests inspired by demonstrations in the US: Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence, AP reports. The protesters used slogans from the American protest movement to call for justice for Adama Traore, whose death four years ago has been a rallying cause against police brutality in France. The demonstration, which came after the release of two differing medical reports into the cause of Traore\u2019s death, had been prohibited by police citing a coronavirus ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. The Huffington Post reports that Native American democrat Paulette Jordan has won the Idaho Senate Primary. Should she win in November, she will be the state\u2019s first female and first indigenous US senator: It\u2019s a long-shot effort by Jordan in deep red Idaho, but if anything, the race will be a fascinating study in contrasts between her and Risch, who could not be more different. Jordan, 40, is a Native American progressive Democrat who would be the state\u2019s first female and first indigenous U.S. senator if she pulls off a win in November. Her priorities are strengthening health care and protecting public lands, and she is a forceful advocate of LGBTQ rights and women\u2019s reproductive rights. She was previously a two-term state legislator \u2015 she defeated a Republican for the seat \u2015 and the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 2018. She is not rich. She believes in science. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The Washington Post\u2019s Rebecca Tan reports that, after a relatively peaceful day of demonstrations, law enforcement \u201chave started firing pepper balls and chemical agents at the small group of remaining protestors\u201d near the White House: Protests in memory of George Floyd\u2019s death, and against police brutality in the US as well as other countries, have sprung up around the world. Here are just a few. In Paris, France, clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of Adama Traore while in police custody in Paris, galvanised by the US demonstrations: Liverpool, UK: Sydney, Australia: Nairobi, Kenya: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: The fence surrounding the White House, erected in the wake of the protests, has been decorated, New York Magazine\u2019s White House Correspondent Olivia Nuzzi reports: Other protestors have tried to tear down the fence, Nuzzi tweeted: Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news from across the country for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch on Twitter with questions, feedback, and, of course, news from wherever you are. I\u2019m @helenrsullivan. Alternatively, send me an email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com The US army was poised at the outskirts of DC, and approximately 1,600 troops were moved to the region, per the Pentagon. The military will not be engaging in law enforcement, a spokesperson for the Pentagon said. The president has threatened to deploy military \u2014 in order to do so, he would have to invoke a Civil War-era act. Protests continued in DC and across the country \u2014 from Los Angeles to Portland to Minneapolis to New York. Thousands defied curfews to protest against police brutality. There were elections in eight states and Washington DC. It was another big test of vote by mail, with many states expanding absentee voting options, though many Americans did line up to cast ballots in person today. The controversial Iowa Republican congressman Steve King was been ousted in Tuesday\u2019s primary, losing his re-election race to the state senator Randy Feenstra. King previously questioned why white nationalism was offensive and was ousted from committee positions in Congress following racist comments. But Feenstra\u2019s policy platform, which emphasizes a hard line against immigration, is not so different from King\u2019s. The use of low-flying helicopters, one of which was printed with the Red Cross logo, against protestors in DC is being investigated by the National Guard. An amped law enforcement presence and the use of aggressive tactics against protestors in the nation\u2019s capital and across the country are being widely criticized. Attorney general William Barr personally ordered the expansion of the perimeter outside the White House, resulting in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters, according to a new report. The Washington Post reported that Barr called for the protesters to be moved moments before Trump spoke at the White House yesterday. The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in response to the killing of George Floyd. The state cited \u201cunlawful race-based policing\u201d in the charge, which was announced by governor Tim Walz at a press conference this afternoon. Joe Biden sharply criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the protests in a Philadelphia speech. \u201cThe president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis president today is part of the problem and accelerates it.\u201d The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is also expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. The archdiocese of Washington said it was \u201cbaffling and reprehensible\u201d to allow Trump to visit the Saint John Paul II National Shrine today. As Trump traveled to the Washington site, which is run by the Knights of Columbus, Archbishop Wilton Gregory said in a statement, \u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.\u201d Trump said the RNC will seek a new venue after the governor of North Carolina told Republicans they should prepare for a \u201cscaled-down convention\u201d due to coronavirus. \u201cThe people of North Carolina do not know what the status of COVID-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,\u201d Cooper said in a letter to the top convention organizer and the RNC chairwoman. From my colleague Daniel Strauss: The controversial Iowa Republican congressman Steve King has been ousted in Tuesday\u2019s primary, losing his re-election race to the state senator Randy Feenstra. King had faced the re-election fight of his life. The nine-term conservative congressman, who was repeatedly reprimanded by leaders in his own party for racist rhetoric and interactions with white nationalists, found himself in a nightmare situation for an incumbent congressman. He had been stripped of his committee assignments, abandoned by more mainstream Republicans and chastised by party leadership. He had even lost support from prominent conservatives in Iowa. Feenstra declared victory on Tuesday evening, promising he\u2019d deliver \u201cresults for the families, farmers and communities of Iowa\u201d. Thousands in Portland marched onto the Burnside Bridge. Once there, they lay face down with their hands behind their backs \u2014 symbolizing the restraint that officers used on George Floyd before he was killed, the Oregonian reports. Medical students in lab coats, carrying signs that read \u201cWhite Coats for Black Lives\u201d assembled in Portland\u2019s Pioneer Square and Caesar The No Drama Llama also reportedly turned up in solidarity. More election results: Steny Hoyer, the House majority leader, won an easy nomination in the Democratic primary of Maryland\u2019s 5th district. He\u2019s held the seat for 40 years. Yvette Herrell won the Republican primary in New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District \u2014 she\u2019ll take on on Xochitl Torres Small in November. Joe Biden handily won the primaries in Indiana, Idaho, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and South Dakota. With all his Democratic opponents out of the race, no surprise there. The Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao reports from Brooklyn: Thousands of people were blockaded on Manhattan Bridge, as the protests against police brutality led past the 8 pm curfew. With police on both ends of the bridge, protestors from Brooklyn said they waited at the barricades for more than two hours to try to enter Manhattan. \u201cThey [the NYPD] promised to let us through and told us 10 minutes,\u201d said one Brooklyn resident who asked not to be identified. \u201cBut then time passed and all they did was get lots of NYPD trucks. Their promise was not to let us through but to manipulate citizens for no reason.\u201d As protestors waited, wondering if they would be arrested and how they would get home, posts on social media started to appear online. The Brooklyn Bridge, which also connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, was barricaded as well. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that the situation was unsafe, and that she was coming to the scene. Mayor De Blasio also visited the Barclays Center, where many of the week\u2019s protests have originated, and said it was a calm situation. At around 11 pm the protestors from Brooklyn decided to turn around and walk back. \u201cIt was an incredibly peaceful protest, no one did anything divisive or provocative,\u201d said Hannah Jayanti, a Brooklyn resident who had taken her bicycle to the protest to help create a barrier between the police and protestors. At midnight, there were still protestors stuck in either borough attempting to get home. The AP has not yet called the election, though King is lagging behind in the Republican primary to represent Iowa\u2019s fourth district. His loss in this election will cap his controversial 9-year stint in Congress. State senator Randy Feenstra put out a statement claiming victory. During the campaign, Feenstra attacked King\u2019s inability to govern after he was barred from House committees for his racist rhetoric. Feenstra\u2019s platform is otherwise quite similar to King\u2019s \u2014 and includes hardline anti-immigration policies. Councilwoman Ella Jones was elected mayor of Ferguson, becoming the first African American and first woman to lead the city. In August 2014, the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, a black teenager, in Ferguson sparked nationwide protests against police brutality. When the St. Louis County prosecutor announced that a grand jury decided not to indict Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot 12 rounds at Brown, another round of protests began. Jones has said she will continue to implement changes to address the policing issues to sparked the 2014 protests. In Los Angeles, thousands took to the streets. Mayor Eric Garcetti took a knee with protestors, even as crowds chanted, \u201cdefund the police\u201d. Los Angeles County was under a sweeping curfew, and activist organizing demonstrations today kept plans quiet to avoid tipping off police. LAPD Chief Michel Moore said at a news conference yesterday looters over the weekend were \u201ccapitalizing\u201d on the death of George Floyd.\u201cWe didn\u2019t have protests last night \u2014 we had criminal acts,\u201d he said, \u201cHis death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\u201d Moore apologized minutes later, saying he \u201cmisspoke\u201d. Protestors today chanted, \u201cFire Michel Moore! Fire Michel Moore!\u201d In New York, thousands of protesters defied curfew and remained on the streets, as officers began making arrests. The police blocked off crowds making their way from Brooklyn across the Manhattan Bridge. There was an officer-involved shooting in which no officers were injured, according to the NYPD, which provided no further detail. The force has been criticized for its aggressive tactics and use of force against protestors through the weekend and on Monday. The city\u2019s Democratic mayor and New York\u2019s Democratic governor have faced pressure from the president to put a stop to vandalism and looting during the demonstrations. \u201cThe NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,\u201d Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. \u201cLook at the videos. It was a disgrace.\u201d Cuomo, who has often clashed with Mayor Bill De Blasio, brought up the possibility of deploying the national guard over the mayor\u2019s objections. Even as protests rage on, eight states and Washington DC are holding elections today. It\u2019ll be another big test of vote by mail, with many states expanding absentee voting options, though many Americans did line up to cast ballots in person today. Polls have closed in Iowa, where Republican Steve King, the conservative congressman who has been abandoned by the Republican establishment over his racist rhetoric and interaction with white nationalists, is up for re-election. King has trailed in the polls, but may still have a chance as the incumbent. The FBI found no indication of antifa involvement in Sunday\u2019s violence, according to reporting in the Nation. In documents leaked to the Nation\u2019s Ken Klippenstein, the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office indicated it had \u201chas no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence\u201d in the violence that occurred in DC. Read on: That same day, President Donald Trump announced on Twitter that he would designate \u201cAntifa\u201d a terrorist organization, even though the government has no existing authority to declare a domestic group a terrorist organization, and antifa is not an organized group. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement, \u201cThe violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly.\u201d The FBI report, however, states that \u201cbased on CHS [Confidential Human Source] canvassing, open source/social media partner engagement, and liaison, FBI WFO has no intelligence indicating Antifa involvement/presence.\u201d The statement followed a list of violent acts like throwing bricks at police and the discovery of a backpack containing explosive materials, which were flagged by the FBI under a \u201cKey Updates\u201d section of the report. Shooting reported in Brooklyn WABC reports that at least five people were injured during a shooting in Brooklyn on Tuesday evening. The injured reportedly include two NYPD officers. Police told the station that all five people were taken to local hospitals. About 1,600 US army troops were moved to the DC region, according to the Pentagon. \u201cActive duty elements are postured on military bases in the National Capitol Region but are not in Washington DC,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Rath Hoffman said in a statement. The troops \u201care not participating in defense support to civil authority operations\u201d, Hoffman said. The president would have to invoke the Insurrection Act in order to deploy the US military to suppress civil disorder inside the US. Even though the troops are not acting as law enforcement, their presence has had a chilling effect on protesters. The stationing of troops and the military tactics used against protesters in DC have drawn criticism. Yesterday, low-flying helicopters snapped tree branches and frightened demonstrators with a deafening roar. One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press. Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled. The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. More than a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the open door of a helicopter flying low over the commercial district. A military chopper buzzed a crowd of demonstrators so close to the ground they were buffeted around by the wind from the rotor, a dispersal technique learned in counter-insurgencies abroad. On Monday, an entirely peaceful protest was driven out of a city square in front of the White House with teargas, baton charges and mounted police, so Trump could pose in front of a church with a Bible. A priest and a seminarian, who had been distributing water and hand sanitizer to protesters from the steps of St John\u2019s Episcopal, were driven away by police with helmets and riot shields to create an uncluttered tableau. A Bible was procured for Trump from inside the church for him to hold aloft. Journalists asked if it was his Bible. \u201cIt\u2019s a Bible,\u201d he replied. The rate of fresh affronts has often outpaced the capacity to digest \u2013 or even describe \u2013 them. Peaceful protesters, journalists, a young African American man pleading for mutual understanding, shop owners, residents are being targeted for arbitrary arrest or police beatings or both \u2013 especially if they are black. Here\u2019s a view of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC this evening: A former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Mike Mullen, condemned the use of force against protestors in order to clear the way for a photo op. In an op-ed published by The Atlantic, Mullen, who served as the highest-ranking military officer in the country from 2001 to 2011, wrote: It sickened me yesterday to see security personnel\u2014including members of the National Guard\u2014forcibly and violently clear a path through Lafayette Square to accommodate the president\u2019s visit outside St. John\u2019s Church. I have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump\u2019s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent. Whatever Trump\u2019s goal in conducting his visit, he laid bare his disdain for the rights of peaceful protest in this country, gave succor to the leaders of other countries who take comfort in our domestic strife, and risked further politicizing the men and women of our armed forces. There was little good in the stunt. While no one should ever condone the violence, vandalism, and looting that has exploded across our city streets, neither should anyone lose sight of the larger and deeper concerns about institutional racism that have ignited this rage. Donald Trump has tweeted that Republicans are seeking a new venue for the Republican national convention, after initial considering North Carolina. Earlier, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper wrote it was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that the state could permit a packed convention in Charlotte this summer. \u201cThe people of North Carolina do not know what the status of COVID-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,\u201d Cooper wrote to Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel. Opinion: In 1919, the state failed to protect black Americans. A century later, it\u2019s still failing Carol Anderson, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the Red Summer. The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and praised the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson had been silent while whites slaughtered African Americans in East St Louis in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale. When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt. More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice. Instead, he sounds much like his ancient predecessor, A Mitchell Palmer. A former undersecretary of defense, James Miller, condemned the president and the defense secretary for using force against protesters in his resignation letter from the Defense Science Board. The Washington Post published Miller\u2019s resignation letter to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. In it, Miller said that Trump\u2019s decision to clear protesters with force in order to pose for a photo \u201cviolated his oath to \u2018take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\u2019 as well as the First Amendment \u2018right of the people peaceably to assemble.\u2019\u201d Miller wrote: When I joined the Board in early 2014, after leaving government service as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, I again swore an oath of office, one familiar to you, that includes the commitment to \u201csupport and defend the Constitution of the United States . . . and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\u201d You recited that same oath on July 23, 2019, when you were sworn in as Secretary of Defense. On Monday, June 1, 2020, I believe that you violated that oath. Law-abiding protesters just outside the White House were dispersed using tear gas and rubber bullets \u2014 not for the sake of safety, but to clear a path for a presidential photo op. You then accompanied President Trump in walking from the White House to St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church for that photo. President Trump\u2019s actions Monday night violated his oath to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed,\u201d as well as the First Amendment \u201cright of the people peaceably to assemble.\u201d You may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it. Instead, you visibly supported it. In Seattle, Mayor Jenny Durkan spoke with protesters and promised to meet organizers tomorrow afternoon to create a plan for reform. Police chief Carmen Best spoke to the crowd as well. \u201cI understand the hurt and the anger that everyone feels, especially after the death of George Floyd,\u201d she said, according to the Seattle Times. \u201cAs a black woman, I feel the same pain you feel and just because I wear the uniform, that doesn\u2019t change that.\u201d But the city\u2019s aggressive tactics against protesters drew criticism after videos of police escalating tensions, spraying chemical agents and deploying flash-bang grenades circulated social media. Mark Zuckerberg is standing by his decision to allow Donald Trump to threaten violence against George Floyd protesters on the platform despite harsh criticism from civil rights leaders and public dissent from his own employees, including a public resignation. In a video conference with staff on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said that his decision to not remove Trump\u2019s warning on social media on Friday that \u201cwhen the looting starts the shooting start\u201d was \u201ctough\u201d but \u201cpretty thorough\u201d, the New York Times reported. The company usually holds an all-staff meeting on Thursdays, but the session was moved up to address growing discontent among employees, hundreds of whom staged a \u201cwalkout\u201d on Monday by requesting time off. \u201cI knew that I would have to separate out my personal opinion,\u201d he told employees, according to the report. \u201cKnowing that when we made this decision we made, it was going to lead to a lot of people upset inside the company, and the media criticism we were going to get.\u201d Anger at Facebook has only grown since Zuckerberg announced on Friday evening that the platform would not to take any action against Trump\u2019s post, which quoted a racist 1960s police chief. Twitter deemed a tweet with the same language dangerous and chose to hide it behind a warning label \u201cin the interest of preventing others from being inspired to commit violent acts\u201d. But though Zuckerberg acknowledged the statement\u2019s racist historical antecedent, he said that the company has a policy of allowing state actors to warn the public about the use of force. This reasoning has garnered scorn from US civil rights leaders, three of whom spoke with Zuckerberg and his top lieutenant Sheryl Sandberg on Monday evening. \u201cWe are disappointed and stunned by Mark\u2019s incomprehensible explanations,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robinson \u2013 heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Color of Change \u2013 in a joint statement. \u201cHe did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump\u2019s call for violence against protesters,\u201d the added. \u201cMark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.\u201d Zuckerberg has also faced continued public criticism from employees \u2013 a highly unusual occurrence for the company. \u201cIt\u2019s crystal clear today that leadership refuses to stand with us,\u201d the engineer Brandon Dail tweeted Tuesday. Representative Will Hurd, a Republican of Texas and the only black Republican in the House of Representatives, is participating in the protests in Houston. While most protesters have marched against police brutality and racist policing, a few have turned up on horseback. In Houston, members of an urban trail riding club drew cheers as they rode in and raised their fists. At least one of the demonstrators was wearing a shirt that read \u201cBlack Cowboys Matter.\u201d Earlier today, my colleague Aben\u00e9 Clayton interviewed Brianna Noble, who rode her horse into the George Floyd protest in Oakland on Friday: Noble hadn\u2019t planned to ride her horse, Dapper Dan, into the center of Friday evening\u2019s protests in the city of Oakland. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a very planned thing,\u201d the 25 year-old Bay Area native told the Guardian. \u201cI was just pissed, sitting at home and seeing the video of George Floyd. I felt helpless and thought to myself: \u2018I\u2019m just another protester if I go down there alone, but no one can ignore a black woman sitting on top of a horse.\u2019\u201d \u201cI know that what makes headlines is breaking windows and people smashing things,\u201d Noble said. \u201cSo I thought: \u2018Let\u2019s go out and give the media something to look at that is positive and change the narrative.\u2019\u201d Noble, who trains feral and wild horses, also works to change narratives in the equestrian world which, in California, is majority white and has a high financial barrier to entry. She hopes that, in addition to contributing to the movement against police brutality toward black and brown people, she will become the first black woman to do horse jumping in the Olympics and bring low-income kids into the horse community. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be known for just walking down Broadway one time,\u201d Noble said. \u201cI want to make a lasting impact in my community for black and brown people. \u201cWhen you\u2019re black it doesn\u2019t matter how loud you scream or how deep your words are, nobody would listen,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo to now have found this amazing pedestal \u2013 my horse Dapper Dan to sit upon \u2013 and not have to say a word is amazing.\u201d A curfew is now in effect in New York City - a curfew which hundreds of anti-police violence protesters are defying. Hundreds of people were still gathered outside Trump International hotel, at the south-east corner of Central Park, at 8pm. Protesters are now walking north from the hotel, many shouting: \u201cFuck your curfew.\u201d It\u2019s going to be a difficult journey home for many, as ride-sharing services and even CitiBikes have ceased operating. Police vans began massing close to the Trump hotel before 8pm, but as the curfew came in officers were yet to take action. This post was amended on Tuesday 2 June. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the subway had stopped running. In Dallas, protesters are dispersing ahead of curfew, according to local reporters. Minneapolis public schools are terminating their contract with the city\u2019s police department following the death of George Floyd. The city\u2019s public school board unanimously approved a resolution on Tuesday night that will end the district\u2019s contract with the Minneapolis police department to use officers to provide school security. The Minneapolis superintendent said he would begin work on an alternative plan to keep the district\u2019s more than 35,000 students safe in the coming school year. \u201cWe cannot continue to be in partnership with an organization that has the culture of violence and racism that the Minneapolis police department has historically demonstrated,\u201d Nelson Inz, one of the school board members, said. \u201cWe have to stand in solidarity with our black students.\u201d While the vote does not bring justice for Floyd, \u201cit will show that meaningful change is possible,\u201d Nathaniel Genene, the school board\u2019s student representative, said. Genene said an online survey of Minneapolis students had received more than 1,500 responses, and about 90% of them supported terminating the district\u2019s contract with the police. Here\u2019s Donald Trump\u2019s latest. Protesters, clergy members and journalists confronted by teargas, rubber bullets and other aggressive policing tactics yesterday might disagree with the president\u2019s statement. The Drug Enforcement Administration has been granted authority to conduct surveillance of protestors, according to a report from Buzzfeed News: The Drug Enforcement Administration has been granted sweeping new authority to \u201cconduct covert surveillance\u201d and collect intelligence on people participating in protests over the murder of George Floyd, according to a two-page memorandum obtained by BuzzFeed News. Floyd\u2019s death \u201chas spawned widespread protests across the nation, which, in some instances, have included violence and looting,\u201d said the DEA memo. \u201cPolice agencies in certain areas of the country have struggled to maintain and/or restore order.\u201d The memo requests the extraordinary powers on a temporary basis, and on Sunday afternoon a senior Justice Department official signed off. Federal agencies have conducted surveillance of protest groups before - in 2015, the Department of Homeland Security monitored activists on Twitter. The FBI monitored Occupy Wall Street protesters in 2011. And of course, antiwar protesters were heavily monitored during the 1960s and 70s. The Guardian has not yet independently verified BuzzFeed\u2019s reporting. Protests in New York continue Hundreds of US cities have set curfews this evening, but as 7pm passed on the east coast many rallies showed no sign of slowing down. In New York, where a curfew is set to start at 8pm, thousands of people were marching to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. A separate group filled Union Square in Manhattan. In Washington, DC, protests have continued despite an amplified policing and military presence. Tens of thousands gathered on Tuesday evening and stayed out past the 7pm curfew. Demonstrators set up aid stations, handing out water and other supplies. Many came prepped with masks and goggles to shield them against teargas and pepper spray. US troops from the 82nd airborne division have been moved from their base in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to the outskirts of Washington DC, according to multiple reports from unnamed defense department officials. Around 700 members of the 82nd are now poised at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland and Fort Belvoir in Virginia, the Associated Press reports. Joint Base Andrews is where Air Force One takes off when the president goes on trips and is minutes from the White House, just outside the boundary of the capital. In addition, 1,400 more soldiers are ready to be mobilized within an hour, AP writes, according to two defense department officials, who are not named. The soldiers are armed and have riot gear, and they also have bayonets, the agency reports. It is not clear if this is (almost literal) saber-rattling from the president, who has been talking hardline on law and order, displaying hardware in order to intimidate protesters, or if those troops will really be seen on the streets of Washington. The president has the jurisdiction to send US troops into the federal capital pretty freely, without invoking legislation or seeking permission as would be the case with a state. The New York Times reported that US army helicopters buzzed the District last night at rooftop level in a deafening, blasting \u201cshow of force\u201d that scattered protesters. This was not long after peaceful protesters were violently swept from outside the White House by police, so that Donald Trump could stage a photo opportunity outside the nearby St John\u2019s \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d. The NYT also informed its readers that: The nation\u2019s capital is the one jurisdiction where the Army can deploy without needing approval from a governor. So President Trump, declaring that \u201cthe destruction of peaceful life and the spilling of blood is against humanity and God,\u201d ordered the Army to deploy an active-duty military police battalion for Washington. Here\u2019s the latest tally of press freedom violations during the demonstrations against police brutality, from the US Press Freedom Tracker: Elizabeth Warren is among the demonstrators at the White House protest, along with her husband and dog, according to reporters at the scene. Hundreds of US cities have imposed curfews to keep the peace during a week of large scale peaceful protest but also volatility and patches of violent unrest - with examples of aggressive over-policing of some demonstrations and under-policing of some outbreaks of looting. Mandated curfew is a tactic that gives law enforcement sweeping arrest powers but is frequently flouted and criticized as being unconstitutional, the Associated Press points out. From New York City to Fargo, North Dakota, cities large and small have put curfews in place, in some cases for the first time in decades, sending out emergency notices on phones and highway signs urging people to stay off the streets. But the deadlines aren\u2019t hard and fast many of them have exceptions for people heading to and from work, reporters, public transportation and even people buying groceries. Many protesters and citizens have routinely disregarded the restrictions, and police have allowed peaceful demonstrations to continue after curfew while focusing their attention on outbreaks of chaos or violence. A curfew allows police the ability without any other reason to threaten to arrest or detain crowds of protesters that linger or groups that appear to be a danger to order. New York City put in place a large-scale curfew for what appeared to be the first time in nearly 80 years this week as groups vandalized buildings and stole from stores. The curfew was originally 11 pm, but Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled it back to 8 pm, before the sun goes down. \u201cIf you choose to protest today, do it in the daytime hours and then please go home because we have work to do to keep a peaceful city,\u201d de Blasio said. Curfews have been installed in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Detroit, Denver. Philadelphia and hundreds of other cities and communities large and small, coast to coast and north to south across the country. In northern California, Sacramento city councilman Steve Hansen said the city\u2019s 8pm curfew \u201creally is to keep people from coming sort of to gawk at what\u2019s going on and keep the looky-loos away.\u201d The curfews also come on the heels of lockdowns and stay-at-home orders imposed during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In Paris, some 20,000 people defied a ban on large gatherings to protest against police brutality. Law enforcement used tear gas and rubber bullets against demonstrators, who set up burning barricades. The death of Adama Traor\u00e9 in 2016 was a rallying cry \u2014 Traor\u00e9, 24, was apprehended after a dispute over an identity check. An officer testified that police pinned down Traor\u00e9 using their body weight before the young man was transported to the police station where he died. He was still handcuffed when paramedics arrived. The officers involved were exonerated. His sister, Assa Traor\u00e9, spoke at the demonstration. \u201cToday we are not just talking about the fight of the Traor\u00e9 family,\u201d she said, according to AFP. \u201cIt is the fight for everyone. When we fight for George Floyd, we fight for Adama Traor\u00e9.\u201d Gatherings of more than 10 people are currently banned in Paris, due to the pandemic. Justin Trudeau responded to a question about Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests across the US, including the issue of the US president threatening military action against demonstrators, with, at first, a 20-second-plus silence, the like of which is unusual for the Canadian prime minister, as he gathered his thoughts. Then he gave an answer that began by saying: \u201cWe all watch in horror and consternation what is going on in the United States\u201d then went on to address entrenched racial injustice in the US but also in Canada. He said: \u201cThere is systemic discrimination in Canada...it\u2019s something that many of us do not see...but it is a lived reality.\u201d This post replaces an earlier, shorter one that sought simply to draw attention to the long silence at the beginning of Trudeau\u2019s response. But that was not clear and this account aims to capture the event and the context more fully and, therefore, fairly. George Floyd\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, and her mother, Roxie Washington, just made their first public appearance at a press conference in Minneapolis. \u201cI wanted everyone to know that this is what those officers took from\u2026\u201d Washington said while holding back sobs, her daughter glancing up at her. \u201cAt the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families. Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here for my baby and I\u2019m here for George, because I want justice for him. I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks,\u201d she said, pointing down to her daughter. \u201cAnd this is the proof that he was a good man.\u201d Thousands of protesters have spent the past five hours marching north through Manhattan as protests against police brutality continue in New York City. Waving signs in support of George Floyd, people made the six mile journey from One Police Plaza, in lower Manhattan, to the Upper East Side. At 5.30pm thousands protesters filled a street close to Gracie Mansion, the official home of NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. In the past few days protests in cities across the US have been marred by violence, as police have used tear gas and force to dispel crowds. Today the police presence has been small, with officers apparently happy to let protesters take over city streets and blocks. Joe Biden is seeing a fundraising surge in the midst of nationwide protests. Biden\u2019s campaign said they noticed an uptick in donations since protests started last week. CNBC reported that fundraisers say they each raised $200,000 to $1 million for the campaign in the last few days. One fundraiser who focuses on the finance industry said he\u2019s seeing an increase of up to 35%. Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute and an associate of former FBI Director James Comey, told CNBC that he made a rare campaign donation of $2,800 \u2013 the maximum individual contribution to the campaign - because he disapproves of the way Trump is handling the protests. \u201cWe have a president who is energetically attacking and trying to destroy the professional national security apparatus of the country and under those circumstances I don\u2019t feel a stance of political neutrality is appropriate,\u201d he told CNBC. The Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump super PAC run by a group of Never-Trump Republicans, said May was its best fundraising month since the PAC was created early in the 2020 election. This is Lauren Aratani in New York taking over for Joan E Greve. A Monmouth University poll showed that nearly three quarters of Americans say the country is on the wrong track \u2013 an all-time low in the seven years the poll has been administered. When asked if the country is going in the right direction or whether it\u2019s headed off track, 74% of respondents who answered the poll May 28 through June 1 said it was heading off track. The poll also found a marked change in public opinion on racial disparities of police excessive force. A majority of Americans \u2013 57% \u2013 say that police officers facing a difficult or dangerous situation are more likely to use excessive force if the culprit is black. In comparison, when the same question was asked after the police killing of Alton Sterling in 2016, 34% of Americans said excessive force would most likely be used if the culprit is black. The number of white Americans who agreed to this has also increased to 49, up from 25% of white Americans in 2016. That\u2019s it from me today. My colleagues, Lauren Aratani and Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Attorney general William Barr personally ordered the expansion of the perimeter outside the White House, resulting in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters, according to a new report. The Washington Post reported that Barr called for the protesters to be moved moments before Trump spoke at the White House yesterday. The state of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in response to the killing of George Floyd. The state cited \u201cunlawful race-based policing\u201d in the charge, which was announced by governor Tim Walz at a press conference this afternoon. Joe Biden sharply criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the protests in a Philadelphia speech. \u201cThe president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis president today is part of the problem and accelerates it.\u201d The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee is also expected to attend Floyd\u2019s funeral next week. The archdiocese of Washington said it was \u201cbaffling and reprehensible\u201d to allow Trump to visit the Saint John Paul II National Shrine today. As Trump traveled to the Washington site, which is run by the Knights of Columbus, Archbishop Wilton Gregory said in a statement, \u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.\u201d The governor of North Carolina said Republicans should prepare for a \u201cscaled-down convention\u201d due to coronavirus. \u201cThe people of North Carolina do not know what the status of COVID-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,\u201d Cooper said in a letter to the top convention organizer and the RNC chairwoman. Lauren and Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Former president George W Bush released a statement in response to the killing of George Floyd and the protests that it has sparked. \u201cIt remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future,\u201d the former Republican president said. \u201cAmerica\u2019s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. ... Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason.\u201d Bush concluded the statement with a call for \u201cpeace rooted in justice.\u201d \u201cThere is a better way \u2014 the way of empathy, and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice. I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way,\u201d Bush said. The former president made no mention of Trump or the forcible removal of protesters near the White House yesterday. The acting chief of the US Park Police denied using tear gas on protesters near the White House yesterday, although he acknowledged the use of \u201csmoke canisters and pepper balls\u201d on the demonstrators. \u201cAs many of the protestors became more combative, continued to throw projectiles, and attempted to grab officers\u2019 weapons, officers then employed the use of smoke canisters and pepper balls,\u201d USPP acting Chief Gregory T Monahan said in a statement. \u201cNo tear gas was used by USPP officers or other assisting law enforcement partners to close the area at Lafayette Park. Subsequently, the fence was installed.\u201d Monahan\u2019s statement concludes, \u201cThe USPP will always support peaceful assembly but cannot tolerate violence to citizens or officers or damage to our nation\u2019s resources that we are entrusted to protect.\u201d Numerous journalists who were at the protest said the demonstration appeared to be very peaceful in the moments before law enforcement officials started to forcibly remove them. Trump mocked Joe Biden as \u201cpolitically weak\u201d and once again referred to protesters as \u201cthugs,\u201d despite widespread criticism of his use of the term last week. \u201cSleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years, and did nothing,\u201d the president said of his Democratic opponent. \u201cNow he pretends to have the answers. He doesn\u2019t even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists, looters or thugs, and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW &amp; ORDER!\u201d The tweet came less than an hour after Trump\u2019s reelection campaign sent an email referring to Biden as the \u201cArchitect of Mass Incarceration,\u201d referencing his role in the passage of the 1994 crime bill. \u201cBiden hasn\u2019t just stoked America\u2019s racial divisions over the course of his decades in Washington,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cBiden was the chief architect of mass incarceration and the War on Drugs, which targeted Black Americans.\u201d Earlier today, Biden delivered remarks in Philadelphia criticizing Trump for his handling of the George Floyd protests. \u201cThe president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,\u201d Biden said. Military trucks were seen driving down the streets of downtown Washington, as protesters began assembling for another demonstration in honor of George Floyd, a day after a peaceful crowd was forcibly dispersed using tear gas. The city\u2019s curfew is set to go into effect in about three hours, and the crowd of protesters outside of Lafayette Park, near the White House, is continuing to grow. In a bit of news related to the coronavirus pandemic, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper said Republicans should prepare for a \u201cscaled-down convention\u201d in August. \u201cThe people of North Carolina do not know what the status of COVID-19 will be in August, so planning for a scaled-down convention with fewer people, social distancing and face coverings is a necessity,\u201d Cooper said in a letter to the top convention organizer and the RNC chairwoman. The letter will likely anger Trump, who has demanded a \u201cguarantee\u201d of a full-scale convention from Cooper, even as health officials have warned such an event could lead to the spread of coronavirus. The president has threatened to hold the convention elsewhere if Cooper did not agree to a full-scale convention, and Republicans have started considering other possible cities for the event. According to Politico, Republican officials will make a trip to Nashville later this week to determine whether the city could host the convention. They are also considering Las Vegas; Orlando, Florida; Jacksonville, Forida; and Georgia as potential sites. The Minnesota department of human rights has filed a formal civil rights racial discrimination charge against the Minneapolis Police Department. The state cites \u201cunlawful race-based policing\u201d in the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died after being knelt on for almost nine minutes on the Memorial Day holiday, May 25, by a white police officer who has since been fired and charged with murder. Three other officers involved were fired but have not yet been detained or charged. Governor Tim Walz announced the filing at a news conference this afternoon. The department enforces the state\u2019s human rights act, the AP reports, particularly as it applies to discrimination in employment, housing, education, public accommodations and public services. Mediation is one of its first-choice tools, but the cases it files can lead to fuller investigations and sometimes end up in litigation. The Minneapolis Police Department has faced decades of allegations of brutality and other discrimination against African Americans and other minorities, even within the department itself. Critics say its culture resists change, despite the elevation of Medaria Arradondo as its first black police chief, in 2017. Arradondo himself was among five black officers who sued the police department in 2007 over alleged discrimination in promotions, pay, and discipline. They said in their lawsuit that the department had a history of tolerating racism and discrimination. The city eventually settled the lawsuit for $740,000. The State of Minnesota has filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department in relation to the death of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer on Memorial Day, the Associated Press reports. The event of Floyd\u2019s death, which was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner after his autopsy, has sparked fierce protests in Minneapolis and across the nation. This news is breaking now, we\u2019ll bring you more details in moments. Clip and save this for the future: Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declined to criticize Trump for his handling of the George Floyd protests. A day after protesters near the White House were forcibly removed using tear gas, McConnell said of Trump, \u201cI\u2019m not going to critique other people\u2019s performances.\u201d Asked whether he was comfortable with what occurred in Washington yesterday, McConnell again dodged the question. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that there were few to no injuries last night, apparently little to no looting,\u201d McConnell said. A Facebook software engineer has resigned over Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s decision to allow Donald Trump to use the platform to threaten violence against protesters, an escalation in the unprecedented display of dissension roiling the company. Timothy J Aveni announced his resignation Monday on Facebook and LinkedIn, as hundreds of other Facebook employees were engaging in a \u201cvirtual walkout\u201d or speaking out against Zuckerberg\u2019s decision on Twitter. \u201cMark always told us that he would draw the line at speech that calls for violence,\u201d Aveni wrote. \u201cHe showed us on Friday that this was a lie.\u201d Aveni connected Facebook\u2019s accommodation of Trump\u2019s violent rhetoric to the company\u2019s track record in Asia, where Facebook has been implicated in ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, mob violence in Sri Lanka and the rise of a demagogue in the Philippines. \u201cFacebook, complicit in the propagation of weaponized hatred, is on the wrong side of history,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFacebook is providing a platform that enables politicians to radicalize individuals and glorify violence, and we are watching the United States succumb to the same kind of social media-fueled division that has gotten people killed in the Philippines, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka. I\u2019m scared for my country and I\u2019m done trying to justify this.\u201d For more on Facebook\u2019s decision to leave Trump\u2019s post up and the response from employees, you can read our full coverage here and here. A day after protesters were forcibly removed from outside the White House, demonstrators returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to condemn the killing of George Floyd. The protesters chanted \u201cDon\u2019t shoot!\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe!\u201d as they laid on the ground in front of the White House, where a new fence has been erected in the wake of the demonstrations. Attorney general William Barr personally asked for the perimeter around the White House to be extended, resulting in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: Barr ordered law enforcement officials on the ground to extend the perimeter around Lafayette Square, which is adjacent to the White House, just before President Trump spoke Monday, a Justice Department official said. According to two federal law enforcement officials, the decision had been made late Sunday night or early Monday morning to extend the perimeter around Lafayette Square by one block. The plan was to be executed, according to the Justice Department official, the following afternoon. Barr was a part of the decision-making process, the official said. The Justice Department official said that in the afternoon, Barr went to survey the scene, and found the perimeter had not been extended. The attorney general conferred with law enforcement officials on the ground, which the official said is captured in a video of the incident. \u2018He conferred with them to check on the status, and basically said, \u2018This needs to be done. Get it done,\u2019 \u2019 the Justice Department official said. The report will almost certainly intensify scrutiny of the decision to deploy tear gas to disperse the crowd of demonstrators, who had been peacefully protesting in the moments before law enforcement officials advanced. Democratic congressman Eliot Engel, who is facing a primary challenge, was caught on a hot mic fighting for a chance to speak at an event in the Bronx. Engel, who has been criticized for not spending enough time in his New York district, asked Bronx borough president Ruben Diaz Jr for the microphone during a press conference after last night\u2019s George Floyd protests. When Diaz refused, Engel said twice, \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a primary, I wouldn\u2019t care.\u201d Diaz replied, \u201cDon\u2019t do that to me.\u201d Engel was facing primary challenges from two progressive candidates, but one of them dropped out Monday to endorse his opponent, education activist Jamaal Bowman. The withdrawal could help Bowman consolidate progressive support, putting Engel at risk of losing the June 23 prumary. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Kansas will ask the US supreme court to reinstate a law requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote, continuing one of the most closely-watched voting rights cases in the country. The law was drafted and championed by former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a Republican known nationally for his staunch anti-immigrant views and baseless claims of widespread voter fraud. The law was passed in 2011, went into effect in 2013, and was first blocked by a federal judge just before the 2016 presidential election. In April, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling blocking the law. While it was in effect, the law blocked more than 31,000 people from getting registered to vote. The US court of appeals for the 10th circuit noted that \u201cat most\u201d just 39 non-citizens got on to Kansas\u2019 voter rolls over a 20-year period. \u201cVoting is only for citizens, and this Kansas law is designed to confirm the citizenship of those registering to vote. After reviewing the appeals court\u2019s decision, we have concluded there is a reasonable basis for appeal,\u201d Kansas attorney general Derek Schmidt, a Republican, said in a statement. The US supreme court can choose whether to hear the case or not. If the court were to rule in favor of Kansas, it could open up the floodgates for other states to impose similar requirements. Joe Biden is expected to George Floyd\u2019s funeral in Houston, Texas, next week. Attorney Ben Crump, who has been representing the Floyd family, announced the news during a Facebook livestream with Van Jones. \u201cWe understand Vice President Biden will be in attendance,\u201d Crump said. Crump told CBS News that Biden\u2019s campaign had requested permission to attend the funeral, and the family said he was welcome to do so. The Floyd family announced today that they would hold public viewings and memorial services later this week and early next week in Minneapolis, Houston and Raeford, North Carolina. Senate Democrats will try to pass a resolution criticizing Trump and affirming Americans\u2019 right to peaceably assemble after protesters near the White House were forcibly removed yesterday. The measure reads, \u201cResolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That it is the Sense of Congress that the constitutional rights of Americans to peaceably assemble, exercise freedom of speech, and petition the government for redress of grievances must be respected; that violence and looting are unlawful, unacceptable and contrary to the purpose of peaceful protests; and that Congress condemns the President of the United States for ordering Federal officers to use gas and rubber bullets against the Americans who were peaceably protesting in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC on the night of June 1, 2020, thereby violating the constitutional rights of those peaceful protestors.\u201d Senate Democrats will try to pass the resolution by unanimous consent, meaning a single opposing vote from Republicans will prevent its approval, so the measure is expected to be blocked. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden sharply criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests in a Philadelphia speech. \u201cThe president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis president today is part of the problem and accelerates it.\u201d Trump claimed there were \u201cno problems\u201d in DC last night after peaceful protesters near the White House were removed using tear gas. The president has been widely criticized for walking to the nearby St John\u2019s Church for a photo op moments after the protesters were forcibly dispersed. The archdiocese of Washington said it was \u201cbaffling and reprehensible\u201d to allow Trump to visit the Saint John Paul II National Shrine today. As Trump traveled to the Washington site, which is run by the Knights of Columbus, Archbishop Wilton Gregory said in a statement, \u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau took an extended pause when asked for his response to Trump\u2019s handling of the George Floyd protests. After pausing for a full 20 seconds, Trudeau said, \u201cWe all watch in horror and consternation what\u2019s going on in the United States. It is a time to pull people together, but it is a time to listen. It is a time to learn what injustices continues, despite progress over years and decades.\u201d Trudeau then shifted the focus to his own country. \u201cBut it is time for us as Canadians to recognize that we, too, have our challenges,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cThere is systemic discrimination in Canada.\u201d Trudeau said that structural inequality was a \u201clived reality for racialized Canadians\u201d and urged his fellow citizens to be \u201callies in the fight against discrimination.\u201d The Pentagon is distancing secretary of defence Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley from Trump\u2019s infamous walk yesterday from the White House to St John\u2019s Episcopal Church. An unnamed \u201csenior defense official\u201d said during a teleconference briefing that the officials were not aware where they were going when they were summoned to see the president and then fell in behind as he walked out of the White House. \u201cOnce they began that walk off the White House grounds with the president, they continued with him,\u201d the official said, adding that Esper and Milley were also unaware the police had cleared the square with tear gas and baton charges. Adam Smith, the Democratic chair of the House armed services committee, told reporters in a teleconference he has asked Esper and Milley to come before the committee to explain the military\u2019s role in responding to the George Floyd protests. \u201cIf you use the US military, that is further contributing to the idea that this is a war,\u201d Smith said. \u201c[Trump] is talking about going to war with the citizens of the United States of America. And that is troubling and I am very concerned about what potential role the US military could play in simply amplifying this misguided rhetoric.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo mused about \u201cdisplacing\u201d New York mayor Bill de Blasio in response to his handling of the city\u2019s George Floyd protests. \u201cMy option is to displace the mayor of New York City and bring in the National Guard as the governor in a state of emergency, and basically take over \u2013 you would have to take over \u2013 the mayor\u2019s job,\u201d Cuomo said. But the Democratic governor, who has a long hisotry of feuding with de Blasio, added, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re at that point.\u201d \u201cThat would be such a chaotic situation in the midst of an already chaotic situation, and I don\u2019t think that makes sense,\u201d Cuomo said. However, the governor said de Blasio and the NYPD\u2019s handling of the protests is \u201cinexcusable.\u201d \u201cI am not happy with last night, and the police did not do their job last night,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat has to be fixed, and that has to be fixed today.\u201d Trump is receiving some criticism from Republican lawmakers after peaceful protesters were removed from outside the White House using tear gas to allow the president to visit a nearby church. \u201cThere is no right to riot,\u201d Republican senator Ben Sasse said. \u201cBut there is a fundamental \u2014 a Constitutional \u2014 right to protest, and I\u2019m against clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop.\u201d In an interview with Politico today, Republican senator Tim Scott said he would not have done the photo op at St John\u2019s Church that Trump did. He added, \u201cIf your question is, \u2018Should you use tear gas to clear a path so the president can go have a photo op?\u2019 the answer is no.\u201d However, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell did not condemn the forcible removal of protesters this morning and instead warned against \u201cviolent riots\u201d overtaking the country. Trump was greeted with a number of middle fingers and critical signs as he made his way to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington. According to the White House pool report, some of the signs read \u201cBlack Lives Matter,\u201d \u201cDump Trump\u201d and \u201cBunker bitch.\u201d As Trump traveled to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington for a photo op, the archdiocese of Washington criticized the facility for allowing the president to visit after peaceful protesters were removed from outside the White House using tear gas. \u201cI find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people even those with whom we might disagree,\u201d Archbishop Wilton Gregory said in a statement. \u201cSaint Pope John Paul II was an ardent defender of the rights and dignity of human beings. His legacy bears vivid witness to that truth. He certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace.\u201d Trump\u2019s visit to the site comes one day after he used the Bible as a \u201cprop\u201d at St John\u2019s Church near the White House, prompting criticism from a number of relgious leaders. Trump is tweeting about the George Floyd protests, demanding that governor Andrew Cuomo call up the National Guard to suppress the unrest. \u201cNYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD,\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet. \u201cThe lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast! Don\u2019t make the same horrible and deadly mistake you made with the Nursing Homes!!!\u201d The final sentence of the tweet is a reference to New York\u2019s very controversial decision to send nursing home residents who tested positive for coronavirus back to their facilities to recover, which critics say caused the virus to quickly spread. New York officials struggled to respond to looting yesterday, with some people breaking into Macy\u2019s flagship store in Manhattan as protests continued to unfold elsewhere. Moments ago, Joe Biden criticized Trump for being \u201cpart of the problem\u201d when it came to intensifying the country\u2019s divisions. \u201cI promise you this,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI won\u2019t traffic in fear and division. I won\u2019t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country \u2013 not use them for political gain.\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi read from her Bible at a press conference today, while Trump is being criticized for using the Bible as a \u201cprop\u201d moments after peaceful protesters were tear-gassed near the White House. \u201cWe would hope that the president of the United States would follow the lead of so many presidents before him, to be a healer in chief and not a fanner of the flame,\u201d Pelosi said. The Democratic speaker expressed dismay over the forible removal of protesters from outside the White House to clear the way for Trump to travel to the nearby St Johns Church. \u201cWhat is that? That has no place, and it is time for us to do away with that. A time to heal,\u201d Pelosi said, referencing Ecclesiastes. A number of religious leaders similarly criticized Trump for holding up his Bible after the protesters were removed, arguing the horrifying scene was not in line with the values that the Bible promotes. The Right Rev Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, told CNN yesterday: \u201cLet me be clear, the President just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.\u201d Joe Biden is getting some early positive reviews for his speech in Philadelphia, where he addressed the killing of George Floyd and the protests that it has sparked. From the president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress: From a former Republican congressman: From a vice president for the center-left think tank Third Way: From a former Obama justice department official: Joe Biden pledged to work to \u201creverse the systemic racism\u201d if he is elected president, specifically mentioning legislation to outlaw police chokeholds. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee sought to draw a clear contrast between himself and Trump. \u201cThe president of the United States must be part of the solution, not the problem. This president today is part of the problem and accelerates it,\u201d Biden said. However, the former vice president made clear that the country\u2019s problems woud not end solely by defeating Trump. \u201cAmerican history isn\u2019t a fairytale,\u201d Biden said, describing \u201cthe harsh reality that racism has long torn us apart.\u201d He went on to say, \u201cLook, the presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. And I won\u2019t either. \u201cBut I promise you this. I won\u2019t traffic in fear and division. I won\u2019t fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country \u2013 not use them for political gain.\u201d Joe Biden criticized Trump for staging a photo op at St John\u2019s Church moments after peaceful protesters were tear-gassed near the White House. \u201cThe president held up the Bible,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI just wish he\u2019d open it once in awhile.\u201d The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee continued, \u201cIn addition to the Bible, the president may want to open up the U.S. Constitution once in a while. He\u2019d find a thing called the First Amendment.\u201d Joe Biden is now delivering remarks in Philadelphia, where the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee addressed the killing of George Floyd and the protests in response to his death. Biden described Floyd\u2019s last words \u2013 \u201cI can\u2019t breathe \u2013 as a \u201cwake-up call for our nation.\u201d \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t breathe.\u2019 George Floyd\u2019s last words. But they didn\u2019t die with him. They\u2019re still being heard. They\u2019re echoing across this nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThey speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk. ... And they speak to a nation where every day millions of people \u2013 not at the moment of losing their life \u2013 but in the course of living their life \u2013 are saying to themselves, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019. It\u2019s a wake-up call for our nation. For all of us.\u201d This is Joan Greve, taking over for Martin Pengelly. Trump is tweeting about the protests that once again overtook Washington yesterday, bragging that the nation\u2019s capital had \u201cno problems last night.\u201d \u201cD.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all,\u201d the president wrote in a tweet. \u201cOverwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).\u201d Yesterday\u2019s DC protests were, of course, most memorable for the moment when a group of peaceful demonstrators were tear-gassed near the White House moments before Trump delivered remarks from the Rose Garden. The images and footage of protesters being forcibly dispersed a half an hour before the city\u2019s curfew went into effect caused alarm around the world. The president\u2019s mention of \u201cdomination\u201d also echoes remarks he made yesterday to the nation\u2019s governors, when he told the state leaders that they had been \u201cweak\u201d in their response to the protests and needed to crack down on the demonstrations. If you\u2019re taking part in protests, we\u2019d like to hear your views. You can get in touch with us by filling in this secure form. Your responses will only be seen by the Guardian. We\u2019d like to publish some of your views and experiences on the website. Protest over George Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers has spread worldwide, and with it condemnation of US policing practicers from diplomats and other government figures. Today, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, spoke on the matter in Brussels, calling Floyd\u2019s death an abuse of power. \u201cLike the people of the United States,\u201d he told reporters, \u201cwe are shocked and appalled by the death of George Floyd.\u201d Borrell said Europeans \u201csupport the right to peaceful protest, and also we condemn violence and racism of any kind, and for sure, we call for a de-escalation of tensions\u201d. The Associated Press adds: In France, protests were planned for the evening in Paris and across the country after calls from the family of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016. A protest was also planned in The Hague, Netherlands. Thousands marched through downtown Sydney. The protesters in Australia\u2019s largest city chanted, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d \u2013 some of the final words of Floyd, Eric Garner, an African American man who was killed while being arrested in 2014, and David Dungay, a 26-year-old Aboriginal man who died in a Sydney prison in 2015 while being restrained by five guards. The demonstrators carried placards reading, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d, \u201cAboriginal Lives Matter\u201d, \u201cWhite Silence is Violence\u201d and, referring to those protesting in cities across the US, \u201cWe See You, We Hear Your, We Stand With You.\u201d The protesters, who appeared to number around 3,000, marched from Hyde Park to the New South Wales state parliament, with plans to continue to the US consulate. \u201cIt\u2019s just gut-wrenching the climate of what\u2019s happening in America, and it\u2019s also happening here in Australia, though it\u2019s subtle,\u201d said one of the protesters, Aoatua Lee. \u201cRacism is real for me.\u201d Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison appeared on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and was asked by anchor Amy Robach about his review of the killing of George Floyd. Ellison recently took over the case (from the Hennepin county attorney) and was asked if he is considering upgrading charges against former officer Derek Chauvin to first degree murder (from third degree) in light of the official autopsy from the county medical examiner and the independent, private autopsy conducted at the request of the family, which both concluded that Floyd died by homicide. \u201cWe are considering all charges, they are all on the table,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cI was appointed Sunday, got the file last night, we are poring through it as fast as we can. There are numerous videos, numerous witness statements, a lot to go through. We are not going to prolong this any longer than is absolutely necessary to do that due diligence.\u201d When asked how long the review would take, Ellison said, \u201cWe have to move carefully, I know that is unsatisfying to people. They want what they want immediately and people have waited too long and have been patient over the years, but this case must be done methodically and we are doing that now. But nothing is off the table. Autopsies are factors in the work we are doing right now.\u201d Ellison emphasized he was working to build an air-tight case. \u201cThe fact is these cases are not easy, and anyone who says they are has never done one,\u201d he said. Ellison concluded the interview by saying he couldn\u2019t give a deadline for when any new charges may be brought against the officers involved in the case. Monday night saw continued peaceful protests and violence in many major US cities. Here\u2019s an at-a-glance guide: Washington DC: Peaceful protesters were teargassed to make way for a 17-minute photo shoot of Donald Trump in front of St John\u2019s Church. The Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese the church belonged to said she was \u201coutraged\u201d by the president\u2019s actions. Minneapolis, Minnesota: In the city where police violence sparked unrest across the country, protesters were peaceful a day after pleas from George Floyd\u2019s brother. New York City: Heavy handed police tactics over the weekend in Brooklyn gave way to peaceful protests Monday night. But stores were looted in the Midtown and Soho neighborhoods of Manhattan. Chicago, Illinois: Protesters were peaceful in much of Chicago, but looting marred protests in the suburb of Naperville. In the suburb of Cicero, two people were killed. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Police fired rubber bullets and teargas on protesters who blocked traffic. Baltimore, Maryland: Thousands of people protested in this city, which just five years ago was roiled by the death of Freddie Gray, who was black, in police custody. Oakland, California: Thousands of peaceful protesters gathered in the city. Las Vegas, Nevada: A police officer and an armed man were shot amid protests near the famous \u201cStrip\u201d. At least 338 people have been arrested in Las Vegas after protests through the weekend and the week. Atlanta, Georgia: At least 55 protesters were arrested in Atlanta when they blocked a roadway. It is the fourth day of protests in that city. Nashville, Tennessee: Peaceful protesters cheered when National Guard troops laid down their shields. St Louis, Missouri: A peaceful protest devolved into looting, and four officers were later shot. All are expected to recover, and it is unclear who fired shots which injured the officers. Louisville, Kentucky: Peaceful protests refocused on loss within the community, after two police officers shot and killed a local business owner during protests, but failed to turn on their body cameras. The mayor fired the police chief as a result. Buffalo, New York: Two police officers were injured when they were struck by a vehicle amid protests. Around the world\u2026 Sydney, Australia: Thousands of protesters marched in solidarity with anti-racism protesters in the US. Placards read, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cAboriginal Lives Matter\u201d. After Trump\u2019s gas-protesters-to-walk-to-church-and-hold-up-a-Bible stunt on Monday night, there is of course a lot of conversation going on about just how religious this three-times-married, pussy-grabbing, settlement-paying, race-baiting, greed-worshipping president really is. And, therefore, a clip from the 2016 campaign trail is duly doing the rounds on social media. It shows then-candidate Trump interviewed by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, then of Bloomberg Politics, about the Bible, which he had been telling crowds at his rallies was his favourite book. Halperin: \u201cI\u2019m wondering what one or two of your most favorite Bible verses are and why.\u201d Trump: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to get into it, because to me that\u2019s very personal. You know, when I talk about the Bible it\u2019s very personal so I don\u2019t want to get into verses.\u201d Halperin: \u201cThere\u2019s no verses that you think about or want to cite?\u201d Trump: \u201cThe Bible means a lot to me but I don\u2019t want to get into specifics.\u201d Halperin: \u201cEven to cite a verse?\u201d Trump: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d Heilemann: \u201cAre you an Old Testament guy or a New Testament guy?\u201d Trump says: \u201cProbably equal. I think it\u2019s just incredible, the whole Bible is incredible. I always joke, I say very much so, I hold up The Art of the Deal, I say my second-favourite book of all time. But I just think the Bible is something very special.\u201d So there\u2019s that. As for why evangelical Christians, such a powerful voting bloc in the Republican party, support Trump so fervently, here\u2019s John S Gardner\u2019s review of Ralph Reed\u2019s book, For God and Country: The Christian Case for Trump. Safe to say, John isn\u2019t buying. On Monday night, hosts on CNN and Fox News gave voice to the schism in US society over the George Floyd protests and Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use the army against them. On CNN, Don Lemon said: \u201cOpen your eyes, America. We are teetering on a dictatorship.\u201d Later, Anderson Cooper noted that protests against police brutality and the killing of African American men and women are specifically asking for law and order, and said: \u201cThe president seems to think dominating black people, dominating peaceful protesters, is law and order. It\u2019s not.\u201d On Fox, Trump booster Tucker Carlson spoke for nearly half-an-hour, urging the president to forcibly put the protests down. \u201cYou can regularly say embarrassing things on television,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cYou can hire Omarosa to work at the White House. All of that will be forgiven if you protect your people. But if you do not protect them \u2026 then you\u2019re done.\u201d With the protests coming on top of a pandemic which has killed more than 100,000 people in the US and an economy which has cratered as a result, Trump is trailing Joe Biden, his presumptive challenger in November, in most polls. Noting that a Fox News reporter had been attacked \u2013 as have many reporters from a host of outlets, by police as well as protesters \u2013 Carlson, speaking directly to a president who was almost certainly watching, asked: \u201cHow are you going to protect the country? How hard are you trying?\u201d Mariann Budde, the Bishop of Washington, has been speaking to ABC\u2019s Good Morning America. Thanks to Joanna Walters for the quotes\u2026 \u201cThis is an excruciating moment,\u201d Budde said, \u201cand a crisis moment in our country, where we need healing and reconciliation and we need justice.\u201d Budde was asked about what happened on Monday night, when police in riot gear fired teargas and charged a crowd around St John\u2019s church before Trump and aides walked across from the White House for a photo opportunity, Trump holding up a Bible for the cameras. The president, she said, had been \u201cholding up a Bible as if it was justification for a message that is antithetical to the teachings of Jesus\u201d. Budde spoke forcefully on the matter on Monday night. \u201cI felt I had to dissociate myself from that and give a message of justice and peace to the nation,\u201d she told ABC, adding that she was given no notice that the president was going to visit the church. \u201cI was sitting and watching the news with my mother when I saw what everyone else saw,\u201d she said. Damage to the church was minor, she said, after fire fighters rushed to put out a fire started when a window was smashed and something inflammatory was thrown into one room during Sunday\u2019s protests. St John\u2019s is known as the \u201cChurch of the Presidents\u201d, as every one since James Madison has worshipped there. (When friends of mine were married there a few years ago, a pew at the back with double leg room was labelled as the place where Abraham Lincoln used to sit when he wandered over from the White House to listen in to a service. Whether Lincoln was a Christian or not is, to people like me at least, a fascinating subject.) Asked if Trump would be welcome at the church now, Budde said: \u201cHe is welcome to pray. Presidents are welcome as citizens of our country, to pray, to kneel before God in humility. \u201cHe is not entitled to use the symbolism to promote an entirely different message. The outrage we are hearing from so many of \u2026 the nation\u2019s young people and people of colour, we need to align ourselves with the God of unconditional love and justice.\u201d At Axios, Jonathan Swan has two fascinating anonymous quotes from the Trump White House, about the decision to speak in the Rose Garden yesterday, and to order the gassing and beating of protesters in Lafayette Square so the president could walk to St John\u2019s church and be seen in public: One senior aide was exuberantly telling friends the photograph of him holding a Bible in front of the church that had been attacked by vandals was an \u201ciconic\u201d moment for the president. But a senior White House official told Axios that when they saw the tear gas clearing the crowd for Trump to walk to the church with his entourage: \u201cI\u2019ve never been more ashamed. I\u2019m really honestly disgusted. I\u2019m sick to my stomach. And they\u2019re all celebrating it. They\u2019re very very proud of themselves.\u201d As protests took place on Friday, remember, Trump was taken to a reinforced bunker under the White House. On Saturday he left for Florida and the SpaceX launch \u2013 and spoke about the killing of George Floyd while there \u2013 but on Sunday, as protests continued, Trump was not seen or heard from. Overnight into Monday, as fires burned in Washington and other cities, the lights on the north side of the White House were switched off, something which usually only happens when a president dies. And then a call between Trump and governors, in which the president ranted about bringing in the army, \u201cdominating\u201d the protests and the need for mass arrests and harsh sentencing, was swiftly leaked to media outlets including Guardian US. It was all disastrous for the president. And so, in short, the whole chaotic scene last night, in which, again, peaceful protesters were hit with tear gas, was just a stunt for the cameras. Here\u2019s David Smith, our Washington bureau chief: Outside St John\u2019s, the Church of the Presidents, Trump stood with bible in hand. It caused widespread outrage and widespread quoting of a line about American fascism attributed to the novelist Sinclair Lewis. Here\u2019s American academic in London and Guardian contributor Sarah Churchwell, with a fascinating thread on who actually said it: Good morning from New York, where I\u2019m taking on the blog for a while before Joan Greve signs in from Washington. I\u2019m in Washington Heights, where lockdown calm still reigns, a long way from the protests in this city. (There\u2019s something very New York indeed about the New York Times live blog I just linked to: it begins with the weather and the all-important notice that alternate-side parking is \u201csuspended through Sunday\u201d.) The Times is copping a lot of flack this morning \u2013 that might be a very British phrase, in which case, it\u2019s being criticised widely \u2013 for a front page which did not foreground Donald Trump\u2019s decision to gas and attack peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square so he could stage a walk to a church as a photo op. Here\u2019s a tweet from David Boardman, a former Seattle Times editor turned journalism academic that sums up, in sober fashion, much of the reaction to the Times\u2019 decisions: The Times story on Trump\u2019s decision, it should be noted, did not pull any punches. I\u2019m going to hand over now to my colleague in New York, Martin Pengelly. Thank you for all your helpful emails and messages. The archbishop of York in the UK has said he would join protests over the death of George Floyd but that violence should not be part of the action. John Sentamu, the most senior black leader in the Church of England who retires on Sunday, said he was shielding at present, but added: \u201cI certainly would want to join [the protests]. But at the moment it turns to violence, I wouldn\u2019t be there because I don\u2019t believe violence is the same as going out and protesting. \u201cPeople should have the right to protest but not use violence, because I\u2019m afraid you can end up in trouble and arrested.\u201d Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Sentamu was also critical of Donald Trump\u2019s threat to use troops against protesters in US cities. \u201cPeople sometimes think that because you\u2019ve got the power and the authority, you can abuse that authority. Martin Luther King said that violence causes as many problems as it solve \u2026 darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that; hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. \u201cThe problem is America has not been listening to the real problems of African Americans and people of colour,\u201d he said. The country had not \u201cdealt with this endemic brutality that some people experience from people in uniform\u201d. Although he condemned violence from protesters and authorities, he said people who had watched the video of a police officer kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck were \u201csaying enough is enough\u201d. Hi \u2013 Oliver Holmes still here. People can get in contact with me if you see something you think is worth putting on our blog. And thank you for the contributions so far. You can reach me via Twitter or on email: oliver.holmes [at] theguardian.com Below is a very powerful photo by a photographer from a Sunday protest in downtown Long Beach, California, which is receiving a lot of attention online after he posted it in the past few hours. Richard Grant has been clear the man was not fired on but that police did \u201coccasionally\u201d point their rubber bullet guns towards him. It is now well into Tuesday across the US. We are trying to make sense of a night of protests that has witnessed escalating violence following threats by President Trump to deploy the military. A week after the police killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died in Minneapolis when a police officer kneeled on his neck, and the demonstrations have not let up. Curfews have been ignored, and both police and protesters are accused of unwarranted attacks, with confrontations in the street raising tensions and quickly turning peaceful protests into street fights. In St Louis, four police officers were wounded by gunfire, while in Buffalo, two people were injured when a car rammed into a line of law enforcement officers. Shootings involving police were also reported in Las Vegas. Meanwhile, authorities in the Chicago suburb of Cicero, where protests have been held, said two people had been killed, although they did not identify the victims or circumstances. A dramatic Trump photo-op preceded the night, in which Washington DC police forcefully cleared the streets with teargas, rubber bullets and flash-bangs so the president could pose in front of a church and hold the bible. \u201cI am your president of law and order,\u201d Trump said outside the church. \u201cI am mobilising all available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your second amendment rights.\u201d He vowed to crack down on \u201cprofessional anarchists, looters, criminals, antifa and others\u201d whose actions had \u201cgripped\u201d America. Our Washington bureau chief, David Smith, reported on the event that enraged demonstrators but also irked the bishop of the episcopal diocese of Washington. The Right Rev Mariann Budde said she was \u201cnot given even a courtesy call, that they would be clearing [the area] with tear gas so they could use one of our churches as a prop\u201d. Richard Wolffe, a Guardian US columnist, says the photo op showed the US leader had reached the \u201cmad emperor\u201d stage: Trump can no more end today\u2019s violence than he can manage a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, or create the jobs that will rescue more than 40 million unemployed. Faced with a three-fold crisis of racial, health and economic disasters, we have a three-year-old in the Oval Office.",

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Elias Visontay and it\u2019s Wednesday 3 June. Australia enters first recession in 29 years Australia has entered its first recession in 29 years after the economy went backwards by 0.3% in the March quarter, with the impact of bushfires and the coronavirus ending the nation\u2019s extraordinary, uninterrupted run of economic growth. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said a recession was inevitable after the Australian Bureau of Statistics released national accounts showing gross domestic product fell 0.3% in the quarter. The economy grew only 1.4% over the past 12 months, which is the weakest performance since the global financial crisis. The opposition treasury spokesman, Jim Chalmers, responded to the announcement by saying Australia entered the Covid-19 pandemic \u201cfrom a position of weakness\u201d, adding \u201ceven before the virus, even before the bushfires, we had issues with weak growth, stagnant wages, weak business investment and productivity\u201d. Universities face $16bn black hole Universities claim they will lose up to $16bn by 2023 due to the impact of Covid-19, according to new modelling. Universities Australia has raised the stakes in lobbying for an industry assistance package or relaxed visa conditions to facilitate international students by revealing it now expects members to lose between $3.1bn and $4.8bn this year alone. NZ travel bubble \u2018very certain\u2019 as Australian cases fall The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said he is \u201cvery certain\u201d of the proposed travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand eventuating provided both countries continue to keep the virus under control. The move towards quarantine-free tourism comes as Greece\u2019s ambassador to Australia conceded a recent Greek government pitch for Australians to visit the country from 15 June was technically illegal to pursue. There have been eight new Covid-19 cases recorded across Australia in the 24-hour period leading up to Wednesday afternoon. There are less than 500 active cases nationally, with 25 people in hospital, five in intensive care units, with two on ventilators. Councils struggle with huge rise in household rubbish Councils around Australia have seen a huge increase in volumes of household rubbish and dumping of waste triggered by a combination of more online shopping, home improvements, international workers returning to their home countries and a clearing out of unwanted possessions during the coronavirus lockdown. City of Melbourne council said it saw a 70% increase in illegally dumped rubbish in April, compared with the same time last year, while City of Sydney council has reported a 35% rise in the volume of special collections. Unions and bosses eye future amid recession Businesses and unions are putting their differences aside and donning their thinking caps as the coronavirus economic slump bites hard. The federal industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, joined union heads Sally McManus and Michele O\u2019Neil and a range of employer groups in Sydney on Wednesday morning. The groups are looking at issues including the definition of casual employment, enterprise agreements for major projects and simplifying awards for hard-hit industries such as hospitality, with Porter summarising the first day as \u201ca very optimistic start to the process\u201d.

      "body": "<p>One of the most grueling college semesters I\u2019ve ever taught ended on 6 May. The following morning, I woke to nine emails from former students asking for help. Four requested letters of recommendation; two asked for comments on graduate school applications; one wanted advice about what to do now that the summer internship I\u2019d recommended her for had been cancelled; another hoped I could suggest ways to make a 10-page essay on the concept of Enlightenment in modern German philosophy stronger; and the last wanted me to \u201cquickly\u201d read a 12,000-word dissertation chapter before he submitted it to his adviser that afternoon.&nbsp;</p> <p>Despite my guilt, I told them all, \u201cNo.\u201d My first priority was to fill my two kids with waffles, then log them in to their respective online learning platforms. My second was to file an unemployment claim, so I could pay household bills over&nbsp;the summer (I live in Boulder, where the cost of living is not cheap). Not one of these students seemed to realize that I am nothing but a gig worker for their university and my gig is now up \u2013 perhaps permanently.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed.html\" data-alt=\".\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed.html\">.</a> </figure>  <p>Like most of the 1.3 million college faculty members employed off the tenure-track, I work on a contingent basis: I only have a job when the university needs me.</p> <p>Some semesters, I teach a full four-course load, which means I can cover my monthly bills. Other semesters, I\u2019m asked to teach just three courses and my guaranteed income for five months of the year consistently falls $200 short of meeting my family\u2019s needs. With the future of college education unsettled by the coronavirus, my family\u2019s normally insecure finances have become even more precarious. Yet, in recent weeks, students have asked me to do more work for them than ever, with no consideration for the fact that I\u2019m not paid for the services they expect me to provide.</p> <p>Of course, this is not their fault. Most college students (and most parents of college students) have no idea that a full 75% of college instructors nowadays are non-tenured or adjunct faculty. Rarely do our contracts last for more than an academic year and, as I know from personal experience, we often earn as much to teach a course as just one of our students pays to attend.

      "bodyText": "One of the most grueling college semesters I\u2019ve ever taught ended on 6 May. The following morning, I woke to nine emails from former students asking for help. Four requested letters of recommendation; two asked for comments on graduate school applications; one wanted advice about what to do now that the summer internship I\u2019d recommended her for had been cancelled; another hoped I could suggest ways to make a 10-page essay on the concept of Enlightenment in modern German philosophy stronger; and the last wanted me to \u201cquickly\u201d read a 12,000-word dissertation chapter before he submitted it to his adviser that afternoon. Despite my guilt, I told them all, \u201cNo.\u201d My first priority was to fill my two kids with waffles, then log them in to their respective online learning platforms. My second was to file an unemployment claim, so I could pay household bills over the summer (I live in Boulder, where the cost of living is not cheap). Not one of these students seemed to realize that I am nothing but a gig worker for their university and my gig is now up \u2013 perhaps permanently. Like most of the 1.3 million college faculty members employed off the tenure-track, I work on a contingent basis: I only have a job when the university needs me. Some semesters, I teach a full four-course load, which means I can cover my monthly bills. Other semesters, I\u2019m asked to teach just three courses and my guaranteed income for five months of the year consistently falls $200 short of meeting my family\u2019s needs. With the future of college education unsettled by the coronavirus, my family\u2019s normally insecure finances have become even more precarious. Yet, in recent weeks, students have asked me to do more work for them than ever, with no consideration for the fact that I\u2019m not paid for the services they expect me to provide. Of course, this is not their fault. Most college students (and most parents of college students) have no idea that a full 75% of college instructors nowadays are non-tenured or adjunct faculty. Rarely do our contracts last for more than an academic year and, as I know from personal experience, we often earn as much to teach a course as just one of our students pays to attend. But because most of us can legitimately request to be addressed by the title \u201cDoctor\u201d, students assume we earn generous salaries, have cushy benefit plans, and get every summer off. Nothing could be further from the truth. On average, adjuncts are paid just under $3,000 per course, and they teach 14 courses per year.

How are they managing this new reality? The Guardian checked in with four California educators \u2026</p> <h2>\u2018It feels like The Twilight Zone\u2019</h2> <p>Just as closures have affected the nature of work, they have changed the complexion of teachers\u2019 home lives.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day looks absolutely wild. I was not prepared to spend 24 hours a day with my children,\u201d said Shelly Steely, who teaches at an <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/37683383730231/2019#suspension-rate-card\">alternative high school</a> in San Diego geared toward students who are at risk of dropping out. </p> <p>Since the lockdowns started, she has struggled to keep pace.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMy husband is working at a call center, so it\u2019s really tough to have time for all the work plus caring for my own kids, cooking and cleaning and helping them with their homework. And we lost our babysitter because my dad is high-risk and hasn\u2019t been able to do it,\u201d Steely said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf5dc38fa82d31bed8658888036ac43e89f2c96c/0_0_5360_3574/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in saner times.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Teaching in saner times.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tina Alcatraz Andres, a middle school teacher in<a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/30666700000000/2019\"> Santa Ana Unified</a>, just south of Los Angeles, said she has been working disjointed, 15-hour days as a parent to two children, 14 and 15. Layered upon those stressors, Andres\u2019s father was diagnosed with Covid-19 days after schools closed.</p> <p>\u201cWe have times where all four of us are on Zoom calls,\u201d Andres said of her working husband, also a teacher, and her kids. \u201cAnd sometimes the internet goes down and it\u2019s panic mode.\u201d</p> <p>Andres has also noticed the lockdown has shifted her family and students\u2019 schedules. Everybody seems to be waking up later now.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t really plan anything early in the morning, because kids don\u2019t show up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing most of my grading at night, around 10 o\u2019clock. Sometimes I send a paper back and I\u2019m talking to students after 1am about the work. It\u2019s very weird and adds to the Twilight Zone feeling of this whole thing.\u201d</p> <p>Andres notes one unexpected perk of the new normal, however. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten to know some of my students better. Some who have been quiet seem to have come alive.\u201d</p> <h2>Digital disconnect</h2> <p>In the weeks that followed the first school closures, teachers describe frantic scenes of hustling to get laptops and hotspots into students\u2019 hands or cobbling together distance learning plans, often from scratch. Stories of teachers scrambling to connect with awol students abounded.&nbsp;</p> <p>At Los Angeles Unified, the nation\u2019s second-largest school district, roughly <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-los-angeles-schools-15000-high-school-students-absent\">15,000 high school students</a> were absent online and completed no school work in the transition to distance learning.&nbsp;</p> <p>In San Diego, trying to engage students online has been Steely\u2019s biggest stress point.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"724010918e3fccab49f6926333a1dc70bd74d52e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/724010918e3fccab49f6926333a1dc70bd74d52e/0_0_5000_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Security guards talk on the campus of the closed McKinley School, part of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) system, in Compton, California, just south of Los Angeles.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Security guards talk on the campus of the closed McKinley school, part of the Los Angeles Unified school district system, in Compton, California, just south of Los Angeles, in late April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI can\u2019t get my kids to connect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m over here like: \u2018Can someone text me back, please? Anyone? I know you hear me because I see the message on \u2018read\u2019. You have to graduate next month but you have to do some work for me to pass you in good faith.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Her students are dealing with a lot: one has been couch surfing, three have become full-time caregivers because their parents are working. A couple have full-time jobs they are still going to because their work is considered \u201cessential\u201d work.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOne of my students up and left town,\u201d Steely said. \u201cI\u2019ve been altering his assignments so he could do them on his phone. Half my students didn\u2019t have computers. It was a whole ordeal trying to get them the devices and now we\u2019re dealing with bad connections.\u201d</p> <p>Angela Der Ramos, who teaches sixth graders in <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/27661420000000/2019#mathematics-card\">Salinas</a>, a central-coast city made famous by John Steinbeck, has been working to keep kids tuned in, turning quizzes into games and focusing on reading, percentages and ratios \u2013 lessons that will build skills they will depend on for life.&nbsp;</p> <p>Many families speak a language other than English at home, she said, and face some of the \u201chidden challenges\u201d known to teachers: lack of access to the internet, overcrowded housing and concerns over immigration status.</p> <p>\u201cIn one of my student\u2019s families, three children and their mom rent a room inside a house,\u201d said Der Ramos. \u201cWhere is he going to go to log on to a computer?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Of the 27 students in Der Ramos\u2019s class, only about six routinely log in, she said. About 10 other students aren\u2019t regulars, but do some of the work, enough for Der Ramos to say, \u201cOK, good. You\u2019re alive and at least engaging in some way\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dd95cbc9f191557d5c07aaad1ea83c9e1debd210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd95cbc9f191557d5c07aaad1ea83c9e1debd210/0_750_2250_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ken Johnson at his office desk in Manteca, where he\u2019s been taking meals during 12-hour work days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ken Johnson at his office desk in Manteca, where he has been taking meals during 12-hour work days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Ken Johnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shift to distance learning affected school districts unevenly. In Menlo Park, an affluent Bay-area community in the heart of Silicon Valley, officials chalk up a relatively smooth transition to the fact that most students in the district had access to devices going into the lockdown \u2013 in addition to teachers who were trained in distance learning techniques.&nbsp;</p> <p>But the same wasn\u2019t true in many rural or disadvantaged areas.&nbsp;</p> <p>Ken Johnson, a high school government teacher and president of the teachers union in <a href=\"https://www.caschooldashboard.org/reports/39685930000000/2019\">Manteca</a>, a Central Valley town an hour east of San Francisco, said he has been working 12-hour days, taking meals at his desk, in part because he and other educators had to create distance learning plans from scratch.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked in my life. We\u2019re doing things on the fly. Everyday is different. If the software is glitchy, you have to become Mr Google and figure it out,\u201d Johnson said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Johnson said he has encountered an irony facing a generation of digital natives in his classes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe funny thing is that kids can spend the entire day on Instagram or TikTok, but when it comes to taking a picture of their work and uploading it \u2026 or even just sending an email, that\u2019s something they apparently don\u2019t know how to do,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s like learning to teach all over again\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Distance learning has upended the entire way educators teach, throwing a wrench into years of professional training and finely tuned lesson plans.&nbsp;Teaching sixth-graders in Salinas, Der Ramos said she had come to rely on students\u2019 body language, the way they roll their eyes or drift off when they are not interested.&nbsp;</p> <p>But online teaching has blunted her ability to read her students \u2013 especially when so many seem to be hesitant to show their face, or the inside of their homes, to the camera. (All teachers interviewed for this story noted the same.)&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cTeachers normally have to play a little psychology with our students \u2013 but this is harder, because we\u2019re not in front of them. When I teach online I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t call on students to answer,\u201d she said. \u201cIn real life you can sort of stare them down until they respond, but start calling on them online and one by one you\u2019ll see them start to log off, like \u2018byeee\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Teaching math is a particular challenge, teachers say. Teaching math concepts involves looking at students\u2019 work and seeing where they went wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about? Making mistakes is what a lot of teaching is based on. But in this case we don\u2019t have the same opportunity to go through the actual work in the same way,\u201d said Der Ramos.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like having to learn to teach all over again, but underwater. And we don\u2019t have the oxygen to share with the students.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I miss my students\u2019</h2> <p>Teachers say much of their time since lockdown started has been consumed by in-the-moment logistics and planning for the future.&nbsp;But it is also proving to be an emotional time for teachers \u2013 both for their students and their own families.&nbsp;</p> <p>Steely in San Diego, for example, said she has been gobsmacked by the amount of homework given by her twins\u2019 teacher.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cMy boys have six hours of homework each day, plus Zoom calls. I\u2019ve seen some complaints about teachers not assigning students enough work. I think those are in bad taste, let\u2019s be real,\u201d she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Among Steely\u2019s biggest concerns for her students is what will happen after summer. School officials in California are looking at dividing the student body in half and staggering school schedules to allow for more space to physically distance. But that creates a major problem for Steely.</p> <p>\u201cAs a family, we were all waiting for our kids to be in school so the money we paid in childcare could finally go to other things. And it\u2019s not just us.

      "bodyText": "In less than three months, the coronavirus has upended America\u2019s public education system. The virus triggered closures of unprecedented scale and forced educators across the country to quickly transition to online teaching, many for the first time in their careers. Roughly 11 weeks since the start of the pandemic, 124,000 US schools remain closed for in-person instruction as they limp toward summer break, affecting almost 51 million students. The coronavirus is quickly becoming the defining moment in education for a generation of schoolchildren and their parents. But what of the teachers? How are they managing this new reality? The Guardian checked in with four California educators \u2026 \u2018It feels like The Twilight Zone\u2019 Just as closures have affected the nature of work, they have changed the complexion of teachers\u2019 home lives. \u201cEvery day looks absolutely wild. I was not prepared to spend 24 hours a day with my children,\u201d said Shelly Steely, who teaches at an alternative high school in San Diego geared toward students who are at risk of dropping out. Since the lockdowns started, she has struggled to keep pace. \u201cMy husband is working at a call center, so it\u2019s really tough to have time for all the work plus caring for my own kids, cooking and cleaning and helping them with their homework. And we lost our babysitter because my dad is high-risk and hasn\u2019t been able to do it,\u201d Steely said. Tina Alcatraz Andres, a middle school teacher in Santa Ana Unified, just south of Los Angeles, said she has been working disjointed, 15-hour days as a parent to two children, 14 and 15. Layered upon those stressors, Andres\u2019s father was diagnosed with Covid-19 days after schools closed. \u201cWe have times where all four of us are on Zoom calls,\u201d Andres said of her working husband, also a teacher, and her kids. \u201cAnd sometimes the internet goes down and it\u2019s panic mode.\u201d Andres has also noticed the lockdown has shifted her family and students\u2019 schedules. Everybody seems to be waking up later now. \u201cI can\u2019t really plan anything early in the morning, because kids don\u2019t show up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing most of my grading at night, around 10 o\u2019clock. Sometimes I send a paper back and I\u2019m talking to students after 1am about the work. It\u2019s very weird and adds to the Twilight Zone feeling of this whole thing.\u201d Andres notes one unexpected perk of the new normal, however. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve gotten to know some of my students better. Some who have been quiet seem to have come alive.\u201d Digital disconnect In the weeks that followed the first school closures, teachers describe frantic scenes of hustling to get laptops and hotspots into students\u2019 hands or cobbling together distance learning plans, often from scratch. Stories of teachers scrambling to connect with awol students abounded. At Los Angeles Unified, the nation\u2019s second-largest school district, roughly 15,000 high school students were absent online and completed no school work in the transition to distance learning. In San Diego, trying to engage students online has been Steely\u2019s biggest stress point. \u201cI can\u2019t get my kids to connect,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m over here like: \u2018Can someone text me back, please? Anyone? I know you hear me because I see the message on \u2018read\u2019. You have to graduate next month but you have to do some work for me to pass you in good faith.\u2019\u201d Her students are dealing with a lot: one has been couch surfing, three have become full-time caregivers because their parents are working. A couple have full-time jobs they are still going to because their work is considered \u201cessential\u201d work. \u201cOne of my students up and left town,\u201d Steely said. \u201cI\u2019ve been altering his assignments so he could do them on his phone. Half my students didn\u2019t have computers. It was a whole ordeal trying to get them the devices and now we\u2019re dealing with bad connections.\u201d Angela Der Ramos, who teaches sixth graders in Salinas, a central-coast city made famous by John Steinbeck, has been working to keep kids tuned in, turning quizzes into games and focusing on reading, percentages and ratios \u2013 lessons that will build skills they will depend on for life. Many families speak a language other than English at home, she said, and face some of the \u201chidden challenges\u201d known to teachers: lack of access to the internet, overcrowded housing and concerns over immigration status. \u201cIn one of my student\u2019s families, three children and their mom rent a room inside a house,\u201d said Der Ramos. \u201cWhere is he going to go to log on to a computer?\u201d Of the 27 students in Der Ramos\u2019s class, only about six routinely log in, she said. About 10 other students aren\u2019t regulars, but do some of the work, enough for Der Ramos to say, \u201cOK, good. You\u2019re alive and at least engaging in some way\u201d. The shift to distance learning affected school districts unevenly. In Menlo Park, an affluent Bay-area community in the heart of Silicon Valley, officials chalk up a relatively smooth transition to the fact that most students in the district had access to devices going into the lockdown \u2013 in addition to teachers who were trained in distance learning techniques. But the same wasn\u2019t true in many rural or disadvantaged areas. Ken Johnson, a high school government teacher and president of the teachers union in Manteca, a Central Valley town an hour east of San Francisco, said he has been working 12-hour days, taking meals at his desk, in part because he and other educators had to create distance learning plans from scratch. \u201cThis is the hardest I\u2019ve ever worked in my life. We\u2019re doing things on the fly. Everyday is different. If the software is glitchy, you have to become Mr Google and figure it out,\u201d Johnson said. Johnson said he has encountered an irony facing a generation of digital natives in his classes. \u201cThe funny thing is that kids can spend the entire day on Instagram or TikTok, but when it comes to taking a picture of their work and uploading it \u2026 or even just sending an email, that\u2019s something they apparently don\u2019t know how to do,\u201d he said. \u2018It\u2019s like learning to teach all over again\u2019 Distance learning has upended the entire way educators teach, throwing a wrench into years of professional training and finely tuned lesson plans. Teaching sixth-graders in Salinas, Der Ramos said she had come to rely on students\u2019 body language, the way they roll their eyes or drift off when they are not interested. But online teaching has blunted her ability to read her students \u2013 especially when so many seem to be hesitant to show their face, or the inside of their homes, to the camera. (All teachers interviewed for this story noted the same.) \u201cTeachers normally have to play a little psychology with our students \u2013 but this is harder, because we\u2019re not in front of them. When I teach online I\u2019ve learned I can\u2019t call on students to answer,\u201d she said. \u201cIn real life you can sort of stare them down until they respond, but start calling on them online and one by one you\u2019ll see them start to log off, like \u2018byeee\u2019.\u201d Teaching math is a particular challenge, teachers say. Teaching math concepts involves looking at students\u2019 work and seeing where they went wrong. \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Making mistakes is what a lot of teaching is based on. But in this case we don\u2019t have the same opportunity to go through the actual work in the same way,\u201d said Der Ramos. \u201cIt\u2019s like having to learn to teach all over again, but underwater. And we don\u2019t have the oxygen to share with the students.\u201d \u2018I miss my students\u2019 Teachers say much of their time since lockdown started has been consumed by in-the-moment logistics and planning for the future. But it is also proving to be an emotional time for teachers \u2013 both for their students and their own families. Steely in San Diego, for example, said she has been gobsmacked by the amount of homework given by her twins\u2019 teacher. \u201cMy boys have six hours of homework each day, plus Zoom calls. I\u2019ve seen some complaints about teachers not assigning students enough work. I think those are in bad taste, let\u2019s be real,\u201d she said. Among Steely\u2019s biggest concerns for her students is what will happen after summer. School officials in California are looking at dividing the student body in half and staggering school schedules to allow for more space to physically distance. But that creates a major problem for Steely. \u201cAs a family, we were all waiting for our kids to be in school so the money we paid in childcare could finally go to other things. And it\u2019s not just us. A lot of parents rely on public schools for childcare,\u201d she said. One and a half hours north, in Santa Ana, Andres said she has also been surprised by the timing of some parents\u2019 feedback. \u201cAs we\u2019re nearing the end of the school year I\u2019ve had a flood of parents whose students haven\u2019t been doing anything for the past eight weeks and are suddenly very interested in how their kids are going to get caught up,\u201d Andres said. Meanwhile, Johnson in Manteca is coming to terms with the fact he wasn\u2019t able to close out the year with a group of students, many of whom postponed plans to leave for college in order to help their parents pull through the pandemic and its financial toll. \u201cI miss my students. I won\u2019t be able to be at their graduation. I want to be able to see them after their graduation and hear their laughter and stupid jokes. That\u2019s why teachers teach \u2013 we have that rapport with our students where we\u2019re just feeding off of it,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI feel like I haven\u2019t been able to see my kids finish growing up. I\u2019ve been doing this 31 years and I still get teared up talking about this.\u201d Still, he has been touched and encouraged by his students\u2019 thoughtful responses to lockdown measures \u201cThey say they\u2019re bored, but they don\u2019t want to go outside because they don\u2019t want to bring the virus home to mom and dad or grandpa,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kids, they get it. Even as young as they are, they understand how serious this is and they\u2019re concerned for others. It gives you hope for the future, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d",

      "bodyText": "California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, is facing mounting pressure, including from a top state official, to grant clemency to dozens of elderly and vulnerable women who are serving long sentences in prison and are at high risk of death from coronavirus. They include survivors of domestic violence, war and cancer. Some are battling life-threatening illnesses. Others have been jailed for murders they say they did not commit. Most are incarcerated in prisons where Covid-19 is rapidly spreading. On 1 May, Fiona Ma, California\u2019s elected state treasurer and a member of the executive branch, sent Newsom a list of 25 elderly and vulnerable women who have active commutation requests the governor could approve while their lives are threatened by Covid. So far, he has released none of them. Less than two months before, California granted early release for 3,500 prisoners convicted of non-violent offenses who were nearing the end of their sentences in an effort to curb the spread of the virus in prisons and jails. Activists say the swift release of older and immunocompromised prisoners is necessary and could potentially save hundreds of lives. But Newsom has resisted giving clemency to people convicted of crimes classified as serious or violent. Meanwhile, the coronavirus crisis behind bars has only escalated. More than 6,000 prisoners have contracted the virus in the state, at least 23 have died and the facilities remain overcrowded. \u201cI\u2019m very concerned for all of them,\u201d said Ma about the women she\u2019s advocating for. \u201cAnyone who has been there more than five years has some sort of health risk,\u201d she continued, noting that prisoners tend to have a wide range of health problems due to their living conditions and treatment. \u201cSome of these older women have been in for 45 years. Certainly these women are not violent.\u201d Battling cancer and Covid inside One of the women on Ma\u2019s list is Patricia Wright. \u201cI\u2019m frail and I\u2019m just so afraid to die here,\u201d Wright, 68, said in a recent phone call from the California Institution for Women (CIW), east of Los Angeles, where 159 inmates have contracted coronavirus. She has terminal liver cancer, is currently in chemotherapy and probably has months to live: \u201cI suffer from loneliness. It\u2019s harder than cancer.\u201d It\u2019s heart-wrenching being away from my children and grandchildren. I just hope I can see them before I leave this world \u2013 Patricia Wright Wright has battled breast and ovarian cancer in the past, and has been incarcerated for more than two decades. She is legally blind and uses a wheelchair. She was convicted of murder, accused of hiring someone to kill her abusive husband. Wright has always maintained her innocence. \u201cI\u2019m no threat to society,\u201d said Wright. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Governor Gavin Newsom speak. I know if he knew my condition, he would listen to me.\u201d Maria Aredondo, 67, has stage II breast cancer, and is held in the same prison as Wright. As CIW has locked down in an attempt to contain Covid, it\u2019s been even harder for her to get basic medical attention, her family said. Aredondo was convicted of murder after her gun was used in a robbery attempt that turned fatal. According to her lawyers, she was moved to a dirty cell after returning from chemotherapy last month. No one checked on her, said her daughter, Maria Nu\u00f1ez. \u201cEvery time we hear from her she says her health is deteriorating,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez added.

Not since wood was the main source of American energy in the 19th century has a renewable resource been used more heavily than coal, but 2019 saw a historic reversal, according to US government figures.

That is roughly equal to the rate which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html\">measles kills children</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The coronavirus represents an especially contagious and deadly disease.</p> \n<p>Compared with <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758\">past coronavirus outbreaks</a>, Covid-19 is spread much more easily among people who show no symptoms, known as asymptomatic carriers. The virus is especially contagious, because of how it is shed from the upper respiratory tract \u2013 or the part of the body used to chant, cry and cough.&nbsp;Although death rates vary across countries, they <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">remain high</a>.</p> \n<p>Protesters or police shouting at the top of their lungs could spread viral droplets for which masks are a weak barrier. Holding hands could also spread contagion. Corralling protesters together makes social distancing impossible.

      "bodyText": "Two public health emergencies have collided in the United States: the Covid-19 pandemic, and the epidemic of police violence against people of color, particularly black Americans. As social unrest spurred by the police killing of George Floyd sweeps America, public health officials and government departments are grappling with the fear that demonstrators and police risk accelerating the spread of the coronavirus, which also disproportionately affects minority communities. \u201cThis is the worst possible thing that could happen,\u201d said Dr Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and an expert on pandemics. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how many of those people are asymptomatic carriers, and that\u2019s really scary.\u201d Several factors could contribute to the spread, including lack of social distancing, limitations of masks, and police tactics such as use of teargas and arrests. At the same time, the threat of infection is unlikely to deter demonstrators desperate for social change. In some cases, the rate of black men killed by police rivals that posed by serious infectious disease. \u201cProtests are life-saving for black people in this country,\u201d said Dr Rhea Boyd, pediatrician and masters of public health in minority health policy. \u201cEven though being in the streets increases your risk,\u201d of Covid-19 infection, \u201cwe all know that risk exists anyway.\u201d While Covid-19 has killed more than 100,000 Americas in just a few months, past studies have found one in 1,000 black men in American are expected to die by police violence in their lifetimes. That is roughly equal to the rate which measles kills children. The coronavirus represents an especially contagious and deadly disease. Compared with past coronavirus outbreaks, Covid-19 is spread much more easily among people who show no symptoms, known as asymptomatic carriers. The virus is especially contagious, because of how it is shed from the upper respiratory tract \u2013 or the part of the body used to chant, cry and cough. Although death rates vary across countries, they remain high. Protesters or police shouting at the top of their lungs could spread viral droplets for which masks are a weak barrier. Holding hands could also spread contagion. Corralling protesters together makes social distancing impossible. And thousands of people circulating together make contact tracing all but impossible. Protests have also shut down testing sites in some cities and states, including in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Jacksonville, Florida, Politico reported. At the same time, police tactics threaten to accelerate the spread of Covid-19. The use of teargas and pepper sprays are a public health nightmare. Both cause incessant coughing. Oil-based pepper sprays cause tears, mucus and saliva to pour from the eyes, nose and mouth. Teargas and pepper spray \u201cwould be the last agent I would use during this time period, for that reason,\u201d said Markel. \u201cYou amplify the possibility of spread.\u201d Quickly jailing protesters also holds unknown infection control risks, given the heavy presence of the virus in jails and prisons. Nina Fefferman is a professor at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, and a mathematical epidemiologist. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, her work focused on projecting the impact of mass incarceration on the spread of the virus. Because communities of color are disproportionately jailed, they were also most likely to be affected by outbreaks in jails and prisons. Protesters sent to jail for short periods in the current unrest are \u201ctemporarily increasing the number and also social diversity caught up in the criminal justice system, introducing them into a jail population, and then releasing them,\u201d said Fefferman. \u201cNone of it is good \u2013 but all of it is unusual.\u201d Four days of protest in Las Vegas provides an example of how this plays out on-the-ground. A local court ordinance asked police to release people charged with misdemeanors, rather than bring them into jail, to slow the spread of Covid-19.

At the same time, Covid-19 has already taken a devastating and disproportionate toll on black Americans, because of a laundry list of state policies.

Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have argued, as recently as 2017, that anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education and healthcare result in enormous gains in life expectancy for Americans of color \u2013 when they are enforced.

      "body": "<p>Health and social care workers could be asked to volunteer to look after people with Covid-19 without wearing protective equipment in the event of extreme shortages, according to proposals seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Councils oversee a range of services which require PPE but which are outside the NHS supply chain. These include care homes, pharmacies, mortuary and funeral services, children\u2019s homes and community mental health services. While these services have access to the national PPE stockpile there are sometimes&nbsp;shortages of key items. The PPE situation in NHS hospitals has improved since the start of the pandemic but gaps in community provision continue.</p> <p>Southampton city council has drawn up an ethical framework document to help councils plan for further waves of the pandemic.</p> <p>One proposal contained in internal documents marked \u201csensitive\u201d from a council planning to adopt the Southampton blueprint, shows that in the event of extreme shortages using PPE that has not been approved by regulators could be considered.</p> <p>In the event of having no PPE available at all, staff could be asked to volunteer to care for people who have or may be infected with Covid-19, without protective equipment.</p> <p>The document suggests that health and care workers who have already had Covid-19 may be suitable volunteers for this high-risk practice although it states that staff should not be put under undue pressure and that human rights legislation should be taken into account.</p> <p>The Unison senior national officer Gavin Edwards&nbsp;condemned the proposals. He said: \u201cExpecting care staff to work without safety kit&nbsp;would be a short-sighted and dangerous gamble. There would then be little, if anything, to stop the spread of the virus to staff, the people they care for and the wider community.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Jasmine Ho of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medsupplydrive.org.uk/\">Med Supply Drive</a>, a group of doctors responding to requests to source PPE for staff in hospitals and community settings, said 81% of its requests had come from community and social care providers. \u201cSome of the people who contact us requesting PPE sound quite desperate,\u201d said Ho. \u201cThere is a strong likelihood that there will be a second wave of Covid and we should be prepared. We find it unacceptable that more than 200 healthcare workers have died. In this local authority guidance it is incredibly irresponsible to be thinking about asking people to volunteer to work without PPE in a situation where none is available.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jenny Vaughan, law and policy lead&nbsp;at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dauk.org/\">Doctors\u2019 Association</a>, said: \u201cNobody should be put at unnecessary risk just for going in and doing their job. We simply don\u2019t know if having a positive antibody test confers safety and if it does, for how long. Asking staff, when there is no PPE, to expose themselves to risk in this way is not acceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Councillor Lorna Fielker, cabinet member for health and adult care at Southampton city council, said: \u201cWe recognised in light of the national pandemic there would be significant challenges for government in ensuring local areas had sufficient PPE&nbsp;to protect their key workers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-spilling-out-of-hospitals-and-care-homes-says-uk-expert\">Covid-19 spilling out of hospitals and care homes, says UK expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSouthampton city council developed a robust and transparent framework that can be used by other local authorities and partner agencies \u2026 to help them determine how they can prioritise and allocate PPE, in the event that PPE supply is insufficient to meet demand.</p> <p>\u201cThe framework is informed by ethical principles and advises organisations to consider the limits and level of risks to all staff (including, but not limited to, health and social care staff) if the organisation is not able to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE.</p> <p>\u201cThe framework acts as guidance, has not been used to date and is only to be used as a last resort by local authorities and partner agencies.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council, added: \u201cSouthampton city council and the strategic coordinating group for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight took proactive steps to develop a carefully considered, ethically informed and transparent framework to support decision-making, in consultation with a range of stakeholders, including trade unions.</p> <p>\u201cThe prioritisation framework was developed in April during the national shortage of PPE and submitted to the secretary of state for health and social care as evidence of the unacceptable reality of what we were having to plan for. It highlighted that the potential actions contained in the framework would not be considered appropriate or safe, and recommended that PPE shortages needed to be addressed at a national level.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a duty to plan for the reasonable worst-case scenario \u2013 in this case a situation whereby we were unable to fulfil at least minimal obligations to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE.&nbsp;The framework explicitly states that working in conditions without adequate PPE cannot be imposed on staff, and that we would not, in any circumstances, pressure staff to provide care or services without adequate PPE.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to add the response from Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council. </p></li> </ul>",

Southampton city council has drawn up an ethical framework document to help councils plan for further waves of the pandemic. One proposal contained in internal documents marked \u201csensitive\u201d from a council planning to adopt the Southampton blueprint, shows that in the event of extreme shortages using PPE that has not been approved by regulators could be considered. In the event of having no PPE available at all, staff could be asked to volunteer to care for people who have or may be infected with Covid-19, without protective equipment. The document suggests that health and care workers who have already had Covid-19 may be suitable volunteers for this high-risk practice although it states that staff should not be put under undue pressure and that human rights legislation should be taken into account. The Unison senior national officer Gavin Edwards condemned the proposals. He said: \u201cExpecting care staff to work without safety kit would be a short-sighted and dangerous gamble. There would then be little, if anything, to stop the spread of the virus to staff, the people they care for and the wider community.\u201d Jasmine Ho of Med Supply Drive, a group of doctors responding to requests to source PPE for staff in hospitals and community settings, said 81% of its requests had come from community and social care providers. \u201cSome of the people who contact us requesting PPE sound quite desperate,\u201d said Ho. \u201cThere is a strong likelihood that there will be a second wave of Covid and we should be prepared. We find it unacceptable that more than 200 healthcare workers have died. In this local authority guidance it is incredibly irresponsible to be thinking about asking people to volunteer to work without PPE in a situation where none is available.\u201d Dr Jenny Vaughan, law and policy lead at the Doctors\u2019 Association, said: \u201cNobody should be put at unnecessary risk just for going in and doing their job. We simply don\u2019t know if having a positive antibody test confers safety and if it does, for how long. Asking staff, when there is no PPE, to expose themselves to risk in this way is not acceptable.\u201d Councillor Lorna Fielker, cabinet member for health and adult care at Southampton city council, said: \u201cWe recognised in light of the national pandemic there would be significant challenges for government in ensuring local areas had sufficient PPE to protect their key workers. \u201cSouthampton city council developed a robust and transparent framework that can be used by other local authorities and partner agencies \u2026 to help them determine how they can prioritise and allocate PPE, in the event that PPE supply is insufficient to meet demand. \u201cThe framework is informed by ethical principles and advises organisations to consider the limits and level of risks to all staff (including, but not limited to, health and social care staff) if the organisation is not able to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE. \u201cThe framework acts as guidance, has not been used to date and is only to be used as a last resort by local authorities and partner agencies.\u201d Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council, added: \u201cSouthampton city council and the strategic coordinating group for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight took proactive steps to develop a carefully considered, ethically informed and transparent framework to support decision-making, in consultation with a range of stakeholders, including trade unions. \u201cThe prioritisation framework was developed in April during the national shortage of PPE and submitted to the secretary of state for health and social care as evidence of the unacceptable reality of what we were having to plan for. It highlighted that the potential actions contained in the framework would not be considered appropriate or safe, and recommended that PPE shortages needed to be addressed at a national level. \u201cWe have a duty to plan for the reasonable worst-case scenario \u2013 in this case a situation whereby we were unable to fulfil at least minimal obligations to provide appropriate safety and protection in relation to PPE. The framework explicitly states that working in conditions without adequate PPE cannot be imposed on staff, and that we would not, in any circumstances, pressure staff to provide care or services without adequate PPE.\u201d This article was amended on 4 June 2020 to add the response from Debbie Chase, interim director of Public Health at Southampton city council.",

With restaurants across France closed from March until Tuesday this week, farmers have struggled to sell the resulting glut of produce.&nbsp;<br></p> <p>The dense warren of surrounding streets is a culinary microcosm of Marseille\u2019s diverse population: there are Corsican fishmongers, halal butchers, Vietnamese grocery stores, Moroccan patisseries, Lebanese bakeries and west African canteens.

No longer, thanks to Covid-19. \u201cC\u2019est interdit,\u201d says manager Pierre Auteroche \u2013 known to all as Pierrot \u2013 his blue surgical mask hanging around his neck as he eats lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame but that\u2019s the way it is.\u201d The cafe is empty except for two customers sitting at separate tables. \u201cIt\u2019s the first day of our reopening,\u201d shrugs Pierrot. \u201cLet\u2019s see what happens.\u201d Prinder is one of the longest-running establishments in Noailles, a quartier known locally as the \u201cbelly\u201d of Marseille, France\u2019s oldest city. Outside on the market square, shoppers haggle at stalls spilling with seasonal fruit and vegetables from Provence. With restaurants across France closed from March until Tuesday this week, farmers have struggled to sell the resulting glut of produce. The dense warren of surrounding streets is a culinary microcosm of Marseille\u2019s diverse population: there are Corsican fishmongers, halal butchers, Vietnamese grocery stores, Moroccan patisseries, Lebanese bakeries and west African canteens. Most cafes and restaurants reopened yesterday in accordance with the government\u2019s second phase of d\u00e9confinement, but a number remain shuttered.

Britain, long described as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/18/doctors-soft-drinks-tax-obesity\">the fat man of Europe</a>\u201d also has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe. Almost 30% of adults in the UK are classed as obese. The figure is nearly 40% in the US, where Covid deaths have topped 100,000.</p> \n<p>It is striking, experts say, that wealthy countries appear to have higher mortality rates than impoverished ones. Africa so far has not experienced the explosion of deaths that Europe has. There will be many factors, and absence of good data collection will be one. But low rates of obesity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/type-2-diabetes-uk-obesity-crisis-nhs\">type 2 diabetes</a> and the chronic disease of the heart and other organs are likely to play a part.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

      "bodyText": "Less than a year ago, Boris Johnson was taking a stand. Milkshakes, he said, should not be taxed. \u201cIf we want people to lose weight and live healthier lifestyles, we should encourage people to walk, cycle and generally do more exercise. Rather than just taxing people more, we should look at how effective the so-called \u2018sin taxes\u2019 really are, and if they actually change behaviour.\u201d Since then, the world has been hit by a coronavirus pandemic, with the prime minister one of those infected. And Johnson, at least on the face of it, has changed his mind. Obesity was a problem before Covid-19, but this is an infectious disease that hits obese people disproportionately hard, no matter their income. Countries with high obesity rates from western Europe to the US are struggling to keep people alive in intensive care units. Britain, long described as \u201cthe fat man of Europe\u201d also has the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe. Almost 30% of adults in the UK are classed as obese. The figure is nearly 40% in the US, where Covid deaths have topped 100,000. It is striking, experts say, that wealthy countries appear to have higher mortality rates than impoverished ones. Africa so far has not experienced the explosion of deaths that Europe has. There will be many factors, and absence of good data collection will be one. But low rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes and the chronic disease of the heart and other organs are likely to play a part. Prof Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health in the US, says obesity \u201cweakens greatly our immune system\u201d. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says 73% of critically ill patients with Covid-19 in Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands are obese. In the UK, according to Prof John Wilding, the president of the World Obesity Federation, obesity doubles the chances of death. The non-profit organisation is publishing a dossier of evidence and guidance about obesity in Covid-19 on its website on Wednesday, setting out what has been established so far.

Referring to today\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed75eda8f087122eca54958#block-5ed75eda8f087122eca54958\">Telegraph story</a>, he asked who has been in charge of the UK\u2019s coronavirus response up to now.</p> \n<p>Boris Johnson&nbsp;also condemned what happened to George Floyd. But he said people should protest in a peaceful way. He said he took full responsibility for the UK coronavirus strategy. He said people know that \u201cwith good British common sense\u201d we can tackle this.</p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said Johnson asks him to cooperate but didn\u2019t reply to a letter he sent privately offering his cooperation on schools. He also said a survey at the weekend showed a huge fall in trust in the government. Johnson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>replied that he phoned Starmer after he got the letter and said Starmer did not criticise his policy. He said the public were following the government guidance. Starmer&nbsp;replied that he would publish his letter.</p> \n<p>Starmer said the government should have been working on a test and trace system for weeks. Dido Harding, who is in charge of the system, said it would not be fully ready until the end of June. Johnson&nbsp;accused Starmer of casting aspersions on the people behind the scheme and said it was up and running on 1 June. He said thousands of people were now self-isolating.</p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said Johnson did not put a number on those being contacted and added that the number infected each day was far bigger than those tested. He said the system should contact 45,000 people a day. He quoted the UK Statistics Authority criticism of the government and asked the PM whether he could see how much damage was being done to trust?</p> \n<p>Johnson&nbsp;said Starmer continues to undermine trust in government and asked for some credit for the people involved. Starmer responded that Johnson was mistaking scrutiny for attacks. </p> \n<p>Starmer said he would like to support the government\u2019s policy but Johnson made it difficult. He said the government said it would not relax the lockdown until the alert level was lowered. What was it now, and what was the R number?</p> \n<p>Johnson&nbsp;said the alert level did allow the lockdown to be relaxed, even though it had not been lowered. </p> \n<p>Starmer&nbsp;said scenes in parliament of MPs forming a kilometre-long queue to vote were \u201cshameful\u201d and excluded MPs who were shielding. If any other employer operated like this, it would be a clear and obvious case of discrimination. Will the PM stop this?</p> \n<p>Johnson<strong>&nbsp;</strong>said people around the country were having to queue. He said it was not unreasonable to expect MPs to do their job. He also said older MPs and those shielding should be allowed to vote by proxy. </p> \n<h2>Snap verdict</h2> \n<p>Sir Keir Starmer gave&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/keir-starmer-warns-pm-get-a-grip-or-risk-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">an interview to the Guardian</a>&nbsp;that was interpreted by us, and others, as indicating a hardening of his stance against the government - less consensus-seeking, more condemnatory. Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that when Johnson pledged to ensure all test results are turned around within 24 hours by the end of the month (there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52904433\">according to the BBC</a>).</p> \n<p>This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best of times. But given that the PM is facing criticism for not even doing his own job properly, it was unwise to invest so much in attacking Starmer for doing his.</p>",

Johnson said Starmer continues to undermine trust in government and asked for some credit for the people involved. Starmer responded that Johnson was mistaking scrutiny for attacks. Starmer said he would like to support the government\u2019s policy but Johnson made it difficult. He said the government said it would not relax the lockdown until the alert level was lowered. What was it now, and what was the R number? Johnson said the alert level did allow the lockdown to be relaxed, even though it had not been lowered. Starmer said scenes in parliament of MPs forming a kilometre-long queue to vote were \u201cshameful\u201d and excluded MPs who were shielding. If any other employer operated like this, it would be a clear and obvious case of discrimination. Will the PM stop this? Johnson said people around the country were having to queue. He said it was not unreasonable to expect MPs to do their job. He also said older MPs and those shielding should be allowed to vote by proxy. Snap verdict Sir Keir Starmer gave an interview to the Guardian that was interpreted by us, and others, as indicating a hardening of his stance against the government - less consensus-seeking, more condemnatory. Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that here, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably. It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that when Johnson pledged to ensure all test results are turned around within 24 hours by the end of the month (there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, according to the BBC). This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best of times. But given that the PM is facing criticism for not even doing his own job properly, it was unwise to invest so much in attacking Starmer for doing his.",

      "bodyText": "Women picking strawberries in Spain for UK supermarkets are facing new forms of exploitation, unions and lawyers warn, as the industry is hit by labour shortages caused by the coronavirus pandemic. This week a coalition of rights groups and lawyers have appealed to the United Nations to urgently investigate allegations of deteriorating working conditions and a lack of protection for workers against Covid-19 infection. Every year thousands of migrant workers, mainly women, travel to southern Spain from Morocco on a bilateral visa arrangement to pick soft fruits and berries in Huelva. In early summer the fruit is sent to supermarkets across Europe. Last year, soft fruit exports from Huelva alone were worth \u20ac994m. Spain\u2019s strawberry industry has been plagued by allegations that some Moroccan women working in its export fruit industry have suffered sexual violence, exploitation and assault while working on farms in Huelva. This year only 7,000 of the estimated 18,000 seasonal workers expected to travel between Morocco and Spain made it to Huelva, as borders shut across Europe in early March to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Ana Pinto, spokesperson of Jornaleras en Lucha, the workers\u2019 rights group in Huelva, said the labour shortage had led to already vulnerable migrant workers being placed under more pressure to get the fruit off the fields. \u201cFewer seasonal workers were able to reach Spain this year,\u201d she said. \u201cThis has meant that the conditions in the field, both for locals and for those who have come from abroad, are being much more abusive, [the workers are] having to pick many more kilos, and having to do more overtime. Masks and gloves are still not being provided, she said: \u201cWe reported more than ten companies for not respecting the security measures. In some of them, they are now trying to respect the security distances, making the workers work separately, each in an opposite end of the row. But there are still crowds. The companies have not provided any masks or gloves for anyone, not before nor now.\u201d Hannah Wilson, a legal advocate at Women\u2019s Link Worldwide in Madrid, a group collecting evidence from unions and workers, said the UN and Spanish authorities need to give the situation urgent attention. \u201cWorking and living conditions are worsening.

These women are vulnerable because they have families at home, young children who are dependent on their income.\u201d The Guardian has reported on dire and sometimes exploitative conditions in the fruit and vegetable picking regions of southern Spain that supply berries and salad to supermarkets across Europe. Last month Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, visited Spain; his report was highly critical of the conditions for migrant workers in Huelva. \u201cI visited areas I suspect many Spaniards would not recognise as a part of their country,\u201d Alston said. \u201cIn Huelva, I met with workers living in a migrant settlement in conditions that rival the worst I have seen anywhere in the world.

They include rugby matches, horse races, musical concerts and dog shows attended, in total, by hundreds of thousands of Britons.</p> <p>One of those at Anfield was Simon Renoldi, 48, an Essex businessman and pub-restaurant owner. A lifelong Liverpool supporter, he travelled up on the train from Euston station in London with his young son.</p> <p>\u201cWe were in first class on the train, and we passed through a few carriages of Madrid fans, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when I caught the virus, or at the game,\u201d he said.

Around 3,000 Atletico supporters were allowed to come from Madrid, a Covid-19 hotspot already, where crowds at football matches <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/22/liverpool-atletico-madrid-coronavirus-champions-league\">had just been banned and schools closed</a>.<br><br>Nobody who has had Covid-19, or the families of almost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-nears-50000-latest-official-figures-show\">50,000 British people</a> who have since died from the virus, can be certain when they caught it. But Renoldi is one of almost 200 people who have contacted the Guardian in recent weeks to say they believe they became infected during the course of a major event in those first two weeks of March.</p> <p>As the death toll in Britain has risen to become the highest in Europe, the initial policy of Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 to dismiss other countries\u2019 rapid responses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">allow the virus to spread</a> \u2013 has been subjected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/bereaved-families-seek-justice-for-uk-victims-of-coronavirus\">unforgiving scrutiny</a>. Permitting the \u201cmass gatherings\u201d to continue has become an emblem of the government\u2019s inaction, captured most vividly in pictures of teeming crowds at the Cheltenham horse racing festival from 10-13 March.</p> <p>The full impact the events had will never be known, but a broader picture is beginning to emerge. Having examined his evidence, Prof Tim Spector, of the <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Covid-19 Symptom Study</a>, told the BBC last week that \u201csporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier, because they\u2019ll have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52797002\">caused increased suffering and death that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have occurred</a>\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018I will never forget that day\u2019</h2> <p>Renoldi recalled a landmark football occasion at Anfield that day. \u201cBecause the game was on and the government advice was that it was safe to be held, you couldn\u2019t have kept me away,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days after the match I had it: dry cough, hot sweats, short breath, gritty lungs.\u201d<br><br>When he felt the symptoms, he self-isolated, but then Simon\u2019s father, Gino, 75, who had diabetes and other health issues but was still working at the pub and living above it, fell ill.

They let three of us in, and we had the last 20 minutes with him, then they turned off the machine. I will never, ever forget that day.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab7cc6577f0bdd2e8e4ed45636a9635a2d4fb026\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab7cc6577f0bdd2e8e4ed45636a9635a2d4fb026/0_928_3024_1814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon with his father, Gino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon with his father, Gino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only eight people were allowed at the funeral. \u201cMum had to grieve on her own after that,\u201d Renoldi said. \u201cThe Covid-19 test came back negative but they\u2019re not always accurate are they? A respiratory consultant at the hospital told us that he was sure it was covid.\u201d<br><br>Reflecting on the match, he said: \u201cNow so many people have died from covid, it\u2019s obvious a lot of things should have been stopped sooner and the game should not have been held.\u201d<br><br>The justification still maintained by ministers for waving ahead that match, the Cheltenham festival, music concerts and other \u201cmass gatherings\u201d \u2013 before they were finally stopped on 16 March \u2013 is that they carried a \u201clow risk\u201d of people transmitting the virus.</p> <p>That was underpinned by advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) that critics now argue looks confusing and alarmingly superficial.<br><br>Sage scientists advise that although such events draw huge crowds, they involve little close human contact, partly because spectators are outdoors. On 11 February, the Sage sub-group SPI-M <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873748/12-spi-m-o-consensus-view-on-public-gatherings.pdf\">noted</a> that \u201cin most larger events, such as sports matches, attendees will come into close contact with at most a handful of people, so the risk to attendees is low.\u201d.</p> <p>But that claim seems to be based on assumptions, not on a researched examination of people\u2019s movements at such events: the nationwide and international travelling, the eating, drinking, shopping, and all-day cramming together involved in a modern sporting or cultural event.</p> <p>The Guardian asked the Government Office for Science, which represents Sage, if the advice was based on detailed scientific research. It did not respond.<br><br>The other element of the Sage advice is about scale: scientists in the group argue that while mass events look as if they would spread a virus, and some people undoubtedly do become infected, only a small proportion of the population attends, so stopping the events is not significant for a nationwide response to a pandemic. </p> <p>Minutes of Sage meetings published for the first time last week <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882718/21-potential-impact-behavioural-social-interventions-04032020.pdf\">reveal that</a> as late as 3 March, the scientists advised: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Johnson government\u2019s decision to allow mass gatherings to take place was not solely because they were considered \u201clow risk\u201d. At that time, the government was not stopping any activities, including those regarded as higher risk: allowing schools, workplaces, pubs, cinemas and restaurants to remain open.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Several people said they found themselves on packed trains to Cheltenham, or on the platform at Birmingham New Street when it was crammed with racegoers, and later came down with Covid-19.</p> <p>Geoff Beadnell, a retired businessman, marked his 71st birthday on 11 April on a Covid-19 high-dependency ward at Cheltenham general hospital, having been to the Gold Cup, the festival\u2019s finale, on 13 March.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing made me convinced I was infected when we went racing,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember queueing for the bar, it was packed, and a guy right in front of me was clearly unwell and sweating; I tried to back away from him but you couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>A week later he began to have \u201creally hot sweats\u201d, and developed a sore throat, then breathing problems.

The events are outside, and \u201cyou don\u2019t actually come into contact with that many people. So the total number of contacts made in these situations compared with every day in a pub for instance, is really negligible.\u201d</p> <h2>Postcode data</h2> <p>However, there is evidence suggesting mass gatherings did have a significant impact on the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Cheltenham became a coronavirus hotspot in the south-west after the festival, and Liverpool cases rose significantly following the Atletico match. <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">The official government data on </a><a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/#category=ltlas&amp;map=rate&amp;area=e08000012\">Covid-19 cases</a>&nbsp;states that on 12 March, there were only nine cases in Liverpool; by 11 April, there were 937. </p> <p>Postcode data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs\">leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>&nbsp;showed that on 3 April, the area of GL52, next to Cheltenham racecourse, had the <a href=\"https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/cheltenham-news/leaked-map-shows-postcode-next-4071259\">highest number of hospitalised Covid-19 sufferers in Gloucestershire</a>.

Stopping Cheltenham on its own would not have preserved the UK from the pandemic, but delays in a coherent response made the initial surge more intense, and cost lives.\u201d<br><br>Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser from 2000-07, argues that major events are \u201cideal\u201d spreading episodes. Told by the Guardian that Sage scientists had advised that large gatherings have minimal impact on the spread of the virus, King said: \u201cI find it very difficult to believe scientists said that; I am absolutely astounded.\u201d<br><br>He pointed out that countries that responded well to Covid-19, and kept cases low, banned crowds at events early, including Greece, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cYou need to get in early, test, trace and isolate infectious people, take all action to stop the virus spreading. But here they allowed the virus to spread. There is nothing to be said for going down the herd immunity route; it involves so many deaths.\u201d<br><br>The DHSC denied again that it was ever part of its plan to allow the virus to spread and attain herd immunity. </p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson maintained the position stated by Hancock on 16 March: that \u201cthe risks of transmission at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low\u201d. Yet despite that stance, crowds are not being allowed at horseracing or Premier League matches as they restart; health concerns are now expressed about people gathering even outside stadiums without social distancing.<br><br>The DHSC did not acknowledge any mistakes or regret, and issued its standard statement. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the latest scientific advice,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government\u2019s clear strategy all along has been to protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d<br><br>Renoldi was at Hillsborough as a Liverpool supporter on 15 April 1989, and survived the terrible crush that killed 96 people.</p> <p>After that disaster, a whole architecture of safety legislation was constructed to protect people from ever again being killed at a sporting event. Those who have lost loved ones as a result of such events going ahead earlier this year are now asking if that public health principle has been overturned.</p> <p>\u201cNow it feels terrible, horrendous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that match should not have gone ahead. It\u2019s another disaster. The people responsible should be held accountable for the decisions they took, and lessons learned so this can never happen again.\u201d</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Caroline Bannock</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The last major football match played in England before all sport was suspended because of the coronavirus crisis was the European Champions League showpiece between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid. It was a thrilling contest that transfixed 54,000 people under the floodlights of Anfield. But now that match, along with many other mass events that the government allowed to go ahead as the pandemic spread in March, is coming under renewed scrutiny as evidence grows of the lethal danger to which people were exposed. They include rugby matches, horse races, musical concerts and dog shows attended, in total, by hundreds of thousands of Britons. One of those at Anfield was Simon Renoldi, 48, an Essex businessman and pub-restaurant owner. A lifelong Liverpool supporter, he travelled up on the train from Euston station in London with his young son. \u201cWe were in first class on the train, and we passed through a few carriages of Madrid fans, so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s when I caught the virus, or at the game,\u201d he said. Anfield was packed, as were the old Victorian pubs around it, and the stadium\u2019s bars, megastore, snack bars, and the corporate areas where Renoldi had his seats. At the time, the government\u2019s official policy was to \u201ccontain\u201d the coronavirus, although an initial testing and tracing effort had been overwhelmed and was abandoned the following day. Around 3,000 Atletico supporters were allowed to come from Madrid, a Covid-19 hotspot already, where crowds at football matches had just been banned and schools closed. Nobody who has had Covid-19, or the families of almost 50,000 British people who have since died from the virus, can be certain when they caught it. But Renoldi is one of almost 200 people who have contacted the Guardian in recent weeks to say they believe they became infected during the course of a major event in those first two weeks of March. As the death toll in Britain has risen to become the highest in Europe, the initial policy of Boris Johnson\u2019s government \u2013 to dismiss other countries\u2019 rapid responses and allow the virus to spread \u2013 has been subjected to unforgiving scrutiny. Permitting the \u201cmass gatherings\u201d to continue has become an emblem of the government\u2019s inaction, captured most vividly in pictures of teeming crowds at the Cheltenham horse racing festival from 10-13 March. The full impact the events had will never be known, but a broader picture is beginning to emerge. Having examined his evidence, Prof Tim Spector, of the Covid-19 Symptom Study, told the BBC last week that \u201csporting events should have been shut down at least a week earlier, because they\u2019ll have caused increased suffering and death that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have occurred\u201d. \u2018I will never forget that day\u2019 Renoldi recalled a landmark football occasion at Anfield that day. \u201cBecause the game was on and the government advice was that it was safe to be held, you couldn\u2019t have kept me away,\u201d he said. \u201cA few days after the match I had it: dry cough, hot sweats, short breath, gritty lungs.\u201d When he felt the symptoms, he self-isolated, but then Simon\u2019s father, Gino, 75, who had diabetes and other health issues but was still working at the pub and living above it, fell ill. On 3 April, he collapsed. \u201cThey managed to get his heart going again, and took him to Basildon hospital, but within three hours we were told his lungs were in a very bad way and he wasn\u2019t going to survive. They let three of us in, and we had the last 20 minutes with him, then they turned off the machine. I will never, ever forget that day.\u201d Only eight people were allowed at the funeral. \u201cMum had to grieve on her own after that,\u201d Renoldi said. \u201cThe Covid-19 test came back negative but they\u2019re not always accurate are they? A respiratory consultant at the hospital told us that he was sure it was covid.\u201d Reflecting on the match, he said: \u201cNow so many people have died from covid, it\u2019s obvious a lot of things should have been stopped sooner and the game should not have been held.\u201d The justification still maintained by ministers for waving ahead that match, the Cheltenham festival, music concerts and other \u201cmass gatherings\u201d \u2013 before they were finally stopped on 16 March \u2013 is that they carried a \u201clow risk\u201d of people transmitting the virus. That was underpinned by advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) that critics now argue looks confusing and alarmingly superficial. Sage scientists advise that although such events draw huge crowds, they involve little close human contact, partly because spectators are outdoors. On 11 February, the Sage sub-group SPI-M noted that \u201cin most larger events, such as sports matches, attendees will come into close contact with at most a handful of people, so the risk to attendees is low.\u201d. But that claim seems to be based on assumptions, not on a researched examination of people\u2019s movements at such events: the nationwide and international travelling, the eating, drinking, shopping, and all-day cramming together involved in a modern sporting or cultural event. The Guardian asked the Government Office for Science, which represents Sage, if the advice was based on detailed scientific research. It did not respond. The other element of the Sage advice is about scale: scientists in the group argue that while mass events look as if they would spread a virus, and some people undoubtedly do become infected, only a small proportion of the population attends, so stopping the events is not significant for a nationwide response to a pandemic. Minutes of Sage meetings published for the first time last week reveal that as late as 3 March, the scientists advised: \u201cThere is currently no evidence that cancelling large events would be effective.\u201d However, the Johnson government\u2019s decision to allow mass gatherings to take place was not solely because they were considered \u201clow risk\u201d. At that time, the government was not stopping any activities, including those regarded as higher risk: allowing schools, workplaces, pubs, cinemas and restaurants to remain open. Although the government still insists that attaining \u201cherd immunity\u201d was not part of its plan, its chief scientific adviser and the chair of Sage, Sir Patrick Vallance, explained on 13 March that allowing 60% of the population to become infected, then recover and attain herd immunity, was one of \u201cthe key things we need to do\u201d. Vallance and other senior figures said multiple times they did not want to delay or mitigate the virus\u2019s spread too early, because the aim was to flatten the peak and maintain a manageable flow of critical cases into the NHS. Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College and a leading Sage scientist before he stepped down on 5 May for breaching the lockdown, told the Guardian he had informed the government well before March that under the \u201cmitigation\u201d policy they were planning, about 250,000 people would die. Asked to confirm if that was true, both Downing Street and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) declined to comment. Other mass gatherings The ordeals of the many people who believe they were infected at major events \u2013 including the England v Wales rugby international at Twickenham on 7 March, which Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, attended; Stereophonics concerts in Cardiff, the Crufts dog show, the All England badminton tournament in Birmingham, and others \u2013 present a damning case that serious dangers to public health were created by allowing the events to go ahead. First, they are a reminder of how dangerous the virus is: many people became seriously ill, some critically, many have still not recovered. Joel Rookwood, a university lecturer who fell ill days after the Liverpool match, said he still has \u201cprolonged fatigue\u201d, shortness of breath, and feels \u201cvery old and weak.\u201d. All the events drew people from across the country and internationally, risking infection to people in the host city and in the places visitors came from and returned to. Martin Middleton, 57, a chief executive in Dublin, went to Twickenham with eight friends from the UK and Spain; five developed symptoms, he ended up in hospital with viral pneumonia, and he knows of at least 14 more people he believes were infected by his group. Numerous people said they believed they were infected at the Cheltenham festival, which attracted 260,000 racegoers to the Gloucestershire town. Jax Hill-Wilson, 63, said she was sure she became infected there while working in corporate hospitality, and she believes she subsequently infected other people close to her. Several people said they found themselves on packed trains to Cheltenham, or on the platform at Birmingham New Street when it was crammed with racegoers, and later came down with Covid-19. Geoff Beadnell, a retired businessman, marked his 71st birthday on 11 April on a Covid-19 high-dependency ward at Cheltenham general hospital, having been to the Gold Cup, the festival\u2019s finale, on 13 March. \u201cThe timing made me convinced I was infected when we went racing,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember queueing for the bar, it was packed, and a guy right in front of me was clearly unwell and sweating; I tried to back away from him but you couldn\u2019t.\u201d A week later he began to have \u201creally hot sweats\u201d, and developed a sore throat, then breathing problems. After calling 111 on three consecutive days, then his GP, he was taken to hospital by ambulance and within 10 minutes was wired up to machines in an isolation ward. \u201cIt was horrendous,\u201d Beadnell said. \u201cI didn\u2019t eat for five days; I had two blood transfusions, they put me on an oxygen machine \u2013 a Cpap \u2013 the mask is horrible, it gave me nasal and throat infections and I have scars on my eyes.\u201d He said of the festival being on: \u201cThe excuse was that it was outdoors and you didn\u2019t have to be close to people, but we were packed like sardines; you couldn\u2019t put a bet on, get a drink or go to the toilet and not be crammed together. Now I\u2019m just grateful to be alive.\u201d Debbie Clifford, 56, a credit controller who lives near Cheltenham, did not go to the races, but said she believed she was infected in town on one of the days it was packed. She fell ill on 21 March, had extreme fatigue, then could not breathe. On 2 April she was admitted to intensive care. \u201cThere were 15 or 20 people there on ventilators; I was the only one conscious,\u201d Clifford said. \u201cI was on my side so could only see one person; I think he died. They moved me to a side ward for covid patients and on 5 April I thought I wasn\u2019t going to survive. The next day, four people on the ward died. But I had a miraculous turnaround. On 7 April they let me come home. I was absolutely terrified because I felt 100 years old, frail, and needed a Zimmer frame. I haven\u2019t recovered yet.\u201d When Clifford discussed the races going ahead, and recalls Vallance explaining herd immunity, she became emotional. \u201cI\u2019m a rational person, a financial auditor, I\u2019m all about facts. I\u2019m from a Conservative-supporting family,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do believe the government was willing to sacrifice people, the old and the sick, which would save them money, and get their herd immunity.\u201d Prof John Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and a leading Sage member, explained to the Guardian his basis for advising that \u201cmass gatherings\u201d had little impact on the spread of a virus. \u201cVery few people actually go to these events\u201d as a proportion of the population. The events are outside, and \u201cyou don\u2019t actually come into contact with that many people. So the total number of contacts made in these situations compared with every day in a pub for instance, is really negligible.\u201d Postcode data However, there is evidence suggesting mass gatherings did have a significant impact on the spread of the disease. Cheltenham became a coronavirus hotspot in the south-west after the festival, and Liverpool cases rose significantly following the Atletico match. The official government data on Covid-19 cases states that on 12 March, there were only nine cases in Liverpool; by 11 April, there were 937. Postcode data leaked to the Local Democracy Reporting Service showed that on 3 April, the area of GL52, next to Cheltenham racecourse, had the highest number of hospitalised Covid-19 sufferers in Gloucestershire. And The Covid-19 Symptom Study has found that by 29 March Liverpool and Cheltenham were among the UK\u2019s most infected areas, with an estimated 5%-6% of people aged 20 to 69 reporting symptoms. The data consultancy Edge Health last month analysed the number of people dying at the hospitals closest to Anfield, Cheltenham racecourse and Old Trafford, where 76,000 people watched Manchester United play Manchester City on 8 March. They found that 35 days later, each had had approximately 40 more Covid-19-related deaths than comparable hospitals nearby. Meanwhile, some scientists who do not sit on Sage have reached very different conclusions to the government\u2019s experts. Dr William Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard, says that many contacts are made at a packed modern event, and that the large crowds increase the chance of superspreading. \u201cCancelling large events at the early stage of a pandemic is an essential part of reducing opportunities for transmission. Stopping Cheltenham on its own would not have preserved the UK from the pandemic, but delays in a coherent response made the initial surge more intense, and cost lives.\u201d Sir David King, the chief scientific adviser from 2000-07, argues that major events are \u201cideal\u201d spreading episodes. Told by the Guardian that Sage scientists had advised that large gatherings have minimal impact on the spread of the virus, King said: \u201cI find it very difficult to believe scientists said that; I am absolutely astounded.\u201d He pointed out that countries that responded well to Covid-19, and kept cases low, banned crowds at events early, including Greece, Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. \u201cYou need to get in early, test, trace and isolate infectious people, take all action to stop the virus spreading. But here they allowed the virus to spread. There is nothing to be said for going down the herd immunity route; it involves so many deaths.\u201d The DHSC denied again that it was ever part of its plan to allow the virus to spread and attain herd immunity. A DHSC spokesperson maintained the position stated by Hancock on 16 March: that \u201cthe risks of transmission at mass gatherings such as sporting events are relatively low\u201d. Yet despite that stance, crowds are not being allowed at horseracing or Premier League matches as they restart; health concerns are now expressed about people gathering even outside stadiums without social distancing. The DHSC did not acknowledge any mistakes or regret, and issued its standard statement. \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the latest scientific advice,\u201d it said. \u201cThe government\u2019s clear strategy all along has been to protect our NHS and save lives.\u201d Renoldi was at Hillsborough as a Liverpool supporter on 15 April 1989, and survived the terrible crush that killed 96 people. After that disaster, a whole architecture of safety legislation was constructed to protect people from ever again being killed at a sporting event. Those who have lost loved ones as a result of such events going ahead earlier this year are now asking if that public health principle has been overturned. \u201cNow it feels terrible, horrendous,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that match should not have gone ahead. It\u2019s another disaster. The people responsible should be held accountable for the decisions they took, and lessons learned so this can never happen again.\u201d Additional reporting by Caroline Bannock",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced a government U-turn to allow MPs who are shielding to vote by proxy following an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions or those who are looking after vulnerable loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. It follows a government move to drop the use of virtual measures in the Commons, as critics including 31 Conservative MPs voted to keep remote tools in place. On Tuesday, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, declined to endorse a proxy vote system, instead saying that vulnerable MPs could be paired. The government voted down virtual measures and was ridiculed over the \u201csocially distanced conga\u201d of politicians that snaked around parliament waiting to vote. At prime minister\u2019s questions, Johnson said MPs who were vulnerable would be able to vote remotely. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, told the prime minster that the scenes of MPs either queuing to vote or unable to vote on Tuesday were shameful. \u201cIf any other employer acted like this it would be a clear and obvious case of indirect discrimination under the Equalities Act,\u201d he said. Johnson replied: \u2018I do not think it\u2019s unreasonable that we should ask parliamentarians to come back to this place and do their job for the people of this country. \u201cI know it is difficult and I apologise to all of those who are shielding or they are elderly. They should be able to vote by proxy,\u201d he said. At present, pregnant MPs and those who are on maternity or paternity leave are allowed to use colleagues as proxy votes under reforms introduced in 2019. Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, who is shielding, welcomed the move. \u201cThe good news is that the PM @BorisJohnson has just announced will allow #COVID19 affected MPs to vote via proxy,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Rees-Mogg\u2019s office confirmed that a motion extending proxy voting arrangements to MPs who are shielding and those over the age of 70 will be tabled for Thursday. Karen Bradley, the chair of the procedures committee, and Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant are expected to table amendments on Tuesday to the motion to allow for parts of the so-called \u201chybrid proceedings\u201d to continue. This would mean any MPs who cannot get to the Commons during the pandemic can take part in debates and committees over Zoom and vote online \u2013 as they have done since the middle of April. Bradley on Tuesday put forward an amendment to the government\u2019s plan to allow remote voting.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump said he will seek a new state to host this summer\u2019s Republican national convention after North Carolina refused to guarantee the event could be held in Charlotte without size restrictions because of ongoing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. The president has lobbied for a full-scale convention without face coverings, despite the threat of the virus. His demands are likely to be extremely difficult as several years of planning go into party conventions. Trump announced his desire for a change on Twitter, complaining that North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and other officials \u201crefuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena\u201d and were not \u201callowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised\u201d. Demands for a full-scale convention had raised alarms in North Carolina, which is facing an upward trend in its virus cases. The state has roughly 29,900 cumulative cases and 900 deaths as of Tuesday. About 700 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized.

Officials in both parties have been preparing contingency plans for months given the uncertainty and dangers posed by the virus and evolving restrictions on large gatherings meant to slow the spread of Covid-19. Cooper made clear to Trump that a full-scale convention would probably be impossible to accommodate given the status of the pandemic in his state, and formalized that on Tuesday in a letter to the RNC. \u201cWe think it is unlikely that we would be to the point at the end of August to be able to have a jam-packed 19,000-person convention in the Spectrum arena,\u201d Cooper said in a letter to Ronna McDaniel, RNC chair. \u201cSo the likelihood of it being in Charlotte depends upon the RNC\u2019s willingness to discuss with us a scaled-down convention.\u201d That prompted the RNC to begin visiting potential alternative sites in GOP-led states, as Republican governors offered up their states.

      "bodyText": "Companies offering short-term loans to consumers have been urged by the financial ombudsman to prioritise the needs of their customers and warned that borrowers were already struggling with unmanageable levels of debt before the coronavirus crisis began. In recent years the Financial Ombudsman Service has dealt with thousands of complaints from borrowers who took out payday loans and other short-term borrowing that they could not afford to repay. The industry boomed after the banking crisis, when mainstream banks became reluctant to lend and consumers\u2019 wages were frozen, but has been in difficulties since the City watchdog, the FCA, started to crack down on interest rates and lending practices. Several lenders, including Wonga and, more recently, Brighthouse, have fallen into administration as a result of the cost of compensating consumers who were given loans without adequate checks. The Financial Ombudsman Service said that it has upheld 70% of complaints against payday loan companies over the past year. Guarantor loans, where the debt is backed by a friend or relative of the borrower, were the subject of just 1,043 of the 271,468 complaints received by the ombudsman over the year, but in 89% of the completed cases it found in the customer\u2019s favour. On Monday, it was announced that the UK\u2019s largest guarantor loan provider, Amigo, was the subject of an investigation by the FCA. The chief ombudsman, Caroline Wayman, said: \u201cBefore Covid-19 was on our horizon, we\u2019d also been hearing from tens of thousands of people struggling with unmanageable levels of debt. \u201cDuring a year when we saw yet more lenders sink under the weight of past unfairness, we continued to raise concerns with firms in this sector about the disappointing proportion of cases where they\u2019d failed to ensure customers\u2019 borrowing was affordable and sustainable.\u201d Wayman said it was time for lenders \u201cto genuinely prioritise customers\u2019 long-term interests\u201d, as there was potential for borrowers to be vulnerable after the crisis. The ombudsman\u2019s annual report showed that payment protection insurance continued to be the most complained about product, and was the subject of 122,153 complaints over the year. Just 17% of the PPI cases resolved during the year were settled in the customer\u2019s favour. The service also reported an increase in the number of consumers complaining about credit card companies and banks refusing to pay out under section 75, which covers spending if a company goes out of business or fails to honour a contract. It said many had arisen after two large travel companies, Thomas Cook and Flybe, went into administration. The current turmoil in the travel industry could lead to many more of these cases as consumers seek refunds for trips they have been unable to take. Wayman said: \u201cThe unprecedented Covid-19 situation has already given rise to many new and complex questions of fairness when things go wrong in financial arrangements.\u201d She said customers unhappy with how a complaint had been resolved should contact the service for free help.",

Johnson replied: \u201cThat depends, I\u2019m afraid, on the outcome of our negotiations, as she knows well. But I\u2019m absolutely confident that our friends and partners will see sense in the great mutual benefit of continuing to collaborate in exactly the way we do.\u201d Twenty minutes later, May expressed her concern again, this time more openly, adding her criticism of the government\u2019s new 14-day quarantine system for overseas arrivals, which begins next week. The former prime minister said the aviation industry sustained millions of jobs. \u201cInternational air travel is necessary for trade,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout it there is no global Britain. So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard, to save jobs and ensure that Britain is open for business?\u201d The interventions herald two potentially difficult areas for Johnson in the coming weeks and months. The latest round of Brexit talks are under way this week, but with few signs of an imminent breakthrough in areas such as mutal standards and fishing rights. The former prime minister is likely to be among a number of Tory MPs who would express concern if a no-deal end to the transition period may mean the UK losing access to data and information sharing in areas such as security. More immediately, a number of Conservatives are angered by the quarantine plan, saying it will provide little public health benefit, and will badly affect the travel and aviation industries. May criticised the plan during an urgent question on quarantine in the Commons from Huw Merriman, the Tory chair of the transport select committee, who is a persistent critic of the scheme.",

As supply chains began to awaken from their deep slumber, continuing logistics challenges increased costs for some firms though reduced wage bills helped to alleviate the pressure. </p> <p>As restrictions are eased, there is still extreme uncertainty about how the pandemic will pan out.

Markets have shrugged off the growing protests against police brutality in the US after the killing of George Floyd in police custody. The protests have been largely peaceful, despite a forceful police response. Oil prices also rallied to three-month highs, with Brent crude rising above $40 a barrel, before falling back as doubts crept in over the timing and scale of a potential extension of production cuts agreed between the Opec cartel and its allies. Gold and silver prices, which rallied at the start of the week amid safe-haven buying, fell, with spot silver down 3% to $17.49 an ounce. We are closing for the day, and will be back from 8am tomorrow. Good-bye! Global stocks are extending gains on the news. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 2.14% to 6,352 Germany\u2019s Dax up 2.7% to 12,345 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 2.48% to 4,979 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 2.99% to 19,537 Dow Jones up 0.92% to 25,979 Nasdaq up 0.57% to 9,663 S&amp;P 500 up 0.78% to 3,104 This compares with 41.8 in April. The UK and European services PMIs were also revised higher, even though they indicated further contraction, while China\u2019s services index jumped to the highest in nearly 10 years and pointed to growth. The closely-watched US non-manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management is out. It\u2019s better than expected at 45.4, inching closer to the 50 mark that divides contraction from expansion. The US services business activity index from IHS Markit posted 37.5 in May, up from April\u2019s record low of 26.7 and slightly higher than the flash estimate of 36.9. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction. This means the downturn in services eased last month as some businesses returned to work, but was still the second-biggest decline since data collection began in October 2009. We are waiting for the more important ISM survey, out in four minutes. The opening bell has rung on Wall Street. Dow Jones up 230 points, or 0.9%, at 25,973 Nasdaq up 41 points, or 0.4%, at 9,649 S&amp;P 500 up 22 points, or 0.7%, at 3,102 The ADP figures come before Friday\u2019s official non-farm payrolls numbers. ADP says: The National Employment Report uses the same time period the Bureau of Labor and Statistics uses for their survey. As such, the May NER does not reflect the full impact of Covid-19 on the overall employment situation. Even so, the much smaller-than-expected rise in unemployment in May, by 2.76m, should cheer financial markets. It is another big number, but nowhere near April\u2019s revised figure of 19.6m job losses. European stock markets continue to march higher. The FTSE 100 index in London is now 1.2% ahead, while Germany\u2019s Dax and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB have each gained 2.3% and France\u2019s CAC 40 is 1.97% higher. Large businesses (with 500 or more employees) accounted for the bulk of the job cuts, shedding 1.6m. The service sector was worst affected with almost 2m job losses, and 794,000 factory workers also lost their jobs. You can read the report here. The latest US jobs numbers from ADP are out. They show 2.76 million people lost their jobs in the private sector in May, compared with 19.6 million in April, which was the worst in the survey\u2019s history. Economists had expected up to 9m job losses. In other travel news, Spain is working on plans to open its borders to tourists from lower-risk Covid-19 countries, possibly as early as 21 or 22 June, according to its tourism ministry. Spain is due to lift its state of emergency on Sunday, 21 June, and could reopen its borders around that time -- earlier than the previously targeted date of 1 July. Reuters reported a tourism ministry spokesman as saying: We want to reactivate and accelerate international mobility but starting with areas in epidemiological situations. Here is our story about Tui\u2019s compensation deal with the US aircraft maker Boeing, Lufthansa\u2019s first-quarter losses and Wizz Air\u2019s full-year profit. The global MSCI index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, is still trading at a three-month high, up 1.14%. Stock markets are still pushing higher, lifted by economic optimism. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 63 points, or 1.02% Germany\u2019s Dax up 2.23% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.83% Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 2.08% US stock futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street later. The Dow Jones is seen opening 175 points higher, and the Nasdaq is expected to gain some 33 points at the open. The Bank of England has issued a statement following the earlier Sky News report that governor Andrew Bailey has told banks to step up preparations for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period on 31 December. The central bank said: It is fundamental to the Bank of England\u2019s remit that it prepares the UK financial system for all risks that it might face. In performing that role, the governor meets the leadership of UK banks on a very regular basis. As we have said previously, the possibility that negotiations between the UK and EU over a future trading relationship might not conclude in a deal is one of a number of outcomes that UK banks need to prepare for over the coming months. Oil prices are now falling, after rallying to three-month highs earlier. Brent crude is down 1.62% at $38.93 a barrel after rising through $40 a barrel, while US crude has lost 1.77% to $36.16 a barrel. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest oil producer and the leader of the Opec oil cartel, and Russia, which is not in Opec, have reportedly reached a preliminary agreement to extend the existing record oil production cuts by one month. Sources told Reuters: Any agreement on extending the cuts is conditional on countries who have not fully complied in May deepening their cuts in upcoming months to offset their overproduction. The Opec+ group, which includes Russia, agreed last month to cut output by a record 9.7m barrels a day, equivalent to about 10% of global output. But there are now doubts as to whether an early meeting of Opec and its allies to extend the production cuts will take place tomorrow, pushing oil prices lower. Bloomberg reported that the meeting won\u2019t happen unless problems around compliance are resolved. Zoom, the booming video conferencing firm, reported its first-quarter results last night. My colleague Mark Sweney has taken a closer look. Zoom may be booming as the global coronavirus lockdown moves work and social life to cyberspace but deep-pocketed rivals including Microsoft, Google and Facebook are taking aim as video conferencing becomes a staple of daily life. On Tuesday, Zoom, which has been catapulted from a relatively unknown video service to a household name during the coronavirus pandemic, reported first-quarter results that were impressive on almost every measure. Revenue surged by 169% to $328m (\u00a3261m) in the three months to the end of April, prompting the company to double revenue guidance for this year. The number of people attending meetings and gatherings on any one day peaked at 300 million in April. In December it was 10 million a day. One analyst called Zoom\u2019s results \u201cone of, if not the greatest quarter in enterprise software history\u201d and its share price enjoyed an initial bounce. However, Zoom\u2019s stock dropped in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors and analysts began to worry about its ability to cope with competitors aiming to muscle in on the video-conferencing boom. In March, Microsoft, an aggressive competitor against Zoom for paying business customers with Microsoft Teams, announced it is to launch a version of its video-conferencing service for consumers. The following month, Facebook, the world\u2019s biggest social networking site, introduced a group video-calling feature called Messenger Rooms that prompted a dip in Zoom\u2019s share price. In April, Google announced it was to make Meet, another Zoom competitor in the business video market, available for consumer use. The hotel chain Travelodge is expected to launch insolvency proceedings in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) later today, allowing it to cut its rent by around 40% over the next 18 months, reports my colleague Joanna Partridge. The 580-hotel chain is owned by investment firms include Goldman Sachs, Avenue Capital and GoldenTree and has \u00a3100m in cash reserves. It has been locked in a battle with its landlords since late March when it initially refused to pay rent for the second quarter of the year, and the company is now offering landlords a sweetened deal in a bid to win them over. Travelodge\u2019s shareholders have pledged to inject up to \u00a340m in new equity, and to raise \u00a3100m in new debt. Unlike a traditional CVA, Travelodge\u2019s plan does not propose any hotel closures or job cuts among its 10,000 staff, and the rent reduction will last until the end of 2021. There has also been lots of airline/travel news today. Lufthansa, the German flagship carrier, has posted a massive first-quarter loss of \u20ac2.1bn, just days after being bailed out by the German government (which means it will have to give up some of its prized landing slots to rivals). The company announced a big restructuring, including reducing its Brussels Airlines fleet by 30% and the workforce by 25%, and its Austrian Airlines\u2019 fleet and staff by 20%. Other carriers, such as British Airways and Ryanair, have also announced big job losses as they battle for survival after the coronavirus crisis forced them to ground their fleets. Some airlines have fared better than others. Wizz Air, the London-listed eastern European airline, reported a net profit of \u20ac281m for the year to 31 March. Wizz Air was the first airline to resume flights from London Luton airport and announced it would start flying to Portugal and Greece from mid-June, as well as expanding into new routes in eastern Europe. Tui, the world\u2019s biggest travel firm, has struck a deal with Boeing to compensate for the grounding of its 737 Max planes, and also agreed a new delivery schedule for the planes, as the tour operator battles through the coronavirus pandemic. As reported earlier, Nissan warned again today that its Sunderland manufacturing plant is still under threat if the UK leaves the EU without a trade deal. Sky News is reporting that the Bank of England\u2019s governor, Andrew Bailey, has told banks to step up their plans for a no-deal Brexit. He held a conference call with the UK\u2019s biggest lenders yesterday. Britain left the EU on 31 January but is still in a transition period, until the end of December. Both sides began a fourth round of virtual negotiations yesterday to try and hammer out a trade agreement before the end of the year. The UK wants binding commitments from the EU to secure its finance industry\u2019s access to the bloc, but has met with rejection. In currency markets, the dollar has weakened further among the unrest across the US, which has benefited other currencies. The euro is set for its seventh day of gains and sterling rose to a one-month high against the dollar. The pound touched $1.2608, the highest since 30 April, and is now trading at $1.2579, up 0.23%. It got a lift from comments by industry chiefs that Britain and the EU might reach a compromise on fisheries, as the two sides embarked on a fourth round of virtual negotiations on a trade deal. Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations, said yesterday that he thought \u201ca deal will be done,\u201d although it will probably take until September or October. However, sterling slipped slightly against the euro today, as Brexit risks remain. Unemployment went up in April, the second month after Covid-19 containment measures were implemented by most European countries, according to Eurostat figures. The unemployment rate in the eurozone rose to 7.3% from 7.1% in March, while the jobless rate for the whole EU was 6.6% in April, up from 6.4% in March. Meanwhile, Australia has entered its first recession for 29 years after the economy shrank by 0.3% in the January to March quarter, with the impact of bushfires and the coronavirus ending the nation\u2019s extraordinary, uninterrupted run of economic growth, writes Katharine Murphy, Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor. And here is some analysis: The latest GDP figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that in the first three months of this year, Australia\u2019s economy shrank for the first time in nine years and removed any lingering doubt that we are in a recession -- but worse is yet to come, writes economics and politics writer Greg Jericho. European stock markets are marching higher, buoyed by economic recovery hopes. A private survey for China\u2019s services sector indicated that activity picked up strongly in May, with the PMI rising to a 10-year high. PMI surveys for the UK and the eurozone have also come in stronger than expected, although services and the private sector as a whole continue to shrink. FTSE 100 up 1.3%, or 83 points, at 6,303 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.94% at 12,254 France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.83% at 4,947 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 2.07% at 19,366 Oil prices have hit three-month highs on hopes that demand will increase, with Brent crude up 1.3% to $40.09 a barrel. Gold and silver have fallen back as safe-haven buying has faded. But the (largely peaceful) protests across the US continue, as thousands of people demand justice for George Floyd, who was killed in police custody last week. UK firms cut jobs at the second-fastest pace since the survey began in January 1998, according to Markit, which compiles the PMI with the Chartered Institue of Procurement &amp; Supply (CIPS). Factory and services activity both declined in May, but manufacturing proved a bit more resilient, with the index at 35.0. Duncan Brock, group director at CIPS, said: May\u2019s survey data painted a deeply concerning picture of a lockdown slowdown across the service sector as employment dropped at the second fastest rate on record, pipelines of new work were woefully empty and business confidence continued to suffer. As the pandemic progressed any hoped-for bounceback in business output never really got going in May following the previous month\u2019s awful results, though a modicum of recovery will offer small respite in some sectors. Pockets of trading began again as firms began adapting to social distancing measures, though only 15% of companies reported a rise in new orders this month. In this aggressively unsympathetic marketplace, supply chain managers voiced their concerns that any significant improvement is unlikely to happen at least in the medium term. As supply chains began to awaken from their deep slumber, continuing logistics challenges increased costs for some firms though reduced wage bills helped to alleviate the pressure. As restrictions are eased, there is still extreme uncertainty about how the pandemic will pan out. Continued anxiety about the coronavirus means consumer spending may not be the wind beneath the sails of any immediate return to pre-virus economic activity. The UK\u2019s final services PMI reading for May is 29.0, better than the flash estimate of 27.8 and up from April\u2019s nadir of 13.4... but it\u2019s still far below the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction. Markit, which compiled the survey, says: Just over half of the survey panel (54%) reported a drop in business activity during May, while only 13% signalled an increase. Those indicating a decrease in output since April often commented on a severe lack of new business to replace work that had been completed after the lockdown, following deep cutbacks to corporate spending in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. There were some reports that the gradual reopening of the UK economy, especially the construction sector, had a positive impact on client demand. Other service providers commented on a tentative revival in business conditions following the initial shock of the lockdown period. The composite output index, which pulls together manufacturing and services, rose to 30.0 in May, better than the flash estimate of 28.9 and up from April\u2019s record low of 13.8. The eurozone as a whole has recovered somewhat from April\u2019s nadir, but remains deep in negative territory. Final Eurozone Composite Output Index: 31.9 (Flash: 30.5, April Final: 13.6) Final Eurozone Services Business Activity Index: 30.5 (Flash: 28.7, April Final: 12.0) Italy, France and Spain were at three-month highs in May, according to the composite PMIs for the private sector, while Germany reached a two-month high. The German services PMI, at 32.6, is also better than the flash estimate and up from April\u2019s record low of 16.2. But the unemployment rate in Europe\u2019s biggest economy has gone up to 6.3%, more than the expected 6.2%. And here is France. Its services PMI for May comes in at 31.1, up from 10.2 in April and higher than the flash estimate of 30.5. The composite index, capturing the private sector, is at 32.1, also up from the flash estimate and April\u2019s 11.1. Eliot Kerr, economist at IHS Markit said: Following April\u2019s record decline, the latest PMI data pointed to a further contraction in French private sector business activity during May. Given the low likelihood of businesses being open in April but closed in May, the latest reduction in output reflects the deteriorating demand conditions that firms now face. That said, rates of activity decline at both manufacturers and service providers did ease in May, and we should expect this trend to continue as more and more firms reopen for business. Although we might see further contractions while demand remains subdued, PMI figures should continue to climb in the months ahead barring a second outbreak. The Italian services PMI has risen to 28.9 from April\u2019s record low of 10.8 in the final reading, slightly better than expected, but still pointing to a sharp decline in activity in the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy. The composite output index posted 33.9 in May, to signal a further substantial contraction in Italian private sector output, albeit up from April\u2019s nadir of 10.9. Services saw the sharpest decline, with manufacturers registering only a modest drop in output. Lewis Cooper, economist at IHS Markit said: The Covid-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns continued to weigh heavily on the performance of the Italian service sector during May, with further substantial reductions in both business activity and new orders. With the economy beginning to reopen and restrictions loosening, however, the falls softened from April\u2019s records. Meanwhile, job cuts continued, with staff numbers falling at the second-quickest rate on record. Firms registered renewed optimism with regards to activity over the year ahead, but sentiment remained among the lowest in the series history. A similar trend was seen in the manufacturing sector, where the downturn continued, albeit at a softer pace. Nonetheless, the Italian economy remains in an extremely challenging period. Preliminary GDP estimates for the first quarter of 2020 recorded a decline approaching 5% on a quarterly basis, and PMI data for the second quarter so far point to another considerable contraction. Gold and silver prices are falling as global stocks are trading close to three-month highs. Both precious metals had enjoyed a rally last week and on Monday as some investors looked for safe-haven investments amid the protests in the US and continuing trade tensions between the US and China. Spot gold slipped 0.37% to $1,720 an ounce, after declining 0.7% on Tuesday. Silver fell 1.6% to $17.79, after hitting its highest level since 25 February on Monday. The dollar has also weakened, with the dollar index falling 0.36% to a two-month low. On the markets, the FTSE 100 index has extended its gains and is trading more than 1% higher at 6,286, up 65 points. Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.1% ahead at 12,153, France\u2019s CAC 40 has added 1.2% to 4,917 and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB has posted an even stronger gain of 1.5%,to 19,254. Spain\u2019s Ibex rose more than 1% in early trading but is now only 0.68% ahead at 7,458 after the latest services and private sector surveys, which confirmed the economy recovered from April\u2019s trough, but remained very weak. Paul Smith, economics director at IHS Markit said: Despite the easing of lockdown measures, economic activity in Spain remained severely curtailed during May. Whilst rising markedly from the extreme readings of April, latest PMI readings remain considerably low and confirm that the Spanish economy will likely experience a contraction in second quarter GDP pushing towards double digits. Spain\u2019s final PMI readings for May from IHS Markit for the country\u2019s services industries and the private sector as a whole are out. They are slightly better than the flash estimates, but still indicate sharp contractions, as they are far below the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction. Markit says the two weakest sectors within services remained hotels and restaurants and transport and storage. As Brexit talks have resumed this week, Nissan is warning that its Sunderland manufacturing plant is still under threat if the UK leaves the European Union without a trade deal, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. Last week, Nissan said that the UK\u2019s largest car manufacturing plant would stay open as it announced plans to cut \u00a32.3bn in costs worldwide. However, the carmaker has said it would need to \u201cimprove efficiency\u201d at the factory in the north-East of England, which employs 6,700 staff. Today, Ashwani Gupta, the Japanese company\u2019s global chief operating officer, warned that with the European Union Sunderland factory\u2019s biggest customer the tariffs that would come with a no-deal Brexit would mean manufacturing in Britain would not be viable. \u201cYou know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cWe are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it\u2019s not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That\u2019s what everybody has to understand.\u201d And we are off. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.9% Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.1% France\u2019s CAC 40 up 1.1% Spain\u2019s Ibex up 1% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business Markets are still riding on a wave of economic optimism, boosted by a strong survey of China\u2019s services sector, which hit a near-10-year high last month. The Caixin China services purchasing managers index (PMI), a private survey, jumped to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction, after falling below 50 for three months because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the highest reading since late 2010. New orders also recorded their biggest increase since September 2010 as demand from within China recovered. The services sector makes up about 60% of China\u2019s economy. This has boosted stock markets in Asia and is also expected to spill over into Europe. Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose to its highest level since February and closed 1.29% higher, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.32% and South Korea\u2019s Kospi added 2.87%, after the South Korean government proposed its biggest stimulus package yet. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.3%, hitting a three-month high and taking the gain from its trough on 23 March to almost 36%. Over here, the FTSE 100 index in London is expected to open 60 points higher and Germany\u2019s Dax is being called 125 points higher. Global stocks have so far shrugged off the growing unrest in the US after the killing of George Floyd, along with simmering trade tensions between the US and China. Despite protests sweeping across US states, night time curfews and president Donald Trump calling for the military to intervene, US markets closed at their highest level in three months yesterday. Oil prices are also rallying, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, rising 1.84% to $40.30 a barrel. Earlier, it hit $40.53, the highest since early March, after gaining 3.3% on Tuesday. US light crude gained 2.7% to $37.82 a barrel. Oil prices have been boosted in recent weeks by growing evidence that China\u2019s economy is recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic, and the easing of lockdowns around the world. This suggests demand for oil will pick up. On the economic data front, we\u2019ll be getting final readings for the services and composite PMI surveys in the eurozone and UK this morning, as well as unemployment rates for Germany, the EU and the eurozone. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The biggest worry remains around Spain and Italy who rely so much on tourism in their services sector, and whose recovery is likely to be slow and painful, as tourists stay away. The recent flash numbers from France, Germany and the UK saw improvements from a record lows in April to 29.4, 31.4 and 27.8 respectively.

Although the number of deaths occurring in care homes in Northern Ireland has previously exceeded those in hospitals, cumulatively there have been 350 hospital deaths compared to 313 care home deaths.&nbsp;</p> <p>At first minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged repeatedly by Carlaw about testing in care homes as he noted the latest death figures. She insisted that a programme of regular and routine testing of care home staff was under way and that her government would publish up-to-date data \u201cas soon as we are able to do that in a robust and reliable manner\u201d.</p> <p>Carlaw said the Scottish government\u2019s policy on testing had been \u201cdither, delay and distract\u201d from the start, and that current testing capacity was being \u201csquandered\u201d. He cited one major provider, Renaissance Care, which claims that less than half of its staff have been tested for Covid-19, despite a commitment from the health secretary, Jeane Freeman, two weeks ago that all staff would be routinely tested.</p> <p>The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, highlighted what he described as a \u201cconsistent disconnect between parliamentary pronouncements and the reality\u201d, referencing cases of care workers still being refused testing unless they are displaying Covid-19 symptoms.</p> <p>In reply to another question, Sturgeon said she had \u201chuge sympathy\u201d for proposals for a national care service, after some MSPs suggested that greater public control of care homes could facilitate the broader reforms that the current crisis has highlighted are desperately needed.</p> <p>Sturgeon has previously guaranteed that the promised public inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s response to the pandemic would \u201cundoubtedly include what happened in care homes\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More people have now died in care homes in Scotland than in hospitals, according to the latest figures from the National Records of Scotland (NRS), which also show that overall deaths have fallen for the fifth week running. The latest data on weekly deaths occurring in various settings shows that 1,818 deaths linked to the virus have occurred in care homes since the outbreak began, compared with 1,815 deaths recorded in hospitals. Week-on-week figures for Scottish facilities show that the number of care home deaths has been higher than that in hospitals for six weeks now, but this is the first time that the cumulative number of deaths has been higher in care homes than in hospitals. The figures come as the Scottish government faces continued scrutiny over care home deaths, including the discharge of untested patients to care settings at the beginning of the outbreak, which the Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, has described as a \u201cnational scandal\u201d. Hospital deaths still far exceed care home deaths in England and Wales, both on a cumulative and weekly basis. Although the number of deaths occurring in care homes in Northern Ireland has previously exceeded those in hospitals, cumulatively there have been 350 hospital deaths compared to 313 care home deaths. At first minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged repeatedly by Carlaw about testing in care homes as he noted the latest death figures. She insisted that a programme of regular and routine testing of care home staff was under way and that her government would publish up-to-date data \u201cas soon as we are able to do that in a robust and reliable manner\u201d. Carlaw said the Scottish government\u2019s policy on testing had been \u201cdither, delay and distract\u201d from the start, and that current testing capacity was being \u201csquandered\u201d. He cited one major provider, Renaissance Care, which claims that less than half of its staff have been tested for Covid-19, despite a commitment from the health secretary, Jeane Freeman, two weeks ago that all staff would be routinely tested. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, highlighted what he described as a \u201cconsistent disconnect between parliamentary pronouncements and the reality\u201d, referencing cases of care workers still being refused testing unless they are displaying Covid-19 symptoms. In reply to another question, Sturgeon said she had \u201chuge sympathy\u201d for proposals for a national care service, after some MSPs suggested that greater public control of care homes could facilitate the broader reforms that the current crisis has highlighted are desperately needed. Sturgeon has previously guaranteed that the promised public inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s response to the pandemic would \u201cundoubtedly include what happened in care homes\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s top officer has said police feared there would be violence if they tried to intervene with protesters in London angered by the brutal death of George Floyd at the hands of an American officer. Demonstrators at protests in London on Sunday and Tuesday flouted coronavirus lockdown rules on how many people can gather together. But the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, said that with feelings running high over the police brutality case in the US and because of the effects of the coronavirus lockdown, officers feared serious and violent disorder if they stepped in to enforce lockdown rules. Dick and other British police leaders said they were appalled by the video of an officer crushing Floyd\u2019s neck with his knee for over eight minutes. It is rare for British police to condemn the actions of officers in another democracy. Speaking to the London assembly, Dick said people should put themselves \u201cin the shoes of a public order commander\u201d, faced with a near spontaneous demonstration, with no chance to negotiate with organisers and a large crowd who would not listen. \u201cThen you have to make some judgments, at the time, in the moment about what is the best thing to do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd judgments, have been made, that people are out in such numbers, feeling so strongly, and are refusing to disperse when asked, that the officers have formed the view that if they were to try at that stage, with those sorts of numbers, to enforce en masse, we probably would have ended up with very serious disorder and a bad situation, a difficult situation, a challenging situation for everybody, turning into a violent situation. So, these are the sorts of risks that public order commanders have [to assess].\u201d After the London protest on Sunday police made 23 arrests, of people aged 17 to 30, including for breaching Covid laws and other offences. The Met commissioneradded: \u201cI recognise, also, feelings are running higher in London.\u201d She also joined a denunciation of the police assault on Floyd, and the violence that followed. She echoed a statement from Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Mike Cunningham, chief executive of the College of Policing, and Paul Griffiths, president of the Police Superintendents\u2019 Association. It says: \u201cWe stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow. \u201cWe are also appalled to see the violence and damage that has happened in so many US cities since then. Our hearts go out to all those affected by these terrible events and hope that peace and order will soon be restored.\u201d The statement added: \u201cPolicing is complex and challenging and sometimes we fall short. When we do, we are not afraid to shine a light on injustices or to be held to account.\u201d The statement urges those in the UK who want to protest to obey lockdown rules restricting how many people can gather together.",

Yet confusion remains over which will welcome visitors from countries with higher infection rates, including <strong>Britain</strong>.</p> <p>As the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed on Wednesday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/priti-patel-urged-to-publish-scientific-advice-behind-uk-quarantine-move\">Britain would enforce a 14-day quarantine period</a> on almost all overseas arrivals from 8 June, Italy said its borders were no longer closed to most travellers from Europe.</p> <p>A foreign ministry spokesman said, however, that the government had not yet spoken to the UK about trying to establish an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-air-bridges-with-holiday-destinations-impossible-warn-public-health-experts\">\u201cair bridge\u201d</a> between the two countries, so that Britons would not have to self-isolate on their return.</p> <p>Despite the EU\u2019s call for a coordinated reopening of the continent\u2019s key travel and tourism sector from 15 June, other member states seem reluctant to welcome travellers from Italy, which has suffered Europe\u2019s second-highest Covid-19 death toll after the UK.</p> <p><strong>Austria</strong>\u2019s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said on Wednesday its border restrictions, including quarantines, would be lifted on Thursday for all the country\u2019s eight neighbours except&nbsp;Italy.</p> <p>\u201cWe will lift all the coronavirus-related border&nbsp;and&nbsp;health checks with Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and&nbsp;Hungary,\u201d Schallenberg said.

      "bodyText": "Italy reopened its borders to European travellers, and other EU member states look set to follow suit by mid-June. Yet confusion remains over which will welcome visitors from countries with higher infection rates, including Britain. As the UK home secretary, Priti Patel, confirmed on Wednesday that Britain would enforce a 14-day quarantine period on almost all overseas arrivals from 8 June, Italy said its borders were no longer closed to most travellers from Europe. A foreign ministry spokesman said, however, that the government had not yet spoken to the UK about trying to establish an \u201cair bridge\u201d between the two countries, so that Britons would not have to self-isolate on their return. Despite the EU\u2019s call for a coordinated reopening of the continent\u2019s key travel and tourism sector from 15 June, other member states seem reluctant to welcome travellers from Italy, which has suffered Europe\u2019s second-highest Covid-19 death toll after the UK. Austria\u2019s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, said on Wednesday its border restrictions, including quarantines, would be lifted on Thursday for all the country\u2019s eight neighbours except Italy. \u201cWe will lift all the coronavirus-related border and health checks with Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary,\u201d Schallenberg said. Unfortunately, he added, \u201cfor Italy the pandemic figures do not yet allow such a step\u201d. It follows Germany\u2019s announcement on Wednesday that it would lift a blanket travel ban to all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Britain from 15 June, providing there were no entry bans or large-scale lockdowns in those countries. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, told a press conference that the ban would be replaced with daily advice on travel to individual countries, and warned that Berlin would continue to warn against all non-essential travel to Britain while the UK maintains its 14-day quarantine rules. The French foreign ministry also said that France and the UK had not started bilateral talks on a possible quarantine exception for travel between the two countries, saying that for the time being it would be applying a principle of strict reciprocity. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced on Wednesday the lifting of restrictions on travel from all EU and Schengen zone countries except Sweden, where the infection rate is still running relatively high, and the UK. Portugal\u2019s foreign minister, Augusto Santos Silva, told the BBC on Wednesday that talks were under way with London on establishing an \u201cair bridge\u201d between the two countries, saying quarantine was \u201can enemy of tourism\u201d and anyone wanting a holiday in Portugal this summer would be \u201cmost welcome\u201d. Spain, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it was working on plans to gradually open its borders to tourists from countries with relatively low infection rates, possibly starting on 22 June, a day after the country\u2019s state of emergency is due to be lifted. A tourism ministry spokesman told Reuters that Madrid had spoken to tour operators and airlines in several European countries and wanted \u201cto reactivate and accelerate international mobility \u2013 but starting with areas in similar epidemiological situations\u201d. Spain has previously said it is keen for travel protocols to be agreed at the European level. However, concerns are now being voiced in Brussels at a lack of coordination by European governments in the reopening of the EU\u2019s borders. The EU set out plans in May for a phased restart of travel this summer from 15 June. A European commission spokesman said it was crucial EU member states had a \u201cstrictly coordinated approach\u201d, but said it accepted that governments might wish to bar those coming from countries with higher rates of infection. \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on specific measures taken by the member states, but what we have done is to produce a number of guidelines as to how they should go about lifting restrictions at the internal borders,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIn this respect the very important principle is non-discrimination \u2013 non-discrimination in terms of nationality \u2013 and that regions of similar epidemiology benefit from the same treatment.\u201d Greece said at the weekend that it would resume flights to the country\u2019s two main airports, Athens and Thessaloniki, from 15 June for an interim period before direct flights to other mainland and island destinations restart on 1 July. During that fortnight, passengers from countries classified as high risk must undergo a coronavirus test and be prepared to self-isolate for seven or 14 days depending on the result. The risks of opening up to foreign tourists were underlined on Wednesday, however, when 12 out of 91 passengers on a Qatar Airlines flight to Athens tested positive. \u201cWe\u2019ve now seen what can happen this summer,\u201d an infectious diseases expert and government adviser on the pandemic, Nikolaos Sypsas, said. \u201cThe safest would be not to open up to tourism, but that would mean huge economic destruction,\u201d he said. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is divide countries of origin into safe and unsafe. That creates certain diplomatic pressures, but for us the first priority is public health.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You can sense the growing disbelief and anger. All his life Boris Johnson has been told that he is the Special One. A person for whom all rules are there to be broken. He is a man who has consistently managed to fail upwards. Sacked from one job for lying or incompetence, he has always effortlessly moved on to a better one. Friends, family and children have only ever been collateral damage in a ruthless pursuit of an entitled ambition.</p> \n<p>Yet now there is no hiding place. Boris has achieved his narcissistic goal of becoming prime minister and from here the only way is down. And it\u2019s a lonely place to be because even he can\u2019t escape the fact that he\u2019s just not cut out for the top job. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s too much like hard work and he is basically lazy: it\u2019s that he\u2019s not that good at it. Lame gags, bluster and Latin free association just don\u2019t cut it.</p> \n<p>Put simply, Boris isn\u2019t as bright as he has come to believe he is. In fact, he\u2019s quite dim. And nowhere is this more evident than when he\u2019s up against Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions in front of a near empty chamber. During their first few outings, much was made of how Boris crumbled in the face of the Labour leader\u2019s forensic questioning. But now it\u2019s clear Johnson can\u2019t cope with any kind of questioning at all. Because even when Starmer isn\u2019t at his absolute sharpest, Boris begins to fall apart. It\u2019s as if he knows he\u2019s up against a man of greater intellect and morality and his only defence is to lash out.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t help that Boris has become his own worst enemy. The charmer turned charmless. Mr Happy turned Mr Angry. It also doesn\u2019t help that even when his friends at the Daily Telegraph try to big him up with a story about how he was going to take direct control over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, they only succeed in teeing up Starmer with his first free hit. Who had been in charge of the government during the past three months? Apart from Classic Dom of course. Because we could all take that as read.</p> \n<p>Boris immediately became defensive and snappy. He had always been in control. All that was changing was that now he would be in total control. Besides, he stood behind what the government had done so far. There hadn\u2019t been many other countries that had managed to kill so many of its citizens through negligence and indifference, so that was something of which we should all be proud. Besides why was the Labour leader standing up and asking him all these difficult questions when he could easily have been more supportive?</p> \n<p>This left Starmer rather perplexed as he had a copy of a letter he had written to the prime minister a fortnight ago offering to help find a solution on reopening schools to which he had not yet received a reply. \u201cUm \u2026 er,\u201d said the floundering Boris. He had rung him back. Except he hadn\u2019t. He had merely spoken to all the opposition leaders on a joint conference call.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c84ab7e0-10d0-4e59-9883-4ff18ed02de4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JiWBb-0KC2s?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There was something almost pathetic about Boris pleading for people to trust him at the very moment he was lying. Starmer merely pointed out that trust had to be earned, and returned to the charge sheet. Why had Johnson eased lockdown restrictions when the woman in charge of track and trace on which the new guidance was predicated had said the programme wouldn\u2019t be fully functional till the end of the month? Why had the guidelines been altered when the threat was still stuck at level 4?</p> \n<p>By now it was clear that Starmer had got under Boris\u2019s skin, and Johnson began to visibly fall apart as he tugged at his hair, tried to prevent his chin from wobbling and angrily jabbed his finger. A prime minister unable to differentiate between being picked on and being subjected to the bare minimum of democratic scrutiny. For Boris even the most modest of criticism is interpreted as a personal betrayal. He might not be very good but he was doing his very best and it was about time the Labour leader and the rest of the country expressed their gratitude for that.</p> \n<p>As so often, the leaders\u2019 exchanges ended with Boris doing a U-turn on government policy. If you had to guess from PMQs who was running the country then you\u2019d have to say it was Starmer. Only the previous day, Johnson had insisted on a three-line whip in support of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s plans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/rees-moggs-plan-to-end-remote-voting-in-parliament-condemned-by-rights-body\">institutionalise discrimination into the workings of the Commons</a>. Now it sounded very much as if he had had a change of mind. Which had meant that much of Tuesday\u2019s proceedings had been as big a waste of time as MPs <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/the-tories-turn-parliament-into-the-worlds-worst-theme-park\">queueing up for 90 minutes</a> to deprive absent MPs of a vote.</p> \n<p>Not that queueing was necessarily a bad thing, Boris ad-libbed. The public had queued for Ikea so it was right for MPs to get their knees dirty and queue to vote as well. Even though there was a fully functional alternative up and running already. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to know where satire ends and reality starts. </p> \n<p>Boris breathed a sigh of relief when Starmer\u2019s six questions came to an end, but there was no let up. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford twice asked Boris to condemn President Trump\u2019s handling of the riots in the US \u2013 teargassing peaceful protesters to get a photo op in front of a church had been a particular low point \u2013 and twice the prime minister declined. Even Theresa May got in on the act by asking a Brexit question he couldn\u2019t answer. How the Tory benches could do with her at PMQs right now.</p> \n<p>The truth is that Boris is a beaten man even before he stands up to speak at the dispatch box. He knows that. Keir knows that. Worst of all, the country knows that. The shouting is all just empty, white noise. A distraction from his own limitations. And at a time of national crisis you can\u2019t get away with putting that on the side of a bus.</p>",

It\u2019s as if he knows he\u2019s up against a man of greater intellect and morality and his only defence is to lash out. It doesn\u2019t help that Boris has become his own worst enemy. The charmer turned charmless. Mr Happy turned Mr Angry. It also doesn\u2019t help that even when his friends at the Daily Telegraph try to big him up with a story about how he was going to take direct control over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, they only succeed in teeing up Starmer with his first free hit. Who had been in charge of the government during the past three months? Apart from Classic Dom of course. Because we could all take that as read. Boris immediately became defensive and snappy. He had always been in control. All that was changing was that now he would be in total control. Besides, he stood behind what the government had done so far. There hadn\u2019t been many other countries that had managed to kill so many of its citizens through negligence and indifference, so that was something of which we should all be proud. Besides why was the Labour leader standing up and asking him all these difficult questions when he could easily have been more supportive? This left Starmer rather perplexed as he had a copy of a letter he had written to the prime minister a fortnight ago offering to help find a solution on reopening schools to which he had not yet received a reply. \u201cUm \u2026 er,\u201d said the floundering Boris. He had rung him back. Except he hadn\u2019t. He had merely spoken to all the opposition leaders on a joint conference call. There was something almost pathetic about Boris pleading for people to trust him at the very moment he was lying. Starmer merely pointed out that trust had to be earned, and returned to the charge sheet. Why had Johnson eased lockdown restrictions when the woman in charge of track and trace on which the new guidance was predicated had said the programme wouldn\u2019t be fully functional till the end of the month? Why had the guidelines been altered when the threat was still stuck at level 4? By now it was clear that Starmer had got under Boris\u2019s skin, and Johnson began to visibly fall apart as he tugged at his hair, tried to prevent his chin from wobbling and angrily jabbed his finger. A prime minister unable to differentiate between being picked on and being subjected to the bare minimum of democratic scrutiny. For Boris even the most modest of criticism is interpreted as a personal betrayal. He might not be very good but he was doing his very best and it was about time the Labour leader and the rest of the country expressed their gratitude for that. As so often, the leaders\u2019 exchanges ended with Boris doing a U-turn on government policy. If you had to guess from PMQs who was running the country then you\u2019d have to say it was Starmer. Only the previous day, Johnson had insisted on a three-line whip in support of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s plans to institutionalise discrimination into the workings of the Commons. Now it sounded very much as if he had had a change of mind. Which had meant that much of Tuesday\u2019s proceedings had been as big a waste of time as MPs queueing up for 90 minutes to deprive absent MPs of a vote. Not that queueing was necessarily a bad thing, Boris ad-libbed. The public had queued for Ikea so it was right for MPs to get their knees dirty and queue to vote as well. Even though there was a fully functional alternative up and running already. It\u2019s getting harder and harder to know where satire ends and reality starts. Boris breathed a sigh of relief when Starmer\u2019s six questions came to an end, but there was no let up. The SNP\u2019s Ian Blackford twice asked Boris to condemn President Trump\u2019s handling of the riots in the US \u2013 teargassing peaceful protesters to get a photo op in front of a church had been a particular low point \u2013 and twice the prime minister declined. Even Theresa May got in on the act by asking a Brexit question he couldn\u2019t answer. How the Tory benches could do with her at PMQs right now. The truth is that Boris is a beaten man even before he stands up to speak at the dispatch box. He knows that. Keir knows that. Worst of all, the country knows that. The shouting is all just empty, white noise. A distraction from his own limitations. And at a time of national crisis you can\u2019t get away with putting that on the side of a bus.",

      "bodyText": "West Indies have selflessly answered the SOS call from English cricket and will fly out to the UK next week despite three players opting out of the trip because of concerns about the Covid\u201119 pandemic. Darren Bravo, Shimron Hetmyer and Keemo Paul all featured in the 2\u20111 victory against England at home last year and were invited to join the three-Test tour that is being staged behind closed doors from 8 July by the selector Roger Harper. Their names were absent from the 25-member touring party announced on Wednesday \u2013 a Test squad of 14, plus 11 reserve players who will act as net bowlers and warm-up opposition \u2013 with a statement from Cricket West Indies saying the board \u201cfully respects their decision\u201d. Johnny Grave, the chief executive, had stressed recently that the death toll from coronavirus in the UK \u2013 now officially past 50,000 \u2013 needed to be viewed from a Caribbean perspective, a sentiment echoed by Joe Root, the England Test captain, who said this week that \u201cit must be extremely scary\u201d. Accordingly all three players have been told there will be no recriminations as regards future selection. With West Indies cricketers starting a 50% pay cut from July \u2013 but the tour offering full match fees worth around \u00a315,000 in total for those among the official 14 \u2013 it is clear their decisions were not taken lightly. Bravo, the Trinidadian left-hander with 54 caps and eight centuries, is a loss by way of experience even though he had been dropped for their most recent Test against Afghanistan, while the Guyanese pair of Hetmyer, an explosive middle-order player, and Paul, a bowling all-rounder, are considered emerging talents. The trio could not be persuaded by a final medical briefing from Nick Peirce, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s chief medical officer, on Monday evening but there will be few grumbles from the home side about the standard of opposition overall given the desperation to stage international cricket this summer. The ECB is looking to recoup as much of the \u00a3220m-per-year broadcast deal as possible, something demonstrated by the lengths it is going to to get West Indies over first and demonstrate to Pakistan, Ireland and Australia \u2013 all due to visit this summer \u2013 that the plan for biosecure matches works. Jason Holder\u2019s touring side will assemble in Antigua in the coming days and, once coronavirus test results are returned from a private laboratory in Florida, depart for the UK on Monday evening. These charter flights, both inter-island and transatlantic, are being paid for by the ECB, as well as tour fees for the reserves. Upon arrival West Indies will head to Old Trafford to spend three weeks living at the Hilton hotel on site and training among themselves \u2013 the first 14 days of which are considered a quarantine period \u2013 before the squad then decamp to the Ageas Bowl before the first Test. The series opener and the two remaining Tests back in Manchester, from 16 and 24 July respectively, will be staged without crowds and only around 200 people in the grounds. The two squads, their coaching staff and the match officials will be subject to a rigorous testing regime, as well as daily temperature checks and thermal screening. England will start as favourites to regain the Wisden Trophy but West Indies, although without a series victory in the UK since 1988, have a much\u2011respected captain in Holder and depth in the bowling department given Shannon Gabriel and Oshane Thomas, two hostile quicks, are listed among the reserves.

As Mexico\u2019s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Kingpin strategy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Simultaneously Calder\u00f3n also began pursuing the so-called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/05/mexico-drug-kingpins-behind-bars-violence-corruption-unchecked\">\u201ckingpin strategy\u201d&nbsp;</a>by which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.</p>\n    <p>That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps \u2013 notably Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva who was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/17/arturo-beltran-leyva-drug-cartel\">gunned down by Mexican marines in 2009</a>&nbsp;\u2013 but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.</p>\n    <p>Under Calder\u00f3n\u2019s successor, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, the government\u2019s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world\u2019s most murderous mafia groups.</p>\n    <p>But Calder\u00f3n\u2019s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa\u2019s Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n.</p>\n    <p>When \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was arrested in early 2016, Mexico\u2019s president bragged: \u201cMission accomplished\u201d. But the violence went on. By the time Pe\u00f1a Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>\"Hugs not bullets\"</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The leftwing populist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics.

      "bodyText": "The body of a missing Mexican congresswoman has been found in a shallow grave more than a month after she was abducted by armed men while raising awareness about the coronavirus pandemic. Anel Bueno, a 38-year-old lawmaker from the western state of Colima, was snatched on 29 April in Ixtlahuac\u00e1n, a town on a stretch of Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast that the drug trade has made one of the country\u2019s most murderous regions. Mexico\u2019s President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador told reporters on Wednesday a suspect had been detained over the killing of Bueno, who was a member of his party, Morena. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know the causes,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador added. Indira Vizca\u00edno, a local politician from the same party, tweeted: \u201cYour departure hurts me deeply \u2013 I\u2019m saddened not just by the fact but by the cruelty.\u201d Vizca\u00edno, another L\u00f3pez Obrador ally, said authorities were fighting to catch the killers \u201cand bring justice \u2013 for this case and all of our country\u2019s victims\u201d. Ixtlahuac\u00e1n is a 30-minute drive from Tecom\u00e1n, a picturesque seaside town that has earned the unenviable reputation as Mexico\u2019s most murderous municipality because of its strategic position for drug smuggling cartels. In 2017 Tecom\u00e1n\u2019s murder rate of a reported 172.5 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants resembled that of a war zone. Last year more than 100 clandestine cemeteries were found there containing the bodies of those who had dared cross the cartels. Colima is one of five Mexican states the United States state department urges travellers against visiting. During a 2018 interview with the Guardian, Vizca\u00edno backed one of the key pledges L\u00f3pez Obrador made to Mexicans ahead of his election that year \u2013 that efforts to combat organised crime would start to tackle the social roots of crime and no longer \u201cjust be a matter of fighting fire with fire\u201d. \u201cCrime rates aren\u2019t going up because the people feel like being bad. Crime rates are going up because people need to eat,\u201d Vizca\u00edno said at a restaurant in Colima\u2019s capital that was the scene of a 2015 assassination attempt on its ex-governor. Bueno had been attempting to raise awareness of Covid-19 prevention techniques when armed men swept into the area on pickup trucks and ordered her inside. During a 2018 interview Tecom\u00e1n\u2019s mayor, El\u00edas Lozano, blamed the bloodshed blighting the region on \u201cthe lack of honest politicians\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s the root of it all. Politicians had the choice of deciding between staying on the sidelines or getting involved \u2013 and many decided to get involved because there were economic benefits,\u201d he said.",

Edmund King called for \u201cmore radical thinking\u201d from metropolitan and city leaders, saying the changes forced on the public by the crisis offered a huge opportunity to change the UK\u2019s transport systems and behaviours and encourage more people to walk and cycle. Speaking at a virtual conference organised by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, King said a car miles \u2013 or road miles \u2013 system could allow drivers to have the first 3,000 miles free, after which they would have to pay per journey. Those in rural areas would get an extra 1,000 miles free. \u201cIt makes you think about the trip and if you have a cleaner greener vehicle you can pay less \u2026 We need some radical thinking and perhaps now the time is right for the Treasury and others to address these bigger issues that politically they have been quite wary of addressing before.\u201d King highlighted evidence from the AA\u2019s own research that showed its members were ready to change their behaviour. \u201cTransport patterns won\u2019t be the same in life after lockdown, according to drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf say they will walk more; four in 10 vow to drive less; a quarter will work from home more and one fifth will cycle more.\u201d The idea of a per-mile charging scheme based on the environmental impact of vehicle journeys has gained traction in recent years. In 2017 it was reported that London mayor Sadiq Khan was considering introducing a per-mile charging scheme in the capital and last year the Centre for London thinktank \u2013 backed by politicians and business groups \u2013 said it would be a more sophisticated approach to road charging and better reflect the true impact of each individual journey than London\u2019s current ultra low emissions zone. King\u2019s call follows measures being rolled out in cities around the world to increase support and infrastructure for walking and cycling as clean alternatives to packed public transport \u2013 which is not compatible with the social distancing required by the coronavirus crisis. King said people\u2019s experience of cleaner air, quieter roads \u2013 and particularly mass home-working \u2013 had created an opportunity that should not be missed. \u201cI am optimistic that this lockdown is beginning to change the attitudes of drivers \u2026 If local authorities can put in well planned infrastructure to walk and to cycle \u2013 and public transport when that returns \u2013 I do feel that can have a credible difference. He added: \u201cThe time is right at the moment because people are out there and they themselves had seen the benefits of walking and cycling and running \u2026 it is a real opportunity.\u201d",

He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-\u00e0-vis arrivals from most EU countries.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said it would take \u201cquite some time\u201d before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ...</p> <p>We are not yet at cruising altitude for this. The number of tests is going to keep on going up and our ability to use the tests we have got is going to carry on going up. This is going to carry on for quite some time before we get to the point where we are all satisfied we have got to the point we need.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Johnson ducked a question about whether Britons would be able to take a foreign holiday this summer.</strong> Asked if it was safe to book one, he replied:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not going to give advice on individuals\u2019 travel arrangements, but you know what the Foreign Office guidance is... everybody at the moment should avoid non-essential travel.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He claimed he was a Sinophile.</strong> Asked about Huawei and whether he would now exclude it from the 5G network, he said he wanted solutions that worked for UK security. But he went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want to stress one thing. I am a Sinophile. I think China is an incredible country and an extraordinary civilisation.</p> <p>And I deeply disapprove of anti-Chinese xenophobia - attacks on people of Chinese appearance that we have seen in recent months.

Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/29/uk-coronavirus-live-priti-patel-questions-response-covid-19-crisis-pmqs-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a#block-5ea970fa8f0853abef659a0a\">here</a>, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/03/uk-coronavirus-live-keir-starmer-boris-johnson-lockdown-easing-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates-news?page=with:block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7#block-5ed786cd8f084df971c8edc7\"> 12.19pm </a>\u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52904433\">if BBC News is to be believed)</a>.</p> <p>This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best times.

And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings.</p> <p>Here is the chart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a620dac087420c31be77a80f62781da5874f1668/0_0_1868_1430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polling on lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"766\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polling on lockdown</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouGov</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As <strong>Chris Curtis</strong> explains in <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/articles-reports/2020/06/03/one-five-have-started-breaking-lockdown-rules-more\">a commentary for the YouGov website</a>, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place.</p> <p>We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones.</p> <p>Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888759/S0313_SAGE33_Consensus_for_SPI-M_on_transition_strategies.pdf\">a consensus view (pdf)</a> dated 4 May.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1.

      "bodyText": "Here is a summary of the main points from the press conference (at the top), as well as our main stories from the day (lower down). Boris Johnson said it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that there would be \u201cmany, many job losses\u201d this year because of the impact of coronavirus on the economy. Technically the UK has not yet reached the official benchmark for a recession - two successive quarters of negative growth - but in practice the economy is already shrinking considerably, with some forecasts saying the country is facing the deepest recession for 300 years. Johnson seemed to acknowledge this when he said: I am afraid tragically there will be many, many job losses. That is just inevitable. But he also said the government would be as \u201cas activist and interventionist\u201d in helping people in the next phase of the crisis as it has been up to now. (See 5.41pm.) Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, refused to explicitly back the government\u2019s decision to impose quarantine on new arrivals to the UK from next week. He also implied that scientists are sceptical about the policy generally. Asked if Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, had endorsed this timetable, he said dates and policy were a matter for ministers. He also said quarantine works best when the infection rate is low in the country receiving visitors and high in those countries sending them in. This is not the case with the UK at the moment vis-\u00e0-vis arrivals from most EU countries. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, said it would take \u201cquite some time\u201d before the new test and trace system was working at full capacity. He said: The new thing that has been brought in - and it is definitely, as you imply, in the early stages of its development, but it is definitely there, and definitely working, but it will work a lot better over time - is the new element of test and trace ... We are not yet at cruising altitude for this. The number of tests is going to keep on going up and our ability to use the tests we have got is going to carry on going up. This is going to carry on for quite some time before we get to the point where we are all satisfied we have got to the point we need. Johnson ducked a question about whether Britons would be able to take a foreign holiday this summer. Asked if it was safe to book one, he replied: I\u2019m not going to give advice on individuals\u2019 travel arrangements, but you know what the Foreign Office guidance is... everybody at the moment should avoid non-essential travel. He claimed he was a Sinophile. Asked about Huawei and whether he would now exclude it from the 5G network, he said he wanted solutions that worked for UK security. But he went on: I want to stress one thing. I am a Sinophile. I think China is an incredible country and an extraordinary civilisation. And I deeply disapprove of anti-Chinese xenophobia - attacks on people of Chinese appearance that we have seen in recent months. We must stamp out such xenophobia. I see absolutely no contradiction with what I\u2019ve said earlier about Hong Kong and high-risk vendors in critical national infrastructure and wanting a good, friendly, clear-eyed, working relationship with China and that\u2019s what this country will have. He said the UK was talking to other European countries about setting up \u201cair corridors\u201d that could allow them to bypass the quarantine rules. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is facing mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the decision to enforce a 14-day quarantine period on all arrivals into the UK months after the pandemic began. The Metropolitan police are facing claims of bias after figures showed that officers enforcing the coronavirus lockdown were more than twice as likely to issue fines to black people as to white people Health and social care workers could be asked to volunteer to look after people with Covid-19 without wearing protective equipment in the event of extreme shortages, according to proposals seen by the Guardian. Theresa May has launched a double attack on Johnson\u2019s government, speaking in the Commons to first warn about the security implications of a final no-deal Brexit, and then against the coronavirus quarantine plans. Johnson has announced a government U-turn to allow MPs who are shielding to vote by proxy following an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions or those who are looking after vulnerable loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. That\u2019s all from us for today. Thanks for the comments. This is from Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov on Boris Johnson\u2019s claim to be a Sinophile. (See 5.45pm.) The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, the Ministry of Justice daily update shows. As at 5pm on Tuesday, 479 prisoners had tested positive for coronavirus across 79 prisons, an increase of just two cases in 24 hours, a rise of less than 0.5% The number of prison staff with the virus increased by just five cases to 935 workers across 105 prisons in the same period, a rise of less than 1% The figures are not live cases and include those who have recovered. There are around 80,000 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Justice unveiled its plan for recovery within the prison estate with potential to restart prison visits in July. Johnson says the UK is discussing air corridors (or \u201cair bridges\u201d, as they are sometimes called) with other European partners. But he will not give details. But he has a message for Italians, he says: \u201cCome back to the UK.\u201d But you have to quarantine, he says. The press conference is now over. I will post a summary soon. Q: What assurances can you give to the car industry in the West Midlands? Johnson says he wants to champion low-carbon vehicles. That is the future. Q: What advice can you give to parents worried about sending their children to school? Whitty says he will reply as a doctor would; when putting a patient on a new treatment, you stress the advantages and the disadvantages. He says children are much less likely than adults to get severe illness from coronavirus. And parents of primary school children are generally not in the age group where they are at high risk, he says. He accepts some parents may have health issues that make them vulnerable. He says government has to perform a balancing act between slowing transmission, and making sure children do not lose out by missing education. He says other family members might be at risk. They need to take sensible decisions, he says. Q: Do you want to exclude Huawei now from the 5G network? Johnson says he thinks what is happening now in Hong Kong will be an infringement of the agreement between China and the UK. On Huawei, he says he wants solutions for the UK that protect UK security. But he stresses that he is a Sinophile. He deeply disapproves of anti-Chinese phobia. We must stamp out attacks on Chinese people, he says. Q: Did Sage specifically advise on imposing quarantine from 8 June? Vallance says it did not advise on timing. That is a policy matter for ministers. He repeats the point about Sage advising that quarantine works best when the incidence of coronavirus is low here and high in other countries. Q: [From the Sun] When will test and trace be operating at full capacity? And are you comfortable for more lockdown measures to be eased before this is up and running? Whitty says they are playing leapfrog. Capacity goes up, then testing goes up. With more capacity, more can be done. Now they can test members of the general public. That means test and trace can operate. And it means the government can identify hotspots. They are not yet at \u201ccruising altitude\u201d, he says. He says it will take quite some time to get there. Vallance says a test and trace system is not the single answer. Other measures will be needed too. Q: Many people will lose their jobs. Will you find new jobs for them, or provide training? Johnson says there will be \u201cmany, many job losses\u201d. That is \u201cinevitable\u201d, he says. He says the government will be \u201cas activist and interventionist\u201d in helping people as it has been so far, he says. He says no other country in the world has done as much. (That last point is not true, according to this Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis.) Whitty says coronavirus is an infection we will have to live alongside for many months, and possibly longer. He says the lockdown should be relaxed very cautiously. He says the government has to isolate people with the virus, or who might have the virus. The people most likely to get it from these people are people in their household. He says test and trace has just been brought in. It will work better over time. It will allow the government to identify people most at risk. Whitty goes on to talk about reducing transmission at an individual level. Washing hands is important, and so is coughing etiquette. The 2-metre rule is important. And if people cannot socially distance at 2 metres, they should wear face coverings. He says all these measures will continue for as long as the epidemic continues. On top of that, the government needs to break social contacts. That is why pubs have been closed down, and why shops and schools were closed too. In this category of lockdown measures, the changes have been very modest, he says. Whitty says shielding is also important, to protect those at greatest risk. A small adjustment has been made to this, but it is \u201cvery small\u201d. And research is vital too - finding new vaccines and drugs. Whitty says he has set out all these measures to explain that it is not \u201clockdown over\u201d. He says the changes announced have been modest. Q: [From Sky] Protesters in London are angry about the death of George Floyd. They cannot speak to the US president. You can. What will you say to him? Johnson says we mourn George Floyd. He says he was appalled and sickened by what happened to him. His message to Trump is that racist violence has no place in society. People have a right to protest. But they should do so peacefully. Q: The government said the lockdown would not be relaxed until the alert level went down to 3. But it is still at 4. What has happened? Whitty says relaxing the lockdown was linked to the government\u2019s five tests. But the alert level is different, he says. It is independently set. It monitors the spread of the disease. (Whitty is wrong about this. The government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan specifically said: \u201cThe content and timing of the second stage of adjustments will depend on the most up-to-date assessment of the risk posed by the virus. The five tests set out in the first chapter must justify changes, and they must be warranted by the current alert level.\u201d And the government produced a chart saying gradual relaxation of the lockdown would only start when the alert level went down to 3. See here.) Q: [From the BBC] Are holidays abroad going to happen? If someone has paid a deposit, should they cancel? Johnson says he will not give people holiday advice. But the Foreign Office advice is clear; everyone should avoid non-essential travel. Q: Would a quarantine like this have saved lives if introduced earlier? And did Sage give advice on the new quarantine policy? Johnson defended the decision to impose a quarantine now, saying: \u201cNow that we\u2019re getting the virus under control in the UK, there is a risk that cases from abroad begin once again to make up a greater proportion of overall cases. We therefore need to take steps now to manage that risk of these imported cases triggering a second peak.\u201d Vallance says the advice is clear: quarantine measures work best when the level of coronavirus in the UK is low, and when it is high in the countries from which people might be arriving. Johnson also said the government \u201cwill explore the possibility\u201d of \u201ctravel corridors\u201d with countries with low rates of coronavirus. Q: What help is there for parents who need to go back to work but who do not have childcare options? Johnson says he understands how frustrating that is. He says they hope to get primary children back. The government will continue to support people, thought things like the furlough system. As for specific options with childcare, he refers the questioner (a member of the public) to the government\u2019s coronavirus website. He says not being able to get childcare should be seen by employers as a reasonable excuse for not being able to go back to work. The first question is from Amy in Brighton. She says Spain has relaxed its lockdown, but there is no second spike. Why? Vallance says he would hope to see the same thing happen here. Johnson says it is possible there could be a second wave. It has its own kinetic force, he says. Whitty says a second wave is quite common. And here are the figures for deaths. Vallance says there is a long tail. It is not coming down as fast as we would like it to come down. Vallance is now going through the slides. The first is for the number of new cases. He says these figures only show people tested. The real number of new cases per day may be more like 8,000, he says. He says the numbers are not coming down fast. That means there is \u201crelatively little room for manoeuvre\u201d, he says. Johnson says as the weather gets worse some people may be tempted to move the gatherings they would have held outdoors indoors. He urges people not to do that, he says. He says the government relaxed the rules for outdoor gatherings because there is much less risk of transmission outside. Johnson says there must be effective international action to reduce the impact of the virus. Health experts have warned that, if the virus is left to spread, future waves could return to strike the UK, he says. He says many developing countries have health systems that are ill prepared for this. Tomorrow he will host a global vaccine summit, he says. Here are the death figures from today\u2019s slides. Johnson is speaking now. He appeals to people to get tested if they have symptoms. And he justifies the decision to introduce quarantine. Boris Johnson is taking the UK government press conference today. It is due to start imminently. He will be appearing with Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has reiterated the region\u2019s opposition to government plans to use \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d to combat Covid-19 flare-ups. Speaking at his regular weekly media briefing, Burnham said: We think this is fraught with difficulties and we have serious concerns about it. At the moment we don\u2019t have a great deal of detail as to how it would work in practice. The government has spoken of it not necessarily just being linked to a single building or an institution, but could be imposed over a wide geographical area. It\u2019s not clear who would make that decision or how it would be enforced and we think there are major difficulties with that. To throw out something as potentially worrying as a local lockdown to people without the detail I think is wrong. The latest Guardian Politics Weekly podcast is out. Sonia Sodha chats to Michael Savage about the latest in Westminster. Peter Walker talks to Lib Dem leadership candidate Layla Moran, and Rajeev Syal reports on the latest restoration plans for the Palace of Westminster. Scotland\u2019s national parks are demanding urgent guidance on reopening public toilets safely and consistently, after weekend reports of local residents near beaches and beauty spots discovering human excrement left by daytrippers, my colleague Libby Brooks reports. Labour\u2019s Taiwo Owetami asks what testing capacity is needed to make test and trace a success. Harding says at the moment there is excess capacity. But in the autumn, when more people get ill with Covid-like symptoms, more capacity will be needed. She says she agrees that at the moment the priority is to speed up testing times. Hunt wraps up the session with another complaint about Harding\u2019s failure to provide data about the number of contacts taking place under test and trace. (See 3.38pm.) He says: I hope you understand that our frustration is that it is very hard to scrutinise what the government is doing if we\u2019re not given the data that allows us to do that. Laura Trott, a Conservative, asks about the app being tested on the Isle of Wight. Harding says the feedback has been very positive. She says more than 50,000 people have downloaded the app - although she admits some of those are people not living on the island. Labour\u2019s Barbara Keeley asks what financial help is available to anyone told to self-isolate. Harding says anyone who is told to self-isolate by test and trace is eligible for statutory sick pay. If not, they could get universal credit, she says. Q: But those pay very little. And this could happen to people more than once. Harding says she understands this. But she says the scheme should work alongside people physically distancing. If you have not been close to someone for more than 15 minutes, you cannot be asked to self-isolate. So this should encourage people to practice physical distancing, she says. Q: But what about key workers, who might come into contact with people with symptoms, like healthcare workers? Harding says if workers have been wearing PPE, they won\u2019t be asked to self-isolate. Back in the Commons health committee Labour\u2019s Rosie Cooper asks what is being done to ensure fraudsters don\u2019t cheat people by pretending to be from test and trace. Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS test and trace system in England, says the test and trace system will never ask for people\u2019s bank details. She says its phone number is public. She says if people receive suspicious text messages or emails, they should report them. But she says there will always be people trying to take advantage of people. Cooper says she does not know where there is no number people can ring to check a call is genuine. Harding says there is a number. It\u2019s 119, she says. The UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll has risen to 39,748 - that\u2019s 359 new deaths since yesterday. The latest daily figures from the Department for Health and Social Care also show there were 171,829 tests on 2 June. Luke Evans, a Conservative, asks what will be done to stop people false reporting that they have been in contact with someone. He suggests this could be done maliciously to force police officers to isolate, or MPs. Harding says she does not think that is likely. She says people have to supply their details. She does not rule it out, but she suggests this is improbable. Hunt says a Sage report from 1 May (pdf) said that contact tracing would only be effective if people were contacted and put into isolation within 48 hours. He asks how many tests results are provided within 24 hours. Harding says over 90% of all test results come within 48 hours. (That is the answer Boris Johnson gave when asked the same question in the Commons by Hunt. See 12.19pm.) Hunt says he wants to know what the figure is for results within 24 hours. Harding says she does not have that figure. Hunt says he finds that hard to believe. Harding then says she does not have validated data. Harding does, though, offer to give the committee a flavour of what is happening. She says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of people contacted by the service are happy to be contacted and to self-isolate. As an example, she cites a person who was planning to go to a family barbecue. She says they were glad to be contacted, because it meant they would not put their family at risk. Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS test and trace system in England, has just started giving evidence to the Commons health committee. Jeremy Hunt, the chair, asks for details of how many people have been contacted. Harding says she cannot give those figures. The system was only launched six days ago, she says. She says she cannot give data at this point because it has not been validated. Hunt says he is disappointed by this answer. Harding says she hopes to start publishing a weekly dashboard with data next week. But to begin with it will not have all the statistics, she says. NHS England has recorded another 179 hospital deaths today. (See 2.20pm.) For the record, here are the equivalent daily NHS England figures for the last two weeks. Wednesday 20 May - 166 Thursday 21 May - 187 Friday 22 May - 121 Saturday 23 May - 157 Sunday 24 May - 147 Monday 25 May - 59 Tuesday 26 May - 116 Wednesday 27 May - 183 Thursday 28 May - 185 Friday 29 May - 149 Saturday 30 May - 146 Sunday 31 May - 85 Monday 1 June - 108 Tuesday 2 June - 143 Here are some of the main points from this afternoon\u2019s Downing Street briefing. Figures on the test-and-trace scheme would only be released once they had been verified and processes had been discussed with the statistics watchdog, Downing Street indicated. The UK Statistics Authority has rebuked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, over the way testing figures have been handled so far. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We are encouraged by the progress so far and are working with the UK Statistics Authority to consider what information it would be useful to publish on the performance of the service and taking the time to ensure this is verified. The PM\u2019s spokesman outlined the membership of the government\u2019s new coronavirus strategy and operations committees. Boris Johnson, Rishi Sunak, Dominic Raab, Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Matt Hancock and Alok Sharma will attend the new C-19 strategy committee. And Gove, Sunak and Hancock will attend the C-19 operations committee. Other cabinet ministers will attend the committee meetings \u201caccording to the agenda\u201d, and they will meet \u201cas often as is required\u201d. The cabinet will continue to meet virtually despite the return of MPs to Westminster. The PM\u2019s spokesman said this was due to social distancing not being possible in the cabinet room, so this week it was conducted via video conference. Downing Street said postal tests could not be included within the PM\u2019s new 24-hour target because of factors that were not within the government\u2019s control. The spokesman said it was dependent on people doing the test straight away and sending it back immediately. Downing Street said businesses should be preparing for life after the UK leaves the single market and customs union. The PM\u2019s spokesman said that, whatever the outcome of negotiations, the UK will be leaving the single market and customs union at the end of the year. In response to the concerns raised by Nissan, No 10 said it remained committed to reaching a deal with Brussels which would result in no tariffs or quotas on cross-border trade. The Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne asks whether the home secretary will bring forward the review of the quarantine policy by 10 days, \u201cto limit a second wave of economic damage\u201d. Patel says the date for review has already been outlined. The Tory MP Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown asks whether the home secretary will consider and urgently review as soon as possible the establishment of air bridges, particularly with countries where the rate of infection is lower than our own. Patel says this is absolutely right and they want to find a safe way for people to travel. Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 Committee, says hundreds of thousands of jobs will be lost if airlines are unable to fly their peak summer schedules. He asks that there be clear criteria for air corridors and the first list of safe countries well before the three-week review on 29 June. Patel says the transport secretary will be leading on this. Meanwhile, the Tory former international trade secretary Liam Fox\u2019s intervention is worth quoting in full: I\u2019m afraid I simply cannot get my head around the public health mental gymnastics of this policy. If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak. And if it is a contingency measure against a second wave, why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have. Surely the answer lies in the government\u2019s test-and-trace system, rather than unnecessary economic isolation. He asks how, in the event of air bridges, it will be possible to identify travellers in transit or stopover passengers who may be able to come through the bridge from higher risk areas to the UK. Patel says the data from the contact locator form will be instrumental in giving people clearance to go through and transit to other locations. She adds the form should be adapted to include data including Covid test information. The Tory former environment secretary Theresa Villiers urges the home secretary to suspend the implementation of the blanket quarantine requirement, to allow more time for air bridges to be in place safely and to save aviation jobs. Patel says this would require bilateral agreements with countries, which the FCO is working on. The Conservative MP Ben Spencer calls the 14-day quarantine \u201ca very blunt tool\u201d with many downsides and consequences for the aviation industry. He calls for the government to move \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to a precise, more targeted based on science and international safety standards that would protect the both the health of the public and staff and save livelihoods. Patel says this is an international crisis, so there is no \u201cbespoke\u201d way of working throughout the crisis for the aviation sector. NHS England has announced 179 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,044. The full details are here. Of the 179 new deaths announced on Wednesday: - 20 occurred on 2 June - 47 occurred on 1 June - 18 occurred on 31 May The figures also show 66 of the new deaths took place between 2 and 30 May, 24 occurred in April, and the remaining four deaths took place in March, with the earliest on 24 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Wednesday by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number of hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 897. Back in the Commons, the Conservative MP Steve Brine says the quarantine measures are \u201cthe right move at the wrong time\u201d. He asks if the government would consider \u201ctravel gates\u201d to block travellers from certain countries based on the science, in what would be a more targeted \u201crisk-based approach\u201d. Patel says there will be a range of measures and ongoing dialogue with the industry. Public Health Wales said a further 17 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,371. And another 82 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases there to 14,203. Patel added: Taking this public health action - alongside our other measures, including test and trace and continued social distancing - will ensure we have greater freedom in the longer term. That includes international travel corridors. Currently, there should only be essential travel, but across government and with the sector we continue to explore all options for future safe travel. Any international approaches will be bilateral and agreed with the other countries concerned. We need to ensure that those countries are deemed to be safe. We are not alone in our fight against this disease, or in the measures we have taken to stop it. Patel says she will not allow a reckless minority to put quarantine at risk. A breach of the rule could lead to a \u00a31,000 fine in England, or potential prosecution. She says the measures will be reviewed regularly to ensure they are proportionate. The first review will take place in the week beginning 28 June. She says various factors will be taken into account when the government decides whether or not to continue with the measures, including: the rate of infection, credibility of reporting, what other governments are doing, the infection rate in other countries and the extent to which testing minimises the risk. Patel says the quarantine measures will come in from 8 June. She says a limited number of exemptions from the self-isolation rule for new arrivals have been allowed. Arrivals will have to fill in a contact locator form, including details of where they will be isolated, and how they can be contacted. The form will have to be completed before arrival. Passengers will need a receipt showing they have filled it in. Border Force officers will be able to impose a \u00a3100 fine on those who do not comply, she says. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is making a Commons statement now about the quarantine scheme. She says the priority is to protect people\u2019s health. This scheme will play an important role, she says. The scientific advice has been consistent and clear, she says. She says we are past the peak - but now more vulnerable to infections being introduced from abroad. She says quarantine would have made little difference earlier - when transmission rates within the UK were higher. But now it would help, she says. Nearly a decade of progress in narrowing the attainment gap in England between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates has probably been \u201cwiped in a few months\u201d due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study has found. Analysis by the Education Endowment Foundation charity said the closure of schools to most pupils 10 weeks ago was likely to reverse all progress made to close the gap since 2011. Over the past decade the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates at the end of primary school in England is estimated to have narrowed from 11.5 months in 2009 to 9.2 months in 2019, according to the Education Policy Institute. However, the EEF fears that progress made since 2011 will now be lost. The analysis, published on Wednesday, said its median estimate was that the attainment gap could widen by 36% but that \u201cplausible estimates\u201d indicated it could widen by between 11% and 75%. Sir Keir Starmer has not held a one-on-one conversation with the prime minister for more than a month, the Labour leader\u2019s spokesman told journalists. As PA Media reports, the spokesman said the telephone talks referred to by Boris Johnson during PMQs (see 12.09pm) were with all opposition leaders, with the last one-on-one conversation occurring on April 29. Starmer has since written a letter (see 12.31pm) requesting a meeting with the PM and the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to discuss schools reopening but Labour says there has been no reply. Downing Street\u2019s new Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) will be moved to the Department of Health and run by one of its senior officials \u2013 instead of the Home Office\u2019s head of counter-terrorism as originally proposed. It is now expected to be led by Clara Swinson, currently responsible for global and public health, in a swift replacement for Tom Hurd, a security specialist who was also a schoolmate of Boris Johnson. But the changes reflect a rapid shift in emphasis after some public health experts had voiced concern that the pandemic virus did not behave in a similar way to violent terrorists. \u201cA different approach is being taken,\u201d a source said. Initially the JBC was modelled on the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre, which assesses the terror threat level, when it was announced by the prime minister in early May. It was intended to assess the pandemic threat on a colour coded scale from one (low) to five (critical), replacing a lower-profile alert system that reported to the country\u2019s four chief medical officers. Initially the risk level was set at four although the government had hoped it would be reduced to three this week as the lockdown began to ease on 1 June. But all four chief medical officers refused to endorse the change because it would contradict evidence the virus was still widespread. The body has been brought firmly under the control of the chief medical officers, including England\u2019s Prof Chris Whitty, suggesting the group will take on disease monitoring currently carried out by Public Health England, with greater involvement from the devolved nations. Hurd, one of the sons of the one-time Conservative foreign secretary Sir Douglas, is expected to return to his job at the Home Office. An Old Etonian, he is considered a contender to become the next director general at MI6. The Bank of England has said it is looking at \u201ca number of outcomes\u201d including a no-deal Brexit scenario, following reports its governor, Andrew Bailey, has told banks and lenders to prepare for the transition period to end without agreement. Bailey said during a call with bank chief executives that they should accelerate planning for the outcome, according to Sky News. Here is the PA Media write-up of PMQs. Boris Johnson has said thousands of people have been traced under the government\u2019s test and trace system for Covid-19, although he did not give a precise figure. During a heated exchange with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs in the Commons, Johnson said thousands of people were being tested every day for coronavirus and their contacts traced. It comes after some of the 25,000 contact tracers employed by the government told the media they have nothing to do, despite earning up to \u00a327.75 an hour. Channel 4 News also reported on Tuesday that of 4,634 contacts provided to NHS Test and Trace by people who have tested positive for Covid-19, just 1,749 were contacted in the first four days of the system going live. The Department of Health said those figures were out of date, adding that it intends to publish weekly performance data shortly. Johnson told MPs: \u201cThousands of people are being tested every day. \u201cEvery person who tests positive in the test and trace programme is then contacted, then thousands of their contacts are then contacted, people they have been in contact with. \u201cAt the moment as a result of our test, track and trace system ... thousands of people are now following our guidance, following the law, and self-isolating to stop the spread of the disease.\u201d The Scottish government has warned that failing to extend the Brexit transitional arrangements to the end of 2022 could cost the Scottish economy up to \u00a33bn and lower its GDP by up to \u00a32bn. Mike Russell, Scotland\u2019s constitution and Europe secretary, said the forecast showed that leaving the EU on 31 December this year would deepen the recession expected to follow the coronavirus crisis, hitting businesses and employers already suffering from a steep decline in economic activity. Citing the Scottish government\u2019s new forecast, Russell urged the UK government to listen to all the business leaders, opposition parties and EU leaders calling for an extension to the Brexit transition. He said the Tory government had to extend it for two more years, and had to do so before 30 June, the cut-off date agreed with the EU: Given the huge economic hit caused by coronavirus it would be an act of extraordinary recklessness for the UK government to refuse to seek an extension. [I] believe there is a growing common-sense coalition to press for an extension to avoid such a disastrous outcome and the needless damage it would do to Scottish jobs and our economy. Sir Keir Starmer gave an interview to the Guardian today that was interpreted by us, and others, as indicating a hardening of his stance against the government: less consensus-seeking, more condemnatory. Obviously in normal circumstances the Guardian is never wrong, but on the basis of what happened at PMQs today it is not clear that anything much has changed. At PMQs Starmer has consistently presented himself as the most reasonable person at the dispatch box (more on that here, including why it worked for another opposition leader) and today he won the \u201ctalking sense\u201d competition quite comfortably. It wasn\u2019t as if the questions were, on their own, especially memorable. But Starmer does tend to specialise in loaded questions to which there is no safe or easy answer (\u201cwhen did you stop beating your wife?\u201d questions, as I think they are known at the bar), and Johnson has yet to develop any plausible response mechanism. At their last PMQs he tried responding with promises (the \u201cworld-beating\u201d test and trace system). We had a flash of that from Johnson at PMQs later, when he pledged to ensure all test results are turned around with 24 hours by the end of the month (see 12.19pm \u2013 there may well be some clarification of quite what this involves at the lobby briefing later) but mostly, in his exchanges with Starmer, Johnson resorted to criticising the opposition leader for \u2013 well, opposing the government. He accused Starmer of launching \u201cendless attacks on public trust and confidence\u201d and of \u201ccasting aspersions\u201d on the good character of people working on test and trace (some of whom are spending much of their time watching Netflix because they don\u2019t have enough to do, if BBC News is to be believed). This is a lame form of parliamentary defence at the best times. But given that the PM is facing criticism for not even doing his own job properly (see 9.37am), it was unwise to invest so much in attacking Starmer for doing his. Three Metropolitan police staff have died after testing positive for Covid-19, the force\u2019s commissioner has revealed. Dame Cressida Dick told the London assembly police and crime committee: Very sadly, we have lost three police staff colleagues, apparently to Covid, in this time period. She also said there were more than 900 assaults on police staff and officers between 20 March and 31 May, including 100 attacks involving spitting or coughing where coronavirus was used as a threat. Of those 100 incidents, 83 people were charged, with 13 of the 14 dealt with by the courts so far handed a custodial sentence, which Dick said \u201cunderlines the courts are taking these horrible offences seriously\u201d. The latest weekly statistics from the National Records of Scotland show that coronavirus deaths in Scotland have fallen for the fifth week in a row, but total deaths in care homes (1,818) have exceeded total deaths in hospital (1,815) for the first time. Between 25 and 31 May, 131 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate have been registered, a decrease of 99 from the previous week. As of 31 May, a total 3,911 deaths related to coronavirus have been registered in Scotland. While there was also a reduction in deaths in care homes over the past week, it is still the case that more than half (52%) of all registered deaths involving Covid-19 in the week occurred in care homes. At first minister\u2019s questions, Nicola Sturgeon said that the figures gave grounds for optimism, but insisted that the stay-at-home message remained essential. Earlier Boris Johnson implied that MPs who cannot attend the Commons to vote in person will be allowed to vote by proxy. When Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, was asked about this yesterday, he did not rule out the idea - but did not support it either. This is from Robert Halfon, a Conservative MP who has to shield. All schools in Wales are to reopen to pupils at the end of June, almost a month after the phased reopening began in England, the Welsh government has confirmed. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools would reopen on June 29 and the summer term would be extended by a week to July 27, with plans for an additional week off at half-term in the next academic year. She said there would be a \u201cphased approach in each school\u201d, with split year groups and a staggered timetable to ensure that no more than a third of pupils are in any school at one time. The minister added that classes would be much smaller, with time in school supported by online lessons in a system which is expected to continue when schools return in September. Further education colleges will reopen from 15 June for face-to-face learning, especially for vulnerable students and those working towards licence to practice assessments, the minister announced. \u201cMy announcement today gives schools three and a half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe will use the last weeks of the summer term to make sure pupils, staff and parents are prepared \u2013 mentally, emotionally and practically \u2013 for the new normal in September.\u201d She went on: 29 June means there will have been one full month of test, trace and protect, which will continue to expand. I can also announce that teachers will be a priority group in our new antibody-testing programme. As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical. Teachers, parents and some councils in England have argued that Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to start opening schools to more pupils from June 1 was premature, with infection rates still high, particularly in some areas in the north, and the test, track and trace system still in its infancy. PMQs has now finished. Snap verdict coming up soon. But, first, the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson has this Labour response to one of the points the PM made earlier. (See 12.09pm.) Theresa May, the former Tory PM, asks for an assurance that the UK will continue to get access to EU databases needed for fighting crime from next year. Johnson says that will depend on the outcome of the Brexit talks. But he hopes the EU will see sense, he says. Labour\u2019s Andy Slaughter asks why references to structural racism were removed from the Public Health England report on diversity and coronavirus yesterday. Johnson says the government commissioned the review. He says he thinks it is \u201cintolerable\u201d that some groups are more at risk. Johnson says the government is doing everything it can to support the UK steel industry. He says 98% of the companies supplying HS2 are based in the UK. Asked if he will end the \u201crough sex\u201d defence, Johnson says that the government is committed to addressing this and that this defence is inexcusable. Labour\u2019s Fleur Anderson asks the PM to condemn the actions of the US police. Johnson says he condemns the killing of George Floyd. Asked if the furlough scheme can be extended for the air industry, Johnson says he cannot give that commitment now. But the government will look at all it can do to support the industry. Johnson says he thought Labour supported quarantine. It is being introduced to keep the infection rate down, he says. Here is the text of the private letter Sir Keir Starmer sent to Boris Johnson that he said he would now be publishing. Labour\u2019s Maria Eagle says Covid has hit worse in deprived areas. Will Liverpool and Knowsley councils get all the money they need to address this? Johnson says he will write back to Eagle about this. Laura Trott, a Conservative, says Sevenoaks needs more police on the streets. Johnson says he agrees. Mark Fletcher, a Conservative, asks if the PM will meet him to discuss how Bolsover (Fletcher\u2019s constituency) can lead the way in green jobs. Johnson says Fletcher has the right vision for the future. Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, asks why self-employed people who pay themselves through dividends do not get support from the Treasury scheme. Johnson says he has an answer of huge complexity. Basically, it would be too complicated to verify, he says. Asked why he is only introducing quarantine now, Johnson says that is because it is vital to keep the infection rate down. Paul Howell, a Conservative, asks about the government\u2019s levelling-up agenda. Should the Treasury be moved to Sedgefield (where Howell is MP). Johnson jokes that he will look at this, but Sedgefield should be careful what it wishes for. Labour\u2019s Lloyd Russell-Moyle asks about cuts to fire services. Johnson says he will respond to Russell-Moyle\u2019s letter on this. Johnson says he understands why people want places of worship to open. But it is tough. Every time you relax a measure, you take a risk with R, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks about the killing of George Floyd. What has the PM said to President Trump about this? Can he say \u201cblack lives matter\u201d? Johnson says of course black lives matter. The only reservation he would have is that protests must be peaceful. Blackford says Johnson did not say what he had said to Trump about this. Will the PM review riot equipment to the US? Johnson says he is happy to look at this, but all exports are covered by guidance, and Britain\u2019s is the most scrupulous in the world. Jeremy Hunt, the Tory chair of the health committee, asks how many tests are being turned around in 24 hours. Johnson says 90% are turned around in 48 hours. He says all the mobile tests are turned around in 24 hours. He says he can promise all tests will be turned around within 24 hours by the end of June, unless there are insuperable difficulties. Starmer says he has tried to support the government. He thought the schools issued needed consensus. That is why he offered to help. He says the scenes in parliament yesterday were \u201cshameful\u201d. If any other employer operated like this, it would be a clear and obvious case of discrimination. Will the PM stop this? Johnson says people around the country are having to queue. He says it is not unreasonable to expect MPs to do their job. When people look at what the government is doing ... He says his policy is test, trace and isolate. Labour\u2019s is agree, U-turn and criticise. Starmer says the PM is mistaking scrutiny for criticism. He would like to support the government\u2019s policy, he says. But Johnson makes it difficult. He says the government said it would not relax the lockdown until the alert level was lowered. What is it now, and what is the R number? Johnson says the alert level does allow the lockdown to be relaxed. The question is whether or not Starmer supports the government\u2019s plan. Starmer says Johnson did not put a number on those being contacted. He says the number of people testing positive every day is only a fraction of the people being infected. The system probably should be contacting 45,000 people a day. He quotes the UK Statistics Authority criticism of the government. Can the PM not see how much damage is being done to trust? Johnson says he does not know why Starmer continues to undermine trust in government. Starmer should give credit to the people involved. Starmer says he will publish his letter to Johnson. He says the government should have been working on a test and trace system for weeks. He says Dido Harding, who is in charge of the system, has said it will not be fully ready until the end of June. Johnson says Starmer is casting aspersions on the people behind the scheme. The scheme was up and running on 1 June, he says. He says thousands of people are now self-isolating as a response. Starmer says Johnson asks him to cooperate. But he says he wrote to the prime minister privately about schools policy. Johnson never replied, he says. He says a survey at the weekend for the Reuters trust showed a huge fall in trust in the government. Johnson says he phoned Starmer after he got the letter. He says Starmer did not criticise his policy. He says the public are following the government guidance. Sir Keir Starmer starts by saying how shocked he was by the death of George Floyd. Referring to today\u2019s Telegraph story (see 9.37am), he asks who has been in charge up to now. Johnson also condemns what happened to George Floyd. But he says people should protest in a peaceful way. He says he takes full responsibility for what happened. He says people know that \u201cwith good British common sense\u201d we can tackle this. Johnson rattles off the amount of money going to Blackpool, in response to a question from Scott Benton. Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP, asks about yesterday\u2019s Public Health England report about diversity and the risk from coronavirus. Johnson says the government commissioned that report. It is obvious different communities are affected differently. Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, will take this work on, he says. Boris Johnson starts by saying he will host a global vaccine summit tomorrow. PMQs is about to start. But first Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, suspends proceedings for one minute to allow some MPs to leave the chamber and others to come in. Only 50 are allowed in at any one time now. From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth PMQs is starting soon. You can read the list of MPs down to ask a question here (pdf). Next Wednesday, 10 June, is the last day when an employer can furlough a worker for the first time under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. But Citizens Advice is urging the government to extend this deadline for the 2 million-plus people in the shielding category - who have been advised to stay at home because they are extremely clinically vulnerable. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: While the government\u2019s gradual approach to winding down the job retention scheme is welcome, there are now just days left for employers to protect their workers who need to shield. We are already seeing too many heartbreaking cases where, having been denied furlough, shielded workers face the impossible choice of safeguarding their health or ensuring they have enough to live on. The government should waive the 10 June deadline for the shielded group, and those they live with. Employers should also be exempt from contributing to the cost of the scheme for the shielded group. Public Health England (PHE) has insisted it published its review (pdf) on disparities in Covid-19 health risks and outcomes for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups in full following claims that parts were removed by government officials. The study, unveiled by the health secretary Matt Hancock on Tuesday, confirmed earlier findings from the Office for National Statistics that BAME individuals have a much higher risk of death from Covid-19 than white people, as do those from poorer backgrounds, men and anyone who is obese or suffering from diabetes. However, a report in the Health Service Journal said sources had informed it that the Department of Health removed a key section from the review. It said a draft that was circulated within government last week contained a section which included responses from over 1,000 organisations and individuals who supplied evidence to the review. Some of these responses said discrimination and poor life chances were playing a part in the increased risk of Covid-19 to those with BAME backgrounds. The Muslim Council of Britain made a recommendation which stated: With high levels of deaths of BAME healthcare workers, and extensive research showing evidence and feelings of structural racism and discrimination in the NHS, PHE should consider exploring this in more detail, and looking into specific measures to tackle the culture of discrimination and racism. It may also be of value to issue a clear statement from the NHS that this is not acceptable, committing to introducing change. One source told HSJ the section \u201cdid not survive contact with Matt Hancock\u2019s office\u201d over the weekend. The review was published on Tuesday with very little notice, following claims it was delayed by the government amid concerns of \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, which Downing Street denied. The HSJ said it understands the responses may be used to inform a set of recommendations to be possibly published later by PHE. Launching the review on 4 May, Prof Kevin Fenton, regional director of public health at PHE and NHS London, said it would engage a wide range of external experts, independent advisers, and diverse constituencies and communities. PHE maintained it had published the report in full. A spokeswoman said: Professor Fenton has been engaging with a significant number of individuals and organisations within the BAME community over the past couple of months, to hear their views, concerns and ideas about the impact of Covid-19 on their communities. The valuable insight he has gathered will help inform the work the equalities minister is now taking forward. You can read the full HSJ story here. The Imperial College paper (pdf) published on 16 March is the one that is generally credited with triggering the lockdown because it contained modelling showing that the NHS would be overwhelmed unless extreme measures were taken to suppress the virus. But the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was also providing similar advice to the government. They have already published a paper with their projections, but it has now been peer reviewed and it\u2019s here, on the Lancet\u2019s website. This is from Adam Kucharski, one of the authors. The LSHTM team forecast that the most stringent version of a lockdown could result in a death toll of 50,000 - much less than under less strict versions. As we reported yesterday, the UK has just passed that figure. Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people were nearly 50% more likely than white people to be arrested in London under coronavirus laws, new figures suggest. The total number of Fixed Penalty Notices (FPNs) handed out by the Metropolitan Police between 27 March and 14 May was almost a fifth higher for those from non-white communities. While people from non-white backgrounds make up around four in 10 (41%) of the capital\u2019s population, according to ONS data, they account for more than half of the fines (54%) and arrests (55%) for alleged breaches of Covid-19 legislation. Black people make up 12% of the population but received 26% of the 973 fines handed out by police and accounted for 31% of arrests, while Asian people, who account for 18% of London\u2019s population, were handed 23% of fines and were subject to 14% of arrests. Police were given powers to break up gatherings or fine and arrest people for breaching lockdown rules under the Health Protection Regulations 2020 from 2 March. Up to 14 May, 973 FPNs were issued by the Met. Some 444 were given to white people, with the total figure (526) 18% higher for non-white people, including 253 issued to black people, 220 to Asian people and 53 to others, according to the information recorded by officers. The Met made a total of 747 arrests, although just 36 were for alleged breached of Covid-19 regulations alone, with the majority coming alongside arrests for other offences. There were a total of 414 arrests for those who classify themselves as black (232), Asian (106), mixed (47) and other (29), some 46% higher than the 284 arrests of white people. The UK\u2019s largest police force admitted \u201chigher proportions of those in BAME groups were issued with FPNs or arrested across London as a whole\u201d but added the reasons were \u201clikely to be complex and reflect a range of factors\u201d. It said: This includes interactions between the areas subject to significant proactive policing activity targeting crime hot-spots and both the variation in the age-profile and geographical distribution of ethnic groups in London. YouGov has released some polling on attitudes to the lockdown this morning. And it suggests that 21% of people say they are following lockdown rules less strictly than before - with a third of those saying that\u2019s at least partly because of Dominic Cummings. Here is the chart. As Chris Curtis explains in a commentary for the YouGov website, Cummings\u2019 excursion to Barnard Castle is not the only factor that might explain why people are taking the lockdown rules less seriously. Curtis says: Those advising the government had always suggested that people would become less observant of the rules as time goes on, which was one of the reasons for delaying lockdown in the first place. We have also seen an increase in the proportion of the public who think the situation is getting better, from 58% to 76% in two weeks, which might also be making some less cautious. Another factor might be ambiguity in the wording. The polling was carried out on Thursday last week and, when people were asked what they had done in the past week, 21% said they had followed the lockdown rules less strictly than previously. When the same question was asked at the end of April, only 5% gave that answer. But by Thursday last week the lockdown rules were less strict than they had been anyway and so some of those 21% may just be people transitioning from obeying the old rules to the new ones. Still, any evidence that people are taking socially distancing less seriously should be worrying. The documents released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies repeatedly stress that easing the lockdown is only safe if people continue to comply with restrictions like the two-metre rule. For example, this is what\u2019s Sage\u2019s scientific pandemic influenza group on modelling (SPI-M-O) said in a consensus view (pdf) dated 4 May. Behavioural changes in the levels of adherence rates are critically important, likely more so than the exact policies implemented, in determining whether the reproduction number remains below 1. Such changes cannot be forecast and therefore have not been included in these models. Even with contact tracing in place, there will need to be sustained, deep reductions in contacts outside work and schools to keep the reproduction number below 1. Commercial flights will return to London City airport by the end of June, with domestic routes the first to resume. The airport announced that international flights will restart early next month but the timing \u201cmay depend on the proposed quarantine of passengers arriving into the UK\u201d, according to a statement. London City\u2019s runway has been closed to commercial and private flights since 25 March due to travel restrictions and the collapse in demand amid the pandemic. Portugal\u2019s foreign minister has said his country is in discussions with the UK about \u201cair bridges\u201d so tourists can avoid being quarantined. Augusto Santos Silva told the Today programme this morning that \u201cquarantine is an enemy of tourism\u201d. He went on: During these weeks our diplomats will work together in order to guarantee that British tourists coming to Portugal would not be subjected on their return to England to any kind of quarantine. From our colleague Philip Oltermann in Berlin Fewer than half of people working from home as a result of the Covid-19 crisis are keen to return to the office, a new study suggests. As PA Media reports, many of those surveyed by jobs site Glassdoor said they were expecting significant changes to their usual working environment when they do return. Around half of the 2,000 employees questioned said they believed they would be back in their office in some capacity in the next few months, although a few said they would continue working from home until next year. And after PMQs in the Commons we will get a statement from Priti Patel, the home secretary, who will be giving details of the new quarantine scheme coming into force next week. The plans are not popular with many Tory MPs, who fear they could be crippling for the tourism industry. But, in a joint article in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) with Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, Patel says quarantine could be good for tourism. Patel and Shapps say: As we continue to follow the rules designed to protect our families, friends and loved ones, so should visitors to our country. And by stopping people coming in from spreading the virus further, we can control it and get back to normal sooner \u2013 meaning the tourism industry will be up and running faster. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. It is PMQs later, and the Daily Telegraph has this morning helpfully been writing Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s script for the exchanges. You might have thought that, given Boris Johnson\u2019s job title is prime minster etc etc .... Submerged underneath the peculiar headline and intro is a proper story about some machinery of government changes in Downing Street. Christopher Hope reports: A new strategy committee \u2013 dubbed \u201cCS\u201d \u2013 will be chaired by Mr Johnson, while the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, will chair the new operations committee, known in Whitehall as \u201cCO\u201d. Both will meet on a regular basis. The new approach echoes the government\u2019s Brexit planning last year which was led by an \u201cXS\u201d strategic and \u201cXO\u201d operational committee. The committees will replace four ministerial implementation groups, set up at the start of the crisis and covering foreign affairs, health, economy and business and public services, each chaired by a Cabinet minister. The regular Covid-19 committee meeting, which has been held every morning at Number 10, is being axed. One source said the new structure would give a more \u201ccohesive\u201d approach to tackling the pandemic. But the story also includes this quote, which inspired the headline. A senior Tory MP said Mr Johnson\u2019s shake-up was intended \u201cto bring some order\u201d to the decision-making process after a difficult two months. The MP said: \u201cBoris has decided that Cummings is there, but he is going to take more direct control.\u201d Edward Argar, the health minister, was asked about this in an interview on Sky, and he insisted that Johnson had always been in charge. He said: The prime minister is the head of this government. The prime minister has always been in charge. UPDATE: On the subject of Boris Johnson being in overall charge of the government\u2019s coronavirus strategy, it is worth recalling this anecdote from Tim Shipman\u2019s write-through in the Sunday Times (paywall) on 17 May. A moment of \u201ctense\u201d standoff between the prime minister and Sir Mark Sedwill, Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant, exposed growing fissures at the top over the implementation of his blueprint for lifting the lockdown. In a meeting early last week, two sources said Johnson had listened as the detail of the plan was outlined but then asked: \u201cWho is in charge of implementing this delivery plan?\u201d One recalled: \u201cThere was just silence. He looked over at Sedwill and said, \u2018Is it you?\u2019 Sedwill said, \u2018No, I think it\u2019s you, prime minister.\u2019\u201d Nick Robinson, the BBC Radio 4 Today presenter, had a rather fruitless exchange with the health minister Edward Argar about the government\u2019s plans for a quarantine. Robinson repeatedly asked Argar to name a European country with a higher infection rate than the UK, given that there is only a risk of \u201creimporting\u201d the virus if the UK allows unfettered access from a nation with a worse infection rate. Argar sidestepped the question three times, saying he didn\u2019t want to pre-empt Prit Patel\u2019s statement to parliament later today. Asked how the quarantine would be enforced, he said new arrivals would be required to give their address and that failure to stay there for 14 days would be met with a fine. He said he had confidence people \u201cwill do the right thing\u201d and comply with the measures. Priti Patel, the home secretary, will set out the government\u2019s quarantine policy for arrivals to the UK later today. We\u2019re expecting a statement in the Commons shortly after prime minister\u2019s questions this afternoon. The London Chamber of Commerce, which represents more than 2,000 companies in the capital, has said the government\u2019s proposed policy \u2013 requiring all UK arrivals to go into quarantine for 14 days \u2013 would send out a message that the UK is closed for business. In a letter to ministers, its chief executive, Paul Scully, writes: Domestically, the government\u2019s roadmap to restarting the economy is correctly centred on a risk-based approach. Yet this blanket aviation proposal doesn\u2019t appear to be risk-based. If it was, it would recognise that arrivals from some countries with much lower transmission levels than the UK and low incidence of the disease would not increase our risk, provided they adopted our social distancing protocols on arrival. The proposal sends out the message that the UK is closed for business, at a time when we are beginning to restart our economy. The BBC\u2019s Danny Shaw has some interesting, and worrying, statistics showing that a disproportionate number of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds have been fined for alleged lockdown breaches: Boris Johnson has said he will offer nearly three million people in Hong Kong a route to UK citizenship if China imposes a security law that critics say would rob the territory of its autonomy. Writing in The Times (\u00a3), the prime minister offered to make what he described as one of the \u201cbiggest changes\u201d in the history of the British visa system to allow 2.85 million Hong Kong citizens the chance of fully-fledged citizenship. The move, which represents an escalation in the stand-off between the UK and China, would put Hongkongers \u201con the route to citizenship\u201d, said the Conservative Party leader. China\u2019s ceremonial legislature, the National People\u2019s Congress, endorsed a security law for Hong Kong earlier this week that has strained relations with the UK and the US. Jeremy Hunt has said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for the government\u2019s flagship test-and-trace programme to be successful unless it rapidly speeds up the turnaround of test results from 48 hours. Hunt, the chair of the Commons health select committee, pointed out minutes from a Sage meeting which said that to be effective the programme must get people to isolate \u201cwithin 48 hours\u201d of them being in contact with an infected person. It currently takes an average of 48 hours for test results to be delivered. Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: My biggest concern at the moment is the time it\u2019s taking for tests to be turned around \u2026 If the test results themselves take 48 hours to come back that is going to be impossible. Hunt said he welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s new 24-hour test turnaround target but added: \u201cBut at the moment, the government isn\u2019t saying how many tests are being met within that target and for test and trace it\u2019s absolutely essential that they all are.\u201d Dido Harding, who is in charge of the UK\u2019s test-and-trace programme, is appearing before Hunt\u2019s health select committee later today. He said he would press Harding for figures on how many people had been contacted so far under the programme. Nissan has warned that its huge Sunderland factory would be unsustainable in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Ashwani Gupta, the company\u2019s global chief operating head, has told the BBC the imposition of tariffs would undermine its business model. The Japanese carmaker, which employs 6,000 people at Sunderland and supports another 24,000 jobs in the supply chain, has previously warned that a no-deal Brexit would threaten its entire European business model. Gupta told the BBC: You know we are the number one carmaker in the UK and we want to continue. We are committed. Having said that, if we are not getting the current tariffs, it\u2019s not our intention but the business will not be sustainable. That\u2019s what everybody has to understand. The health minister Edward Argar is fielding questions on behalf of the government this morning. On BBC Breakfast, he was quizzed about the government\u2019s use of statistics. He said he didn\u2019t have a figure for the number of people being tested every day and could not say how many people had been traced under its new test and trace programme. The government hasn\u2019t published figures on how many people have been tested for almost two weeks. It says this has been \u201ctemporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\u201d. Asked about a Channel 4 News report that found that only 37% of contacts given to the government\u2019s test-and-trace programme had been contacted last week, Argar described the figures as \u201cpartial and outdated\u201d but said he could not provide more accurate data: We\u2019re into the thousands but I\u2019m not going to give you a figure until we\u2019ve worked with the UK Statistics Authority to get a reliable and accurate methodology of giving that data out. We\u2019re working at pace with them and as soon as we can come to an agreement with them we\u2019ll be publishing that data on a weekly basis. Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the council of the British Medical Association, has criticised an official report published yesterday that confirmed that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups are dying disproportionately from Covid-19. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Nagpaul expressed concern that the report had not come up with any conclusions, recommendations or actions to urgently protect people in the most at-risk groups: It\u2019s just full of graphs and figures. It\u2019s a statistics analysis; it isn\u2019t a report or review that has come up with any actions or recommendations and therefore it hasn\u2019t taken us further. Prof John Newton, of Public Health England, told No 10\u2019s daily briefing last night that more work was needed to understand the disproportionate effect of Covid-19 on people from BAME backgrounds. He urged people not to jump to conclusions from its report. But Nagpaul said: \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury of going out and discussing how to implement this report. What we need is some clear recommendations and actions and mitigations now, which really could be taking place.\u201d It\u2019s shaping up to be another busy day. This is what\u2019s coming up later: 11am Metropolitan police commissioner Cressida Dick gives evidence at the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee. 12noon Boris Johnson faces Keir Starmer at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. Also at 12noon \u2022 Belfast\u2019s chief scientific officer and Sage member, Prof Ian Young, gives evidence to Northern Ireland Assembly\u2019s health committee. \u2022 Nurses protest outside Downing St. 12.20pm Nicola Sturgeon takes first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh. Later Priti Patel, the home secretary, sets out a statement on the 14-day quarantine for arrivals to the UK. 2.30pm Dido Harding, who is in charge of the test and trace programme in England, and Paul Deighton, the head of the domestic PPE efforts, appear before the health and social care committee. Also at 2.30pm Former chancellors Philip Hammond, George Osborne and Alastair Darling appear at Treasure committee 4pm Northern Ireland briefing. 5pm Downing St briefing. Good morning and welcome to our UK live blog on the coronavirus pandemic. Labour has sharpened its attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis this morning after Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson must \u201cget a grip\u201d or No 10 would be directly responsible for a second spike in the infection rate. In an interview with the Guardian, the Labour leader accused the prime minister of \u201cwinging it\u201d over the easing of the lockdown and making an already \u201cdifficult situation 10 times worse\u201d. Starmer also questioned whether the timing of some decisions over the relaxation of the lockdown rules had been taken \u201cto try to deflect attention away\u201d from the Dominic Cummings affair. The easing of the lockdown, he said, was \u201can exit without a strategy\u201d. The two leaders will face each other for the first time in two weeks at prime minister\u2019s questions from midday. We\u2019ll bring you live coverage.",

      "body": "<p>Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy.</p> \n<p>Speaking at the regular No 10 press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance said the advice from the Sage advisory committee was that quarantines worked best when infection rates inside a country had dropped, but also when applied to countries with high rates of coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The quarantine plan, unveiled by the home secretary in the Commons to a sometimes hostile reception from Conservative MPs, does not distinguish between countries of varying infection rates, with the only exceptions being for certain professions, such as freight drivers.</p> \n<p>Asked about the issue at the press conference, Vallance stressed the decision was ultimately one for ministers. \u201cThe Sage advice from the experts in this area is that the measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and they\u2019re most effective when they\u2019re applied to countries from higher rates,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He added: \u201cAnd the judgment of that time is, of course, not something for us, it\u2019s something for politicians to make. They make the policy, and they make the timing decisions.\u201d</p> \n<p>With a number of Tory MPs, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/theresa-may-attacks-boris-johnson-over-brexit-and-covid-quarantine-plans\">among them the former prime minister Theresa May</a>, expressing concern at the quarantine, both from the point of view of its effectiveness, and its impact on the travel and aviation sectors, Patel told the Commons the measures would be in place from 8 June and would be reviewed in three weeks.</p> \n<p>A breach of self-isolation could result in a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/how-will-the-uk-new-14-day-coronavirus-quarantine-work\">Under the quarantine plans</a>, self-isolating arrivals are permitted to leave the house to buy food and medicine for themselves or others in the household, including pets, where it is not possible to obtain the provisions in any other manner, as well as to attend funerals, court hearings and to access critical public services, such as social services.</p> \n<p>Critics have challenged the government over its decision to introduce such a stringent policy at this stage of the pandemic, particularly as there was no enforced quarantine for any arrivals in late February and early March when the virus was raging in countries such as Italy and Spain.</p> \n<p>The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called for the government to publish the scientific advice, saying there was concern the quarantine plan was a \u201cfudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Conservative former international trade secretary Liam Fox said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I simply cannot get my head around the public health mental gymnastics of this policy. If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak?\u201d</p> \n<p>Patel told MPs that Sage would publish advice in due course, while advice from within the&nbsp;Home Office&nbsp;would be provided to the home affairs select committee.</p> \n<p>May expressed her concerns earlier, during an urgent question on the aviation industry, sought by Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the transport select committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cInternational air travel is necessary for trade,\u201d the former prime minister said. \u201cWithout it there is no global Britain. So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard, to save jobs and ensure that Britain is open for business?\u201d</p> \n<p>Discontent among Conservatives has also been fuelled by being unable to answer questions from constituents about whether they might be able to go abroad this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>International air travel is necessary for trade. Without it there is no global Britain</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Theresa May</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s lots of scepticism around the quarantine plans,\u201d one Tory MP. \u201cMany MPs don\u2019t want to stop their constituents going on foreign holiday after their sacrifices during lockdown.\u201d</p> \n<p>One Conservative MP expressed frustration at the quarantine plan: \u201cMost people think it\u2019s mad: slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. It has only&nbsp;gone down&nbsp;well with the&nbsp;\u2018Blame Johnny Foreigner\u2019 brigade.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked at the press conference whether people should book holidays, Johnson only pointed to Foreign Office plans warning against such travel for now.</p> \n<p>While a number of Tories have urged the use of \u201cair bridges\u201d, mutual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/uk-air-bridges-with-holiday-destinations-impossible-warn-public-health-experts\">quarantine-free agreements with other nations</a>, Johnson urged caution: \u201cWe will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection \u2013 but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whereas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/air-bridge-linking-uk-to-portugal-may-be-agreed-by-end-of-june\">countries such as Portugal</a> and France have sent positive signals that they are open to some form of travel arrangement, others have underlined the challenges raised by approving travel to and from the UK. Denmark said on Friday it would not consider opening its border to travel to or from the UK until 31 August at the earliest.</p> \n<p>A Home Office spokesperson said:&nbsp;\u201cGiven&nbsp;the vast majority of people have already complied with pandemic measures, we expect those entering the UK will do the right thing and abide these measures \u2013 that means filling out their contact locator form before they reach the border.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIf a passenger refuses to complete the form - for example if they have not provided an address - they could be fined or forced to return home.</p> \n<p>\u201cBorder Force will undertake checks at the border, Public Health England will contact people at random to ensure they are self-isolating and anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action, including a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice or a unlimited fine.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Priti Patel faces mounting calls to publish the scientific advice behind the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK, after the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser declined to fully endorse such a blanket policy. Speaking at the regular No 10 press conference, Sir Patrick Vallance said the advice from the Sage advisory committee was that quarantines worked best when infection rates inside a country had dropped, but also when applied to countries with high rates of coronavirus. The quarantine plan, unveiled by the home secretary in the Commons to a sometimes hostile reception from Conservative MPs, does not distinguish between countries of varying infection rates, with the only exceptions being for certain professions, such as freight drivers. Asked about the issue at the press conference, Vallance stressed the decision was ultimately one for ministers. \u201cThe Sage advice from the experts in this area is that the measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and they\u2019re most effective when they\u2019re applied to countries from higher rates,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cAnd the judgment of that time is, of course, not something for us, it\u2019s something for politicians to make. They make the policy, and they make the timing decisions.\u201d With a number of Tory MPs, among them the former prime minister Theresa May, expressing concern at the quarantine, both from the point of view of its effectiveness, and its impact on the travel and aviation sectors, Patel told the Commons the measures would be in place from 8 June and would be reviewed in three weeks. A breach of self-isolation could result in a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution. Under the quarantine plans, self-isolating arrivals are permitted to leave the house to buy food and medicine for themselves or others in the household, including pets, where it is not possible to obtain the provisions in any other manner, as well as to attend funerals, court hearings and to access critical public services, such as social services. Critics have challenged the government over its decision to introduce such a stringent policy at this stage of the pandemic, particularly as there was no enforced quarantine for any arrivals in late February and early March when the virus was raging in countries such as Italy and Spain. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, called for the government to publish the scientific advice, saying there was concern the quarantine plan was a \u201cfudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time\u201d. The Conservative former international trade secretary Liam Fox said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid I simply cannot get my head around the public health mental gymnastics of this policy. If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak?\u201d Patel told MPs that Sage would publish advice in due course, while advice from within the Home Office would be provided to the home affairs select committee. May expressed her concerns earlier, during an urgent question on the aviation industry, sought by Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP who chairs the transport select committee. \u201cInternational air travel is necessary for trade,\u201d the former prime minister said. \u201cWithout it there is no global Britain. So instead of bringing in measures to close Britain off from the rest of the world, why is the government not taking a lead in developing an international aviation health screening standard, to save jobs and ensure that Britain is open for business?\u201d Discontent among Conservatives has also been fuelled by being unable to answer questions from constituents about whether they might be able to go abroad this summer. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of scepticism around the quarantine plans,\u201d one Tory MP. \u201cMany MPs don\u2019t want to stop their constituents going on foreign holiday after their sacrifices during lockdown.\u201d One Conservative MP expressed frustration at the quarantine plan: \u201cMost people think it\u2019s mad: slamming the stable door after the horse has bolted. It has only gone down well with the \u2018Blame Johnny Foreigner\u2019 brigade.\u201d Asked at the press conference whether people should book holidays, Johnson only pointed to Foreign Office plans warning against such travel for now. While a number of Tories have urged the use of \u201cair bridges\u201d, mutual quarantine-free agreements with other nations, Johnson urged caution: \u201cWe will explore the possibility of international travel corridors with countries that have low rates of infection \u2013 but only when the evidence shows that it is safe to do so.\u201d Whereas countries such as Portugal and France have sent positive signals that they are open to some form of travel arrangement, others have underlined the challenges raised by approving travel to and from the UK. Denmark said on Friday it would not consider opening its border to travel to or from the UK until 31 August at the earliest. A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cGiven the vast majority of people have already complied with pandemic measures, we expect those entering the UK will do the right thing and abide these measures \u2013 that means filling out their contact locator form before they reach the border. \u201cIf a passenger refuses to complete the form - for example if they have not provided an address - they could be fined or forced to return home. \u201cBorder Force will undertake checks at the border, Public Health England will contact people at random to ensure they are self-isolating and anyone failing to comply may face enforcement action, including a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice or a unlimited fine.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of mostly young protesters have marched through central London in an overwhelmingly peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration that culminated in passionate crowds gathering at the heart of Westminster. They persuaded two police officers to \u201ctake the knee\u201d outside the gates of Downing Street in a mark of respect to American George Floyd and other black victims of police violence, prompting cheers from the crowd present in the late afternoon. A few minutes later two demonstrators were arrested after bottles were thrown at the same group of officers, although the confrontation was short-lived, and police mostly looked on as a vast crowd marched from Hyde Park to Parliament Square. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a lockdown-defying demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. They carried hundreds of handmade signs and called out the names of Floyd and others in the UK like Mark Duggan who had died at the hands of police, or who were victims of racial injustice such as the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. While most of the day passed peacefully, skirmishes between police and protesters broke out next to the Foreign Office around 8pm as a decision to kettle a few hundred angry stragglers went awry, with bottles thrown and a small group trying to rush the officers by goading them. Reinforcements thronged in and batons were raised, sending tensions soaring and forcing crowds into a brief stampede on to Whitehall. At 11pm, the Metropolitan police said there had been a total of four arrests at the protest. Speaking earlier, Frankie Clarence, 28, one of the organisers, said: \u201cI feel we are now in a period where voices don\u2019t need to be voiceless any more.\u201d He was one of many who highlighted the case of Belly Mujinga, the black transport worker who died of coronavirus after being spat at at a train station. The demonstrator added: \u201cThe British Transport Police said any assault to staff would be prosecuted, fined and arrested. After hearing the news of Belly Mujinga we found injustice and no action had been taken on her behalf. These guys are contradicting their words and there\u2019s thus injustice not just in the US, but the UK. It\u2019s literally everywhere in the world.\u201d Sanique Gillette, 20, from Acton, said she was there because she had a 10-year-old brother she did not want to see targeted by police when he was older, simply because he was black. \u201cIt is outrageous [Floyd\u2019s death]. It was in plain sight that someone was murdered.\u201d Others expressed disgust with Boris Johnson for not condemning the US president\u2019s actions, shouting \u201cfuck Boris, fuck Trump\u201d \u2013 and accused the prime minister of racism \u2013 while others cited the everyday racism experienced in London. Imarn Ayton, 29, said the protest was about \u201cracism, prejudice, power and the willingness to abuse that power. Right now, currently, in 2020 in England, we have that abuse going on.\u201d She added: \u201cIt happened to me the other day here at a protest. I was arrested because I hurt someone\u2019s feelings when I said the quote: \u2018Your ancestors would be proud.\u2019 I hurt a man\u2019s feelings and he used his power and abused his power.\u201d Protesters brought traffic to a standstill, but there appeared to be few complaints as many car and bus drivers honked their horns in support. Some drivers accepted signs from protesters and waved them outside their window as the protest marched past. Star Wars actor John Boyega, 28, was one of the few high-profile names present, with most public figures reluctant to be seen breaking physical distancing guidelines. The actor told fellow demonstrators he was \u201cspeaking to you from my heart\u201d. The British actor referenced two other black Americans who died in the US, as well as Lawrence\u2019s murder in London in 1993. He said: \u201cWe are a physical representation of our support for George Floyd. We are a physical representation of our support for Sandra Bland. We are a physical representation of our support for Trayvon Martin. We are a physical representation of our support for Stephen Lawrence.\u201d Margaret Bernard, 60, said she had experienced racism first-hand when the National Front marched in Lewisham in 1970 and her brother had been attacked by skinheads. \u201cMy generation thought we had changed all of that,\u201d she said. \u201cWords do not describe how I feel about what is happening in the US. I feel sickened, disgusted. I think this is the tip of the iceberg. Institutional racism has been happening for decades and every nation needs to address that.\u201d Asked what she thought of Floyd\u2019s death, 17-year-old student Nayana Brathwaite said: \u201cIt is disgusting. He put a knee on his neck. As a police officer he should know that would have killed someone.\u201d Holding a banner bearing the name of Mark Duggan, a 29-year-old British man shot and killed by the police in 2011, Dilan, 20, said: \u201cThis is also about people who are killed in the UK. It is not just the injustice in the US, it is worldwide. \u201cI do not like the way Boris Johnson has reacted. He has not been telling Trump what he is doing is wrong.

But there were no serious reactions and no heart rhythm disturbances, which is a known issue with the drug. \u201cWhile we had hope this drug would work in this context, our study demonstrates that hydroxychloroquine is no better than placebo when used as post-exposure prophylaxis within four days of exposure to someone infected with the new coronavirus,\u201d said Dr Todd Lee, an associate professor of medicine, division of infectious diseases at McGill University in Canada and one of the lead authors of the study. \u201cOur study\u2019s results set politics aside and provide unbiased evidence to guide practice in the prevention of Covid-19 and reinforce the importance of randomised clinical trials as we work together nationally and internationally to combat the novel coronavirus,\u2019\u2019 said Dr Ryan Zarychanski, an associate professor of internal medicine at the University of Manitoba, Canada. Other trials taking place will show whether there is a place for the drug in preventing infections in other settings. A very much larger trial is underway in healthcare workers, aiming to recruit 40,000 around the world, led by the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok.",

      "bodyText": "Three former chancellors have warned the government to prepare for 1980s levels of unemployment as the coronavirus crisis sinks Britain into the deepest recession in living memory. Lord Alistair Darling, George Osborne and Philip Hammond said the government urgently needed to announce measures to cushion the blow as job losses began to mount. Darling, who as Labour\u2019s last chancellor led the response from No 11 to the 2008 financial crisis, told the Commons Treasury committee: \u201cWe need to get ourselves into the frame of mind where we\u2019re thinking about 1980s levels of unemployment.\u201d Osborne, his Conservative successor, also suggested the current economic collapse could trigger mass unemployment. \u201cThere will be loads of people in businesses that have gone bust that aren\u2019t going to return, and people who are coming off furloughs into unemployment. That is going to be a big social challenge, and of course economic challenge, for this government,\u201d he said. Britain\u2019s unemployment rate peaked at almost 12% in 1984 during the period of de-industrialisation overseen by the Thatcher government. The Bank of England has warned joblessness could more than double from the current rate of 3.9% by the end of the year as Covid-19 and lockdown measures used to contain the virus bring the economy to a near standstill. The former chancellors\u2019 interventions come as the current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, prepares to scale back the government\u2019s furlough wage subsidy scheme from August. As lockdown restrictions are rolled back in an attempt to reopen the British economy, Sunak is believed to be working on a fresh package of policy measures, including job creation initiatives, expected to be announced in July. Darling said if he were still chancellor he would be getting the whole of government involved in drawing up measures to keep people in work or to help them retrain if they lost their job. \u201cGovernment needs to be planning. Let\u2019s just assume things are going to be worse \u2013 it\u2019s better that it\u2019s good and well \u2013 but don\u2019t leave it too late because it does take a long time to put these things in place,\u201d he said. Darling and Hammond warned Sunak against embarking on a fresh round of austerity to tackle rising government borrowing, saying he should pursue pro-growth policies to ensure a stronger economic recovery takes hold. Hammond said: \u201cIn the recovery phase, the next two years, where the debt as percentage of GDP is not the primary concern we should be addressing.\u201d However, Darling suggested the continuing health risks of Covid-19 meant the government was not yet ready to boost the economy fully. Osborne said the government would either need to impose cuts or raise taxes once the pandemic had passed. He said: \u201cSadly we are poorer than we thought we were, and either we\u2019re going to have to raise more in revenue or spend less than we were planning.\u201d All three former chancellors warned Boris Johnson of the mounting risks of failing to reach a trade deal with Brussels before the end of the Brexit transition at the end of this year.

Other MPs and officials who have been in close contact with him will be tested and could be asked to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>During the debate, after Sharma was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times, his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water. Sharma also appeared sweaty and sounded hoarse on Tuesday, according to one fellow MP, when he voted to abolish hybrid parliamentary measures.</p> \n<p>During one vote, the minister voted straight after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and immediately before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock.

      "bodyText": "Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has been tested for coronavirus after feeling unwell while delivering a statement in the House of Commons. The cabinet minister has gone home to self-isolate following his appearance at the dispatch box earlier on Wednesday. The parliamentary authorities are understood to have given the area a deep clean and MPs were at the time sitting at least two metres apart. \u201cThis was done as a precaution,\u201d a House of Commons source said. However, his suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government\u2019s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link. Many MPs have protested against the new arrangements, which have resulted in them queueing around the parliamentary estate while complying with the two-metre physical distancing rules in order to vote. Observers noticed that Sharma appeared unwell and to be sweating profusely while he spoke about the corporate insolvency and governance bill in the Commons. A spokeswoman for the business secretary said: \u201cAlok Sharma began feeling unwell when in the chamber delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. In line with guidance he has been tested for coronavirus and is returning home to self-isolate.\u201d If Sharma does test positive, it will be an early trial of the government\u2019s new contact tracing system. Other MPs and officials who have been in close contact with him will be tested and could be asked to self-isolate. During the debate, after Sharma was seen wiping his face with a handkerchief several times, his Labour shadow, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water. Sharma also appeared sweaty and sounded hoarse on Tuesday, according to one fellow MP, when he voted to abolish hybrid parliamentary measures. During one vote, the minister voted straight after the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and immediately before the Labour MP Stephen Kinnock. He was also one of a few ministers who attended full cabinet, a source said. In another vote on the substantive motion, Sharma queued to vote immediately after Saqib Bhatti, the Conservative MP for Meriden, and just before Paul Scully, the Tory MP for Sutton and Cheam. Kirsty Blackman, SNP deputy leader in Westminster, sent her best wishes to Sharma but said: \u201c[It] does, however, demonstrate just how ridiculous and irresponsible the Tory government\u2019s decision to end virtual participation in parliament was. They must now rectify this serious mistake and reintroduce hybrid proceedings without delay.\u201d Lisa Nandy, Labour\u2019s shadow foreign secretary, said the development was \u201cjust awful\u201d, adding: \u201cThe government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn\u2019t even begin to describe it.\u201d Digital voting in the Commons was ended on Tuesday after MPs approved a government motion introduced by the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, despite widespread objections. Senior Conservatives, opposition groups, unions and the equalities watchdog raised concerns that the move would prevent many MPs, particularly the elderly and vulnerable members who are shielding, from being able to vote. Chaotic scenes unfolded in the Commons when MPs formed a long queue snaking through parliament so they could maintain social distancing while voting on the motion. The Labour MP Karl Turner said he had asked the Health and Safety Executive to conduct an urgent risk assessment of working conditions in parliament. He said MPs having to \u201chuddle together\u201d on escalators on the parliamentary estate while lining up to vote were among a number of \u201cunsafe practices\u201d. A string of cabinet ministers and senior officials have come down with coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, including Boris Johnson, who was treated in intensive care. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, Chris Whitty, the chief medical adviser, Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, Dominic Cummings, the senior No 10 adviser, and Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, were also all unwell with coronavirus in late March or early April. The first MP to fall ill with the virus was Nadine Dorries, a health minister, who tested positive in March. A House of Commons spokesperson said: \u201cThe house\u2019s priority is to ensure that those on the estate are safe while business is facilitated. We have closely followed guidance from PHE on action to take following a suspected case of Covid on site, including additional cleaning.

In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>&nbsp;\u201cIt was always reckless of Boris Johnson to set an arbitrary date and expect schools to fall in line,\u201d he said. \u201cHeads and their staff know far more about their individual challenges than Whitehall ever will.

Figures obtained by the Guardian showed that in large parts of the north-east not a single primary school opened to more pupils on Monday, the government\u2019s target date for reopening after the 10-week lockdown. Data from 11 of the 12 biggest local authorities in the region, which has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, showed just 12% of their 856 primary schools admitted additional pupils on Monday. Across England, a National Education Union poll of members suggested, more than two in five schools (44%) decided against admitting more pupils on Monday, contrary to government expectations. In the north-west, the proportion of schools opening to more pupils was even lower, at just 8%, according to a survey by the country\u2019s biggest education union.

The north-east has the highest per-capita infection rate of any region in England, and is thought to be particularly vulnerable given its relatively high proportion of people with secondary illnesses linked to heavy industry, such as mining and shipbuilding. Of the 10 worst-affected local authorities in England, the top four are all in the north-east: Sunderland, Gateshead, South Tyneside and Middlesbrough. Data released by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday showed that the north-east had suffered 41% more deaths during the week ending 22 May than its five-year weekly average, a far higher figure than other places such as Wales (13%) and London (24%). In County Durham, Gateshead and Hartlepool, not a single primary school out of 309 reopened to more pupils, reflecting continuing concern among headteachers about the safety of opening up to more pupils. In Newcastle, officials said only two of its 73 primary schools might be able to admit more pupils before next week. The opening figures for primary schools in England emerged as the Welsh government said schools there would reopen at the end of June, almost a month after the planned phased return began in England. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, said schools would reopen on 29 June and the summer term would be extended by a week to 27 July, with plans for an additional week off at half term in the next academic year. Further education colleges would reopen from 15 June for face-to-face learning, especially for vulnerable students and those working towards a licence to practice assessments, she said.

Top stories Additional charges have announced against the four former police officers involved in the killing of George Floyd. Minnesota\u2019s attorney general has upgraded the charge against Derek Chauvin to second-degree murder and charged the three other officers who took part in Floyd\u2019s arrest. In North Carolina, a leading police chief has called for \u201csweeping reforms\u201d to policing in the US, including a ban on chokeholds. George Floyd\u2019s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, and her mother have spoken publicly for the first time. Elsewhere, the secretary of defence, Mark Espers, has categorically opposed President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, that would allow military troops to be deployed inside US cities in response to protests. Flawed data underpinned the decisions of the World Health Organization and several national governments to alter their Covid-19 policies, a Guardian investigation has revealed. A little-known US healthcare analytics company \u2013 whose handful of staff included a science fiction writer and an adult-content model \u2013 provided research for several of the world\u2019s most prestigious medical journals, including the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine. The Guardian\u2019s investigation found that the company, Surgisphere, had hired staff with \u201clittle or no scientific background\u201d and its chief executive has been named in three malpractice suits. Elsewhere, the chief architect of Sweden\u2019s Covid-19 strategy has conceded that there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement\u201d, agreeing that too many people had died through the Scandinavian country\u2019s light-touch approach. Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita has been the highest in the world over the seven days to 2 June. The oil and gas giant Chevron could be facing penalties worth $100m after the Western Australian government ruled that the company had failed so far in its carbon dioxide emission targets at its Gorgon gas field project in the Pilbara.

But epidemiologists suggest an Australian winter is unlikely to drive the same level of increases seen across Europe or the US. The Morrison government will fund grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m. The new tranche of economic stimulus designed to create a pipeline of work for the construction sector will be unveiled today. An investigation into a NSW police officer who slammed a teenager into the pavement during Mardi Gras in 2013 took three years, Guardian Australia has learned. Leon Mixios employed a leg sweep to forcibly bring the then 18-year-old to the ground, in an act an internal review eventually found constituted \u201cunreasonable use of force\u201d. Mixios was dismissed from his job. Not a single person has been charged under NSW\u2019s race hate laws two years after their introduction. The law changes came after lobbying from an alliance of 31 community groups but the shadow attorney general says a failure to prosecute anyone suggests the government was \u201csimply disinterested in combating racism\u201d. Repeated forestry conservation breaches in Victoria could spark a fundamental review of industry-wide exemptions, with a landmark court judgment opening the possibility that state forestry operations could fall under federal jurisdiction for the first time in two decades. The world Police have identified a German national as the new prime suspect in the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, who disappeared 13 years ago in Portugal. The 43-year-old is in prison for unrelated charges but significant information that emerged in 2017 strongly links him to the case. Vladimir Putin has ordered a state of emergency after 20,000 tonnes of diesel fuel spilled into a river inside the Arctic Circle. The Russian president berated the head of a power plant responsible for the fuel leak on live television. The head of a Brazilian foundation tasked with promoting black culture has been caught on tape calling activists from the country\u2019s black movement \u201cscum\u201d. The appointment of S\u00e9rgio Camargo, a close ally of President Jair Bolsonaro, to the role sparked outrage in 2019. Scientists have revealed the largest and oldest structure built by the Mayans \u2013 a massive rectangular elevated platform from about 1000 BC exceeding the volume of Egypt\u2019s Great Pyramid of Giza.

      "body": "<p>Unrest has swept across the United States since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in custody of Minneapolis police. Since then, protests have swelled in dozens of towns and cities across the country.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Tens of thousands of people have been standing shoulder to shoulder as they protest against the killing of George Floyd, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes despite his cries that he could not breathe.</p> \n<p>But the public health emergency that engulfed the nation \u2013 Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 - has not disappeared. Here are this week\u2019s main developments on Covid-19, as American wrestles with civil unrest.</p> \n<h2><strong>Where are cases of coronavirus increasing?</strong></h2> \n<p>More cases are being detected in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage#states\">number of southern states</a>, including Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. But cases are not increasing <em>only</em> in southern states. Alaska, Montana and California have also seen cases increase. In total, 17 states are seeing increases.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago. The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period, and people may not get tested until they feel ill.&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Where are cases of coronavirus decreasing?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>Broadly speaking, the states which had the worst outbreaks this spring and the most severe stay-at-home orders are bending the curve downward. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington DC and seven other states are all seeing reductions in cases.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Mass protests began in Minnesota last week over the killing of Floyd on 25 May, but it may take weeks for increases in case to show up in testing data, because of the virus\u2019s long incubation period. It is also unclear <a href=\"https://health.ebsco.com/blog/article/covid-19-ten-things-you-need-to-know\">whether temperature</a> could play a role in limiting the spread of this disease now that summer is approaching.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bc6cc0e7-dfa4-4552-bba5-4c7247ed87f0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GbsJFgRupWo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>When will we get a vaccine?&nbsp;</strong></h2> \n<p>First, there is still no guarantee we will get a vaccine.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s never a guarantee, ever, that you\u2019re going to get an effective vaccine,\u201d said Dr Anthony Fauci, the United State\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci made the comments Tuesday, in a podcast of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-3ICY-N4\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Even if there is a vaccine, Fauci said, questions remain about how long it would provide immunity. That said, scientists are bullish on the prospects of finding an effective vaccine.</p> \n<p>More results are expected in the late fall from a promising candidate being developed by the American biotech company Moderna, and manufacturing capacity is already being ramped up.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Producers will begin making doses of the vaccine before clinical trials are ready. That way, up to 100m doses could be ready within weeks of vaccine approval, not months.&nbsp;More data is expected on Moderna\u2019s vaccine in the late fall.</p> \n<p>If a vaccine is proven safe and effective during that time frame, it would shatter the world record for fastest vaccine development. Currently, the fastest vaccine to ever be developed was for mumps, a disease which causes swelling of the glands and in rare cases more severe complications for adults.&nbsp;That took four years.</p> \n<h2><strong>Have scientists found new treatments?</strong></h2> \n<p>There is still no drug proven to shorten the duration or severity of symptoms of Covid-19, although studies are underway for a variety of potential treatments.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the United States, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">antiviral medication called remdesivir</a> has shown promise early results, and the NIAID is continuing to study the drug for effectiveness. Gilead, which owns the drug\u2019s patent, has released thousands of doses to US hospitals for doctors to treat patients under emergency provisions.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>After being promoted by Donald Trump, one of the most talked about drugs to treat Covid-19 is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/28/questions-raised-over-hydroxychloroquine-study-which-caused-who-to-halt-trials-for-covid-19\">hydroxychloroquine</a>.

      "bodyText": "Unrest has swept across the United States since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in custody of Minneapolis police. Since then, protests have swelled in dozens of towns and cities across the country. Tens of thousands of people have been standing shoulder to shoulder as they protest against the killing of George Floyd, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes despite his cries that he could not breathe. But the public health emergency that engulfed the nation \u2013 Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 - has not disappeared. Here are this week\u2019s main developments on Covid-19, as American wrestles with civil unrest. Where are cases of coronavirus increasing? More cases are being detected in a number of southern states, including Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. But cases are not increasing only in southern states. Alaska, Montana and California have also seen cases increase. In total, 17 states are seeing increases. These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago. The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period, and people may not get tested until they feel ill. Where are cases of coronavirus decreasing? Broadly speaking, the states which had the worst outbreaks this spring and the most severe stay-at-home orders are bending the curve downward. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, Washington DC and seven other states are all seeing reductions in cases. Mass protests began in Minnesota last week over the killing of Floyd on 25 May, but it may take weeks for increases in case to show up in testing data, because of the virus\u2019s long incubation period. It is also unclear whether temperature could play a role in limiting the spread of this disease now that summer is approaching. When will we get a vaccine? First, there is still no guarantee we will get a vaccine. \u201cThere\u2019s never a guarantee, ever, that you\u2019re going to get an effective vaccine,\u201d said Dr Anthony Fauci, the United State\u2019s leading expert on infectious diseases, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease. Fauci made the comments Tuesday, in a podcast of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Even if there is a vaccine, Fauci said, questions remain about how long it would provide immunity. That said, scientists are bullish on the prospects of finding an effective vaccine. More results are expected in the late fall from a promising candidate being developed by the American biotech company Moderna, and manufacturing capacity is already being ramped up. Producers will begin making doses of the vaccine before clinical trials are ready. That way, up to 100m doses could be ready within weeks of vaccine approval, not months. More data is expected on Moderna\u2019s vaccine in the late fall. If a vaccine is proven safe and effective during that time frame, it would shatter the world record for fastest vaccine development. Currently, the fastest vaccine to ever be developed was for mumps, a disease which causes swelling of the glands and in rare cases more severe complications for adults. That took four years. Have scientists found new treatments? There is still no drug proven to shorten the duration or severity of symptoms of Covid-19, although studies are underway for a variety of potential treatments. In the United States, the antiviral medication called remdesivir has shown promise early results, and the NIAID is continuing to study the drug for effectiveness. Gilead, which owns the drug\u2019s patent, has released thousands of doses to US hospitals for doctors to treat patients under emergency provisions. After being promoted by Donald Trump, one of the most talked about drugs to treat Covid-19 is hydroxychloroquine. Early lab studies indicated the drug might be effective against coronavirus, but drugs can act very differently in the complex environment of the human body. There is still no proof hydroxychloroquine is effective in treatment of Covid-19, and several studies have had negative results. Discussion of the drug is likely to continue. A large study of more than 96,000 people, which resulted in the World Health Organization stopping its hydroxychloroquine trials, has come under scrutiny from scientists around the world. Scientists are demanding the source of the data from the study, which a Guardian investigation revealed came from a tiny, little-known American company. When will life go back to \u2018normal\u2019? \u201cNormal\u201d depends on many, many things. Much of what life looks like right now depends on where you live, and many things will be changed for a long time ahead. As cases decrease in New York City, the US metropolis worst affected by the outbreak is tiptoeing toward the first stage of reopening on 8 June. For example, the New York governor just announced children\u2019s day camps can reopen on 29 June. But large gatherings at events such as baseball games or concerts still appear to be a long way off. Ahead of the US election in November, the Republican National Committee has announced it will relocate its convention from North Carolina, after the Democratic governor there said he could not guarantee that thousands of people could meet in the convention center in August as planned.",

      "body": "<p>Soaring unemployment is expected to push more than a million more Britons into poverty by Christmas and is already driving up homelessness, charities are warning.&nbsp;</p> <p>Around 200,000 children are among those facing a new life below the pre-coronavirus poverty line unless ministers reform benefits, according to analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank published on Wednesday.</p> <p>It has examined a <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/monetary-policy-report/2020/may/monetary-policy-report-may-2020.pdf\">Bank of England economic scenario </a>that predicted that as a result of the lockdown measures unemployment could rise by 2 million to 3.3 million people \u2013 almost 10% of the workforce \u2013 by the end of 2020.</p> <p>IPPR found working families paying relatively high rents as a proportion of their income will be hit hardest by having to rely on universal credit.

      "bodyText": "Soaring unemployment is expected to push more than a million more Britons into poverty by Christmas and is already driving up homelessness, charities are warning. Around 200,000 children are among those facing a new life below the pre-coronavirus poverty line unless ministers reform benefits, according to analysis by the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank published on Wednesday. It has examined a Bank of England economic scenario that predicted that as a result of the lockdown measures unemployment could rise by 2 million to 3.3 million people \u2013 almost 10% of the workforce \u2013 by the end of 2020. IPPR found working families paying relatively high rents as a proportion of their income will be hit hardest by having to rely on universal credit. The analysis found that increasing child benefit by \u00a35 a week, removing the two-child limit on universal credit and lifting the benefit cap could prevent the rise in child poverty. The thinktank defines poverty as having less than 60% of the expected median income after housing costs that Britons would have if the pandemic had not occurred. This is equivalent to \u00a3386 per week for a household with two children under 14. In April, after lockdown, the number of people claiming universal credit surged 69% within a month to 2.1 million people. \u201cHundreds of thousands of families and their children who may have been \u2018just about managing\u2019 before Covid now face being plunged into poverty,\u201d said Claire McNeil, associate director of IPPR. \u201cThe government must apply the same level of ambition it had for supporting businesses and workers in the early stages of this crisis, to prevent a new generation of children and their families falling into poverty through no fault of their own.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions said it had already injected \u00a36.5bn into the welfare system, including increasing universal credit and working tax credit by up to \u00a31,040 a year. \u201cWe\u2019ve also rolled out income protection schemes, mortgage holidays and additional support for renters,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThis builds on action already taken to support low paid families such as raising the living wage, uplifting benefits by inflation and increasing work incentives.\u201d Scores of charities have also reported a rise in homelessness since the pandemic, driven mostly by workers being laid off as businesses, particularly in low-wage sectors such as retail and hospitality, were closed for lockdown in late March. The homelessness charity Crisis surveyed 150 frontline organisations and found the mounting pressure of being without a safe home had also taken its toll with significant rises in people seeking help for basic needs such as food, finances and feelings of loneliness and isolation. This is despite a so-far broadly successful government initiative to help about 15,000 rough sleepers off the streets of English towns and cities and into hotels during the pandemic. The government has announced plans to make 3,300 new homes available to rough sleepers in the next 12 months at a cost of \u00a3160m.

Since mass protests erupted in Hong Kong a year ago \u2013 sparked by a bill which would allow for extradition to China \u2013 Beijing has made increasing encroachments on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, including declarations by its offices in Hong Kong that Basic Law provisions did not apply to them. Martin Lee, a barrister, former legislator and co-drafter of the Basic Law, said the offers by foreign governments to help Hongkongers were \u201cgenerous\u201d but not enough. He said Beijing had clearly breached its treaty obligations, which it had made great efforts in 1997 to have supported by the international community and registered in the UN, precisely to ensure Hong Kong\u2019s elite residents and businesses did not flee. \u201cI want the international community to put their heads together and come up with a multinational sustainable solution for Hong Kong,\u201d he said. Lee Cheuk-yan, a veteran activist who alongside Martin Lee was arrested in a widely condemned crackdown by Hong Kong authorities earlier this year, said Hong Kong people \u201cdon\u2019t just want an exit\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s a shame in a way that they only offer us an exit, and do not offer to stand by us in our fight for Hong Kong,\u201d he said. With the Australian government\u2019s relationship with China already under strain over early calls for a coronavirus inquiry, the Coalition has appeared to tread carefully on the Hong Kong developments, issuing statements of concern jointly with likeminded countries including the US, the UK and Canada, rather than speaking out on its own. But Australian politicians say there is precedent for the government to respond with special programs in times of particular need.",

The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong>Australia\u2019s economy is in recession. </strong>Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic.

Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019.

Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths.</li> <li><strong>French anti-racism protesters defied a coronavirus gathering ban. </strong>Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence. <br></li> <li><strong>China\u2019s service sector is bouncing back. </strong>China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. </li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war.</li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period </strong>since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March.</li> <li><strong>Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, </strong>its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state.</li> <li><strong> </strong><strong>The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics</strong>.

According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,340,811 people are known to have been infected, while 378,359 are known to have died since the outbreak began.<br></li> <li><strong>Brazil deaths pass 30,000. </strong>A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths.</li> <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/yemen-faces-macabre-tragedy-as-aid-funding-falls-short-by-1bn\">Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn</a>. </strong>Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/saudi-arabia-to-co-host-un-fundraising-summit-for-yemen\">a humanitarian fundraising summit</a> raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. </li> <li><strong>Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine.</strong> A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year.</li> <li><strong>France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days.</strong> It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures.</li> <li><strong>Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began</strong>, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below: At least three people were reported dead as coronavirus-hit Mumbai appeared to escape the worst of Cyclone Nisarga Wednesday, the first severe storm to threaten India\u2019s financial capital in more than 70 years, AFP reports. The city and its surrounds are usually sheltered from cyclones - the last deadly storm to hit the city was in 1948. Authorities had evacuated at least 100,000 people, including coronavirus patients, from flood-prone areas in the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat ahead of Nisarga\u2019s arrival. In Mumbai, police announced fresh coronavirus restrictions on the city of 18 million people - which was just beginning to emerge from a months-long lockdown - banning gatherings of four people or more until Thursday afternoon. Mumbai is India\u2019s worst-hit city, home to a fifth of the country\u2019s more than 200,000 coronavirus cases. The storm evacuees included nearly 150 coronavirus patients from a recently built field hospital in Mumbai, underscoring the difficulties facing the city ahead of the monsoon season as it struggles to contain the pandemic. \u201cRefrain from venturing out to coast-beaches, promenade, parks and other similar places along the coastline,\u201d the police tweeted early Wednesday. Key coronavirus questions as tens of thousands gather at protests across US Unrest has swept across the United States since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed in custody of Minneapolis police. Since then, protests have swelled in dozens of towns and cities across the country. Tens of thousands of people have been standing shoulder to shoulder as they protest against the killing of George Floyd, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes despite his cries that he could not breathe. But the public health emergency that engulfed the nation \u2013 Sars-Cov-2, the virus which causes Covid-19 - has not disappeared. Where are cases of coronavirus increasing? More cases are being detected in a number of southern states, including Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. But cases are not increasing only in southern states. Alaska, Montana and California have also seen cases increase. In total, 17 states are seeing increases. These increases reflect infections that may have taken place weeks ago. The novel coronavirus has a long incubation period, and people may not get tested until they feel ill. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest updates in the coronavirus pandemic for the next while. As always, we\u2019d love to hear from you \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. The British prime minister Boris Johnson will host a global vaccine summit on Thursday, urging nations to pledge funding for vaccinations against infectious diseases to help the poorest countries tackle the pandemic. Representatives of more than 50 countries, including 35 heads of state or government, will come together virtually in London to raise funds for the GAVI vaccine alliance, a public-private global health partnership. The summit aims to raise at least $7.4bn (\u00a36bn) for GAVI to immunise a further 300 million children in the world\u2019s poorest countries by 2025 against diseases such as polio, diphtheria and measles. Johnson said: Just as the UK is the single biggest donor to the international effort to find a coronavirus vaccine, we will remain the world\u2019s leading donor to GAVI, contributing \u00a31.65bn over the next five years. I urge you to join us to fortify this lifesaving alliance and inaugurate a new era of global health cooperation, which I believe is now the most essential shared endeavour of our lifetimes. A \u20ac130bn (\u00a3116bn) post-lockdown stimulus package has been agreed by the coalition partners running the country, the chancellor Angela Merkel has said. Merkel said her conservatives and their Social Democrat coalition partners agreed measures designed to speed up Germany\u2019s economic recovery after resolving differences on incentives to buy new cars and relief for highly indebted municipalities. The agreement paved the way for a fiscal programme that is substantially bigger than similar packages by Germany\u2019s Eurozone partners. A China-EU summit planned for September in Leipzig has been postponed because of the pandemic, the German government has said. The decision was made after the chancellor Angela Merkel held separate phone calls with the Chinese president Xi Jinping and the European Council president Charles Michel, the German government\u2019s spokesman Steffen Seibert said. They agreed that the meeting cannot take place at the envisaged time given the pandemic but should be rescheduled. The details should be agreed soon. A similar summit that was due to take place at the end of March in China was also postponed. Merkel had hoped to used Germany\u2019s six-month presidency of the EU from 1 July to strengthen the bloc\u2019s ties with China. But the fight against the virus and its social and economic impact as well as environmental issues will now be the focal point of her efforts, she has said. The EU had wanted to use the summits to push China to deliver on its promise in April last year to give European companies equal treatment and put an end to a practice of forcing foreign firms to share know-how when operating in China. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of official cases of coronavirus passed 6.4m, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 6,435,453 people are known to have been infected, while at least 382,093 are confirmed to have died since the outbreak began. Spain\u2019s congress voted to approve a sixth and final two-week extension of the country\u2019s state of emergency. It has been in effect since 14 March and Wednesday\u2019s vote means that the exceptional measures that have underpinned one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns will now remain in force until 21 June. The UK\u2019s business secretary Alok Sharma went into self-isolation after beginning to feel unwell in the House of Commons chamber. He was delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. The official Brazilian death toll passed 30,000 after a record record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths were recorded in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199. But the president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to downplay the pandemic, even as Brazil\u2019s health ministry says the number of cases has risen to 555,383. The World Health Organization said it has received reports of 100,000 new cases every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it has resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing studies that apparently showed it was dangerous. Pakistan recorded its largest single day increase in infections, as a fourth politician died after testing positive for the virus. Mian Jamshed Kakakhel, who was a member of a provincial assembly in the north-west, died on Wednesday. Yesterday two other lawmakers died after testing positive. The number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Sweden surpassed that of France. With 450 deaths per 1 million people, Sweden now has the seventh-worst death rate in the world, according to tallies kept on the Worldometers website. Entry checks at land borders to Austria introduced because of the pandemic will be scrapped from Thursday, except for those at the border with Italy, Austria\u2019s foreign minister announced. The controls on the Italian border will be evaluated again next week, Alexander Schallenberg told a press conference. The UK government was criticised for failing to release test and trace data. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the programme\u2019s chief, Dido Harding: \u201cI hope you understand that our frustration is that it is very hard to scrutinise what the government is doing if we\u2019re not given the data that allows us to do that.\u201d Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to the UK while it maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government will scrap general travel warnings for 30 countries, including the UK, from 15 June. Sharma, a cabinet minister, appeared at the dispatch box earlier, Rowena Mason and Rajeev Syal write. The parliamentary authorities are understood to have given the area a deep clean and MPs were at the time sitting at least 2 metres apart. \u201cThis was done as a precaution,\u201d a House of Commons source said. However, Sharma\u2019s suspected illness is likely to cause concern about the government\u2019s decision to bring back parliament in its physical form, after weeks of allowing MPs to attend remotely via video link. Many MPs have protested against the new arrangements, which have seen them queuing around the parliamentary estate while complying with the 2-metre physical distancing rules in order to vote. Observers noticed that Sharma appeared unwell and to be sweating profusely while he spoke about the corporate insolvency and governance bill in the Commons. The UK\u2019s business secretary Alok Sharma has been tested and is returning home to self-isolate after beginning to feel unwell in the House of Commons chamber, his spokeswoman has said. Secretary of state Alok Sharma began feeling unwell when in the chamber delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill. In line with guidance he has been tested for coronavirus and is returning home to self-isolate. Restrictions may have to be reimposed in Iran if the country is hit by a second wave of infections, its president has warned, as local authorities say transmissions are creeping back towards the previous peak. Lockdown measures have been gradually lifted since April but have been reimposed in some areas after localised outbreaks. The health ministry, cited by state media, has reported 3,134 new infections in the past twenty four hours, the most since 30 March, bringing the total to 160,696. And 70 more deaths brought the toll to 8,012. The president Hassan Rouhani said: If in any part of the country these warnings aren\u2019t taken seriously and God forbid the outbreak of illness peaks again, the authorities will have to reimpose restrictions. This issue will create problems for the ordinary life of citizens and will also bring serious economic damage to the society. The crisis is an opportunity for \u201ca new beginning\u201d, Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has said, as he outlines plans for the country\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cThe acute phase of the health emergency is behind us but now we have to deal with the economic emergency,\u201d Conte said, adding that Italy had earmarked \u20ac80bn (\u00a371.4bn) worth of measures to help companies and workers affected by the lockdown. Conte admitted that there have been \u201cdelays\u201d in people receiving social benefits, due to the \u201cstate apparatus\u201d not being prepared. \u201cBut we will improve,\u201d he promised. The aims of Italy\u2019s \u201crecovery plan\u201d over the next few months include investing in infrastructure, relaunching public and private investments, ensuring broadband availability across the country and encouraging electronic payments to tackle the shadow economy. Conte said the justice and taxation systems also needed to be reformed. Restrictions on inter-regional travel were lifted on Wednesday and borders opened up to European travellers as Italy tries to revive tourism, a sector crucial to its national economy. The further easing of restrictions coincides with the sustained fall in deaths and infections since 4 May, when construction and manufacturing activity across the country resumed. Italy registered 71 news deaths on Wednesday, up from 55 on Tuesday, and 321 new infections, compared to 318 on Tuesday. However, Conte warned citizens to maintain physical distancing and wear face masks. The numbers are encouraging and we deserve to smile after months of sacrifice \u2026 but the virus has not disappeared. Spain\u2019s congress has voted to approve a sixth and final two-week extension of the country\u2019s state of emergency, which has been in effect since 14 March, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. Wednesday\u2019s vote means that the exceptional measures that have underpinned one of Europe\u2019s strictest Covid-19 lockdowns will now remain in force until 21 June. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said that the last extension was needed to preserve the gains made against the virus over the past three months, but added that the country\u2019s gradual loosening of lockdown restrictions was going well. \u201cWe will keep on asking for prudence, prudence and prudence,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez. \u201cWe will remain alert until the risk disappears. And, after that, we will keep working to learn for the new pandemics that we have a duty to prevent.\u201d The extension was approved despite fierce opposition from the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox, both of which accuse the government of unnecessarily curtailing people\u2019s freedoms. To date, Spain has reported 27,128 deaths from the virus and 240,326 confirmed infections. The USA has recorded 1,045 more deaths and 24,955 new cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said, taking the totals to 106,202 deaths and 1,827,425 cases. France\u2019s death toll, the world\u2019s fifth-worst, has increased by 81, or 0.3%, to reach 29,021, the health ministry has said. That represents a decelerated increase compared to Tuesday, when fatalities were up by 0.4%. The number of people hospitalised has continued its long-running decline. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of official cases of coronavirus passed 6.4m, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 6,435,453 people are known to have been infected, while at least 382,093 are confirmed to have died since the outbreak began. The official Brazilian death toll passed 30,000 after a record record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths were recorded in a 24-hour period, taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199. But the president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to downplay the pandemic, even as Brazil\u2019s health ministry says the number of cases has risen to 555,383. The World Health Organization said it has received reports of 100,000 new cases every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world. The WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also said it has resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing studies that apparently showed it was dangerous. Pakistan recorded its largest single day increase in infections, as a fourth politician died after testing positive for the virus. Mian Jamshed Kakakhel, who was a member of a provincial assembly in the north-west, died on Wednesday. Yesterday two other lawmakers died after testing positive. The number of Covid-19 deaths per capita in Sweden surpassed that of France. With 450 deaths per 1 million people, Sweden now has the seventh-worst death rate in the world, according to tallies kept on the Worldometers website. Entry checks at land borders to Austria introduced because of the pandemic will be scrapped from Thursday, except for those at the border with Italy, Austria\u2019s foreign minister announced. The controls on the Italian border will be evaluated again next week, Alexander Schallenberg told a press conference. The UK government was criticised for failing to release test and trace data. The former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, told the programme\u2019s chief, Dido Harding: \u201cI hope you understand that our frustration is that it is very hard to scrutinise what the government is doing if we\u2019re not given the data that allows us to do that.\u201d Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to the UK while it maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government will scrap general travel warnings for 30 countries, including the UK, from 15 June. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Health officials in Portugal have insisted that increases in confirmed coronavirus cases in the Lisbon region are due to more tests being carried out in areas identified as hotspots, rather than signs of a second wave of outbreak. The health ministry on Wednesday announced 366 new cases nationally, the biggest daily increase in almost four weeks. Officials said 335 of those new cases were in the Lisbon metropolitan area, while the outbreak is waning in the rest of the country. The Lisbon total was almost double the number detected in the region the previous day. The secretary of state for health, Antonio Sales, said the governments strategy is to encircle the hotspots, which are in low-income neighbourhoods around the capital, and run more tests there. Construction workers and temporary staff working in the service sector are being especially targeted for testing. The increase comes after Portugal eased restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus, leading to crowded beaches last week. The UK death rate from the coronavirus outbreak overtook that of Spain on Wednesday, according to data collated by the Worldometers website, after the British health department reported 359 more deaths from Covid-19. According to the Worldometers site, which is one of several online services tracking coronavirus statistics, the UK now has 585 coronavirus deaths per million people, compared to 580 for Spain. Spain had reported no new deaths from the virus by 5.30pm GMT on Wednesday. The UK\u2019s health department on Wednesday reported that the UK death toll from coronavirus had increased to 39,728. The total number of confirmed cases was 279,856, an increase of 1,871 on the day before. Unlike most other countries, UK health authorities do not publish recovery rates. A censorship row has broken out in the UK after third-party submissions were left out of a government-commissioned report on the disproportionate effects of Covid-19 on black, Asian and minority ethnic people, Haroon Siddique and Denis Campbell report. Public Health England said it had engaged with more than 1,000 people during its inquiry. But the report, which has been criticised for failing to investigate the reasons for the disparities or make recommendations on how to address them, did not mention the consultations. Anger has been compounded by a report in the Health Service Journal claiming that before publication the government removed a section detailing responses from third parties, many of whom highlighted structural racism. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), which called in its written submission for \u201cspecific measures \u2026 to tackle the culture of discrimination and racism [within the NHS]\u201d, said it had contacted PHE to ask why its evidence was not included. Its secretary general, Harun Khan, said: To choose to not discuss the overwhelming role structural racism and inequality has on mortality rates and to disregard the evidence compiled by community organisations, whilst simultaneously providing no recommendations or an action plan, despite this being the central purpose of the review, is entirely unacceptable. It beggars belief that a review asking why BAME communities are more at risk fails to give even a single answer. The MCB is seeking further clarification from PHE as to why the report removed the submission from the MCB and others. It is imperative that the full uncensored report is published with actionable policies and recommendations as suggested by community stakeholders, and a full Covid race equality strategy is introduced.

Sweden\u2019s government has been ready to introduce further measures to try to halt the spread of the coronavirus, had they been recommended by public health officials, the health minister said on Wednesday. \u201cThe government has been, at all times, prepared to introduce further measures recommended by the expert authority,\u201d Lena Hallengren said in written comment to Reuters. Earlier, the public health agency\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said that with hindsight, Sweden should have done more to halt the outbreak, which has claimed a higher proportion of lives in Sweden than in neighbouring countries. Sweden\u2019s death rate from the outbreak passed that of France on Wednesday. Experts have voiced fears that Latin America\u2019s two largest economies are reopening their economies too fast as a record number of Covid-19 deaths leave Brazil poised to overtake Italy as the country with the world\u2019s third-highest number of fatalities, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s correspondent for the region. The South American country recorded 1,262 deaths on Tuesday \u2013 a new daily record \u2013 taking its official toll to 31,199, not far short of the 33,530 deaths recorded in Italy. Brazil has recorded more than 555,000 infections \u2013 second only to the US. Mexico, meanwhile, has confirmed the deaths of 10,637 people and nearly 100,000 cases although officials admit the true numbers are likely to be considerably higher. Despite those grim statistics both countries this week began a gradual reopening, as did parts of other countries in the region including Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela. In Rio, where nearly 4,000 people have died, restrictions on the use of beaches and commerce were partially relaxed and surfers returned to the Atlantic waves off Ipanema. The level of traffic appeared to be returning to normal and car showrooms and estate agents were allowed to reopen. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, continued to play down the crisis on Tuesday, telling supporters: \u201cI regret every death but that\u2019s everyone\u2019s destiny.\u201d In Mexico, the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, resumed his travels, kicking off a six-state tour as the nationwide physical distancing rule was relaxed. When cats get the coronavirus they show cold-like symptoms including a runny nose, fever and cough, Russia\u2019s federal veterinary service has reported. In a statement carried by the Tass news agency, the service said: According to the information published on the website of the World Organization for Animal Health [OIE], cats (both domestic and wild cats) and minks often exhibit clinical symptoms of an acute respiratory infection. Namely, the animals exhibit such symptoms as high fever, cough, sneezing, discharge from nose and eyes. Some cats exhibited symptoms of an acute intestinal infection, such as vomiting and diarrhoea, the agency said. Dogs do not seem to show any symptoms, it added. The statement came after Nikolay Vlasov, deputy head of the federal veterinary service, submitted a report to the OIE on a coronavirus infection in a cat in Moscow late last month. The World Health Organization has received reports of 100,000 new cases of coronavirus every day for the past five days, as the outbreak gathers pace in various regions around the world, its director general has said. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also said that the WHO had resumed trials of hydroxychloroquine, an arthritis drug that had been used to treat Covid-19 patients, after reviewing data in studies that had apparently shown it was dangerous. Opening the WHO\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing, Tedros said: More than 100,000 cases of Covid-19 have been reported to WHO for each of the past five days. The Americas continues to account for the most cases. For several weeks, the number of cases reported each day in the Americas has been more than the rest of the world put together. We are especially worried about Central and South America, where many countries are witnessing accelerating epidemics. We also see increasing numbers of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. Meanwhile, the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe continues to decline. Yesterday saw the fewest cases reported in Europe since 22 March. On hydroxychloroquine, Tedros said: As you know, last week the Executive Group of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial, because of concerns raised about the safety of the drug. This decision was taken as a precaution while the safety data were reviewed. The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee of the Solidarity Trial has been reviewing the data. On the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol. The Executive Group received this recommendation and endorsed continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine The World Health Organization\u2019s coronavirus briefing has just begun. You can watch it in the player at the top of the blog. The organisation\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is beginning with an update on the renewed Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, has knighted a group of citizens and frontline health workers \u201cfor their services to the community during the coronavirus emergency.\u201d. New knights include Annalisa Malara, the 38-year-old anaesthetist at Codogno hospital in the northern Lombardy region, who first treated Italy\u2019s \u201cpatient one\u201d; Maurizio Cecconi, a professor of anaesthesiology and intensive care at Milan\u2019s Humanitas University; the team of researchers at Rome\u2019s Spallanzani hospital who carried out studies on the virus and Elena Paglierini, the Italian nurse pictured in viral photo that showed her asleep on her desk after a long shift in a Covid-19 ward in Cremona. They were all named knights of merit of the Italian republic. Greece has been forced to confront the risks of restarting international tourism after authorities announced that 12 out of 91 passengers aboard a Qatar Airlines flight to Athens had tested positive for coronavirus, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. The country\u2019s civil protection ministry, rushing to enforce emergency health protocols, responded by suspending air links to and from the Arab state until 15 June. All 91 travellers were immediately placed in quarantine. \u201cWe knew there would be such cases. We\u2019ve seen what can happen this summer,\u201d said infectious diseases expert Nikolaos Sypsas. The incident highlighted the degree to which opening up to tourism was a calculated risk, he told ANT1 TV. \u201cThe safest [thing] would be not to open up to tourism but that would mean huge economic destruction,\u201d added professor Sypsas who sits on the specialist committee advising the Greek government on management of the pandemic. \u201cThe first thing we have to do is divide countries of origin into safe and unsafe [categories]. That creates certain diplomatic pressure but for us the first priority is public health.\u201d The passengers who tested positive will have to self-isolate in a government-designated hotel for 14 days. At least two were reported to be members of Australia\u2019s large ethnic Greek community, which traditionally returns to Greece during the summer months. Donald Trump, the US president, said he will seek a new state to host this summer\u2019s Republican national convention after North Carolina refused to guarantee the event could be held in Charlotte without size restrictions because of ongoing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. The president has lobbied for a full-scale convention without face coverings, despite the threat of the virus. His demands are likely to be extremely difficult as several years of planning go into party conventions. Trump announced his desire for a change on Twitter, complaining that North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, and other officials \u201crefuse to guarantee that we can have use of the Spectrum Arena\u201d and were not \u201callowing us to occupy the arena as originally anticipated and promised\u201d. Demands for a full-scale convention had raised alarms in North Carolina, which is facing an upward trend in its virus cases. The state has roughly 29,900 cumulative cases and 900 deaths as of Tuesday. About 700 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized. Mecklenburg county, where Charlotte is located, accounted for 4,500 cases \u2013 more than double the next-highest county \u2013 and has nearly 100 deaths. Belgium has announced that restaurants, cafes and bars can reopen next week, in a significant easing of lockdown restrictions, writes Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. From 8 June, an individual can see up to 10 people in a week, compared with the current four-person limit per household for home gatherings. The new rules apply to indoor and outdoor meetings. Restaurants, cafes and bars can open from Monday if they take precautions, such as banning counter service and shared menus, compulsory masks for staff and a 1.5-metre distance between tables. Gyms can also reopen, but contact sports are banned and swimming pools will remain closed until July. Night clubs and festivals are not expected to return until late August. Belgium will reopen its borders on 15 June. People are advised to follow six golden rules, including hand hygiene and social distancing, when meeting someone from outside the family. After a meeting of Belgium\u2019s national crisis centre, the prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced the start of the third phase of lifting the lockdown: \u201cWe are going to think differently, with our freedoms the point of departure.\u201d The differences between Belgium and its neighbours, France, the Netherlands, Germany, which have already eased lockdown rules, were beginning to cause tensions as Belgians crossed borders to visit cafes and restaurants that remained shut at home. Few cases are as surreal as the town of Baarle-Hertog, a Belgian town with nearly two dozen Dutch enclaves, where borders divide streets and shops. Although forbidden for Belgians to cross the border, plenty have been doing so. \u201cI made sure I was in Holland, not Belgium so I could have a drink on the terrace,\u201d one visitor told the francophone broadcaster RTBF. \u201cI didn\u2019t harm anyone.\u201d But another resident, Jozef, told the channel that he hadn\u2019t crossed the border since February - despite living only 1 metre away. \u201cI am waiting for the end of the lockdown and the lifting of the frontiers.\u201d The UN and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement have called on governments, the private sector, international organizations and civil society to unite towards \u201ca people\u2019s vaccine\u201d for Covid-19. While there are dozens of coronavirus vaccine efforts continuing around the world, the signs are that access to the jab will be as hotly contested as were supplies of medical equipment for health systems struggling to treat patients with the disease. In a joint statement, the UN, the IRC and the RCM said: Covid-19 is a global disease affecting people around the world but with a disproportionately higher impact on vulnerable groups and individuals. As the race to identify the most effective tools to combat this virus continues with steady pace, the spirit of global solidarity must prevail: no one should be left behind. A people\u2019s vaccine should protect the affluent in cities and the poor in rural communities, the old in care homes and the young in refugee camps. A global social contract for a people\u2019s vaccine against Covid-19 is a moral imperative that brings us all together in our shared humanity. The unity and commitment towards a people\u2019s vaccine against Covid-19 should be accompanied by equal global collaboration and resolve to sustain immunisation against preventable diseases. Pakistan recorded its largest single day increase in coronavirus infections on Wednesday, as a fourth politician died after testing positive for the virus. Mian Jamshed Kakakhel, who was a member of a provincial assembly in the northwest, died on Wednesday, the Associated Press reports. His death comes a day after two lawmakers died at different hospitals after testing positive for the coronavirus. So far, four Pakistani lawmakers have died because of the coronavirus in the country, according to the American news agency. Pakistan on Wednesday reported 67 deaths in the past 24 hours from the outbreak. Critics have blamed the prime minister, Imran Khan, for an increase in deaths and infections. They accuse him of easing restrictions last month at a time when there was a need to enforce a stricter lockdown to contain the spread of the virus. Pakistan has recorded a total of 80,463 confirmed cases and 1,688 deaths since February. The number of deaths per capita from the coronavirus outbreak in Sweden has now surpassed that of France, as the country also recorded a bumper rise in infections due to the release of previously withheld statistics from a Stockholm test lab. According to the latest update from the public health agency, 74 more people have died from Covid-19 in Sweden, pushing the total death toll to 4,542. With 450 Covid-19 deaths per 1m people, it means Sweden now has a higher coronavirus death rate than France, which has recorded 443 deaths from the virus per 1m population, according to tallies kept on the Worldometers website. Sweden\u2019s unwelcome rise up the coronavirus rankings on Wednesday came after its chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, who is credited with masterminding his country\u2019s light touch outbreak strategy, admitted there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement in what we have done\u201d. Asked in an interview on Swedish radio whether too many people in Sweden had died, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d adding that the country would \u201chave to consider in the future whether there was a way of preventing\u201d such a high toll. \u201cIf we were to encounter the same disease again knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would settle on doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,\u201d Tegnell said. It would be \u201cgood to know exactly what to shut down to curb the spread of infection better\u201d, he added. Also on Wednesday, a further 2,214 confirmed cases of coronavirus were announced \u2013 the highest daily increase in cases yet in the country. According to Stockholm regional officials, the big daily rise in cases came because a laboratory that had hitherto only reported positive tests to patients publicly released data on 1,385 positive tests for the first time. Sweden has reported 40,803 cases since the coronavirus outbreak began. Damien Gayle back on the blog now, with thanks to Alexandra Topping for covering my break. If you have any comments, tips or suggestions drop me a line at damien.gayle@theguardian.com. In the UK, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has outlined how the proposed 14-day quarantine for people coming into the country will work. She told the Commons Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation on arrival. She said that anyone found breaking the isolation rules could face a fine of up to \u00a31,000 or prosecution. Patel said: We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk. The UK government has faced criticised for not implementing a quarantine earlier, but Patel said scientific advisers had advised that quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. Imported cases of the virus now pose a more significant threat, she said, so it was important to \u201cprotect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction\u201d. The measures will come into force on Monday, with \u201climited exemptions\u201d intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment are not disrupted. The regulations apply to England. Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Controversial French scientist Professor Didier Raoult, who has promoted hydroxychloroquine as an effective treatment against Covid-19, has been reported to public prosecutors in Marseille after a fellow specialist claimed patients were given the drug illegally. The investigative newspaper Le Canard Encha\u00een\u00e9 reported on Wednesday that a \u201ccolleague\u201d working as an infection specialist had sent a letter to the authorities at the beginning of April claiming Raoult had given trial patients the drug without their \u201cfree and clear\u201d consent as required by law. The French National Drug Agency was said to have carried out its own investigation and concluded that Raoult\u2019s trial patients were not correctly informed. The agency said: The procedures for informing patients and for tracing the reasons for the prescription do not comply with legal requirements. The agency added that it had referred the matter to the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Marseille prosecutor Dominique Laurens told 20 Minutes investigators were looking into the letter with \u201cthe greatest care\u201d. She said: It\u2019s easy to denounce certain things, but much more difficult to verify them. Under French legislation known as the 2012 Jard\u00e9 Law, covering therapeutic drug trials, patients must give their express consent to taking part. Raoult divides public and scientific opinion in France between those who see him as a rebellious local hero and modern messiah and others less convinced by his methods and self-promotion. He denied the accusations and told French media he had always \u201crespected the full force of the law\u201d. The links between obesity and the risk of becoming dangerously ill with coronavirus have become increasingly clear, my colleague Sarah Boseley has looked at the subject in detail: France\u2019s digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since Tuesday afternoon, when it became available. StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus, but its launch hasn\u2019t been completely smooth. A last-minute launch delay meant some citizens downloaded a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - causing it to briefly top France\u2019s download charts. England has not yet launched its app. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, originally said that the app would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d across England, but it could now be as late as mid-May or July. Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a \u201ccentralised\u201d design, while other countries such as Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a \u201cdecentralised\u201d technology developed by Apple and Google. Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake. He told the TV channel France 2. As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it\u2019s a very very good start. We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it. This is Lexy Topping, just taking over from Damien for an hour while he has a break. Any tips or stories please do get in touch: alexandra.topping@theguardian.com 07920 021380 Officials in Afghanistan have said that the country is heading toward the peak of its coronavirus outbreak as Wednesday saw the biggest one-day rise in the number of deaths yet and the number of confirmed cases passed 17,000, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Amrullah Saleh, the vice president, said people continue to break lockdown roles and that, according to the information he has received from health ministry, Afghanistan is on the verge of a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. \u201cThe virus will spread fast in coming two months, if we control it in August, we can go back to normal on the eve of new year\u201d Saleh said. He also asked the Taliban to announce a humanitarian ceasefire so the health workers can fight the virus across the country. The office of Save the Children in Afghanistan said Tuesday that the coronavirus crisis has left more than seven million children in the country prone to poverty and barred them from their basic rights. \u201cCovid-19 crisis exposes more than seven million Afghan children to the threat of hunger. Also, the children who have been deprived of school in the last three months have not had access to their basic right that is education\u201d said Maryam Ataee, the NGO\u2019s Afghanistan spokesperson. On Wednesday, the Afghan health ministry recorded the biggest one-day rise in number of deaths, as 24 patients died overnight. The ministry also said it had detected 758 new cases, raising the total number of infections to 17,267. Of those 294 have died and 1,522 have recovered. Most of new infections and deaths were recorded in the capital, Kabul, and the western province of Herat, which are hotspots of the virus in Afghanistan. Kabul recorded 332 new cases with eight deaths, while Herat reported 216 new positive cases and four deaths. After around three weeks pause in reporting coronavirus statistics, due to a problem in the testing process, the southern province of Kandahar recorded 54 new cases on Wednesday. In the north, the interior ministry has confirmed that the police commander of Kunduz province has died due to the virus, along with a district governor. More than 600 nurses worldwide are known to have died from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, the International Council of Nurses said on Wednesday, according to Reuters. The death toll among nurses more than doubled in the past month from 260 on 6 May, according to its figures, which are based on data from more than 30 countries. \u201cIn the last two months, we have seen the number of deaths of nurses as a result of coronavirus around the world rise from 100 to now in excess of 600 and we think worldwide the number of healthcare workers who could be infected by the virus is around 450,000,\u201d Howard Catton, chief executive officer of the Geneva-based ICN, told Reuters Television. \u201cThese are numbers that keep going up,\u201d he said. On average, 7% of all cases of coronavirus infection are among healthcare workers, which means that nurses and other staff are at great personal risk \u201cand so are the patients they care for\u201d, it said. Extrapolating from more than 6 million reported cases gave its estimate of some 450,000 infections among healthcare workers. Infection rates among healthcare workers vary greatly between countries, with fewer than 1% in Singapore and more than 30% in Ireland, it said. Spain and Germany have recorded low numbers of fatalities among healthcare workers despite large outbreaks, it added. \u201cWhy do the rates of deaths among nurses appear higher in some Latin American countries?\u201d it asked, referring to the region that the World Health Organization (WHO) says has emerged as the new epicentre for the pandemic. \u201cWhy are some countries reporting disproportionate deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic HCWs (healthcare workers)? This is an issue raised directly by the Philippine Nurses Association to ICN, concerning Filipino HCWs in the UK,\u201d it said. Entry checks at land borders to Austria, introduced because of the coronavirus pandemic, will be scrapped from Thursday, except for those at the border with Italy, Austria\u2019s foreign minister has announced. \u201cAs of tomorrow there will be no more checks in order to enter Austria,\u201d Alexander Schallenberg told a press conference, according to AFP. The controls on the Italian border will be evaluated again next week, the French news agency quoted him as saying, adding that Vienna was considering the possibility of allowing entry from Italian regions where infection figures are low. Austria said last month it would open its borders - closed in mid-March - with all countries, except for Italy and Slovenia, in the middle of June. Announcing the decision to bring forward the opening, Schallenberg cited positive epidemiological developments in neighbouring Germany, Hungary, Lichtenstein, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and the Czech Republic. On Wednesday, Austria reported that 26 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and one person had died of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. To date the Alpine EU member of nearly nine million people has escaped the worst of the pandemic, registering more than 16,759 cases, of which 15,629 have recovered and 669 have died. It\u2019s been proposed, probed and pushed to the margins of the European Union for more than two decades. Now, writes Ashifa Kassam in Madrid, as Europe reels from tens of thousands of coronavirus deaths and millions of lost jobs in the worst recession for generations, ministers from Spain, Italy and Portugal say the time has come to revive a radical idea: a pan-EU minimum income. \u201cThis is the moment for debates about social protection,\u201d Pablo Iglesias, Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister for social rights and leader of Podemos, told the Guardian. \u201cAnyone who finds themselves in a vulnerable situation should have access to protection mechanisms that allow them to fill their fridge and care for their family.\u201d The measure, Iglesias argues, could protect more than 113 million people who face poverty and social exclusion in the EU and offer a safety net as the coronavirus pandemic threatens to pull millions more into poverty. He has joined forces with the labour ministers for Italy and Portugal, Nunzia Catalfo and Ana Mendes Godinho, to call for a common EU approach to minimum income. The measure would pave the way for the bloc\u2019s 450 million residents to receive a top-up if their income falls below a certain level. What the trio are putting forward is the idea; the hope is that EU governments will come together to hash out how it would be funded, the minimum income amount, and eligibility. Switzerland\u2019s economy shrank 2.6% during the first three months of the year compared to the previous quarter, as the coronavirus crisis took a heavy toll, official statistics showed Wednesday. The pandemic and the measures taken to halt the spread of the virus severely restrict economic activity, at the same time as the international economic slump also slowed exports, Switzerland\u2019s economic affairs ministry said. It added, however, that exports had swung back into positive territory, saved by the country\u2019s large pharmaceutical sector. Switzerland, which has registered nearly 1,700 deaths from Covid-19 and nearly 30,800 coronavirus infections, stopped short of full confinement requirements but introduced dramatic restrictions from mid-March to try to rein in the virus. With case numbers declining, Switzerland, like many other European countries, has since 27 April been gradually lifting restrictions. Schools, restaurants, and shops have resumed business, and a third phase in the easing process is due to kick in on 6 June, when events with up to 300 people will be permitted, and all leisure and entertainment businesses and tourist attractions will be permitted to reopen. Here are the main points of our global coronavirus coverage so far today: \u201cWe could have done better,\u201d Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist has said. Anders Tegnell, the architect of Sweden\u2019s light-touch approach to the coronavirus has acknowledged that the country has had too many deaths from Covid-19 and should have done more to curb the spread of the virus. Known deaths from coronavirus passed 380,000, according to Johns Hopkins University figures that show the toll currently standing at 380,662. Confirmed infections are nearing 6.4 million, with 6,399,876 so far. Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to Britain while the UK maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced plans to scrap travel warnings for 30 countries including Britain from 15 June. A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. Lufthansa has announced it will undergo \u201cfar-reaching\u201d restructuring as it posted a first-quarter net loss of \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.9bn/$2.3bn), hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cGlobal air traffic has come to a virtual standstill in recent months,\u201d chief executive Carsten Spohr said in a statement. Air pollution in China has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels, and scientists say Europe may follow suit. Data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea) shows concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are now at the same levels as one year earlier. Vietnam\u2019s most gravely-ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot who works for its national airline, has started to recover and may no longer require a lung transplant, state media said. Vietnam, which has reported no deaths from the coronavirus, has mounted an all-out effort to save the 43-year-old man. Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic, the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, confirmed. It came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter, on the back of the bushfires, drought and the pandemic New Zealand has recorded 12th day with no new cases. The government is considering abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person is still recovering, health officials said on Wednesday. The patient is not in hospital. Iran\u2019s daily number of new coronavirus transmissions continued creeping back towards its previous peak on Wednesday, with 3,134 confirmed cases detected in the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry. The Islamic republic recorded 3,186 transmissions on 30 March, at the height of its outbreak. Numbers then dipped to 802 on 2 May, after the country imposed closures of schools, religious sites and parts of the economy, but have crept up since then as measures to contain the spread have been eased. Wednesday\u2019s figure is the second highest number of daily transmissions reported in a day. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said that 70 more Iranians had died as a result of the outbreak in the past 24 hours, and 2,557 patients were in hospital in a critical condition, the Islamic Republic News Agency reports. Iran has so far reported 160,696 confirmed cases of coronavirus, of which 125,206 have recovered and 8,012 have died. The number of coronavirus cases is slowly declining in Russia, the World Health Organization has said, as the Kremlin prepares to stage a vote that would pave the way for the president, Vladimir Putin, to continue in office. \u201cWe are seeing a good, albeit slow, decline\u201d in the number of infections in Russia including the capital Moscow, said Melita Vujnovic, the WHO\u2019s Russia representative, according to AFP. \u201cWe are hoping that the epidemic will continue to decline further,\u201d she told reporters. This week Putin said a delayed vote on constitutional reforms allowing him to potentially stay in power beyond 2024 would be held on 1 July. He ordered officials to pay \u201cspecial attention\u201d to safety issues in organising the vote but stressed that the country had passed the peak of contagion. Germany will lift a travel ban for European Union member states plus Britain, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland from 15 June as long as there are no entry bans or large-scale lockdowns in those countries, the foreign minister has said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Heiko Maas said all countries concerned met those criteria except Norway due to an entry ban and Spain, where he said parliament was deciding whether to extend an entry ban, Reuters reports. Maas said the travel warnings would be replaced with guidelines, adding that Germans would be urged not to travel to Britain when not essential while a 14-day quarantine is in place. As social unrest spurred by the police killing of George Floyd sweeps America, public health officials and government departments are grappling with the fear that demonstrators and police risk accelerating the spread of the coronavirus, which also disproportionately affects minority communities, writes Jessica Glenza, Guardian US health reporter. \u201cThis is the worst possible thing that could happen,\u201d said Dr Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and an expert on pandemics. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how many of those people are asymptomatic carriers, and that\u2019s really scary.\u201d Several factors could contribute to the spread, including lack of social distancing, limitations of masks, and police tactics such as use of teargas and arrests. At the same time, the threat of infection is unlikely to deter demonstrators desperate for social change. In some cases, the rate of black men killed by police rivals that posed by serious infectious disease. \u201cProtests are life-saving for black people in this country,\u201d said Dr Rhea Boyd, pediatrician and masters of public health in minority health policy. \u201cEven though being in the streets increases your risk,\u201d of Covid-19 infection, \u201cwe all know that risk exists anyway.\u201d Humanity will be \u201cfinished\u201d if we fail to drastically change our food systems in response to the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, the prominent naturalist Jane Goodall has warned, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. She blamed the emergence of Covid-19 on the over-exploitation of the natural world, which has seen forests cut down, species made extinct and natural habitats destroyed. The coronavirus is thought to have made the jump from animals to humans late last year, possibly originating in a meat market in Wuhan, China. Intensive farming was also creating a reservoir of animal diseases that would spill over and hurt human society, said Goodall, one of the world\u2019s foremost experts on chimpanzees and a longtime conservation campaigner, speaking alongside two European commissioners at an online event held by the campaigning group Compassion in World Farming, on Tuesday. \u201cWe have brought this on ourselves because of our absolute disrespect for animals and the environment,\u201d she said. \u201cOur disrespect for wild animals and our disrespect for farmed animals has created this situation where disease can spill over to infect human beings.\u201d People must move away from factory farming and stop destroying natural habitats as a matter of urgency, she said, because of the threat of diseases and of climate breakdown. Factory farming is linked to the rise of antibiotic resistant superbugs, which threaten human health. \u201cIf we do not do things differently, we are finished,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on very much longer like this.\u201d Primary school pupils in North Korea returned to their classrooms on Wednesday, after months of delays to the start of the new term, AFP reports. While Pyongyang has not confirmed a single case of coronavirus, it had nevertheless imposed strict rules to curb its spread, including closing its borders and ordering thousands into isolation. The new school term was originally scheduled to start in early April but was repeatedly postponed. Some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April. Uniformed students made their way to their schools on Wednesday morning, all wearing red commemorative flowers and face masks. At an elementary school in Pyongyang pupils wearing backpacks had their temperatures checked as they arrived for lessons. In the classroom they lined up to wash their hands using water from red buckets before taking their seats. \u201cYou have to rub your hands,\u201d the teacher told them. Students wore their masks in class but sat close together as they diligently listened to their teacher - also wearing a face covering - talk about the North\u2019s leadership, maths and other topics.

Germany will continue to warn against non-essential travel to Britain while the UK maintains its 14-day quarantine rules, despite removing curbs for travel to the rest of Europe. Speaking a press conference on Wednesday morning, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government would scrap general travel warnings for 30 countries including Britain from 15 June, replacing it with daily travel advice for each country that reflects the current development of the pandemic. The 30 countries include the 26 member states of the European Union as well as four countries that are part of Schengen but not the EU: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Maas said while the UK maintained its rule for international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days, his government would advise against non-essential travel to Britain. Germany introduced a rule for international arrivals to self-isolate for 14 days on 9 April but the advice was scrapped in mid-May British doctors are trialling a formulation of anti-inflammatory ibuprofen to see if it reduces respiratory failure in patients with severe symptoms of Covid-19, Reuters reports. The trial involves a particular formulation of ibuprofen, which researchers said had been shown to be more effective than standard ibuprofen for treating severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARCS), a complication of Covid-19. The formulation is already licensed for use in Britain for other conditions. \u201cIf successful, the global public health value of this trial result would be immense given the low cost and availability of this medicine,\u201d said Matthew Hotpot, director of NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre. The trial, known as \u201cLiberate\u201d, will be a randomised study, with recruitment of up to 230 patients expected over the coming months. It is being run by Guy\u2019s &amp; St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust in London, King\u2019s College London and pharmaceutical organisation the SEEK Group. In March, France\u2019s health minister said people should not use anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen if they have symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. However, US, British and EU drug regulators as well as the maker of Nurofen, Reckitt Benckiser, have all said there is no evidence that ibuprofen makes Covid-19 worse. Patient 91, British pilot in Vietnam, showing signs of recovery Vietnam\u2019s most gravely-ill Covid-19 patient, a British pilot who works for its national airline, has started to recover from the illness and may no longer require a lung transplant, state media said today, report Reuters. Vietnam, which has reported no deaths from the coronavirus, has mounted an all-out effort to save the 43-year-old man, who has been identified officially by the government as \u201cPatient 91\u201d. Until recently, the Vietnam Airlines pilot was thought by doctors and officials to be in urgent need of a lung transplant. The fate of \u201cPatient 91\u201d has received unprecedented national attention, with more than 50 people in Vietnam offering themselves as potential lung donors, according to state media. The man, who is being treated at a hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, can now smile, shake hands and respond to commands from hospital staff, the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said on Wednesday. His reliance on artificial life support has also been reduced but he is still on a ventilator to allow his badly-damaged lungs to recover, VNA said. He has tested negative for the coronavirus, and Vietnam has spent more than $215,000 treating him, the report added. Through aggressive testing and a mass, centralised quarantine programme, Vietnam has successfully contained the spread of the novel coronavirus, putting it on course to revive its economy much sooner than most others. Vietnam\u2019s second most serious case, \u201cPatient 19\u201d, was discharged from hospital on Wednesday. Of Vietnam\u2019s 328 coronavirus cases, 90% have recovered. Here\u2019s Jon Henley\u2019s take on Anders Tegnell\u2019s admission that there was \u201cquite obviously a potential for improvement in what we have done\u201d in Sweden: Asked whether too many people in Sweden had died, he replied: \u201cYes, absolutely,\u201d adding that the country would have to consider in the future whether there was a way of preventing such a high toll. Figures suggest the country\u2019s death rate per capita was the highest in the world over the seven days to 2 June. This week the Swedish government, bowing to opposition pressure, promised to set up a commission to look into its Covid-19 strategy. More here: Our science correspondent, Hannah Devlin, has written this handy guide to the face mask, whether it works, and how to make your own: Air pollution in China has climbed back to pre-pandemic levels, and scientists say Europe may follow suit. Air pollution causes at least 8m early deaths a year, and cleaner skies were seen as one of the few silver linings of Covid-19. Experts have called for action to help retain the air quality benefits of lockdowns, and measures taken to date have included expanding cycle lanes and space for walking in cities. Data from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea) shows concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) across China are now at the same levels as one year earlier. At the height of the country\u2019s coronavirus response in early March, NO2 levels were down by 38% from 2019 and levels of PM2.5 were down by 34%. More here: Berlin\u2019s senate has switched one of the three \u201ccorona traffic lights\u201d in its pandemic warning system to red, after the R number stayed above 1.2 for three consecutive days. The German capital recorded 35 new infections on Tuesday evening, bringing the total number of active cases of Covid-19 to 317. The latest basic reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average, was estimated to be at 1.95. Dilek Kalayci, Berlin\u2019s senator for health, said the R number was more likely to fluctuate while the total number of infections was low. \u201cBut the number of new infections is increasing, so that you can recognise a change of trend.\u201d If one of the two other \u201ctraffic light\u201d indicators, either the number of free intensive care beds or the number of weekly new infections, also switches to red, the senate will need to take action, for example by reintroducing restrictions that have just been eased. For now, the two other traffic lights are on green: the number of weekly new infections in the city is currently at 5.1 per 100,000 people, while Covid-19 patients only take up 3.3% of intensive care beds. Across Germany as a whole, the R number on Wednesday sunk back below one, to 0.89. Germany will lift a travel ban for European Union member states plus Britain, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland from 15 June as long as there are no entry bans or large-scale lockdowns in those countries, the foreign minister said. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Heiko Maas said all countries concerned met those criteria except Norway, due to an entry ban, and Spain, where he said parliament was deciding whether to extend an entry ban. Maas said the travel warning would be replaced with guidelines, adding that Germans would be urged not to travel to Britain when not essential while a 14-day quarantine is in place. [Edit: see Philip Oltermann\u2019s update here] Meanwhile, free movement between the Czech Republic and Slovakia will be restored from midnight tonight. Indonesia has reported 684 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the south-east Asian country to 28,233, and 35 deaths, taking the total to 1,698. Meanwhile Malaysia has reported 93 new cases, with no new deaths. Sweden should have done more to combat the coronavirus and prevent a much higher national Covid-19 death rate than in neighbouring countries, the man behind the Public Health Agency\u2019s pandemic strategy said today. Nearly 4,500 Swedes have died in the outbreak, a higher mortality rate than in Denmark, Norway and Finland, and criticism has been growing over the government\u2019s decision not to impose lockdown measures as strictly as elsewhere in Europe. Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency, said that in hindsight Sweden should have done more. \u201cIf we were to run into the same disease, knowing exactly what we know about it today, I think we would end up doing something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done,\u201d Tegnell told Swedish radio. \u201cYes, I think we could have done better in what we did in Sweden, clearly.\u201d While most of Europe, including Norway, Denmark and Finland, closed schools, shops and businesses, bringing much of society to a halt, Sweden has relied more on voluntary measures, social distancing and common-sense hygiene advice to stem the outbreak. It shut care homes to visitors in late March, but around half of the deaths in the country have been among elderly people living in care facilities. Tegnell said it was hard to know which measures taken elsewhere might have been the most effective in Sweden. \u201cMaybe we will find this out now that people have started removing measures, one at a time,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then maybe we will get some kind of information on what, in addition to what we did, we could do without adopting a total lockdown.\u201d Earlier this week, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said the government would launch an enquiry into the handling of the pandemic. Spain\u2019s National Ballet Company have gone back to work today for the first time since lockdown, rehearsing in small groups of no more than 12 dancers. Interesting news we missed yesterday: a South high court in South Africa declared some of the government\u2019s coronavirus lockdown regulations unconstitutional, but suspended the order for 14 days, leaving the rules in place for now. South Africa introduced in March one of the world\u2019s most restrictive Covid-19 lockdowns - including a ban on alcohol and cigarette sales - but has gradually eased restrictions down to the third of five levels. The Liberty Fighters Network advocacy group filed a lawsuit against the regulations in May, arguing they were unlawful as they violated South Africa\u2019s Bill of Rights. In response, the court declared rules governing levels three and four of the lockdown to be \u201cunconstitutional and invalid\u201d. \u201cThe regulations ... in a substantial number of instances are not rationally connected to the objectives of slowing the rate of infection or limiting the spread thereof,\u201d the written judgement read. \u201cInsofar as the \u2018lockdown regulations\u2019 do not satisfy the \u2018rationality test\u2019, their encroachment on and limitation of rights ... is not justifiable.\u201d The judgement said all regulations under level three and four must be reviewed and amended giving due consideration to their impact on individual rights, aside from a few exceptions including the closure of borders, nightclubs and casinos. Today is World Bicycle Day, which has been celebrated in the Philippines by the opening of new bike lanes in the capital, Manila: The Chinese government has said today that a report widely circulated yesterday that said it delayed sharing information about Covid-19 with the World Health Organization (WHO) is totally untrue. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian made the remarks during a daily briefing in response to a question about the report by the Associated Press, which said the WHO was frustrated by significant delays in information sharing by Beijing as the coronavirus outbreak took hold in China in January. Russia has reported 8,536 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 today, taking its nationwide tally to 432,277, the third highest in the world. The death toll reached 5,215 after the authorities said they had recorded another 178 deaths from the virus. Is this the future of concerts? The Greek singer Natassa Theodoridou played last night in the Athens suburb of Glyfada to an audience who stayed in or at least near their cars throughout: Sheikh Hasina, the prime minister of Bangladesh and chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, and Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation, have written for us about dealing with the twin perils of a super-cyclone and Covid-19 in Bangladesh last month: There was no time to lose when Cyclone Amphan began forming over the Indian Ocean in May. But shelters are not built with social distancing in mind in Bangladesh and the country faced a challenge: how to move 2.4 million people from the destructive path of the storm without delivering them into an even greater danger \u2013 Covid-19. Mass evacuations are challenging at the best of times. People are reluctant to leave their homes unguarded. This time the challenge was far more complex. People were afraid to move to shelters for fear of the virus. First responders also had to make sure the evacuation itself was not a vector for contagion. In a matter of days, Bangladesh prepared almost 10,500 additional shelters \u2013 on top of the 4,171 in existence \u2013 to accommodate evacuees with a measure of social distancing. More than 70,000 \u201ccyclone preparedness\u201d volunteers across coastal areas were mobilised. Masks, water, soap and sanitiser were distributed. The garment industry, reeling from cancelled export orders, retooled production lines to manufacture personal protective equipment. Much more here: Lufthansa has announced it will undergo \u201cfar-reaching\u201d restructuring as it posted a first-quarter net loss of \u20ac2.1bn (\u00a31.9bn/$2.3bn) today, hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, reports AFP. \u201cGlobal air traffic has come to a virtual standstill in recent months. This has impacted our quarterly results to an unprecedented extent. In view of the very slow recovery in demand, we must now take far-reaching restructuring measures to counteract this,\u201d chief executive Carsten Spohr said in a statement. On top of the collapse in passenger numbers, depreciation of some company assets sapped the bottom line. Falling fuel prices meanwhile cost the airline \u20ac950m because it had hedged its purchases with much higher priced contracts. The first quarter was much worse than the loss of \u20ac342m in 2019\u2019s first quarter, traditionally a quiet time for travel. On Monday, the airline\u2019s supervisory board approved a \u20ac9bn bailout deal from the German government. The group is to ask its shareholders to back the agreement, which will see the state take a 20% stake in the group, at an online meeting on 25 June. Like its rivals, the Lufthansa group \u2013 which also includes Eurowings, Swiss, Brussels and Austrian Airlines \u2013 has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The airline said on Wednesday it plans to increase seat capacity in September to \u201cup to 40%\u201d of what was expected before the pandemic, and compared with around 3% in May. But of its 760 aircraft, 300 are expected to remain parked next year and 200 in 2022. Even with the hoped-for gradual increase of passenger traffic, Lufthansa\u2019s push to repay the bailout cash \u201cwill only succeed if we implement restructuring programs in all areas \u2026 and agree on innovative solutions with the unions and working councils,\u201d finance director Thorsten Dirks said. Looking ahead, \u201cthe uncertain further development of the corona pandemic continues to make it impossible to make a precise forecast of the earnings trend for 2020\u201d, the group said, predicting only a \u201csignificant decline\u201d in adjusted operating profit. A study of blood donors in the Netherlands has found that around 5.5% of them have developed antibodies against the new coronavirus, blood donation firm Sanquin said today. The study, conducted among 7,000 donors between May 10 and 20, gives an indication of what percentage of the Dutch population may have already had the disease. A similar study in April showed antibodies in 3% of Dutch blood donors. \u201cThis shows that over 90% of our donors have still not been in touch with the virus, assuming almost all people who have been infected develop antibodies,\u201d Sanquin\u2019s head researcher, Hans Zaaijer, told Dutch public broadcaster NOS. \u201cWe are miles away from a scenario of herd immunity.\u201d As of Tuesday 46,647 infections with the new coronavirus had been confirmed in the country, with 5,967 deaths.

Thanks! We\u2019ve got more detail from our team in Australia about how the country is on the brink of its first recession for nearly 30 years. The resource-rich nation saw its economy shrink by 0.3% in the first quarter amid the onslaught of coronavirus. Added to the devastating bushfires at the turn of the year and with worse to come according to treasurer Josh Frydenberg, the country is sure to plunge into recession when June quarter are releasded later in the year. Here\u2019s the full story from Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy: Our correspondent in Bangkok, Rebecca Ratcliffe, has sent this dispatch about how academics have taken inspiration from Japan to find ways of holding graduation ceremonies during the outbreak. She writes: Robots decked out in gowns and mortarboards have already found their way into a university hall in Japan. They might also be about to appear in Malaysia, as academics search for ways to hold graduation ceremonies without risking transmission. Sultan Zainal Abidin University, in north-eastern Terengganu state, has released a simulation video showing waist-high robots collecting certificates from staff. Each robot head features a screen that broadcasts a student\u2019s face through video conferencing. Business Breakthrough (BBT) University in Tokyo held a graduation ceremony using similar technology in April, allowing students to participate remotely during lockdown. Not all students are keen on the idea though, with some saying they\u2019d rather wait to take part in the ceremony in real life. Malaysia has eased restrictions following a relatively moderate virus outbreak. So far, nearly 8,000 people have been infected and 115 deaths have been recorded. India is still some way from the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, according to a government expert. The country passed 200,000 infections on Wednesday, the health ministry said, and worse is expected to come. Cases jumped by 8,909 over the previous day in one of the highest single-day spikes, taking the tally to 207,615. Six other nations, from the United States, to Britain and Brazil, have a higher caseload. But Dr Nivedita Gupta, of the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research, warned: \u201cWe are very far away for the peak.\u201d Officials have previously said it could be later this month, or even July, before cases start to fall off. The death toll from the disease stood at 5,815. We reported yesterday about the death of a doctor who worked at the same hospital as the coronavirus whistleblower, Li Wenliang. Now our China correspondent, Lily Kuo, reports on how the death of Hu Weifeng, 42, a urologist at Wuhan Central hospital, has prompted a wave of anger at hospital authorities for not protecting frontline health workers in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cFrom Li Wenliang to Hu Weifeng, the medical staff of Wuhan Central hospital lost the most during the outbreak. They were killed by the leaders of the hospital,\u201d one internet user wrote on the Chinese social media site Weibo. Indifference or disbelief towards Covid-19 runs deep in the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2019s capital, Kinshasha, in a response that strikes fear into watchdogs battling the disease, AFP reports. On May 20, the official committee to fight the coronavirus said three of its workers were threatened at knifepoint, part of what the government last Friday described as \u201crising cases\u201d of abuse of virus campaigners. The hostility in the chaotic capital of 10 million people is such that Caritas and two grassroots groups called Lucha and Filimbi have resorted to going out in groups to spread awareness messages and hand out masks. In the districts of Victoire and Selembao, they were recently greeted by scores of locals who wagged their forefinger at them in disapproval or screamed \u201ccorona eza te!\u201d (\u201cthere\u2019s no corona,\u201d in the Lingala language). Many, however, accepted a mask, although one admitted that this was to avoid the risk of a 5,000-franc fine ($2.6/2.4 euros) for not wearing one. Good morning/afternoon/evening wherever you might be. My name is Martin Farrer and I\u2019m taking over blogging duties from Helen Sullivan. Helen has just published her summary of the day below, and we\u2019ve also just launched my wrap up of the day so far which focuses on how global stock markets have risen to a three-month high despite anxiety about continuing spread of the virus and the US protests. And Australia is heading into recession for the first time in 30 years. You can read it in full here: Known deaths in the coronavirus pandemic passed 380,000 on Wednesday, with Johns Hopkins University figures showing the toll currently standing at 380,250. Confirmed infections are nearing 3.4 million, with 6,378,239 so dar. Brazil deaths passed 30,000. A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths. Australia\u2019s economy is in recession. Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. His confirmation came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter, on the back of the bushfires, drought and coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be.\u201d New Zealand saw its 12th consecutive day with no new cases. New Zealand has reported a 12th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, as the government considers abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths. French anti-racism protesters defied a coronavirus gathering ban. Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence. China\u2019s service sector is bouncing back. China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn. Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after a humanitarian fundraising summit raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine. A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year. France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days. It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures. Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March. Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state. The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive. The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock. A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week, Chinese state media reported. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, reportedly became China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks when he died on Friday after being treated for more than four months. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for now \u2013 I\u2019ll be crossing over to the US live blog in a minute. My colleague Martin Farrer will be with you for the next few hours. Known deaths in the coronavirus pandemic passed 380,000 on Wednesday, with Johns Hopkins University figures showing the toll currently standing at 380,250. Confirmed infections are nearing 6.4 million, with 6,378,239 so far. Brazil, with 31,199 deaths, is on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths. But Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed Covid-19 as a \u201clittle flu\u201d, again brushed off the tragedy on Tuesday. \u201cI regret each of the deaths - but that\u2019s everyone\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capitalBras\u00edlia. These are the ten countries with the highest number of infections, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker: US: 1,831,821 Brazil: 555,383 Russia: 423,186 United Kingdom: 279,392 Spain: 239,932 Italy: 233,515 India: 207,191 France: 188,450 Germany: 183,879 Peru: 170,039 The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 342 to 182,370, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 29 to 8,551, the tally showed. South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved a request by the country\u2019s health authorities to import Gilead Sciences Inc\u2019s anti-viral drug remdesivir to treat COVID-19, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The decision came after a government panel concluded last week that remdesivir showed positive results. The ministry said it will cooperate with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), other ministries and Gilead Sciences to swiftly import the drug. More on New Zealand now, which on Wednesday saw its 12th consecutive day with no new cases: New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday she could lift all social distancing measures to return the country to normal life, bar the international border closure, as early as next week. Ardern will decide on Monday whether the country is ready to shift to alert level 1, more than two months after she imposed a strict level 4 lockdown, shutting most businesses and forcing people to stay home, in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Arden said waiting until Monday would allow her to see if recent changes, like the removal of restrictions on the number of people in bars and at social gatherings, had led to a rise in cases. \u201cIf it hasn\u2019t, then we will be in a good position to move,\u201d she said during a televised news conference. Under level 1 there is no requirement for physical distancing or limits on the number of people allowed in places like bars, clubs, churches, and sports venues, she said. However, there would be one major change from pre-pandemic normality, with no immediate plans to reopen New Zealand\u2019s border. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has confirmed Australia is now in a recession as the economy reels from the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Frydenberg\u2019s confirmation came after the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the economy shrank by 0.3% in the March quarter, on the back of the bushfires, drought and coronavirus pandemic. Asked whether the country was now in recession, he said: \u201cWell, the answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019. And that is on the basis of the advice that I have from the Treasury department about where the June quarter is expected to be.\u201d In Australia, a world without cheques, fewer ATMs and a regulatory push to lower electronic transaction fees as fewer people use cash are some of the likely impacts of Covid-19 on payments, the Reserve Bank has said. RBA assistant governor Michele Bullock told a Morgan Stanley disruption conference on Wednesday that cash was now the payment method for just 25% of transactions, or around 10% of their value. The long-term decline of cash has been accelerated by merchants and consumers concerned about hygiene during the Covid-19 pandemic, with many putting up signs asking for card payments or rejecting cash altogether, she said. As shoppers flocked instead to online shopping, where cash was not an option, ATM withdrawals in April were down 30% from the month before and more than 40% lower than the year before. Bullock said it was \u201clikely that a large part of this will become a permanent change in behaviour\u201d and add to pressure on banks to reduce the number of ATMs in their networks \u2013 a consolidation that will be \u201cmore urgent\u201d and occur \u201cmore quickly\u201d as a result. China reported one new coronavirus case and four new asymptomatic Covid-19 cases in the mainland on 2 June, the country\u2019s health commission said. The National Health Commission said the one confirmed case was imported involving a traveller from overseas. Mainland China had five confirmed cases, all of which were imported, and 10 asymptomatic cases for 1 June. China does not count asymptomatic patients, those who are infected with the coronavirus but not exhibiting symptoms, as confirmed cases. Total number of infections to date in the mainland stands at 83,021. The death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. Dan Collyns brings you this action-packed update from Bolivia: \u201cThanos is beating us\u201d warned a Bolivian government minister in a live televised press conference on Monday as he called for his compatriots to comply with sanitary measures and lockdown restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bolivia\u2019s public works minister Iv\u00e1n Arias grasped the eponymous action figure along with models of fictional rivals Hulk and Iron Man as he made the comic-book comparison and exhorted Bolivians to protect themselves as the country relaxed its quarantine measures this week. \u201cWe must all use masks, keep a metre\u2019s distance and respect the rules, because it\u2019s been shown that Thanos is beating us; chaos, pain, death,\u201d Arias said, prompting amused reactions on social media. \u201cSo, it\u2019s very worrying what\u2019s happening in La Paz region and that\u2019s why I call on all Pace\u00f1os to get out their best Avenger, the best protector we all have,\u201d he added as he held plastic toys of the three Marvel Comics characters. Lockdown measures have been eased in La Paz and four other Bolivian cities beginning this month. The country has so far confirmed nearly 11,000 Covid-19 cases and 376 deaths. The pandemic comes at an uncertain time in Bolivia as the country\u2019s interim president Jeanine A\u00f1ez has been accused of using the pandemic to delay elections. China\u2019s huge service sector has bounced back to growth for the first time since January in a sign that the world\u2019s second largest economy is recovering strongly from strict coronavirus-induced containment measures. Although employment and overseas demand remains weak in the economy, the Caixin/Markit services purchasing managers\u2019 index rose to 55.0 in May from 44.4 in April, hitting the highest level since late 2010. The 50-mark separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. The news buoyed Asian stock markets that were already riding on a wave of positive sentiment in the United States where stocks rose for a third straight day despite widespread unrest on the country\u2019s city streets. Tokyo and Hong Kong were both up more than 1% while the ASX200 in Australia was up 0.8% despite GDp figures showing the country is on course for its first recession in 30 years. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay has this report: Jacinda Ardern has had to wrestle with perhaps an unusual problem for a world leader at the moment: wishing people would stop wanting to stand so close to her. Those jostling for selfies with the New Zealand prime minister have occasionally stood \u201ccloser than advised\u201d, she has said, risking her adherence to her government\u2019s own physical distancing measures. At a news conference this afternoon, Ardern was asked by a reporter about pictures of her \u201cembracing\u201d fans in public, a characterisation she said she disagreed with. People had approached her for selfies when she was out and about, she said, and sometimes they stood \u201ccloser than would be advised.\u201d New Zealanders are still required to remain two metres from people they don\u2019t know. Recent polls have showed Ardern\u2019s approval rating soaring to 65% during the lockdown she imposed over Covid-19, which is widely credited for curbing the spread of the virus. Politicians in New Zealand are remarkably accessible; the prime minister does her own shopping and groceries, and last month made world headlines when she was turned away from a popular Wellington cafe on a date with her partner because they did not have a table available. (The story had a happy ending when space became free and a staff member chased the couple down the street to let them know.) As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you \u2013 please get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com with comments, questions and news tips from where you live. Clashes broke out between police and protesters in Paris on Tuesday after around 20,000 people defied a ban to rally over the 2016 death of a black man in police custody, galvanised by US demonstrations against racism and deadly police violence, AFP reports. The protesters used slogans from the American protest movement to call for justice for Adama Traore, whose death four years ago has been a rallying cause against police brutality in France. The demonstration, which came after the release of two differing medical reports into the cause of Traore\u2019s death, had been prohibited by police citing a coronavirus ban on gatherings of more than 10 people. The protest started in the late afternoon outside the court in northern Paris, before projectiles were thrown and the police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, AFP journalists witnessed. Many of the protesters drew inspiration from the protest movement raging across the United States over the police killing last week of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, holding up slogans in English such as \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d. Dan McGarry in Port Vila and Tess Newton Cain: Here is the latest news about the Covid-19 outbreak across the Pacific, from Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain on Wednesday 3 June. The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 294, an increase of two since last week, both in Guam. As the global and regional situation stabilises and the direct threat of Covid-19 recedes, Pacific countries are beginning to ramp up repatriation efforts. Thousands of agricultural and cruise ship workers, diplomats and officials, as well as people simply caught at the wrong place at the wrong time, are finally being afforded the chance to return. Some people in virus-free countries, such as Palau, remain ultra-cautious about any potential for infection by these new arrivals. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay has this report: New Zealand has reported a 12th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, as the government considers abandoning as early as next week all remaining restrictions on the country except stringent border controls. Just one person in New Zealand is still recovering from the illness, health officials said on Wednesday. They are not in hospital. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, with 22 deaths. \u201cEven though are in this very favourable position in New Zealand, there are record numbers of cases being reported globally every day,\u201d Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cThis pandemic continues apace outside our borders and we cannot afford to let our guard down.\u201d Currently, New Zealand has physical distancing measures and gathering limits of 100 people in place, although businesses and schools are open. The government will consider lifting those restrictions next Monday. Border restrictions would remain; only New Zealanders and their families can enter the country and must enter government-run quarantine for two weeks. Ukrainian football club Karpaty Lviv has been placed in quarantine after 25 people among the players and staff tested positive for the coronavirus, the country\u2019s Premier League said Tuesday. All those infected have self-isolated while the club was \u201cput in quarantine for at least two weeks,\u201d the league said in a statement. Training has been suspended. The next two games for the Lviv side, scheduled for mid-June, have been cancelled. Karpaty said that 65 people were tested for the coronavirus, and urged other clubs to view testing of its players and staff with \u201cutmost responsibility.\u201d A game set for last Sunday between Karpaty and Lviv had been cancelled after the first positive test results came back. A sports official told AFP under condition of anonymity that most of those who have the coronavirus have \u201cno symptoms\u201d. Ukrainian football matches restarted last weekend behind closed doors, as part of easing of the virus lockdown. Ukraine on Tuesday registered a total of 24,340 cases of the coronavirus, and 727 people died from the illness. Latvia said Tuesday it will drop coronavirus quarantine rules for travellers from more than 20 European countries, a move already adopted by its Baltic eurozone neighbours Estonia and Lithuania, AFP reports. Mandatory two-week self isolation will no longer apply to visitors arriving from \u201clow risk countries\u201d from Wednesday, Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins told reporters in the capital Riga. A free travel list published by Latvia\u2019s Centre for Disease Prevention and Control did not include countries like Sweden and Britain, where the rate of infection remains high. Borders with neighbouring Russia and Belarus will also remain sealed for passengers, but open to goods. With the pandemic believed to be virtually extinguished in Latvia, authorities plan to lift all emergency measures on 9 June. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania reopened their shared borders on May 15, becoming among the first in Europe to allow citizens free movement for business and pleasure after two months of restrictions. A country of 1.9 million people, Latvia has confirmed 1,071 cases of coronavirus, including 24 deaths. Health experts cast doubt on UK hopes for holiday \u2018air bridges\u2019 The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker and Jamie Grierson report: Public health experts and officials have warned that the idea of \u201cair bridge\u201d links between the UK and overseas holiday destinations may prove impossible this summer, amid continued concern over how they could operate safely. A number of Conservative MPs are pushing for air bridges \u2013 mutual agreements with other countries to allow travellers to fly in and out without coronavirus quarantine restrictions \u2013 ahead of the imposition of the UK\u2019s 14-day quarantine system next week. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is to announce how the quarantine process will work in a statement to the Commons on Wednesday, and is coming under significant pressure from Tory MPs to signal a willingness to implement air bridges amid fears over the new measures\u2019 effect on the tourism and hospitality sectors. Writing in Wednesday\u2019s Telegraph alongside the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, Patel said: \u201cWe owe it to the victims of Covid-19 to impose quarantine,\u201d arguing it was crucial and tourism would be up and running faster if tough measures were taken. In Japan, facilities have been warned against using devices that atomise hypochlorous acid to disinfect against coronavirus, The Mainichi reports: An increasing number of facilities in Japan are suspending use of devices to atomize hypochlorous acid solution as a disinfectant, which has been commonly been adopted by schools, day cares and public facilities to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, following a government call for caution. On May 29, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) introduced guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) stating that in indoor spaces, \u201croutine application of disinfectants to environmental surfaces by spraying or fogging (also known as fumigation or misting) is not recommended for COVID-19.\u201d ... METI is still evaluating the effectiveness of the solutions as a disinfectant on object surfaces contaminated with viruses. But misting of the solutions is not recommended in terms of effectiveness or safety. The true number of Covid-19 infections among inmates at Manhattan\u2019s federal lockup was likely about seven times what the Bureau of Prisons has previously publicly reported, a government lawyer conceded Tuesday. The bureau\u2019s website says five inmates at the Metropolitan Correctional Center have had the virus. But Assistant US Attorney Jean-David Barnea, representing the MCC\u2019s warden at a court hearing, said at least 34 inmates had been quarantined with symptoms because they were believed to have it, AP reports. Barnea made the revelation at a federal court hearing for a lawsuit that seeks court oversight over conditions for the nearly 800 inmates at the MCC. Despite conceding the number of virus cases was probably much higher than five, Barnea fought claims that the caseload could\u2019ve been more than a few dozen. The MCC has been able to keep the epidemic under control at the prison, he said, adding that no inmates have been found to have the virus since 23 April. The judge did not immediately rule. Lawyers for inmates estimated that 75 to 150 inmates infected by the coronavirus went largely untreated. Here is the full story on Mumbai bracing for a historic storm, ahead of which authorities in the financial capital, which is struggling to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, evacuated nearly 150 virus patients from a recently built field hospital to a facility with a concrete roof as a precautionary measure: It\u2019s enough to make your head swim: Zoom booms as teleconferencing company profits from coronavirus crisis The teleconferencing company Zoom has seen a massive increase in profits and has doubled its annual sales forecast, driven by a surge in users as more people work from home and connect with friends online during the coronavirus crisis, AP reports. The once-obscure Zoom Video Communications, which has rapidly emerged as the latest Silicon Valley gold mine, released financial results on Tuesday showing the astronomical growth that has turned it into a stock market star. Zoom\u2019s boom has come despite privacy problems that enabled outsiders to make uninvited and sometimes crude appearances during other peoples video conferences. Zoom\u2019s revenue for its fiscal first-quarter between February and April more than doubled from the same time last year to $328m, turning a profit of $27m compared with $198,000 a year ago. The numbers exceeded analysts already heightened expectations, providing another lift to a rocketing stock that has more than tripled in price so far this year. After a big run-up leading up to Tuesday\u2019s highly anticipated announcement, Zoom\u2019s stock gained nearly 3% in extended trading to $213.60 \u2013 more than five times the company\u2019s initial public offering price of $36 less than 14 months ago. British poverty campaigners have called for an emergency cash support scheme to help struggling low-income households after UK food bank charities reported that the first full month of coronavirus lockdown was their \u201cbusiest ever\u201d. The charities said their experience of record food bank use in April, following a huge surge in food aid in March, showed it was clear that current social security safety net measures were not enough to prevent poorer families being swept into destitution. The Trussell Trust, the UK\u2019s biggest food bank network, said it gave out 89% more food parcels in April, compared to the same month last year, while the Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan) recorded a 175% increase over the same period. The number of families with children who received food parcels almost doubled in April compared to the the same period last year, the Trussell Trust said, a rise it described as unprecedented. A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths. But Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed Covid-19 as a \u201clittle flu\u201d, again brushed off the tragedy on Tuesday. \u201cI regret each of the deaths - but that\u2019s everyone\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capitalBras\u00edlia. Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000. Rio de Janeiro has Brazil\u2019s second highest death toll with 5,686 deaths, followed by the northeastern state of Cear\u00e1 where 3,421 people have died. For all Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissiveness, scientists and medical experts believe the situation is dire and likely to get worse. \u201cNot even in our most dreadful nightmare could we have imagined the situation we are now in,\u201d Drauzio Varella, a doctor and broadcaster, wrote in one of Brazil\u2019s top newspapers last week. At least 100,000 people, including some coronavirus patients, were being moved to safer locations according to officials Tuesday, as India\u2019s west coast braced for a cyclone, the first such storm to threaten Mumbai in more than 70 years, AFP reports. Authorities in India\u2019s financial capital, which is struggling to contain the pandemic, evacuated nearly 150 Covid-19 patients from a recently built field hospital to a facility with a concrete roof as a precautionary measure, officials said. The chief minister of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, said people living in flimsy homes near the shore were being moved to safer places before Cyclone Nisarga makes its scheduled landfall on Wednesday afternoon or evening. \u201cSlum-dwellers... in low-lying areas have been instructed to evacuate,\u201d Uddhav Thackeray said in a message posted by his office on Twitter. In Maharashtra\u2019s Palghar district, more than 21,000 villagers were being evacuated, local media reported, citing officials. Indian meteorologists have warned of heavy rainfall - with winds of 100-110 kilometres (60-70 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 120 kph - causing damage to thatched huts, power lines and one to two metre-high (three to 6.5 feet) storm surges inundating low-lying areas of Maharashtra. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest global updates for the next few hours. As always, I\u2019d love to hear from you \u2013 please get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com with comments, questions and news tips from where you live. As India\u2019s West coast braces for what is expected to be its strongest cyclone in 70 years, authorities have moved 100,000 people to safer locations \u2013 including coronavirus patients. In Brazil, meanwhile, the death toll has passed the sombre milestone of 30,000 deaths, after a record increase of 1,262. The current toll is 31,199. Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has passed 6.3 million. According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,340,811 people are known to have been infected, while 378,359 are known to have died since the outbreak began. Brazil deaths pass 30,000. A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths. Yemen aid funding falls short by US$1bn. Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after a humanitarian fundraising summit raised only $1.35bn for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine. A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year. France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days. It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures. Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March. Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state. The pandemic is exposing \u201cendemic inequalities\u201d that must be addressed, according to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, who highlighted the protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd and data showing the crisis has had a worse impact on ethnic minority groups. The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive. The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock. A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week, Chinese state media reported. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, reportedly became China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks when he died on Friday after being treated for more than four months. Meanwhile, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map of the coronavirus for more than a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, according to an Associated Press report. The rise in unemployment slowed in Spain. The number of new jobseekers was close to 27,000 in May, about 10 times lower than in March and April during the country\u2019s lockdown, the labour ministry said.",
