I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the Guardian this morning.</p> \n<p>Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the world\u2019s richest man, had his phone \u201chacked\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince\">after receiving a WhatsApp message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia</a>, Mohammed bin Salman, sources have told the Guardian. The message, sent during a friendly exchange between the pair, contained a malicious file that enabled Saudi agents to exfiltrate data from Bezos\u2019s phone within hours of him receiving the message in May 2018, forensic analysis has concluded. Security experts working for Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post newspaper, only began examining his phone last January following the publication by the National Enquirer of a story about Bezos\u2019s affair with Lauren Sanchez.</p> \n<p>The revelation will increase unease in western capitals<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/revealed-the-saudi-heir-and-the-alleged-plot-to-undermine-jeff-bezos\"> about Saudi Arabia\u2019s aggressive targeting of its perceived enemies</a> after the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. It will also raise renewed questions about how the Enquirer, then owned by David Pecker, a media mogul with close links to Saudi Arabia and also Donald Trump, obtained Bezos\u2019s private text messages and why the publication appeared to be conducting a campaign against the Amazon boss.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Setbacks for Democrats \u2013 </strong>Hopes that moderate Republicans could help Democrats shift the rules of engagement in Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/democrats-trump-impeachment-trial-rules\">were dashed this morning</a>. In votes along party lines, the Senate rejected a series of attempts to subpoena witnesses and force the White House to produce evidence. The votes, which included a bid to force former national security chief John Bolton to give evidence, came amid fierce debate on the first day of the president\u2019s impeachment trial, which began when chief justice John Roberts brought down his gavel to begin proceedings shortly after 1pm Washington time. There could be renewed efforts by Democrats to bring forward witnesses but for now they have been frustrated by what one called a \u201ccover-up\u201d. Republicans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-day-one\">stuck with their party</a> despite pressure on senators such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/trump-impeachment-trial-key-senators-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins\">Mitt Romney and Susan Collins to shift ground</a>.

      "bodyText": "Nine people are confirmed to have died and at least 440 have been infected in the outbreak of a new Sars-like virus that was first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan less than a month ago. The World Health Organisation met on Wednesday to determine whether to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, after authorities in China confirmed the death toll had risen from six overnight. The US reported one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, designated 2019-nCoV, on Tuesday, and cases have also been confirmed in Korea and Thailand. It has also spread to 14 health workers in China, confirming human-to-human transmission. But health authorities say there is no cause for public concern in Australia. What is Australia doing? Medical staff from the New South Wales Health department will be stationed alongside biosecurity staff at Sydney airport to meet the thrice-weekly direct flight from Wuhan, conduct an initial diagnosis of any people on the flight who are exhibiting flu-like symptoms, and if necessary send them to Westmead hospital for testing. Authorities are also providing written information, in English and Chinese, to passengers on those flights about what to do if they develop respiratory symptoms. \u201cWe are meeting every passenger, providing information to them, asking them to declare if they have got any symptoms, but we know that an incubation period for a virus like this could be seven days,\u201d Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, told the ABC. He said temperature scanners would not be used because they did not detect infected people who had not yet developed a fever. \u201cWe know in our experience in swine flu and other epidemics that measuring temperature might pick up a few people but it also misses a lot of people, and it probably doesn\u2019t add anything to the biosecurity measures that we\u2019ve put in place,\u201d he said. What powers do health authorities have? Under Australian law airlines are obliged to report sick passengers to biosecurity staff before the plane is unloaded. Coronavirus has also been made a notifiable condition in NSW, which means the state government must be notified of suspected cases. It also means health providers can use powers under the Public Health Act 2010 to isolate or place into quarantine people who are suspected of having the virus, but are not complying with health or biosecurity officers. \u201cAlmost always we don\u2019t need to do that because people are very sensible and cooperative, but we do have powers, if need be, under the Public Health Act to control the spread of diseases,\u201d the NSW Health executive director, Dr Jeremy McAnulty, told reporters on Wednesday. Most people can be relied upon to self-report unless their symptoms are so mild as to be mistakenly dismissed as a common cold, said Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. \u201cMost people will self-report because they will be concerned,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cThey will know that they have come from an area of concern and people do not want to die of a serious disease.\u201d Murphy said reports from China showed there \u201cclearly seem to be a number of mild cases that just have a fever, a bit like a common cold\u201d. McAnulty said the virus did not appear to be as severe as Sars, but that it was \u201cprudent to be cautious until we learn more about this situation\u201d. MacIntyre said severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) had fatality rates of 12% and 26% respectively, while the fatality rate for the novel coronavirus was currently about 2% to 5%. But she stressed there was no formal published data yet. Will that work to prevent the disease spreading to Australia? One suspected case has been reported in Australia, but tests showed he did not have the coronavirus. Queensland health authorities confirmed on Tuesday that a man who had recently visited Wuhan had presented with respiratory symptoms. He was released from home isolation after Queensland Health said he no longer had flu-like symptoms, and on Wednesday afternoon it was reported that test results were negative for the virus. Australian authorities are still developing a rapid test for the virus. A laboratory in Melbourne has developed a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, using the virus sequence provided by Chinese authorities. The incubation period for the virus is up to seven days, which means some people could be asymptomatic when assessed at the airport. Murphy said authorities did not have a \u201cclear clinical picture\u201d of whether people were infectious before they developed symptoms. He told reporters on Tuesday that \u201cyou cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country\u201d. \u201cSo it\u2019s about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention,\u201d he said. Who is at high risk? Anyone is at risk who has recently been in Wuhan, or who has had close contact with someone who has been there, and has developed flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, sore throat, coughing or breathlessness. People who suspect they may have the virus are advised to ring ahead to their general practitioner or local hospital, so precautions can be taken to protect other patients from infection and appropriately triage the at-risk patient. The biggest risk to controlling the virus, MacIntyre said, was a failure to appropriately triage. \u201cWe really want to focus on the healthcare system and make sure that detection is improved,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want somebody sitting in the emergency department for three hours with a cough or fever and not being properly triaged.\u201d Hospitals and general practitioners have been provided with information and advice about the virus, but MacIntyre said failure to swiftly isolate at-risk patients could increase the spread of the infection. \u201cWe see failure of triage all the time in Australia, such as with measles,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have got to look at where you can make the biggest impact and if it\u2019s anything like the Sars and Mers outbreaks it\u2019s going to be hospitals that are at the highest risk of outbreaks.\u201d",

A forensic analysis implicated a WhatsApp account purportedly owned by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, which sent a large video file to Bezos in May 2018. It is \u201chighly probable\u201d, investigators found, that the file contained malware. Within hours, large amounts of data were exfiltrated from Bezos\u2019 phone. Dinner meeting.

A report by Human Rights Watch has found that guerrilla groups have supplanted state authorities on either side of the lawless border between Venezuela and Colombia, leaving citizens vulnerable to murder, kidnappings, child recruitment and rape. Press freedom activists are up in arms after the US journalist Glenn Greenwald was charged with cybercrimes in Brazil, for allegedly helping hackers who leaked cellphone messages between leading figures in a major corruption scandal.

South Korea has cut strips through a timid Olyroos defence to seal a 2-0 victory in their AFC U-23 Championship semi-final and deny Australia their first chance to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. Australia can still qualify for the Olympics if they beat Uzbekistan on Saturday. Media roundup Tourism executives say the \u201cworst summer on record\u201d has cost Australia $2bn already and could hit the industry for $4.5bn more, the Australian reports. Malcolm Turnbull has accused prime minister Scott Morrison of \u201cmisleading\u201d the public over climate change, writes the Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cI don\u2019t know why Scott Morrison has acted the way he has \u2026 I\u2019ve known him for 20 years and I can\u2019t explain his conduct.\u201d NSW MP Andrew Constance came out swinging against the Red Cross, Salvation Army and St Vincent De Paul for taking too long to distribute bushfire donations, states the ABC. Coming up NSW fire crews are bracing for the return of severe fire conditions with hot and windy weather forecast across much of the state. Nick Kyrgios will play Gilles Simon in the second round of the Australian Open tonight. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 What\u2019s the secret to the perfect espresso? Well forget long conversations with your local barista, because mathematicians reckon they\u2019ve found the formula. \u201cThe key to making the shot reproducible is you want the particles just large enough that the flow is uniform and predictable, but as small as they can be to maximise the surface area,\u201d research co-author Dr Jamie Foster.

UK infectious disease experts have doubled their estimate of the likely number of cases during the coronavirus outbreak to 4,000.</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s emergency committee met as the international spread of the virus became clear, following the diagnosis of cases in people who have travelled not only to other regions of China but also abroad.

The People\u2019s Daily newspaper tweeted that no one would be allowed to leave the city from 10am on Thursday and that train stations, the airport, city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance shuttle buses would be temporarily closed.</p> <p>Members of WHO\u2019s emergency committee, who praised China for its openness in sharing data and information, said that in circumstances where a new and infectious virus was circulating, they would recommend that mass gatherings should be avoided.</p> <p>Responding to the public transport ban, Dr Didier Houssin, chair of the committee, said: \u201cWe need some time to understand the specific measures that have been taken.\u201d The WHO team in China would be reporting overnight on developments.</p> <p>The committee said that the virus is mostly affecting older people, with 73% of patients over the age of 40. Nearly two-thirds (64%) are male and 40% of those who have died had underlying conditions that made them vulnerable to a new virus, such as heart disease or high blood pressure. This was typical of the coronaviruses, they said.
