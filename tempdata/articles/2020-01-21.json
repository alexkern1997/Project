      "bodyText": "Australia will begin screening passengers on high-risk flights from China for signs of a new Sars-like coronavirus following confirmation from the Chinese health authorities that the virus has begun spreading from human to human. The outbreak was first reported in Wuhan City in China on New Year\u2019s Eve and tied to a seafood market, but officials have since confirmed that it has spread to other humans who had not frequented the market, as well as to health workers. As of Tuesday, 220 people are confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus \u2013 a type of virus that spreads from animals to humans \u2013 and three people have died. Chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy announced the new screening measures on Tuesday, four days after saying additional screening at points of entry into Australia was unnecessary. A handful of cases of the new virus have been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Chinese cities other than Wuhan, all in people who had recently been in Wuhan. There are no confirmed cases of the disease in international travellers to Australia and a number of potential passengers have been assessed by state health authorities without the presence of the disease being confirmed, Murphy said. The new screening measures will focus on a direct flight from Wuhan City to Sydney, which flies three times a week. It will be met by Border Force staff and biosecurity officers from New South Wales Health from its next scheduled arrival on Thursday. \u201cThey will be providing to all the passengers an information pamphlet in English and Mandarin, outlining the symptoms this disease might deliver and asking them to identify themselves at the border. If anyone has a fever or suspect they might have this disease and if they are suspected of having this condition, New South Wales Health will follow up as per our normal border security and biosecurity protocols,\u201d Murphy said. The most common symptom is a high fever, but patients can also show other respiratory symptoms like coughing, a sore throat and breathlessness. Murphy said authorities were also conducting \u201ccareful modelling\u201d to determine which flights form China pose the highest risk and should also be met by biosecurity staff. This includes the 160 flights that fly directly from China to Australia each week, as well as hundreds more indirect flights. Information about the virus will be placed in Mandarin and English at all points of entry into Australia, and the Australian government will also target Chinese-language media. Murphy said temperature scanning at airports would not be reinstated because it was found during the 2009 swine flu pandemic to be \u201cineffective\u201d. One of the cases of the virus in Thailand was reportedly detected by an airport temperature scanner. \u201cIt missed a large number of cases ... cases that may be incubating or afebrile,\u201d he said. \u201cIt leads to a false sense of security. It\u2019s not an effective public health mechanism.\u201d He said Australia was well-prepared to diagnose, treat and isolate anyone suspected of having the disease, but that there was no failsafe way to keep it out of the country. \u201cThe important thing to remember is with border screening you cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe incubation period is probably a week.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally.</p> \n<p>State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople\u2019s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,\u201d said China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/coronavirus_spread-zip/giv-3902dSLCdIc1qXq4/\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus in China\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/coronavirus_spread-zip/giv-3902dSLCdIc1qXq4/\">Coronavirus in China</a> \n</figure> \n<p>The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s health ministry has confirmed human-to-human transmission of a mysterious Sars-like virus that has spread across the country and fuelled anxiety about the prospect of a major outbreak as millions begin travelling for lunar new year celebrations. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert and head of the national health commission team investigating the outbreak, confirmed that two cases of infection in China\u2019s Guangdong province had been caused by human-to-human transmission and medical staff had been infected, China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said on Monday. Authorities earlier reported 139 new cases of the new strain of coronavirus over the weekend, bringing the total number of infected patients to 217 since the virus was first detected last month in the central city of Wuhan. It was also confirmed on Tuesday that an 89-year-old man had died from the virus in Wuhan, bringing the number of fatalities to four. Cases were confirmed in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong province in the south, heightening fears ahead of the lunar new year holiday, when more than 400 million people are expected to travel domestically and internationally. State broadcaster CCTV said on Monday evening there were seven suspected cases in other parts of the country, including Shandong in the east, and the south-western provinces of Sichuan, Guangxi and Yunnan. Five people who travelled from Wuhan were also being treated for fevers in Zhejiang province. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,\u201d said China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, weighing in on the matter for the first time. The strain has caused alarm because of its connection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03. The current outbreak has spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea. A man was in isolation in Brisbane, Australia after being suspected of having the virus after he returned from a visit to Wuhan. China\u2019s National Health Commission said it had sent working groups to all provinces to oversee outbreak prevention, describing the situation as \u201ccontrollable\u201d. Hospitals in Shanghai and Beijing and in Zhejiang province have \u201ccomprehensively\u201d strengthened examination procedures. In Shenzhen, temperature checks have been put in place in airports, ports and railway stations. More than 100 patients with symptoms were waiting to be seen at the Xiehe hospital in Wuhan at 6am on Monday. \u201cIf you are coming now, you have to wait between three and four hours before you can see the doctors,\u201d a hospital worker said by phone. At a hospital in Chaoyang district in Beijing, patients were being given masks and forms to fill out, detailing any recent travel to Wuhan. A nurse said preventive measures were also being taken to protect doctors Coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people, and the outbreak in Wuhan has been linked to a now-closed seafood market where live animals were reportedly sold. The World Health Organization has said an animal source was \u201cthe most likely primary source\u201d of the outbreak, with \u201csome limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts\u201d. Researchers worry the number of infections has been severely underestimated. The WHO said it would convene an emergency meeting in Geneva on Wednesday to discuss whether the new coronavirus constituted an international health emergency. Xi Chen, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said the likelihood of human-to-human transmission had appeared large given how many cases were confirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see all these cases coming from animals at the same market,\u201d Chen said. For weeks, the only reported cases were in Wuhan and areas outside mainland China, prompting many people to question whether other cities were simply not reporting or testing for the virus.

Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/khan-attack-will-put-sentencing-and-release-of-terrorists-under-scrutiny\">was out on licence</a> when he murdered two people in Fishmongers\u2019 Hall, in central London before he was shot dead by police. The new measures will include lie-detector tests, a doubling of counter-terrorism specialised probation officers and closer monitoring and reporting requirements including polygraph tests, the Home Office and Ministry of Justice said in a joint announcement. An independent review of the way different agencies including the police, the probation service and the security services investigate, monitor and manage terrorist offenders will also be launched. Critics say the overhaul is too little, too late: \u201cAfter 10 years in government, a major overhaul now is actually an admission of failure,\u201d Diane Abbott says. She said cuts to policing had undermined the fight against terrorism.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump impeachment </strong>\u2013 The long-awaited trial of the president will kick off today at around 6pm UK time. Late last night the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/mitch-mcconnell-outlines-proposals-for-speedy-impeachment-process\">outlined his proposals</a> for a speedy trial and, he hopes, acquittal, with no guarantees about witnesses or new evidence. Democrats, who demanded votes on witnesses to be held straight away, branded McConnell\u2019s proposals a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d. Senators will debate the rules of the trial when they convene. Trump won\u2019t be there, as he is scheduled to give a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/donald-trump-impeachment-trial-senate\">key-note address at the Davos World Economic Forum</a> in Switzerland. The Guardian will have comprehensive coverage of the trial, including a live blog, details of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/20/what-are-trump-articles-of-impeachment\">articles of impeachment</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/trump-impeachment-trial-key-senators-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-susan-collins\">key senators who could cross the floor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/mitch-mcconnell-impeachment-trial-trump-who-is-senate-leader\">profiles of McConnell</a> and one of Trump\u2019s other key backers in the chamber, Lindsey Graham, who has promised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/21/lindsey-graham-senator-trump-bulldog-impeachment-trial\">not to \u201cpretend to be a fair juror\u201d.</a></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Dangerous moment\u2019</strong> \u2013 Conservative MPs have seized on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/bbc-faces-dangerous-moment-after-tony-halls-departure\">Tony Hall\u2019s departure as the BBC\u2019s director general in the summer</a> to call for an overhaul of funding and the licence fee. The former culture secretary, John Whittingdale called for a debate on the broadcaster\u2019s funding at its 2022 mid-term review. He wants Hall\u2019s successor to consider how the BBC can compete in the Netflix era. The combination of an unfriendly government and an ageing audience <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/20/tony-hall-gave-bbc-stability-but-failed-to-see-digital-crisis-ahead\">will likely give Hall\u2019s successor sleepless nights</a>. The mid-term review is likely to be used to discuss both the abolition of the license fee and decriminalisation of non-payment. Since Christmas, the former chair of Ofcom Patricia Hodgson has called for a subscription model to be introduced.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018I am not a spy\u2019 </strong>\u2013 The British-Australian academic, Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who is being held in prison in Iran, claims Tehran tried to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/21/jailed-british-australian-kylie-moore-gilbert-rejected-irans-offer-to-work-as-a-spy\">recruit her as a spy</a> in exchange for her release. In a letter to her \u201ccase manager\u201d that was smuggled out of prison, the Cambridge-educated academic wrote: \u201cPlease accept this letter as an official and definitive rejection of your offer to me to work with the intelligence branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\u201d She said she could not be persuaded under any circumstances to change her mind. \u201cI am not a spy.

Action on Sugar at the university found that the pre-mixed drinks sold in supermarkets contain up to nine teaspoons of sugar in just 250ml. \u201cIf consumers knew how much sugar was really in these drinks, would they still happily choose to drink their way to tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes?\u201d asked Katherine Jenner, the group\u2019s campaign director.

With the economic damage done by the devastating 2003 Sars virus still fresh in the mind of many traders, stocks were sold heavily on Tuesday and expectations grew that the markets were in for more falls in the days ahead. The fears across the region were particularly acute given the threat of contagion as hundreds of millions travel for the forthcoming lunar new year holidays when up to 400 million are expected to be on the move across China. The mood swing saw MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slip 1% after a steady start. Hong Kong, which suffered badly during the Sars outbreak, saw its index fall 2%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips 1.5%, with airlines under pressure.

The Sars outbreak claimed the lives of at least 650 people in China and Hong ong in 2002-03 and caused lasting economic damage and disruption. The impact on the Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index was not helped on Tuesday after Moody\u2019s said it had lowered its rating in a fresh blow to the financial hub, which is expected to have fallen into recession last year owing to the unrest as well as the China-US trade war. Investors had already been guarded after the International Monetary Fund trimmed its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a surprisingly sharp slowdown in India and other emerging markets. There had been some relief as Donald Trump and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron seemed to have struck a truce over a proposed digital tax. The two agreed to hold off on a potential tariffs war until the end of the year, a French diplomatic source said. Trump is due to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos later on Tuesday, and trade and tariffs could be on the agenda.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The hospital pressured the family to immediately cremate Huang\u2019s mother, but they refused, asking for more information. A few days later, they relented and workers from a funeral home, also in protective clothing, retrieved, cremated and buried her within a few hours, leaving the family no time to say goodbye. Afterwards, the staff disinfected the van they had travelled in and threw away their hazmat suits.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother\u2019s death was dealt with without any dignity,\u201d said Huang, 40, who did not want to give his or his mother\u2019s full name. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t even counted as a number on the government\u2019s list,\u201d he said, referring to the six people authorities say have been killed by the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902xYIlm2DBPhH3/\" data-alt=\"map\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/01/archive-zip/giv-3902xYIlm2DBPhH3/\">map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>China is on high alert as a new strain of coronavirus \u2013 first detected in Wuhan \u2013 spreads across the country.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>South Korea</h2> \n<p>At Incheon airport near Seoul, the only airport in South Korea with direct flights from Wuhan, authorities have been operating two special gates for passengers from the city since 3 January where officials use ear thermometers to check passengers\u2019 temperatures.
