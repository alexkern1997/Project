Italian football authorities have insisted matches be played behind closed doors this weekend and the Ireland Italy clash in the Six Nations rugby has been postponed. </p> <p>Bigger concerns, however, lie over the fate of this summer\u2019s prestige tournaments, particularly the men\u2019s European Football Championship in June and the Tokyo Olympics the month after.</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday declared \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in their plans. However Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at Oxford University who worked with the IOC during the Zika virus outbreak before the 2016 Rio Games, said that governing bodies will currently be contemplating their response to all possible scenarios, and who would be responsible should things go wrong.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the Japanese authorities and IOC are saying is that they fully intend to go ahead and that would be the right judgment at this stage\u201d, Dye told the Guardian. \u201cThe end of July is a long way away. We are not even two months into the [outbreak] and a lot of things have already happened. We have seen it spread across China and decline almost everywhere in China and in some parts at a dramatic rate.</p> <p>\u201cNobody knows what is going to happen by the summer but the sensible thing is to consider different scenarios. What the organisers will be asking is: what are the risks, the costs, the benefits and who will be responsible if something horrible happened?\u201d</p> <p>The European Championships are set to be held in 12 cities across the continent, which poses a different risk for the spread of the disease and, according to Dye. \u201cThe idea of controlling spread close to venues would essentially be an impossibility.</p> <p>\u201cThe issue of responsibility will be very important as well. What\u2019s happening in Italy at the moment will be one factor that will be taken into account. But Italy in February when it comes to April and May will look like relatively distant past.\u201d<br></p> <p>Day said he thought the likelihood of the coronavirus mutating into a stronger strain was unlikely this year but that the occurrence of victims testing positive after having apparently already recovered from the virus was concerning. <br><br>\u201cWe don\u2019t know why this has happened. It could be that the testing was not rigorous enough\u201d, he said. \u201cBut if it is the case that immunity is not long lasting then developing a vaccine for coronavirus will be more difficult\u201d.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-27T18:21:38.510Z\">at 6.21pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5800cd8f0811db2faffdeb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-27T17:51:18.169Z\">5.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The director of the Wellcome Trust has called for the world bank to spend $10bn on the crisis.</p> <p>Jeremy Farrar said an urgent commitment of $10bn (\u00a37.7bn), \u201cwith more to follow as needed,\u201d was \u201cessential\u201d from the World Bank to \u201cunderpin the public health measures in low- and middle-income countries, coordinated by the WHO alongside critical investment in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67702569475d5656c06b620043e8c4bd436b11ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67702569475d5656c06b620043e8c4bd436b11ed/0_120_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Farrar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Farrar</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Guttridge/The Francis Crick Institute</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He said:<strong> \u201c</strong>Anything less leaves us at risk of much greater costs later and long-term catastrophe.

The death toll from the Covid-19 in Iran rose to 26 today. </p> <p>\u201cI have already given the order to the maritime minister and the head of the coastguard to substantially increase the number of boats and patrols around the islands of the eastern Aegean,\u201d the centre right leader told his cabinet adding that patrols would be stepped up on both land and sea. \u201cOur islands are already overburdened with public health issues and they must be doubly protected.\u201d </p> <p>Athens had informed the European commission that it was taking the step. Under EU law a member state can elevate border security to the highest level if public health is threatened. </p> <p>Three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Greece. The first person to have contracted the virus \u2013 a 38-year-old female designer \u2013 was treated in hospital in Thessaloniki, the country\u2019s northern capital, on Wednesday, three days after returning from the Milan fashion show. Greek authorities announced that her nine-year-old son had also been infected, forcing the school he attends in Thessaloniki to shut down for the next two weeks. The boy had attended class on Monday and Tuesday before beginning to display symptoms yesterday. </p> <p>A third victim, described as a 40-year-old woman who had also travelled to Italy, was also confirmed to have contracted the potentially killer flu after being admitted to a specialist unit in a hospital in Athens earlier today. </p> <p>Media reports of supermarkets in Thessaloniki running out of essential goods as a result of panic buying have been rife. Mitsotakis kicked off the cabinet meeting calling for calm. \u201cThe biggest enemy in such situations is panic,\u201d he said emphasising the importance of personal hygiene and urging Greeks who may develop symptoms of the disease to follow health ministry guidelines. </p> <p>Earlier the country\u2019s health minister announced that carnival parades would be cancelled to prevent the disease spreading. Festivities were due to peak this weekend in the Orthodox nation. </p> <p>Greece has seen a renewed surge in refugee arrivals on its shores with some 42,000 asylum seekers now stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros facing Turkey. The Aegean isles have become the main gateway for illegal migration into the EU.

These are people who did not travel abroad, or were not linked to another known case. Health authorities are looking for the original source in these places \u2013 dubbed patient zero.

It will disrupt plans for millions of faithful from around the world who come to the kingdom to pray together. The decision illustrates how tense the situation is across the Gulf region and the wider Middle East as a whole largely as a result of the rise in the number of deaths and infections in Iran. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <h2>Schools shut in Japan</h2> <p>The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says he wants all elementary, middle and high schools nationwide to remain closed until spring holidays in late March.

In other countries people are being told to keep their kids home from school if they\u2019ve been anywhere near the growing number of zones worldwide hit by virus outbreaks. <br></p> <h2>Border controls</h2> <p>Germany is introducing new landing cards for people arriving from countries most hit by the virus. Pakistan halted flights to and from neighbouring Iran. Prague suspended flights from South Korea. Cyprus is adding more police and health workers at crossing points between the internationally recognised state in the south and a self-declared Turkish Cypriot state in the north.

The Dow Jones index of leading US shares has suffered its biggest points fall in history amid the coronavirus crisis, closing down 1,190.95 in New York. The Australian market plummeted on opening. Ireland and the Netherlands have reported their first cases of the virus. In the US Californian health officials are monitoring 8,400 people for symptoms after their arrival on domestic flights, but they have only an \u201cinadequate\u201d 200 test kits. The New York Times reported a US government whistleblower claiming health workers interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then mingled with the general population. There are 38 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France, more than doubling the tally in 24 hours. 50 Brits were among 130 guests told they can leave a coronavirus-hit Tenerife hotel. The death toll in Italy has reached 17. Facebook Inc said it would cancel its annual developer conference, F8 2020, amid rising concerns of the coronavirus outbreak. MSF has accused Italian authorities of discriminatory action after one of their search and rescue vessels in the Mediterranean was put under quarantine following the disembarkation of 276 passengers who had been rescued at sea. Coronavirus fears have driven the Australian market down for the fifth day running, with the benchmark ASX200 index dropping almost 3.2% shortly after the opening bell. Retailer Harvey Norman, which had experienced only very small falls this week, finally succumbed to selling pressure after releasing its half year results this morning. Within half an hour of the opening bell its shares tumbled 7.9%, the third biggest fall among ASX200 stocks. The company blamed \u201cwidespread bushfires and associated severe reductions in air quality that affected many communities\u201d that hit franchisees during the peak Christmas shopping season for a 4.1% fall in its profits for the six months to the end of December compared to the same time the previous year. Buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay, which has been something of a market darling, was the biggest loser in early trade, diving 9.4%. Also plunging were stocks with exposure to the Chinese market or international travel, both of which have been disrupted by the virus crisis. Online flight booking site Webjet and travel agency Flight Centre both fell more than 4%, national carrier Qantas dropped 3% and Air New Zealand, which is listed on the Australian exchange but is not part of the ASX200 index, was also down 3%. Also punished was Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest\u2019s Fortescue Metals, which exports iron ore to China. Its stock fell almost 5.8%. MSF has accused Italian authorities of discriminatory action after one of their search and rescue vessels in the Mediterranean was put under quarantine following the disembarkation of 276 passengers who had been rescued at sea. The Ocean Viking has 32 crew and one journalist aboard, and is among the search and rescue vessels which patrol for boats carrying migrants fleeing to Europe. MSF said the vessel had complied with all measures and had been anchored off Sicily for nearly five days, and accused authorities of \u201cdiscriminatorily applying\u201d quarantine restrictions to search and rescue vessels. Michael Fark, Head of Mission for Libya and Search and Rescue Operations said: \u201cQuarantining the Ocean Viking is equivalent to stopping an ambulance in the middle of an emergency. This is a discriminatory action \u2013 the only vessels that have been put into quarantine are those conducting rescues. In the past 48 hours we have had reports of boats in distress in the central Mediterranean. We are deeply worried about the fate of people travelling in them. Although we have fully complied with the preventive measures, we currently have no reason to suspect any of the crew onboard as having contracted, or having been exposed to, the virus. In compliance with a request from Italian authorities, the temperature and health status of all is being checked and reported by MSF medical team onboard twice daily. As the conflict in Libya escalates, migrants and refugees trapped in the country say they have no other choice but to risk their lives to escape across the Mediterranean. It is urgent for the Ocean Viking to go back to sea to rescue men, women and children from drowning. The legitimate public health concerns posed by Covid-19 should not be used to justify the prevention of saving lives as sea.\u201d It\u2019s a continuing fall after an immediate cut on opening. The ASX200 began the day at 6,657.90, and is currently on 6,540. Australia\u2019s ASX200 has taken an immediate cut on opening. But it is just an initial 1.5% and not all stocks have started trading yet. It is wait and see at the moment. Just picking one stock - Flight Centre. It was trading at $40.04 a share on close on Friday. This morning it\u2019s trading at $32.21 - that\u2019s a drop of nearly 20% Hello, this is Helen Davidson in Sydney picking up our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Many thanks to Sam Gelder and our London team for their work. I\u2019ll update you with a summary of the latest news shortly, but we are just waiting for the Australian stock market to open any minute, after big falls in New York. The Dow Jones index of leading US shares suffered its biggest points fall in history amid the coronavirus crisis, closing down 1,190.95 in New York. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland rose to nine on Thursday, as the canton of Basel-City put a number of children into a two-week quarantine after one of their caregivers tested positive for the virus. A young woman who returned to work at a daycare centre after travelling to Milan has tested positive for Covid-19, authorities said. \u201cThe young woman who resides in the canton of Basel-City is doing well given the circumstances,\u201d the region\u2019s health department said in a statement. \u201cAs a carer for children and young children working at a daycare in Riehen, she came into contact with many children. \u201cThe health department is now making extensive checks in the patient\u2019s professional and personal environment accordingly.\u201d Officials in California are scrambling to retrace the movements of a woman in the state who is believed to be the first person in the US to contract the coronavirus with no known connection to travel abroad or other known causes. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said on Thursday that the woman, who has not been identified, lives in Solano County in northern California. The county is home to Travis Air Force Base, where dozens of people infected in China or on cruise ships have been treated. But there was no evidence the woman had connections to the base. Over in sport, the final two stages of the United Arab Emirates Tour have been cancelled amid fears of a further outbreak of coronavirus, according to teams at the cycle race. Chris Froome, who is making his comeback from a career-threatening crash last year, Mark Cavendish and Adam Yates are among the riders who will now be tested for the virus. The New York Times is reporting that a US government whistleblower has claimed health workers interacted with Americans quarantined for possible exposure to coronavirus without proper medical training or protective gear, then mingled with the general population. As well as being the Dow\u2019s worst points fall ever, the index\u2019s 4.4% drop was its worst percentage fall in two years. Meanwhile the tech-focused Nasdaq index tumbled by 4.6%, its worst daily loss since 2011. Scott Minerd of financial services firm Guggenheim Partners told Bloomberg TV that the coronavirus outbreak \u201cis possibly the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my career\u201d, a time-span which includes the 1987 crash and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cThis has the potential to reel into something extremely serious,\u201d Minerd warned. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine a scenario where you can actually contain this, and so that\u2019s the thing that to me is very frightening.\u201d CNBC also reports that the Dow \u2013 which measures 30 large US companies \u2013 and the more broadly-based S&amp;P 500 were also on pace for their worst weekly performance since 2008. Through Thursday\u2019s close, the Dow was down more than 11% week to date while the S&amp;P 500 had lost 10.8%. The dramatic fall on Wall Street will have sent shivers through the Asia Pacific markets which open in the next 90 mins. Australia\u2019s ASX200 index is expected to take an early hit with indications of it opening more than 2% down. Japan and Hong Kong will likely follow. This is Wall Street\u2019s worst day in two years, reports CNBC: Thursday marked the Dow\u2019s biggest one-day points decline in history. Those losses put the Dow in correction territory, down more than 10% from its record close. It took the Dow just 10 sessions to tumble from its all-time high into a correction. Our business blog has been covering the gyrations in the market throughout the day. The Dow Jones index of leading US shares has suffered its biggest points fall in history amid the coronavirus crisis, closing down 1,190.95 in New York. Asian and Australian markets are also expected to fall. Three west German states have reported a total of 19 new cases of coronavirus, a day after the federal health minister said the country is at the start of an epidemic. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, the health ministry said on Thursday 14 more people had tested positive in the Heinsberg area, where a couple were the first confirmed cases in the state. The new cases took the total in Heinsberg to 20. All were isolated at home and did not require hospital treatment, the state\u2019s health ministry said. Further south, Baden-Wuerttemberg reported four new cases, taking its total to eight. The state of Rhineland-Palatinate also said on Thursday a man in Kaiserslautern had tested positive for the virus. \u201cThe male patient is doing well so far. He\u2019s in isolation,\u201d Rhineland-Palatinate\u2019s state government tweeted. On Wednesday, the federal government\u2019s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Germany was at the beginning of a coronavirus epidemic after new cases sprung up which could no longer be traced to the virus\u2019s original source in China. Our Ireland correspondent has more details on preparations in the Republic of Ireland: Confirmation that Northern Ireland\u2019s first case of coronavirus returned from northern Italy via Dublin airport has set off alarm bells in the Republic of Ireland. Authorities will try to swiftly retrace the patient\u2019s journey \u2013 where they sat on the plane, their movements through the airport, and how they travelled to Northern Ireland. Simon Harris, the health minister, says Ireland is prepared for an outbreak. But Michael O\u2019Dwyer, head of the department of anaesthesia and critical care at St Vincent\u2019s University hospital in Dublin, told the Irish Times on Thursday that Ireland would struggle to handle even a small number of severely ill patients because the main Dublin hospitals lack capacity for extra patients requiring intensive care. Even before disclosure of Northern Ireland\u2019s first case there was a question mark over St Patrick\u2019s festival events across the island. The St Patrick\u2019s Festival committee, which organises events from 13 to 17 March, said it would follow official guidance on risk assessment. \u201cWe have underscored the very urgent need for this documentation to be made available to the festival, so that an informed and prompt decision can be made regarding our forthcoming events. We have clarified to the relevant authorities our readiness to respond in whatever way is required of us in the best interests of public safety.\u201d The Netherlands has confirmed its first case of coronavirus. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health said in a statement the patient in the southern city of Tilburg had recently travelled in northern Italy and is now being treated in isolation. California health officials are monitoring 8,400 people for coronavirus symptoms after their arrival on domestic commercial flights, but the state had only a limited supply of test kits available, governor Gavin Newsom has said. The state currently has only about 200 test kits, an \u201cinadequate\u201d number, but has been in \u201cconstant contact with federal agencies\u201d that have promised to send a fresh supply of kits in coming days, he said at news briefing in Sacramento. California officials said 33 people had tested positive for the virus there, but five had since left the state. The state on Wednesday reported the first known case of the virus in the US of unknown origin. The patient had not recently traveled to an area with a reported outbreak, and was not exposed to another known infected person. The Republic of Ireland\u2019s health minister said the first case of coronavirus confirmed in Northern Ireland was \u201cnot unexpected\u201d. Simon Harris said: Given the evolving situation, this first case of Covid-19 disease was not unexpected. The National Public Health Emergency Team has been planning for this scenario since January. The general public should continue to adhere to the public health protocols issued by the Department of Health. Dr Tony Holohan, chief medical officer in the Department of Health, said: \u201cThe HSE is well prepared and is working to inform any contacts the patient had in order to prevent transmission.\u201d Facebook has cancelled F8, its annual conference for developers, because of Covid-19. Read the full story here. The NHS is rolling out new services to test people for coronavirus, including \u201cdrive through\u201d testing in west London. The service, provided by Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust in Parsons Green, is only available after a referral from NHS 111. It comes after the NHS\u2019 strategic incident director for coronavirus asked health services across the country to set up home and community testing. People are invited to an appointment in their car, where two community nurses carry out a swab in the nose and mouth. The patient is then asked to self-isolate while the swabs are assessed within 72 hours. The European Football Championship will kick off in Rome as planned, Uefa has insisted, despite the growing number of coronavirus cases in Italy. It comes as an unnamed professional footballer in the Italian third tier has tested positive for Covid-19. Read the full story here. Dr Michael McBride said the patient had recently returned from northern Italy. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it should cause a lot of concern (to the public). I think we should reassure the public as we have been doing all along. As the minister has said repeatedly it wasn\u2019t a case of if but when we would have a case in Northern Ireland. \u201cWe have now seen our first case in Northern Ireland \u2013 someone returning from northern Italy \u2013 and that is not unexpected.\u201d At a media briefing, Northern Ireland\u2019s Public Health Agency (PHA) confirmed testing of a patient had resulted in a presumptive positive test for coronavirus. The test outcome has now been sent to Public Health England laboratories for verification. The patient is receiving specialist care and PHA officials are working to identify any contacts the patient had to help prevent further spread. Northern Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said: \u201cWe have robust infection control measures in place which enable us to respond immediately. Our health service is used to managing infections and would assure the public that we are prepared.\u201d McBride said he would not disclose any personal details of the patient, or where they were being held. More information on the announcement there are now 38 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France, more than doubling the tally in 24 hours. During a press conference, the French health minister, Olivier Veran, said this \u201csharp increase\u201d from 18 cases on Wednesday was due to the identification of so-called \u201ccontact persons\u201d linked to previously known cases, adding that France was \u201cready\u201d for an epidemic. Health ministry director, Jerome Salomon, said out of the 38 cases, two people had died, 12 were cured and 24 were hospitalised, two of those being in a \u201cserious condition\u201d. Chief medical officer of Northern Ireland Michael McBride told journalists that the first confirmed coronavirus patient in the region had travelled from Italy via Dublin. France now has 38 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the French health minister has said. Sam Gelder here. I will be running the Guardian\u2019s live blog, updating you on the latest information surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any news tips, images or updates from your area then please do share it with me. Email: sam.gelder.casual@theguardian.com Northern Ireland has its first confirmed case of coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 16. Read the Guardian\u2019s summary of what to do here: I will be handing the live blog over to my colleague shortly. Here is a summary of the main news in the last three hours. \u2022 50 Brits were among 130 guests told they can leave a coronavirus-hit Tenerife hotel. Some 168 British nationals are among hundreds of guests being kept at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace in the south west of the Spanish island after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, tested positive for coronavirus. \u2022 The chief medical officer, professor Chris Whitty, said schools could shut for two months in the event of a pandemic. He was speaking about measures to reduce risk if the coronavirus outbreak reaches pandemic proportions. While noting that such an outcome was just one possibility, he said that there could be a \u201csocial cost\u201d if the virus intensifies seeing mass gatherings reduced and schools closed for more than two months. \u2022 A councillor has said Buxton is not in lockdown, amid reporting suggesting it was. Samantha Flower, a borough councillor for the Burbage area of Buxton, where a school has been closed due to the outbreak, said there was no sense of lockdown in the town but that there was confusion about the advice for anyone with symptoms. \u2022 The death toll in Italy reaches 17. Three more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, the Civil Protection Agency said. \u2022 Greece has announced that it will reinforce border patrols, citing the threat posed to the country of coronavirus being brought in by refugees and migrants desperate to reach Europe. Facebook Inc said it would cancel its annual developer conference, F8 2020, amid rising concerns of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIn place of the in-person F8 event, we\u2019re planning other ways for our community to get together through a combo of locally hosted events, videos and live streamed content,\u201d said Konstantinos Papamiltiadis, director of platform partnership. The conference, which attracted 5,000 people from around the world last year, was scheduled to be held on 5 -6 May at San Jose, California. NHS doctors have told the Guardian of their experiences of the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus, warning that they have concerns about how patients who may have been infected are being managed. James (not his real name), a GP in Derbyshire, where one of the latest British coronavirus cases is thought to have been located, described the Department of Health\u2019s response to the virus as \u201cridiculous\u201d and \u201cnegligent\u201d. He said none of his patients who had travelled back from at-risk countries had been given any information at airports or sea ports on what to do if they developed symptoms of coronavirus. James said his practice had seen patients arriving back from affected areas, some of whom had been on cruises around many regions experiencing coronavirus outbreaks, who had not been given any information on what to do if they developed symptoms.

Some 168 British nationals are among hundreds of guests being kept at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace in the south west of the Spanish island after at least four guests, including an Italian doctor, tested positive for coronavirus. Those who can leave are understood to have arrived on Monday, after the guests who were diagnosed had already left. Overall, 130 guests from 11 countries have been told they can leave by Spanish authorities. \u2018Please visit Chinatown\u2019: coronavirus fears empty San Francisco district Most days you can\u2019t walk through San Francisco\u2019s historic Chinatown without bumping into a tourist\u2019s extended arm, readying for a camera-phone photo. Lunchtime in particular is usually a bustling affair. But on a recent weekday at the height of the coronavirus pandemic that has dominated Asian countries across the Pacific Ocean, there was a noticeable absence of foot traffic. At the Dragon Gate on Grant Avenue, the entrance to Chinatown that is usually frequented for selfies, no one posed and no one snapped. The picturesque and Instagram-worthy red lanterns that hung between buildings went unphotographed, as did the bright mural of Bruce Lee and the ornate architecture. The erhu that an elderly gentleman played for no one outside Old Saint Mary\u2019s Cathedral practically echoed down the street. Read more here England has only 15 available beds for adults to treat the most severe respiratory failure and will struggle to cope if there are more than 28 patients who need them if the number of coronavirus cases rises, according to the government and NHS documents. Ministers have revealed in parliamentary answers that there are 15 available beds for adult extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment at five centres across England. The government said this could be increased in an emergency. There were 30 such beds in total available during the 2018-19 winter flu season. But an NHS England document prepared in November 2017 reveals the system will struggle to cope if more than 28 patients need the treatment, describing that situation as black/critical. Thanks to everyone who has been emailing and messaging me. I am now moving into my last hour running the Guardian\u2019s live blog and your insight has been really useful. If you have any news tips, images or updates from your area then please do share them with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: We are urgently seeking clarification from the Canary Island authorities following their announcement that 130 tourists of different nationalities will be granted permission to leave the Costa Adeje Palace Hotel. We continue to offer support to all British nationals at the hotel. US officials are ramping up efforts to guard Americans against a local spread of the new coronavirus, dispatching test kits nationwide, and promising funding legislation within the next two weeks. At least 40 public health labs should now be able to test specimens for coronavirus and that could more than double by Friday, health and human services secretary Alex Azar told a House of Representatives committee. He said a newly manufactured test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be sent to 93 public health labs as soon as Monday, and a privately manufactured test based on the new CDC test could be sent to those same labs as early as Friday. Three more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, bringing the death toll from the worst outbreak of the illness in Europe to 17, the Civil Protection Agency said. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 650, officials said, from 528 announced at a news conference some seven hours earlier. The vast majority are in the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto. The virus is beginning to have an effect on sporting events and organisations. Italian football authorities have insisted matches be played behind closed doors this weekend and the Ireland Italy clash in the Six Nations rugby has been postponed. Bigger concerns, however, lie over the fate of this summer\u2019s prestige tournaments, particularly the men\u2019s European Football Championship in June and the Tokyo Olympics the month after. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Wednesday declared \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in their plans. However Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at Oxford University who worked with the IOC during the Zika virus outbreak before the 2016 Rio Games, said that governing bodies will currently be contemplating their response to all possible scenarios, and who would be responsible should things go wrong. \u201cWhat the Japanese authorities and IOC are saying is that they fully intend to go ahead and that would be the right judgment at this stage\u201d, Dye told the Guardian. \u201cThe end of July is a long way away. We are not even two months into the [outbreak] and a lot of things have already happened. We have seen it spread across China and decline almost everywhere in China and in some parts at a dramatic rate. \u201cNobody knows what is going to happen by the summer but the sensible thing is to consider different scenarios. What the organisers will be asking is: what are the risks, the costs, the benefits and who will be responsible if something horrible happened?\u201d The European Championships are set to be held in 12 cities across the continent, which poses a different risk for the spread of the disease and, according to Dye. \u201cThe idea of controlling spread close to venues would essentially be an impossibility. \u201cThe issue of responsibility will be very important as well. What\u2019s happening in Italy at the moment will be one factor that will be taken into account. But Italy in February when it comes to April and May will look like relatively distant past.\u201d Day said he thought the likelihood of the coronavirus mutating into a stronger strain was unlikely this year but that the occurrence of victims testing positive after having apparently already recovered from the virus was concerning. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why this has happened. It could be that the testing was not rigorous enough\u201d, he said. \u201cBut if it is the case that immunity is not long lasting then developing a vaccine for coronavirus will be more difficult\u201d. The director of the Wellcome Trust has called for the world bank to spend $10bn on the crisis. Jeremy Farrar said an urgent commitment of $10bn (\u00a37.7bn), \u201cwith more to follow as needed,\u201d was \u201cessential\u201d from the World Bank to \u201cunderpin the public health measures in low- and middle-income countries, coordinated by the WHO alongside critical investment in diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines.\u201d He said: \u201cAnything less leaves us at risk of much greater costs later and long-term catastrophe. The sums are considerable. The decision to release funds should not be taken lightly, but the stakes could not be higher.\u201d Farrar said what was missing in the global response was tangible, high-level funding and support from global financial institutions including the World Bank, Regional Development Banks and the International Monetary Fund. \u201cThe possible impact of this coronavirus is far beyond a health emergency \u2013 it\u2019s a global crisis with potential to reach the scale of the global financial crisis of 2008,\u201d he said. The coronavirus outbreak will cost world tourism at least $22bn (\u00a317bn) owing to a drop in spending by Chinese tourists, said the head of the World Travel and Tourism Council. The Covid-19 epidemic has killed more than 2,760 people, mostly in China \u2013 where it first emerged in December \u2013 and infected more than 81,000 in over 45 countries. \u201cIt is too soon to know but the WTTC has made a preliminary calculation in collaboration with (research firm) Oxford Economics which estimates that the crisis will cost the sector at least $22bn,\u201d Gloria Guevara told El Mundo daily. \u201cThis calculation is based on the experience of previous crises, such as Sars or H1N1, and is based on losses deriving from Chinese tourists who have not been travelling in recent weeks,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese are the tourists who spend most when they travel.\u201d The loss figure is the most optimistic scenario envisaged by the study which was published on 11 February by Oxford Economics, taking the hypothesis of a 7% drop in overseas trips by Chinese nationals. But the losses could more than double, reaching as much as $49bn if the crisis lasts as long as the Sars outbreak, which erupted in November 2002 and was brought under control in July 2003. Schools have been issued with advice on coronavirus by Health Protection Scotland. Guidance sent out on Thursday was given as two more people were diagnosed with the infection in England \u2013 taking the total to 15. The outbreak of this strain of coronavirus started in the Chinese city of Wuhan earlier this month and has killed 2,747 people in the country. The guidance was sent to directors of education in local authorities to prep staff on preventing the spread of infections, courses of action if staff or pupils become unwell and resources on hygiene techniques. Schools will also be advised on how to deal with people returning from affected areas, similar to what has already been released to the public. Colleges and universities also received the guidance, along with independent schools. The education secretary, John Swinney, said: This guidance has been circulated to schools, colleges, universities and early learning and childcare providers in Scotland following general guidance on basic preventative measures against coronavirus issued earlier in the month. Advice to people returning from affected countries will depend on which regions they have visited and will be updated as the situation changes, so we\u2019re asking members of the public to stay up to date with the latest health and travel advice. We are well-prepared for an outbreak in Scotland but the public also has a vital role to play in helping us contain any positive cases by keeping themselves informed and following basic hygiene precautions such as hand-washing and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. There have still not been any confirmed cases in Scotland of the virus, although the Scottish Government and NHS expect diagnoses to come, with preparation work already being carried out. The leader of Derbyshire county council, Barry Lewis, has written a blog update on the situation in Buxton: I\u2019m sure you will be well aware of the coronavirus which not so long ago seemed like something that was happening a long way from Derbyshire and probably wouldn\u2019t touch our lives in any major way. Unfortunately I can tell you that we do now have a confirmed case in Derbyshire. I can\u2019t say too much about the case, that\u2019s in the hands of Public Health England. But what I can say is that all agencies including the county council and its public health staff are working very closely and extremely hard to contain the virus and keep us all safe. I must emphasise to all our residents that the risk remains low. If you\u2019re worried, there\u2019s loads of information on the NHS website \u2013 go to www.nhs.uk/coronavirus. And, we\u2019ll be keeping the council\u2019s website up to date with the latest information too at www.derbyshire.gov.uk/coronavirus Robert Largan, MP for the High Peak \u2014 which includes Buxton \u2013 described claims that the town was on lockdown as \u201creally unhelpful\u201d. He added: \u201cA primary school and a doctors temporarily closing does not constitute a \u2018lockdown\u2019. More responsible journalism please.\u201d The Buxton Opera House insisted it was going ahead with its performance of Fascinating Aida tonight, and the Buxton Taphouse pub and Hydro cafe said it was business as usual. Samantha Flower, a borough councillor for the Burbage area of Buxton, where a school has been closed due to the outbreak, said there was no sense of lockdown in the town but that there was confusion about the advice for anyone with symptoms. Flower said: \u201cWe\u2019re not locking down. Until they tell us to cut off the town we\u2019re not doing that. We have got to take proper advice from the medical profession and they\u2019re being very calm about it. This is a very rural community and people see themselves as quite tough, rugged individuals \u2013 they\u2019re not the sort of people to panic over a sniffle.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s a small community \u2013 we all know each other, we all use the same shops \u2013 but nobody knows if they have been in direct contact [with the confirmed Coronavirus patient].\u201d Flower said that people in Buxton that have the symptoms aren\u2019t able to get through to speak to someone on 111 and end up being told just to go to the website. \u201cThe problem is people aren\u2019t able to directly speak to anyone. If you call the GP they say to ring 111 and no-one can say for certain if they were in direct contact with the parent and the child that had it. There\u2019s a bit of confusion. People are thinking if they have all these symptoms do I just stay at home and lockdown and then call for help? They\u2019re not sure what to do.\u201d Flower said she had been told that Buxton Medical Practice would reopen on Friday and had been deep-cleaned as news of the confirmed case emerged. \u201cI don\u2019t want people to be overly concerned,\u201d she said. \u201cA little bit more information would be helpful because we\u2019d like to know what happens when you can\u2019t say for certain if you\u2019ve been in direct contact with someone [carrying the virus]. It\u2019s going to be happening around the UK now. Everyone will have to be careful.\u201d Thanks to everyone who has been emailing and messaging me. I am running the Guardian\u2019s live blog and so far your insight has been really useful. If you have any news tips, images or updates from your area then please do share them with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Merlin Entertainments, which owns Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Legoland and other popular attractions, said it has \u201crestricted\u201d its employees\u2019 travel to countries with a high risk of coronavirus and has introduced \u201cenhanced cleaning regimes\u201d on its sites. Legoland is closed for winter and will reopen in mid-March, with Alton Towers and Thorpe Park due to open closer to the end of March. A Merlin spokesman said: \u201cThe health and safety of our guests and our staff is always our top priority and we will take all necessary precautions to ensure their continued welfare. \u201cWe have restricted employee travel to higher-risk countries, implemented enhanced cleaning regimes at our attractions, and informed our teams of coronavirus symptoms as well as the importance of good hygiene practices. \u201cLike many businesses, we continue to monitor the situation closely and are in regular contact with local authorities so we may respond quickly to any developments.\u201d Merlin\u2019s brands also include the London Eye, Madame Tussauds, Shrek\u2019s Adventure! London and the Blackpool Tower In the US, the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, on Thursday said that at least 40 public health labs could currently test specimens for coronavirus and the figure may more than double by Friday. Azar, speaking before the House Ways and Means Committee, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had tested 3,625 specimens for the virus as of this morning. He said at least 40 labs currently had test kits previously manufactured by the CDC that were modified to test for coronavirus. He added that a newly manufactured CDC test could be sent to 93 public health labs as soon as Monday, and a privately manufactured test based on the new CDC test could be sent to those same labs as early as tomorrow, pending FDA clearance. Downing Street defended the response to the situation at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: The Foreign Office has been in contact with more than 100 British nationals who are staying in the hotel. They are providing them with support, they are also in regular contact with local authorities and tour companies to share information. The quarantine is being managed by the Spanish authorities. We understand that those guests who have been assessed by medical staff and who are not showing symptoms are free to move around within the hotel. Pressed on whether there would be an evacuation flight for Britons, the spokesman said: \u201cWe base all our decisions on medical and scientific advice and everything is kept under review.\u201d Regarding the potential cancelling of mass events in the event of an intensified virus spread, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Nuffield Trust Summit: \u201cWe do want to minimise social and economic disruption subject to keeping people safe. He added: \u201cOf course that is always going to be a balance. We\u2019re going to be led by the scientific advice into what works.\u201d The minister of health in Tenerife has said 130 of the estimated 700-plus tourists at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel can leave. They spent three days in isolation after the coronavirus was detected there in four Italian tourists. The minister said there were 11 nationalities among the group. None of the remaining guests at a hotel have shown any symptoms of the virus, a spokesman for the regional government said. It appears that the 130 will be made up of those who arrived at the hotel after the four Italians who tested positive had already left. Most of these weren\u2019t holidaying at the hotel, but arrived when their flights home were cancelled due to a sandstorm. One of these is Harley Mitford, who is in the hotel with his sister and stepfather. They arrived when their BA flight home was cancelled after a holiday in a nearby villa. Despite the announcement, Mitford said that his family hadn\u2019t received any information about the departure, but had seen the announcement on the news. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been told anything, I just asked at reception and they gave us the usual runaround,\u201d he said. Chris Whitty has been speaking about measures to reduce risk in the event that coronavirus outbreak reaches pandemic proportions. While noting that such an outcome was just one possibility, he said that there could be a \u201csocial cost\u201d if the virus intensifies seeing mass gatherings reduced and schools closed for more than two months. He said: One of the things that\u2019s really clear with this virus, much more so than flu, is that anything we do we\u2019re going to have to do for quite a long period of time, probably more than two months. \u201cThe implications of that are non-trivial, so we need to think that through carefully. \u201cThis is something we face as really quite a serious problem for society potentially if this goes out of control. It may not but if it does globally then we may have to face that.\u201d Whitty also said that the UK would inevitably be affected in the event of a global epidemic. If this becomes a global epidemic then the UK will get it, and if it does not become a global epidemic the UK is perfectly capable of containing and getting rid of individual cases leading to onward transmission. \u201cIf it is something which is containable, the UK can contain it. If it is not containable, it will be non-containable everywhere and then it is coming our way.\u201d Greece has announced that it will reinforce border patrols, citing the threat posed to the country of coronavirus being brought in by refugees and migrants desperate to reach Europe. Outlining the emergency measure at the end of a cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said he had ordered frontier security to be put \u201con the highest alert\u201d because there was a risk that asylum seekers from Iran and Afghanistan could import the virus when they arrived on outlying islands in rickety boats from Turkey. The death toll from the Covid-19 in Iran rose to 26 today. \u201cI have already given the order to the maritime minister and the head of the coastguard to substantially increase the number of boats and patrols around the islands of the eastern Aegean,\u201d the centre right leader told his cabinet adding that patrols would be stepped up on both land and sea. \u201cOur islands are already overburdened with public health issues and they must be doubly protected.\u201d Athens had informed the European commission that it was taking the step. Under EU law a member state can elevate border security to the highest level if public health is threatened. Three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Greece. The first person to have contracted the virus \u2013 a 38-year-old female designer \u2013 was treated in hospital in Thessaloniki, the country\u2019s northern capital, on Wednesday, three days after returning from the Milan fashion show. Greek authorities announced that her nine-year-old son had also been infected, forcing the school he attends in Thessaloniki to shut down for the next two weeks. The boy had attended class on Monday and Tuesday before beginning to display symptoms yesterday. A third victim, described as a 40-year-old woman who had also travelled to Italy, was also confirmed to have contracted the potentially killer flu after being admitted to a specialist unit in a hospital in Athens earlier today. Media reports of supermarkets in Thessaloniki running out of essential goods as a result of panic buying have been rife. Mitsotakis kicked off the cabinet meeting calling for calm. \u201cThe biggest enemy in such situations is panic,\u201d he said emphasising the importance of personal hygiene and urging Greeks who may develop symptoms of the disease to follow health ministry guidelines. Earlier the country\u2019s health minister announced that carnival parades would be cancelled to prevent the disease spreading. Festivities were due to peak this weekend in the Orthodox nation. Greece has seen a renewed surge in refugee arrivals on its shores with some 42,000 asylum seekers now stranded on Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros facing Turkey. The Aegean isles have become the main gateway for illegal migration into the EU. The seven-month old centre right government has taken a much tougher stance on the issue of migration than its leftist predecessor. Some 130 people quarantined at a hotel in Tenerife are being allowed to leave, Sky news has reported. They are a number of 700 people \u2013 many of whom remain \u2013 who were in lockdown after an outbreak. Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian\u2019s live blog, updating you on the latest information surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any news tips, images or updates from your area then please do share them with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has said while the coronavirus presents \u201csome challenges\u201d, he does not think the world is facing anything on the level of the deadly Spanish flu in 1918. Speaking to health professionals at the Nuffield Trust Summit in Windsor, Prof Whitty said: \u201cOccasionally things come along which, no matter how good your strategic aim is, will knock you off course for a while. \u201cWe are not heading into a H1N1 1918 flu pandemic situation, but the coronavirus does present some challenges for us. It definitely will for a period. How big remains to be seen.\u201d The H1N1 influenza pandemic in 1918 is estimated to have killed at least 50 million people worldwide. The outlook in Europe. Here is an overview of countries affected, including where people have died and what precautions are being taken. Italy Italy is by far the European country worst affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, with 14 deaths and 528 infections. The area most hit has been northern Italy. Germany In Germany, 26 people have been infected, including 10 diagnosed since Tuesday. Fourteen of the 26 work for an equipment manufacturer in Bavaria, and were infected by a colleague returning from China. Several hundred people are quarantined in their homes. France France has so far registered 18 infections and two deaths, and has urged its nationals to delay travel to virus hotspots in northern Italy. Students returning from China, Singapore, South Korea and the Italian regions of Lombardy and Veneto are asked to remain at home for two weeks after their return. Spain The country has registered 17 cases \u2013 15 of them since Monday. Twelve are linked to Italy. They include four Italians who were visiting Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The hotel where they were staying has been quarantined. Three cases have been registered on the Spanish mainland, including one man in serious condition in the Madrid region. Britain So far there have been 15 recorded cases, including two announced on Thursday. One patient had been in Italy and the other in Tenerife. The government has requested travellers returning from affected areas in northern Italy, China, South Korea and Iran to isolate themselves and inform authorities. Switzerland Four cases have been resistered since Tuesday, including a man in his 70s who was infected near Milan. Russia Two infected Chinese citizens have been treated in Russia, which has also repatriated and quarantined eight passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, of whom three have tested positive. Austria A 72-year-old man in Vienna tested positive on Thursday, making him Austria\u2019s third case after an Italian couple, both 24, tested positive on Tuesday. Croatia Three people have tested positive for the virus, including a young man who recently stayed in Italy and his brother. Greece It has announced three cases, all Greeks who had recently returned from northern Italy. Athens announced its first infection Wednesday, a woman aged 38. Two more were announced on Thursday, including a 10-year-old. All three affected are Greek nationals. Finland Two virus infections were confirmed Wednesday, a Chinese tourist in Lapland and a second case involving a Finnish national who had recently visited northern Italy. Sweden There have been two cases so far. One was registered at the end of January: a woman who had visited Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged in December. On Wednesday, a second infection was discovered in a man returning from northern Italy. Belgium has had one case detective and Denmark announced its first case on Thursday. Georgia on Wednesday announced the first confirmed case in the South Caucasus region. In North Macedonia there has been one case, a woman who recently returned from Italy. Norwegian health authorities announced on Wednesday the first case in the Nordic nation in someone who returned from China last week. They said the patient was not in danger. Lastly, Romania reported its first on Wednesday \u2013 a man who was in contact with an Italian who visited the country last week. In Estonia, the first case of confirmed new coronavirus was found on Wednesday evening, social affairs minister, Tanel Kiik, said Thursday. The European Union is bracing for the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic but it is still too early to estimate the magnitude, the bloc\u2019s commissioner for the internal market said. Tourism is already feeling the pinch because \u201cour Chinese friends haven\u2019t been coming to Europe for two months\u201d, Thierry Breton told a news conference. He said supply chains reliant on China, including for the auto, medical, electronic, wood and toy industries, were also being affected. The commissioner spoke after a Brussels meeting of EU economy ministers. If the disruptions continue, the EU stands ready to deploy economic support measures for virus-hit sectors after another ministerial meeting next month, Breton said. But for now \u201cit\u2019s too early to say\u201d what measures would entail or \u201cmeasure the precise impact\u201d on Europe\u2019s economy. Italy is the hardest-hit member state, with an outbreak in its economically important north responsible for a dozen Covid-19 deaths. At a briefing for journalists, EU officials said the bloc was currently in a \u201ccontainment phase\u201d of identifying infection cases and coordinating on preparedness plans. One official said the EU was well-prepared and that, while other clusters such as that in Italy may well occur, overall the risk to the bloc was no more than \u201cmoderate\u201d because of member states\u2019 capacities to respond. Closing Europe\u2019s borders \u2013 either its external borders or its internal, passport-free Schengen borders \u2013 was not seen as advisable or effective, the officials said. However, there was a possibility that authorities might soon look at cancelling \u201cmass gathering events\u201d such as sporting fixtures. Moscow\u2019s mayor has asked China to respect the measures the city is taking to prevent the spread of the coronavirus after China\u2019s embassy complained about disproportionate action against Chinese nationals. The embassy this week deplored what it described as the \u201cubiquitous monitoring\u201d of Chinese nationals on Moscow\u2019s public transport network in a formal complaint sent to local authorities and leaked to Russian media. But Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, defended the measures on Thursday and urged the Chinese embassy to encourage its citizens in Moscow to comply with the quarantine measures. \u201cI ask that you relate with understanding to these necessary measures, which are aimed at preventing coronavirus infections from spreading,\u201d Sobyanin wrote in a response to the embassy, the Interfax news agency reported. Hundreds of people have been quarantined across Russia, which has barred many categories of Chinese nationals from entering the country. Authorities in Moscow have carried out raids on potential carriers of the virus and used facial recognition technology to enforce quarantine measures. Russia has also barred many categories of Chinese nationals from entering the country. Three Russian nationals are receiving treatment in Russia after they contracted the virus on a cruise ship in Japan, the authorities have said. Two Chinese nationals were also treated in hospital in Russia for the virus, but they have since recovered and been discharged. A growing number of countries are reporting cases of the new coronavirus, with governments looking for solutions as everyday life around the globe is disrupted. Here are some of the latest developments: Hunting for patient zero From California to Italy and beyond, more cases are popping up with no clear origin. These are people who did not travel abroad, or were not linked to another known case. Health authorities are looking for the original source in these places \u2013 dubbed patient zero. They are using what\u2019s called contact tracing, or finding all the people the patients were in contact with them. Foreign pilgrims banned from visiting Islam\u2019s holiest shrines Saudi Arabia has made this move, changing the face of this years annual hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. It will disrupt plans for millions of faithful from around the world who come to the kingdom to pray together. The decision illustrates how tense the situation is across the Gulf region and the wider Middle East as a whole largely as a result of the rise in the number of deaths and infections in Iran. Schools shut in Japan The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, says he wants all elementary, middle and high schools nationwide to remain closed until spring holidays in late March. Japan now has more than 900 cases, including hundreds from a quarantined cruise ship. In other countries people are being told to keep their kids home from school if they\u2019ve been anywhere near the growing number of zones worldwide hit by virus outbreaks. Border controls Germany is introducing new landing cards for people arriving from countries most hit by the virus. Pakistan halted flights to and from neighbouring Iran. Prague suspended flights from South Korea. Cyprus is adding more police and health workers at crossing points between the internationally recognised state in the south and a self-declared Turkish Cypriot state in the north. But EU officials insisted that the virus does not stop at borders, saying that if a case is identified at the border, it\u2019s probably too late and the spread is likely anyway. Now that there are more cases being reported outside China than inside, Chinese authorities are eager to shed the virus stigma and questions about its early handling of the epidemic. President Xi Jinping said on Thursday: \u201cWe have the confidence, the ability and the certainty to win this war against the epidemic.\u201d And the Chinese respiratory disease specialist Zhong Nanshan predicted China\u2019s outbreak should be \u201cbasically under control\u201d by the end of April. He credited strong measures taken by the government and the work of medical workers for helping curb the spread. In an update addressed to parents on its website, Dulwich Prep school said that as well as the two pupils who returned from a half-term holiday in one of the Category 2 areas and \u201chave since become unwell\u201d, it had been made aware of \u201cother families within our school community where a parent has been asked to self-isolate by their employer\u201d. It said the two pupils were unrelated and from different sections of the school. The pupils had contacted NHS 111, self-isolated and were awaiting the results of tests. There would be a \u201cprofessional deep clean\u201d of the site to be completed by Friday and staff were preparing lessons and assignments to be delivered via online platforms in case the school remained closed beyond Monday morning. \u201cWe hope to reopen on Monday 2 March but will publish details as soon as we hear the results of the tests being conducted on our pupils that have fallen ill. However, if either of our pupils test positive for Covid-19 we will remain closed for a longer period while the school undergoes a full deep clean.\u201d Shares of Microsoft Corp fell more than 4% after the company warned of weakness in PC business due to a hit to its supply chain from the coronavirus outbreak. The company echoed similar statements from Apple Inc and HP. The drop in share price wiped nearly $50bn from Microsoft\u2019s market value on a day when broader markets were down more than 2%. The virus has so far infected about 80,000 people, killed nearly 2,800 and spread to 44 countries, after originating in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Apple was the first big technology firm to say the virus was affecting its production and demand in China. PayPal Holdings Inc and Mastercard Inc have also warned about a possible hit. Several Wall Street analysts expect other technology companies with heavy presence in China to soon come out with their own statements. Governments from Iran to Australia shut schools and cancelled big events as they battled to contain the coronavirus outbreak. For the first time, new infections reported around the world surpassed those in mainland China, where the flu-like disease emerged two months ago from an illegal wildlife market. It is now on the decline in the country after an aggressive containment campaign. In Japan, where cases rose to 200, there was particular concern after a female tour bus guide tested positive for a second time \u2013 one of very few worldwide to do so. Big gatherings have been halted in Tokyo, Japan\u2019s capital, but it still plans to go ahead with the 2020 Olympics, whose cancellation or relocation would be a massive blow for the country. \u201cThis virus has pandemic potential,\u201d the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. \u201cThis is not a time for fear. This is a time for taking action to prevent infection and save lives now.\u201d Lebanon health ministry confirms third case of coronavirus, NNA reports. One of London\u2019s top private schools, Dulwich Prep London, has said it will be closing for a few days \u201cas a precautionary measure\u201d after two students returned from Italy feeling unwell. Paul Reid, director general of the Health Service Executive, has outlined what is being done to keep Ireland in the \u201ccontainment phase\u201d. He has been speaking at a briefing. Hello everyone. I will be running the Guardian\u2019s live blog, updating you on the latest information surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. If you have any news tips, images or updates from your area then please do share it with me. Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist The new coronavirus epidemic is at a \u201cdecisive point\u201d globally, the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, urging affected countries to \u201cmove swiftly\u201d to contain the disease. \u201cWe\u2019re at a decisive point,\u201d Tedros told reporters in Geneva. \u201cIf you act aggressively now, you can contain this virus, you can prevent people getting sick, you can save lives.\u201d \u201cThere does not appear to be widespread community transmission,\u201d he added. Tedros emphasised that all countries should ensure their health systems were prepared for an outbreak. \u201cWe are actually in a very delicate situation in which the outbreak can go in any direction based on how we handle it,\u201d he said. The World Health Organization said that as of 6am Geneva time this morning, China had reported a total of 78,630 cases of COVID-19 to WHO, including 2,747 deaths. Outside China, there were 3,474 cases in 44 countries, and 54 deaths. It is the second day in which the number of new cases reported in the rest of the world has exceeded the number of new cases in China. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest developments. If you\u2019re looking for more detail, here\u2019s our earlier coverage. Coronavirus could trigger economic damage on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, analysts have warned, amid growing concerns over the fallout from the deadly disease. The death toll in Iran has risen to 26, with almost 250 people diagnosed with the virus. Two more people have died from coronavirus in Italy, bringing the death toll to 14. The number of confirmed cases has risen to more than 520. Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife, and the patients have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London. Saudi Arabia has taken the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time. The Japanese government has ordered the closure of all schools and museum for a month. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned an epidemic that is on the way\u201d. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died. More cases have been reported all over the world including in Switzerland, Kuwait, Spain, South Korea and Austria. Estonia, Denmark, Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. Donald Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans \u201cremains very low\u201d and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a \u201cfew days\u201d. But Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. Australia has extended its travel ban on China and enacted its emergency response plan, because \u201cthere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus\u201d, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison.",

About half of Americans say they are highly concerned that the country\u2019s voting systems might be vulnerable to hackers, and about that many also are strongly concerned about foreign governments interfering by tampering with election results or influencing American attitudes.</p> \n  <p>But, perhaps unsurprisingly concerns vary significantly by partisanship. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to express worries about the security of elections - with about 6 in 10 Democrats saying they are very or extremely concerned that voting systems might be vulnerable to hackers. Roughly two-thirds are highly concerned that foreign governments will interfere in 2020, by tampering with results or influencing what Americans think about political candidates.</p> \n  <p>By contrast, fewer than half of Republicans express significant concern about hackers, and just about a quarter are highly concerned about any form of foreign interference.</p> \n  <p>The AP-NORC poll of 1,074 adults was conducted between 13 February and 16 February, with a sample designed to be representative of the US population as a whole.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e57c0118f0811db2faffa4d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-27T13:20:26.823Z\">1.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It is fair to say that opinion is divided as to whether Vice-president Mike Pence is the right man to take charge of a potential disease pandemic situation.

      "bodyText": "Mike Bloomberg apologized for his remarks on transgender people, and said he was \u201cin it to win it\u201d when it came to the election. Donald Trump spent 45 minutes today meeting with the with the lead actors in a conservative play about \u201cthe Deep State\u201d, and made some more comments about the coronavirus outbreak. Hillary Clinton gets a podcast. Mike Bloomberg is reportedly eyeing a Bloomberg/Yang ticket. Mike Bloomberg and his campaign have been seeking an endorsement from the election\u2019s former dark horse Andrew Yang, floating the possibility of having Yang on as his running mate, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. Yang, who dropped out of the race earlier this month, entered the scene with no political background, but quickly rallied a passionate base known as the Yang Gang. He ran what he called \u201cthe nerdiest presidential campaign in history\u201d, with his signature policy a promise to provide every American with a universal basic income of $1,000 a month. Just in time for the 2020 election to get really interesting: Hillary Clinton is getting a podcast, set to launch in late spring. Some of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls are out in force in South Carolina now, and they have a celebrity brigade behind them. Stumping for Joe Biden is actress Vivica A. Fox: And Tom Steyer has a packed rally planned for tomorrow night: Elizabeth Warren had musician John Legend with her yesterday: Meanwhile, Amy Klobuchar is in North Carolina with American Idol\u2019s Clay Aiken. In more Donald Trump news, the president called the press pool for an unscheduled event, shortly after the Dow Jones index suffered its biggest points fall in history amid coronavirus fears. The president planned to discuss his \u201csuccess in empowering members of the African-American community\u201d, and included guests such as conservative commentator Candace Owens and media personalities Diamond and Silk. The event turned into an impromptu press conference, and Trump started to talk about the coronavirus outbreak. Donald Trump spent 45 minutes today meeting with the lead actors in a conservative play about \u201cthe Deep State\u201d, the Daily Beast reports. The play, FBI Lovebirds: Undercovers, is based on congressional testimony and text messages between former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who discussed the FBI\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia while having an affair. Trump and his allies have repeatedly pointed to Strzok and this affair as proof for their claim that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election is a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d. On Thursday, Trump hosted the play\u2019s leads, Superman actor Dean Cain and former Buffy the Vampire Slayer actress Kristy Swanson, along with playwright Phelim McAleer and producer Ann McElhinney in the Oval Office. The meeting was supposed to last 15 minutes, McAleer told the Daily Beast. \u201cWe went for a 15 minute meeting that took 45 minutes,\u201d McAleer said. \u201cWe were there for 45 minutes in the Oval Office, and he loves it, he loves the play.\u201d Speaking of Mike Bloomberg, here he is telling Kasie Hunt that he\u2019s \u201cin it to win it\u201d. \u201cWhy would I spend all this money and all this time out of my life and all this wear and tear?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019m running a race and I\u2019m behind with one lap to go, what am I\u2019m going to do, quit?\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cNo, you run harder.\u201d Mike Bloomberg had to apologize for his legacy of \u2018stop-and-frisk\u2019 as New York mayor before he launched his campaign in November. Now, with just days to go to Super Tuesday, he\u2019s apologizing again, this time for referring to transgender people as \u201che, she, or it\u201d and \u201csome guy in a dress\u201d who enters girls locker rooms. \u201cIt was a poor attempt to describe how some who oppose transgender equality think about this issue\u2014and those words do not reflect my unwavering support for equality for transgender Americans,\u201d Bloomberg said in an exclusive statement to NewNowNext. \u201cI want to offer my sincerest apologies to the members of the transgender community.\u201d He purportedly spoke to some transgender leaders on a private call Thursday as well, but his campaign declined to name who those leaders were. Hi all, Vivian Ho on the west coast here, taking over for Kenya Evelyn. Politics are happening. Bernie Sanders appears to have had an impressive past two days in fundraising, according to his campaign. Elizabeth Warren announces plan for clemency board In a tweet thread Thursday, Massachusetts senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren unveiled a plans to form a presidential clemency board \u201cthat will prioritize cases of older Americans incarcerated for unduly long sentences and establish a presumption of release.\u201d Warren acknowledged there will be some exceptions, including for people deemed a danger to society. She also took the time to thank fellow senator Cory Booker of New Jersey for \u201cleading on criminal justice reform and consistently highlighting this issue,\u201d leading to speculations of a possible Warren-Booker ticket. Sen. Booker dropped out of the presidential race in last month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended nearly 1,200 points down Thursday. Investors continue to fear the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the US economy. President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he had enlisted vice president Mike Pence to lead the nation\u2019s efforts at combating the highly infectious virus. But as we reported earlier, those initial efforts appear to be limiting who can speak publicly about it. The Trump administration is clamping down on interviews discussing the coronavirus, even directing cabinet officials to go through US vice president Mike Pence. From the NY Times: Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the country\u2019s leading experts on viruses and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.\u201d Pence is one of three people designated as the administration\u2019s primary coronavirus official. Government workers, including health experts and scientists, must coordinate their statements with the vice president\u2019s office. President Donald Trump garnered immediate backlash for tapping Pence to lead crisis re draw criticism nearly immediately after the press conference. Critics have pointed to Pence record as the governor of Indiana, when he gutted health spending budgets and delayed a rollout of needle exchanges. It enabled the state\u2019s worst outbreak of HIV. Conservatives declare war on socialism in CPAC battle cry \u201cAmerica vs. Socialism\u201d is the umbrella theme at the biggest annual gathering of conservatives under way at the National Harbor in Maryland. Many attendees are wearing \u201cMake America great again\u201d or \u201cKeep America great\u201d hats. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) marketplace is as brash and unapologetic as ever. T-shirt legends include \u201cGod, guns, Trump 2020\u201d and, in a parody of The Terminator film franchise, \u201cTrumpinator. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d There are Trump novelty pens and socks. A blue full length dress proclaims \u201cMake America great again.\u201d Not invited this year is Utah Senator Mitt Romney, the sole Republican who voted for the president\u2019s conviction at the impeachment trial. A placard with Romney\u2019s face says: \u201cUsed Trump for political gain... and then stabs him in the back.\u201d When Charlie Kirk of the pro-Trump student group Turning Point USA referred to Romney during a speech, the crowd booed and Kirk responded: \u201cCorrect. Every time his name is mentioned, you should react that way.\u201d Once given the cold shoulder himself by CPAC, Donald Trump now enjoys a cult-like status here and is due to speak on Saturday. On Thursday, his deputy, Mike Pence, told the crowd: \u201cI know you\u2019re going to say yes to four more years of President Donald Trump in 2020.\u201d There were chants of \u201cFour more years!\u201d and \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d Trump won the Democratic debates \u201cin a knockout\u201d, the vice president declared. \u201cThe truth is today\u2019s Democratic party has been taken over by radical leftists who want higher taxes, open borders and late term abortions.\u201d He attacked frontrunner Bernie Sanders in particular but warned that \u201cdespite what the media tells you, there are no moderates in this Democratic field\u201d. During Pence\u2019s speech, a protester dressed as Trump was removed by security. Georgia governor Brian Kemp mocked and dismissed the impact of voter suppression on residents as state officials misled the public about the ability to stop poll site closures, according to a new report by the US House. Kemp, a Republican, narrowly defeated Democrat Stacey Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial race. Abrams went on to launch a national campaign to combat voter disenfranchisement. The Georgia Recorder first reported that Kemp, then state secretary, circulated news reports bout \u201cproblems with local officials\u2019 attempts to challenge voter registrations.\u201d Kemp , along with aide David Dove, then responded with crying-laughing emojis. The report was released by the US House Oversight Committee into voter suppression in minority communities. Officials also uncovered what they called \u201cconcerning information about voter suppression in Georgia.\u201d Documents produced to the Committee show that state election officials claimed in public to lack authority over polling locations, while behind the scenes they were advising counties on closing, moving, and consolidating polling sites. Former Baltimore mayor Catherine Pugh, 69, was sentenced to three years in federal prison on Thursday. The disgraced politician pleaded guilty last year to tax evasion and conspiracy for arranging fraudulent sales of her self-published children\u2019s book series to non-profit foundations. From the Baltimore Sun: Pugh\u2019s political fall began in March when The Baltimore Sun revealed she had entered into a no-bid deal with the University of Maryland Medical System, where Pugh sat on the board of directors, to buy 100,000 copies of her sloppily self-published \u201cHealthy Holly\u201d books for $500,000. She later resigned from the board and as mayor amid multiple investigations into her finances and the book sales. In total, she netted more than $850,000, prosecutors say. She initially faced a possible 4-5 years sentence. Attorneys for the former mayor called the judge\u2019s ruling \u201cvery fair.\u201d And those children\u2019s books? Rather than donating them to local schools, prosecutors and Pugh agreed to destroy all those currently in government custody. Mike Pence breaks Reagan record for CPAC appearances Vice President Mike Pence is making his 14th appearance at the the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the National Harbor near Washington, breaking former president Ronald Reagan\u2019s record. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, introduced Pence by asking: \u201cCan you imagine being to the right of Dick Cheney? Well, that\u2019s our vice president.\u201d Pence, put in charge of the US response to the coronavirus, said 15 cases have been detected in America so far. \u201cWhile the risk to the American public remains low, as the president said yesterday, we\u2019re ready. We\u2019re ready for anything.\u201d He added: \u201cI promise you, we will continue to bring the full resources of the federal government to bear to protect the American people.\u201d In a swipe at Democratic critics, Pence said: \u201cThis is not the time for partisanship. The American people expect us to work together.\u201d A new poll found Joe Biden 20 points up over Bernie Sanders in South Carolina, which will hold its primary on Saturday. According to Monmouth University, Biden is capturing the support of 36% of likely primary voters in the Palmetto state, compared to 16% for Sanders and 13% for Tom Steyer. Biden is relying on a decisive victory in South Carolina to reinvigorate his campaign after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second-place finish in Nevada. If Biden were to secure a 20-point victory, he will likely declare himself the dominant moderate candidate in the race in the hope of mitigating Sanders\u2019 expected Super Tuesday delegate gains. But Biden still faces the test of Mike Bloomberg\u2019s $500 million campaign machine in Super Tuesday states, so his own path to the nomination faces numerous challenges. Stop Sanders movement within party? Here\u2019s what one team of journalists at the NYT found: Bernie Sanders rallying in North Carolina today, a Super Tuesday voting state. Nancy Pelosi as a white knight. Innnnnteresting..... It\u2019s been a whirlwind of a morning as Democrats head into South Carolina primary. Black voters may be \u2018Feeling the Bern\u2019 more than many analysts thought and the Trump campaign is even taking notice. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says the party will support whoever wins. More on South Carolina, including latest polls, in the afternoon. Stay tuned! Poll: Americans are extremely concerned about election security Steven Segal misled the public about his cryptocurrency deal The US government is creating a division for denaturalizing US citizens Nancy Pelosi says Democrats are unified, except for superdelegates \u201cUnity, unity, unity\u201d is what US House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi reiterated in a press conference today, telling reporters that Democrats are focused on winning back the White House and Senate, not infighting ahead of the 2020 US presidential race. \u201cContrary to what you may be hearing or writing, we are all unified,\u201d she said. \u201cWhoever the nominee is of our party, we\u2019ll wholeheartedly support.\u201d But when asked about her thoughts on the fight over superdelegates totals in winning the nomination, Pelosi remained mum. \u201cThat\u2019s not the issue, the person who will be nominated will be the person who wins the majority-plus-one,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthat may happen before we even get to the convention but we\u2019ll see.\u201d Maine Newspaper rips Warren and Sanders, endorses Klobuchar The Bangor Daily News is praising pragmatism. Maine\u2019s only independently run paper officially endorsed Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar\u2019s bid for the White House calling her \u201ca centrist who earns praise from Republicans.\u201d \u201cThis should be seen as a benefit, not a drawback at a time when both political parties too often move to their extremes and gridlock is a hallmark in Washington,\u201d staff editors wrote. Perhaps more notable, however, is who the paper is staunchly against. Editors excoriated fellow New Englanders, senators Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, calling them \u201ctoo liberal to gain the needed support to become reality.\u201d Klobuchar was also the only candidate who agreed to speak the paper\u2019s editorial board. Coincidence? The US Dept. of Justice announced it had created a division tasked with denaturalizing immigrants. The Denaturalization Section \u201cunderscores the department\u2019s commitment to bring justice to terrorists, war criminals, sex offenders and other fraudsters who illegally obtained naturalization\u201d officials said in a statement. From the Washington Post: Denaturalizations have ramped up under the Trump administration: Of the 228 denaturalization cases that the department has filed since 2008, about 40 percent of them were filed since 2017, according to official department numbers. The Justice Dept. did not announce who would be tapped to lead the new section. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, actor Steven Seagal allegedly failed to disclose a promotional agreement related to cryptocurrencies. The SEC alleges Seagal accepted $250,000 in cash and $750,000 worth of Bitcoiin2Gen (B2G) tokens in exchange for online promotion of the currency, including \u201cposts on his public social media accounts encouraging the public not to \u2018miss out\u2019\u201d. Seagal violated the anti-touting provisions of the federal securities laws. He\u2019ll pay a $157,000 fine. The SEC issued a warning to investors to \u201cbe wary of celebrity endorsements.\u201d Republicans are betting on black voters, too Democrats aren\u2019t the only ones banking on black voters. The Trump campaign announced they\u2019re also getting in the race to engage African Americans ahead of the 2020 presidential election. How? By opening field offices in key swing states just days before the country\u2019s first primary featuring a majority black electorate. From NPR: Campaign officials say the goal is get their message directly to African Americans, getting around what they can the \u201cfilter\u201d of the media. Offices will feature promotional videos and pamphlets touting President [Donald] Trump\u2019s record on issues such as African American employment and addressing disparities in the criminal justice system. It\u2019s an uphill climb though, according to Pew, black voters remaining overwhelmingly Democratic. Some polls have shown increasing black support for Trump. But his approval ratings remain historically low, winning only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll found 8 out of 10 African Americans think Trump is a racist. Nine out of 10 disapprove of his job performance. Good Morning. I\u2019m taking over for the live blog and we\u2019re talking black voters. A new national poll indicates Bernie Sanders is leading among black voters. According to the Hill/HarrisX survey, Sanders extended his lead after Tuesday night\u2019s debates, including a 9-point advantage among African Americans. Overall, Sanders saw a 6-point increase from last week\u2019s Hill/HarrisX poll, with 28 percent support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters. The poll was conducted between February 23 and 24 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 points. Despite US vice president Joe Biden\u2019s popularity among them, black voters aren\u2019t a monolith. Last week, I spoke with African American democrats in South Carolina ahead of Saturday\u2019s primary who insisted there\u2019s a progressive movement in the state that is largely ignored. As Bill Frey of the Brookings Institute noted, black migration from the Northeast and Midwest may be a factor. Hillary Clinton won early primaries in 2016 largely because of the black vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWith most African Americans living in and moving south, those races become more competitive because the range of political ideologies among them widens. One row that looks set to run between now and the South Carolina primary on Saturday is the sight of former president Barack Obama taking legal action over what he claims is a misleading TV ad from a Republican super PAC that was due to air in the state. The lawyers letter makes this objection to the advert, saying that: This unauthorized use of President Obama\u2019s name, image, likeness, voice and book passage is clearly intended to mislead the target audience of the ad into believing that the passage from the audiobook is a statement that was made by President Barack Obama during his presidency, when it was in fact made by a barber in a completely different context more than 20 years ago. It is significant that the ad is targeting minority voters in the state, as Biden\u2019s path to winning the primary on Saturday over Bernie Sanders relies on him capturing a significant share of the African American vote. The Committee to Defend the President super PAC attempting to run the ads started life in 2013 as the Stop Hillary PAC. Earlier this month the same super PAC had a Facebook ad that purported to show a photo of \u201cthe Bernie bros\u201d removed for being against Facebook\u2019s ad policies. The Biden campaign were tweeting last night that they were close to having raised $1 million dollars in a day. Barack Obama is yet to openly endorse anybody in the race for the Democrat nominations, which some have found surprising, given the extent to which Joe Biden has been using his relationship with Obama and their time spent together in government. Biden himself will be at a campaign event at Conway in South Carolina from 5:30pm EST tonight. As much as Donald Trump likes to paint it as a fake news hoax, concerns about foreign interference in US elections are not going to go away, as has been revealed by a new joint poll from the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They have found that Americans have widespread concerns about the security and integrity of elections, with few saying they have high confidence that votes in the 2020 presidential election will be counted accurately. There are widespread fears about security vulnerabilities, as well as voter suppression and voter fraud. About half of Americans say they are highly concerned that the country\u2019s voting systems might be vulnerable to hackers, and about that many also are strongly concerned about foreign governments interfering by tampering with election results or influencing American attitudes. But, perhaps unsurprisingly concerns vary significantly by partisanship. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to express worries about the security of elections - with about 6 in 10 Democrats saying they are very or extremely concerned that voting systems might be vulnerable to hackers. Roughly two-thirds are highly concerned that foreign governments will interfere in 2020, by tampering with results or influencing what Americans think about political candidates. By contrast, fewer than half of Republicans express significant concern about hackers, and just about a quarter are highly concerned about any form of foreign interference. The AP-NORC poll of 1,074 adults was conducted between 13 February and 16 February, with a sample designed to be representative of the US population as a whole. It is fair to say that opinion is divided as to whether Vice-president Mike Pence is the right man to take charge of a potential disease pandemic situation. Shannon Palus at Slate has listed Pence\u2019s horrible history on public health initiatives. While Donald Trump seems keen to talk down the impact of coronavirus in an attempt to quell any panic about it on Wall Street, high on Pence\u2019s agenda today will be that the US appears to have seen its first human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 to someone who has no track record of contact with anybody who had travelled. With the news that Japan is planning to close all schools for a month to combat the spread of the coronavirus and other countries taking drastic measures like Saudi Arabia halting pilgrimages, it is clear that the economic disruption caused by a prolonged outbreak in the US could be significant. Vivian Ho has walked around the San Francisco\u2019s historic Chinatown for us, to see the impact that fear is already having. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in San Francisco, but even so, Chinatown regulars say the streets are less crowded, and people have begun to worry \u2013 not about the virus itself, they said, but on whether their businesses can survive this downturn. AP is reporting a diplomatic push from Russia to extend their last remaining nuclear treaty with the US. Vladimir Leontyev, a deputy head of the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s arms control department, said during parliamentary hearings that it\u2019s impossible to modify the New Start treaty that expires in February 2021. Leontyev said that the US has continued to stonewall Russian offers to extend the pact and recently refused to hold a meeting between experts to discuss legal aspects of its possible extension. The New Start, which was signed in 2010 by President Barack Obama and then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers. The treaty, which can be extended by another five years, includes a comprehensive verification regime to check compliance, including on-site inspections of each sides nuclear bases. Its expiration on 5 February next year would remove any limits on Russian and US nuclear arsenals for the first time in decades. Much fuss has been made about Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign spending power, but USA Today have just published a piece looking at his ground game in Richmond, Virginia. Their reporter was out and about with 63-year-old retiree Sean Mee, and it is an interesting look at the reaction the billionaire\u2019s campaign is getting on the street. Another man shouted as Mee walked away, \u201cwe\u2019re old and have mortgages\u201d to explain why he and others on his block would be supporting Bloomberg instead of Sanders. Read it here - USA Today: How billionaire Michael Bloomberg is campaigning for the White House Bernie Sanders\u2019 comments about Cuba at the weekend during his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview have continued to provoke responses throughout the week. Here\u2019s Aaron Hicklin on what Sanders\u2019 words felt like for the LGBTQ movement. When Bernie Sanders doubled down on his old \u201cnot everything was bad\u201d defense of Fidel Castro last weekend, citing things like Castro\u2019s literacy programs, I thought of my fellow students from the early 90s. Although society has transformed since I left college, Sanders\u2019 take on Cuba seemed marooned in the past. Cuba\u2019s record on LGBTQ rights has improved in the last 20 years, but Castro was singularly ruthless in his persecution of gay men, lesbians and transgender people. United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has delivered a broadside in Geneva against Donald Trump\u2019s policies on environment and migration, accusing the president of endangering public health and the rights of children. The former Chilean president criticised recent moves to deregulate the US economy and weaken environmental protection standards. \u201cUntreated pollutants may now be poured directly into millions of miles of streams and rivers, putting ecosystems, drinking water and human health at risk. Weaker fuel emission standards for vehicles and decreased regulations on the oil and gas industries could also harm human rights\u201d Bachelet also criticised US migration policies that she said raised significant human rights concerns. \u201cReducing the number of people trying to enter the country should not be done in disregard of asylum and migrant protections. The situation of children in detention is of particular concern,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s the pick of a few things around the web to have a read of this morning. Politico\u2019s leading piece on the Democrat race is a closer look at the Bernie Sanders\u2019 relationship with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Despite his anti-establishment rhetoric and a handful of high-profile breaks with his party over 29 years in Congress, the Vermont independent is typically not the headache for his Democratic leadership that Ted Cruz and Rand Paul once were for the GOP. Sanders, it\u2019s often forgotten, actually serves on Schumer\u2019s leadership team. Read it here - Politico: Inside Bernie\u2019s relationship with Chuck and Nancy The New York Times opinion section has gone big on making the case for each of the six main challengers for the Democrat presidential nomination. They\u2019ve devoted one essay each to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Mike Bloomberg, Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar. Read it here - New York Times: Choose your champion The Hill has an interesting look at just what Donald Trump is up to with his administration\u2019s shake up of the justice department and the intelligence community. President Trump is challenging two institutions with crucial roles to play in the next election with a controversial appointment to the intelligence community and tweets directed at the Justice Department. Read it here - The Hill: Trump shakes up Justice Department, intelligence community AP are reporting that one of the nation\u2019s largest labor unions is unveiling plans to invest $150 million in a nationwide campaign to help defeat president Donald Trump. The campaign will be aimed at eight key states: Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. The union and its local members will pay particular attention to two key urban battlegrounds: Detroit and Milwaukee. They believe will play a defining role in the 2020 general election, and the investment will focus primarily on direct contact and online advertising targeting minority men and women who typically don\u2019t vote. It is the largest voter engagement and turnout operation in the history of the Service Employees International Union, which claims nearly 2 million members. Union president Mary Kay Henry has called it \u201ca make-or-break\u201d moment for working people in America under Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s systematically unwinding and attacking unions. Federal workers rights have been totally eviscerated under his watch,\u201d Henry said in an interview. \u201cWe are on fire about the rules being rigged against us and needing to elect people that are going to stand with workers.\u201d The SEIU has yet to endorse a specific challenger for the Democrat nomination. It is one the most diverse unions in the US. Membership features those who work in health care, food service, janitorial services and state and local government workers, among others. Half its members are people of color, and more than half make less than $15 an hour. Good morning. It\u2019s a busier in-tray than usual for Vice-President Mike Pence after president Donald Trump put him in charge of the US response to coronavirus. The administration has been giving mixed signals on the crisis. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have described the further community spread of Covid-19 as inevitable, even while Trump downplays the significance of the spread of the virus. There\u2019s evidence that for the first time there is a case in the US that involves someone with no known link to foreign travel. Pence is also due to be speaking at the 2020 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland this morning. Ted Cruz, Kellyanne Conway and Betsy DeVos are also on the bill. Meanwhile Trump\u2019s lawyers are going to be busy after an escalation of the Republican president\u2019s long-running battle with the news media. His team say they are filing a lawsuit against the New York Times. The campaign said the aim of the litigation was to \u201chold the news organization accountable for intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d. For the Democrats we\u2019ll find out on Saturday whether Joe Biden can get over the line in first place in South Carolina. Frequently described as one of \u2018firewall\u2019 states, its a test of his appeal to minority voters. There are fifty-four delegates up for grabs. But the campaign already seems to have moved on to looking at the states that will vote on Super Tuesday - and in particular Texas. Mike Bloomberg has spent more than $13.5 million on television ads around Houston alone. Elizabeth Warren will be in San Antonio today with its former mayor and her former rival for the nomination, Julian Castro. She visits Houston on Saturday. Pete Buttigieg will be in Dallas on Sunday. Texas will award 228 delegates on Super Tuesday, second only to California.

Otres activistas como el colectivo @liwaiai @catarsiabcn o @gazpachoagridulce @susanayuan @afrofeminas @sosracismomad est\u00e1n tratando el tema.

      "bodyText": "Epidemics bring out the best and worst of social media. In the past two months, I have seen pseudo-scientific \u201ccures\u201d for the Covid-19 proliferating on WeChat, conspiracy theorists on Gab propagating various \u201ctruths\u201d about the source of the outbreak, and young Tik Tokers video-sharing \u201cfunny\u201d memes about the virus. On the flipside, I have witnessed the development of numerous campaigns fighting back against a parallel epidemic of #coronaracism. Since knowledge of the outbreak first occurred, disheartening incidents have been reported in Australia, Europe, and the US of people of east Asian appearance being verbally abused, kicked off public transport, denied entrance to shops, spat on and even violently attacked. Even as I write this, there are reports of attendees at Melbourne\u2019s Royal Children\u2019s hospital refusing to allow Asian doctors to treat their kids. \u201cLess than 0.001% of Chinese people have coronavirus, yet more than 99.999% have already experienced coronaracism.\u201d This quote from British-born Chinese comedian Ken Cheng underlines pervasive and indiscriminate nature of the racism stemming from this outbreak. In January 2020, the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus was coined by the French Asian community on Twitter in response to a spate of racially motivated attacks in the country. Following a successful debut on the French Twittersphere, this hashtag campaign was quickly translated into English, German, Italian, Spanish and appeared across various platforms. On Instagram, for instance, Taiwanese-Spanish musician Chenta Tsai posted a picture of the phrase scrawled across his torso on the runways of Madrid Fashion Week. The campaign has even prompted a Chinese band to published an EP \u2013 Wo bushi Bingdu (\u201cI am not a virus\u201d in Chinese). In Australia, where 5.6% of the population can claim Chinese ancestry (census 2016), journalist Avani Dias introduced the #DontDumpTheDumplings hashtag on 13 February, calling on Australians to continue to frequent their local Chinese restaurants, whose businesses have reportedly suffered tremendous losses due to lack of patronage. Only a few days later, progressive political activist group GetUp launched a campaign with the same intention on Instagram and Twitter. Their hashtag #iwilleatwithyou borrows its nomenclature from the successful anti-Islamophobia campaign following the 2014 Sydney Lindt cafe siege. As a member of the Chinese diaspora who has experienced xenophobia amid the outbreak myself, I find all of these aforementioned social media campaigns uplifting. However, these campaigns face many obstacles, two of which are fear-spreading and rumour-mongering. In times of crisis, fear fosters discrimination. During epidemics, avoidance and stigmatisation of out-groups are common strategies of collective coping. Anthropological and historical accounts of past epidemics provide plenty of evidence of fear \u201clegitimising\u201d collective discrimination against minorities and other \u201coutsiders\u201d. For instance, during the 1853 yellow fever epidemic in America, Irish and German immigrants were blamed as the cause. In the 1916 major outbreak of polio in New York City, Italian immigrants were accused of bringing the epidemic to the US. During the early phases of the outbreak of Covid-19, the denigration and blaming of groups deemed responsible for the outbreak was already plain to see within China. Shortly after the new coronavirus outbreak in Hubei province was officially declared by Chinese authorities in January, discriminatory rhetoric and attacks against people from the region began to emerge online and in public. For instance, pictures of banners stigmatising people travelling back home from Hubei went viral on social media. A widely circulated picture shows a banner in Shanghai with the message: \u201cPeople coming back from Hubei are all time bombs\u201d. Sensationalist media coverage of the outbreak works to further exacerbate existing fears, including some deliberately pandering to xenophobic stereotypes or peddling popular rumours. Perhaps the most widely publicised example of the latter was the emergence of a video of \u201ca Chinese woman indulging in the apparently common practice of eating fruit bat soup\u201d. Although this video has been debunked, it is still circulated online, promoting the narrative that Chinese people deserve their affliction by dint of their \u201cdisgusting\u201d eating habits. A more recent example of misinformation fuelling xenophobia is the conspiracy theory claiming the latest Covid-19 outbreak in Italy is caused by Chinese \u201cbig pharma\u201d and government who deliberately sent virus carriers to Europe. Fear, rumour and xenophobia are three intimated linked issues, and one sustains the other. As the outbreaks continue to spread, so do panic, new rumours and tension across communities. As of Thursday, Covid-19 has reached 40 countries. As the world is preparing for a pandemic, maybe we should also prepare for combating a #coronaracism pandemic so we can all fight the virus in solidarity.

Outgoing health department secretary, Glenys Beauchamp, who retires from the department at the close of business on Friday, told the Senate inquiry examining the administration of the government\u2019s $100m sports grant program that she had destroyed all her personal notebooks while cleaning out her office at the end of January. Beauchamp had been due to retire at the end of last month, but agree to stay on as department head while her successor, the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, dealt with the coronavirus outbreak. But the destruction of her notebooks, which may have included the only notes of a late-night teleconference between herself, the former Sport Australia head, Kate Palmer, and the board chairman, John Wylie, after Palmer learned of the colour-coded electoral spreadsheets being used to award the grants, has raised another issue in the sports rort affair. Greens senator Janet Rice described Beauchamp\u2019s actions as \u201cstrange\u201d, given her long career in the public service. \u201cThese notebooks included details of meetings held in relation to the sports rorts scandal,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy would the secretary destroy these relevant documents when she knew she would be giving evidence today on the sports grants program? \u201cMs Beauchamp also said today that she saw the Coalition\u2019s colour-coded spreadsheet days before the election was called, and organised an urgent meeting with Sport Australia to discuss it and their evidence to Senate estimates.

Under the commonwealth archival law, some records must be kept, but others considered to be of \u201clow importance\u201d can be destroyed. Non-government members of the committee examining what has become known as \u201csports rorts\u201d expressed shock when told of the notebooks\u2019 destruction. Labor senator Katy Gallagher said she would write to the public service commissioner to look into the matter. \u201cAnd if need be, to provide further guidance about what constitutes a record and how those records need to be handled,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, these records are gone, so they are lost forever.\u201d Gallagher said there was a \u201cbroader\u201d issue of \u201ca very significant reluctance to provide any information to the committee\u201d charged with investigating the program\u2019s administration. \u201cSo we have sought documents from Sport Australia, we\u2019ve asked for documents from health today, they have taken it on notice, Sport Australia has taken it on notice \u2013 the government has refused to provide documents to the Senate \u2013 so there is something that exists in these documents that the government doesn\u2019t want us to have access to, that is clear,\u201d she said. \u201cThe issue that we will take up more broadly, about the protection of documents, is to make sure that even at the lowest levels, to the highest levels, that there is an understanding about the importance of preserving records that are created in the performance of your duties as a commonwealth public servant, and that those need to be adhered to at all times.\u201d The non-government committee members also seemed taken aback to learn Palmer had been \u201csurprised\u201d to see the colour-coded spreadsheet McKenzie\u2019s office was using to award the grants. Palmer said she saw the spreadsheet for the first time before walking into a Senate estimates hearing in April \u2013 days before the 2019 election was called \u2013 after it was handed to her by a staffer. \u201cA teleconference was held between myself, the chair of the board, and myself \u2026 It was to discuss that we had seen and received this spreadsheet,\u201d Palmer told the inquiry.

Palmer left the organisation at the end of last month, having announced in October last year she would not seek to renew her contract when it expired. The committee learned no more about the timing of the grant approvals, which were not emailed to Sport Australia until 11 April, 17 minutes after the government entered the caretaker period, on a briefing note dated 4 April from McKenzie\u2019s office. Rice said the government had treated the process with contempt. \u201cThe Coalition is actively subverting democracy with this cover-up,\u201d she said. \u201cMorrison still refuses to release the Gaetjens report, the 28 different versions of the colour-coded spreadsheet or the 136 emails between his office and then-minister McKenzie.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When death came to the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-35064071\" title=\"\">village of Eyam</a>, it was probably hidden inside a roll of cloth. Bubonic plague is thought to have been carried to this remote corner of Derbyshire from London back in the 1660s by infected fleas, trapped in a bale of fabric ordered to make costumes for a festival. The sickness spread fast, killing dozens of villagers and leaving many on the verge of fleeing in panic \u2013 but then something extraordinary happened.</p> <p>The rector of Eyam, believing it his duty to spare neighbouring towns from infection, persuaded his parishioners to take the astonishingly self-sacrificing step of sealing themselves off from the world. They would live or they would die, but nobody would leave until the sickness had burned itself out. One mother is said to have buried six of her children, yet by staying must have saved countless other women from the same fate.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s impossible to read the story of Eyam without wondering who on earth would be capable of such selflessness now. When it came to the crunch, how many of us would secretly have more in common with the local squire, who fled after the first few deaths and left his neighbours to their fate? Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren\u2019t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good.</p> <p>So it\u2019s lucky for us, then, that Covid-19 is nothing like the Black Death. Where untreated, plague killed about half of its victims. This new virus seems to have a death rate of <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/\" title=\"\">about 2%</a>, and medicine has thankfully come a long way in 400 years. Having been caught up in the noughties\u2019 swine flu outbreak and suffered nothing worse than a few days sweating under a duvet, I\u2019m certainly not inclined to panic unnecessarily about this one, but then people like me aren\u2019t the point. It\u2019s the elderly and infirm, people with existing lung conditions or suppressed immune systems, who may be most vulnerable, and it\u2019s them we are being asked to protect.</p> <p>Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else\u2019s problem.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/covid-19-what-we-know-and-do-not-know-about-the-coronavirus\">Covid-19: what we know and do not know about the coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word \u201cquarantine\u201d sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is \u2013 like the tourists now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/no-one-has-told-us-anything-tourists-on-lockdown-in-tenerife-hotel-coronavirus\" title=\"\">confined to a Tenerife hotel </a>after an Italian guest tested positive \u2013 when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don\u2019t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don\u2019t want to risk taking 14 days off.</p> <p>If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it\u2019s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/all-wirral-coronavirus-evacuees-set-to-leave-quarantine-after-testing-negative\" title=\"\">draconian emergency powers</a> to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital.</p> <p>China\u2019s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/coronavirus-residents-welded-inside-their-own-home/\" title=\"\">nailing victims\u2019 front doors shut</a>, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won\u2019t translate easily to European democracies.</p> <p>So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200212-sitrep-23-ncov.pdf\" title=\"\">warning</a> that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-hubei-south-korea-japan-trumpcases-infections-death-toll-outbreak-italy-latest-news\" title=\"\">closing all its schools</a> but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/matt-hancock-clarifies-coronavirus-travel-advice-after-criticism\" title=\"\">briefing MPs </a>on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn\u2019t worth it at this stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-news-live-updates\">Coronavirus news: death toll rises in Italy and Iran as outbreak could cause 2008-level economic damage - live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam\u2019s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go. Airlines freezing recruitment, restaurants reporting cancellations and factories running low on parts are only the most visible signifiers of what may be to come.</p> <p>But when the WHO urges countries to step up preparations, it isn\u2019t just talking about hospital beds and economic resilience and endlessly reminding people to wash their hands. This isn\u2019t just a test of clinical resources but a test too, in some ways, of Britons\u2019 willingness to put ourselves out for others. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t another Eyam. But we have a choice about whether to be vicars or squires, all the same.</p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Compared with 17th-century peasants, modern Britons simply aren\u2019t enormously used to the idea of sacrifice for the supposed collective good. So it\u2019s lucky for us, then, that Covid-19 is nothing like the Black Death. Where untreated, plague killed about half of its victims. This new virus seems to have a death rate of about 2%, and medicine has thankfully come a long way in 400 years. Having been caught up in the noughties\u2019 swine flu outbreak and suffered nothing worse than a few days sweating under a duvet, I\u2019m certainly not inclined to panic unnecessarily about this one, but then people like me aren\u2019t the point. It\u2019s the elderly and infirm, people with existing lung conditions or suppressed immune systems, who may be most vulnerable, and it\u2019s them we are being asked to protect. Doing whatever is necessary to stop the virus spreading is, much like vaccinating your kids against measles, not just about protecting your own interests but putting the wellbeing of the herd first. The trouble is that we all know what has happened to vaccination levels across the west, as a minority of parents seemingly decided the herd was someone else\u2019s problem. Are we really ready for a pandemic? Not so much for the virus itself as the personal sacrifices and inconveniences that might follow a serious outbreak: for lockdowns and school closures, empty streets and cancelled holidays, perhaps even factory shutdowns and shortages in the shops if there is serious disruption to global supply chains. The word \u201cquarantine\u201d sends a particularly medieval shiver down the spine because it means being trapped where the infection is \u2013 like the tourists now confined to a Tenerife hotel after an Italian guest tested positive \u2013 when instinct tells you to flee. But even self-isolation, or voluntarily shutting yourself away at home, as the government recommends here for those potentially exposed to the virus, will be hard on self-employed people who don\u2019t get sick pay, and those in jobs so precarious they don\u2019t want to risk taking 14 days off. If NHS beds come under intense pressure, difficult choices may have to be made. Yet it\u2019s hard to imagine the spirit of Eyam prevailing when ministers have already had to invoke draconian emergency powers to prevent a man rescued from coronavirus-stricken Wuhan leaving quarantine in a Merseyside hospital. China\u2019s solution to this dilemma has been the kind of brutally sweeping measures that perhaps only the most authoritarian of states could muster: sealing off whole cities, banning travel, knocking up new hospitals in days and reportedly even nailing victims\u2019 front doors shut, in some cases, to stop them venturing out. The virus now seems to be peaking in China. Yet what can be made to work in a society where everyone fears the consequences of disobeying authority, and where the concept of collective sacrifice for the communal good is drummed in from childhood, won\u2019t translate easily to European democracies. So far, Britain has opted more for keeping calm and carrying on, bearing in mind the World Health Organization\u2019s warning that this is about containing the social and economic damage caused by mass outbreaks, as well as saving lives. Japan is closing all its schools but the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was clear, when briefing MPs on Wednesday, that this government would seek to keep schools open wherever it could. The scientific advice is seemingly that the economic and social disruption caused by widespread closures, which stop parents going to work, isn\u2019t worth it at this stage. The unspoken fear is obviously that there may be more than enough economic disruption as it is, with efforts to contain the virus hampering the free movement of goods and people around the world. The modern equivalent of Eyam\u2019s bolt of cloth is lorry drivers shuttling between factory depots, or middle managers flying to and from meetings, meeting and greeting and sneezing and coughing as they go. Airlines freezing recruitment, restaurants reporting cancellations and factories running low on parts are only the most visible signifiers of what may be to come. But when the WHO urges countries to step up preparations, it isn\u2019t just talking about hospital beds and economic resilience and endlessly reminding people to wash their hands. This isn\u2019t just a test of clinical resources but a test too, in some ways, of Britons\u2019 willingness to put ourselves out for others. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t another Eyam. But we have a choice about whether to be vicars or squires, all the same. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Pandemic fears mount that virus \u2018could get out of control\u2019</h2> \n<p>Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Friday.</p> \n<p>Fears that the coronavirus outbreak will be officially declared a global pandemic have grown after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-found-in-sub-saharan-africa-as-who-says-spread-could-get-out-of-control\">the first case was confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Nigeria\u2019s health ministry said the case was found in Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s biggest cities, with a population of 20 million people. Africa has recorded only two cases up to now, one in Algeria and one in Egypt. The spread of contagion to countries with poor public health systems has alarmed the World Health Organization, which said it could \u201cget out of control\u201d. The news was also greeted by financial markets as another sign that attempts to contain the virus have failed. Shares in Asia Pacific were hammered for the fifth day running and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-could-trigger-damage-on-scale-of-2008-financial-crisis-covid-19\">world stock markets are on course for their worst week </a>since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008.</p> \n<p>In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/uk-two-more-patients-in-england-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">schools and offices could shut for months</a> if a pandemic takes hold, according to the chief medical officer, while government and NHS documents show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-england-only-has-15-beds-for-worst-respiratory-cases\">England only has 15 specialist beds for severe respiratory cases.</a> The risk of large public gatherings is also threatening sporting events. Two leading cyclists, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish, are among riders who will be tested for the coronavirus after the UAE Tour was cancelled when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/chris-froome-facing-coronavirus-test-after-uae-tour-is-cancelled\">two participants contracted Covid-19</a>. But Uefa has insisted that the European Football Championship will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/italy-can-host-euros-despite-coronavirus-says-uefa\">kick off in Rome as planned</a> in June. In South Korea, members of a sect at the centre of the biggest outbreak outside China say <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/were-treated-like-criminals-south-korean-sect-feels-coronavirus-backlash\">they feel scapegoated for the spread of the disease</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re being treated like criminals,\u201d says one worshipper in Seoul.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Out of credit \u2013</strong> Universal credit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/universal-credit-linked-psychological-stress-increase-study-benefits-uk\">has led to an increase in mental health problems</a> among people claiming it, according to the first major study to quantify the impact of the controversial benefit system. The study published in The Lancet says the roll-out of the system has led to a 6.6% increase in psychological distress among claimants, or around 63,674 people. The report suggests more than 21,000 may have become clinically depressed. Stress factors included a five-week wait for a first payment, leading to claimant debt, rent arrears and the removal of benefits. Professor Dame Margaret Whitehead, co-author of the report, called on the government to reform the system.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Labour clashes \u2013 </strong>Labour leadership rivals Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/27/nandy-and-starmer-clash-over-brexit-and-antisemitism-in-tv-debate\">have clashed over Brexit and antisemitism in a televised hustings event</a>. In a veiled assault on Starmer\u2019s record as shadow Brexit secretary, Nandy called the party\u2019s policy for a second referendum an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d. She also said the party had suffered a \u201ccollective failure of leadership\u201d at the top over antisemitism. Starmer dismissed her claims as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said he spoke out on the issue.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Syria flashpoint \u2013 </strong>Dozens of Turkish troops have been killed in a bombing raid by pro-Syrian government forces in Idlib, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/dozens-of-turkish-soldiers-killed-in-strike-in-idlib-in-syria-reports-say\">ratcheting up tensions in the war-torn country</a>. Turkish officials said 33 military personnel died in the airstrike on Thursday night while sources among the factions fighting in the area near the Turkey-Syria border said the deaths followed a precision strike on a two-storey building in the village of Balioun. Turkey supports rebels fighting the Syrian regime but that has pitted them against Russian forces who have fought alongside Syrian government troops in a ferocious three-month long assault on Idlib.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Home alone \u2013 </strong>Priti Patel, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/27/priti-patel-tried-to-have-home-office-official-sacked-on-christmas-eve\">has become embroiled in another controversy</a> about her relations with officials after it was reported that she tried to oust the Home Office communications chief. It is claimed that she asked her permanent secretary to sack Andy Tighe on Christmas Eve, but the top civil servant, Philip Rutnam, refused. Tighe has since taken retirement but Patel\u2019s relationship with Rutnam has deteriorated amid claims of her bullying of staff.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"322c2f8af44e0321a2f36ed9bfb0db22364bac5d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/322c2f8af44e0321a2f36ed9bfb0db22364bac5d/0_418_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A model dinosaur in Crystal Palace park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model dinosaur in Crystal Palace park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Saved for the nation \u2013 </strong>Historic England will announce today that the lifesize dinosaurs that have captivated visitors to Crystal Palace park since the 19th century <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/28/crystal-palaces-lifesize-dinosaurs-added-to-heritage-at-risk-register\">will be added to its heritage at risk register </a>after cracks started to appear in the models. The Victorian Jurassic Park evolved from the Great Exhibition of 1851 to nurture appreciation of giant creatures such as the megalosaurus and iguanodon. But it is thought ground movement and changing water levels are causing the statues to deteriorate with some losing teeth, toes and tails.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast</h2> \n<p>Ballots went out to Labour members this week as the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader intensifies.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Pandemic fears mount that virus \u2018could get out of control\u2019 Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Friday. Fears that the coronavirus outbreak will be officially declared a global pandemic have grown after the first case was confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria\u2019s health ministry said the case was found in Lagos, one of Africa\u2019s biggest cities, with a population of 20 million people. Africa has recorded only two cases up to now, one in Algeria and one in Egypt. The spread of contagion to countries with poor public health systems has alarmed the World Health Organization, which said it could \u201cget out of control\u201d. The news was also greeted by financial markets as another sign that attempts to contain the virus have failed. Shares in Asia Pacific were hammered for the fifth day running and world stock markets are on course for their worst week since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008. In the UK, schools and offices could shut for months if a pandemic takes hold, according to the chief medical officer, while government and NHS documents show England only has 15 specialist beds for severe respiratory cases. The risk of large public gatherings is also threatening sporting events. Two leading cyclists, Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish, are among riders who will be tested for the coronavirus after the UAE Tour was cancelled when two participants contracted Covid-19. But Uefa has insisted that the European Football Championship will kick off in Rome as planned in June. In South Korea, members of a sect at the centre of the biggest outbreak outside China say they feel scapegoated for the spread of the disease. \u201cWe\u2019re being treated like criminals,\u201d says one worshipper in Seoul. * * * Out of credit \u2013 Universal credit has led to an increase in mental health problems among people claiming it, according to the first major study to quantify the impact of the controversial benefit system. The study published in The Lancet says the roll-out of the system has led to a 6.6% increase in psychological distress among claimants, or around 63,674 people. The report suggests more than 21,000 may have become clinically depressed. Stress factors included a five-week wait for a first payment, leading to claimant debt, rent arrears and the removal of benefits. Professor Dame Margaret Whitehead, co-author of the report, called on the government to reform the system. * * * Labour clashes \u2013 Labour leadership rivals Keir Starmer and Lisa Nandy have clashed over Brexit and antisemitism in a televised hustings event. In a veiled assault on Starmer\u2019s record as shadow Brexit secretary, Nandy called the party\u2019s policy for a second referendum an \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d. She also said the party had suffered a \u201ccollective failure of leadership\u201d at the top over antisemitism. Starmer dismissed her claims as \u201cnonsense\u201d and said he spoke out on the issue. * * * Syria flashpoint \u2013 Dozens of Turkish troops have been killed in a bombing raid by pro-Syrian government forces in Idlib, ratcheting up tensions in the war-torn country. Turkish officials said 33 military personnel died in the airstrike on Thursday night while sources among the factions fighting in the area near the Turkey-Syria border said the deaths followed a precision strike on a two-storey building in the village of Balioun. Turkey supports rebels fighting the Syrian regime but that has pitted them against Russian forces who have fought alongside Syrian government troops in a ferocious three-month long assault on Idlib. * * * Home alone \u2013 Priti Patel, the home secretary, has become embroiled in another controversy about her relations with officials after it was reported that she tried to oust the Home Office communications chief. It is claimed that she asked her permanent secretary to sack Andy Tighe on Christmas Eve, but the top civil servant, Philip Rutnam, refused. Tighe has since taken retirement but Patel\u2019s relationship with Rutnam has deteriorated amid claims of her bullying of staff. * * * Saved for the nation \u2013 Historic England will announce today that the lifesize dinosaurs that have captivated visitors to Crystal Palace park since the 19th century will be added to its heritage at risk register after cracks started to appear in the models. The Victorian Jurassic Park evolved from the Great Exhibition of 1851 to nurture appreciation of giant creatures such as the megalosaurus and iguanodon. But it is thought ground movement and changing water levels are causing the statues to deteriorate with some losing teeth, toes and tails. Today in Focus podcast Ballots went out to Labour members this week as the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader intensifies. The candidates \u2013 Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy \u2013 all made their pitches to a live audience at this week\u2019s Guardian hustings in Manchester with Anushka Asthana. Lunchtime read: \u2018I was a sexual badass,\u2019 says pop firebrand Halsey Halsey, the chart-topping American pop firebrand, says that her outspoken commentary about the industry means that \u201cnobody wants to be her friend\u201d. But she is wildly popular with her audience and has opened up about her struggles with bipolar disorder (\u201cartists need to take better care of themselves\u201d), relationships (\u201cI was a sexual badass\u201d) and the industry (\u201cArt still works!\u201d) as she releases her third album, Manic, and prepares for a UK tour. Sport Mikel Arteta could not hide the pain of Arsenal\u2019s agonising Europa League defeat to Olympiakos, which removes their most likely to route to Champions League football. Another scintillating Bruno Fernandes display swept Manchester United into the last 16 and on this showing they are serious contenders for a second crown in three years. Celtic were knocked out of the competition as two late goals gave Copenhagen a 3-1 away win and a 4-2 aggregate victory while Wolves advanced 6-3 on aggregate despite a 3-2 defeat to Espanyol, with Pedro Neto missing an open goal as Jonathan Calleri hit a hat-trick. Chelsea\u2019s women have never won the League Cup but they have the chance to break their duck against Arsenal this weekend. Wales are confident Liam Williams will be available for selection against England at Twickenham next week more than four months after the Lions full-back suffered an ankle injury in training during the World Cup. Ian Watmore, a former FA chief executive and senior civil servant, will succeed Colin Graves as the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board. And a female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship in North Carolina, while competing against boys. Business The market meltdown is set to worsen again in Europe and the US today with FTSE100 futures pointing to a drop of more than 3% at the opening bell this morning and the Dow Jones in Wall Street on track to shed 2%. A range of indicators flashed serious warnings including the Vix volatility index, also known as the fear index, which spiked to its highest level since 2011. Brent crude oil \u2013 a barometer for world growth \u2013 is close to dipping below $50 a barrel. The pound is on $1.288 and \u20ac1.172. The papers Coronavirus occupies the front of most of the papers today. The Times and the Telegraph both agree on the lead story today \u2013 \u201cTop sports events under threat from coronavirus\u2019\u201d, says the former, and \u201cMajor events in doubt as coronavirus fears grow\u201d for the latter.

Any potential hit to the Australian economy will further deepen damage done by bushfires and floods that have ravaged the east coast in recent months \u2013 although the extra day in February on Saturday may save the Morrison government the embarrassment of statistics showing a shrinking GDP. Statistics released on Friday show government revenue has already taken a savage hit from the series of natural disasters, reducing the government\u2019s chances of declaring a much-ballyhooed budget surplus in May. The budget position was $3.7bn worse at the end of January than predicted in mid-year update numbers released the previous month, data released by finance minister Mathias Cormann revealed. On the market, a heavy day of selling that tested brokers\u2019 computer systems pushed the benchmark ASX200 index down 3.25%, or 9.8% for the week \u2013 taking it to the 10% mark that signifies a market \u201ccorrection\u201d and resets expectations of future growth. The week of falls has wiped more than $200bn from the market and ravaged stocks that are exposed to China or the travel industry, including airlines, miners and educators. But no sector has been exempt from the sell-off. Just 11 companies in the ASX200 index escaped a fall on Friday. They included Bega Cheese, which is in a trading halt after telling the market its profit results for last year and the year before might be wrong due to an error in its accounting systems. Retailer Harvey Norman, which had suffered only minor falls during the week, saw its share price collapse by 14% \u2013 the biggest decline of the day \u2013 as investors fled the stock following a disappointing half-year result. The company, long a target for short-sellers, said \u201cwidespread bushfires and associated severe reductions in air quality that affected many communities\u201d had hit franchisees during the peak Christmas shopping season, leading to a 4.1% fall in its profits for the six months to the end of December compared to the same time the previous year.

But unless three days are available that means there is not enough time to play the traditional three pool games, quarters, semis and final, plus ranking games for losers. The men\u2019s teams have made their displeasure known. Speaking to the Guardian, so did USA coach Mike Friday.</p> <p>\u201cAll 16 teams are totally 100% disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is it depriving the passionate rugby supporter that comes to the stadiums, and putting them off coming to the stadiums, by the fact you don\u2019t have the ebb and the flow that quarter-finals bring and you don\u2019t get to see your team play as often as you\u2019d want.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need a healthy balance on the integration with the women\u2019s game, to make sure the game grows globally</p> <footer> <cite>Mike Friday</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cAlso, taking away that bottom-eight tournament on the second day deprives the developing nations of an opportunity to get battle scars in the coliseum, so to speak. That hurts sponsors of those nations and it hurts their unions.</p> <p>\u201cOf course we understand the broadcasting bit, getting that golden two hours right, but I think we have to recognise the essence of the game. We need a healthy balance on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/25/evania-pelite-rugby-sevens-is-driving-standards-for-womens-sport-in-australia\">integration with the women\u2019s game</a>, to make sure the game grows globally. We\u2019re hoping World Rugby will get it right \u2026 we need further engagement with the stakeholders, the players and the coaches and those who are in it day to day.</p> <p>\u201cIn Sydney and Hamilton the stadiums were empty and at times in Cape Town they were empty. We need to be very careful we don\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d</p> <p>In LA, in fact, the issue is on hiatus. The women\u2019s Eagles won their event <a href=\"https://www.world.rugby/sevens-series/stage/1964/fixtures\">in Glendale, Colorado in October</a> so at the home of the Chargers of the NFL and the Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Friday\u2019s hard-running stars will play the regular format across Saturday and Sunday.</p> <p>But Dan Lyle, the former Bath, Leicester and USA No8 leading LA for the sports and entertainment giant AEG, pointed to the strains of organising any sevens tournament when he described what that will mean: \u201cNBC has to go off the air at 5pm PT on Sunday because they want to go to hockey. So that means our final has to be at 4.30, which means our first game of the day has to be at 8.15 in the morning.\u201d</p> <p>In a way, the punishing schedule conveys authenticity: sevens tournaments began 140 years ago in the Scottish borders and were played from dawn to dusk.

      "bodyText": "The World Rugby HSBC Sevens Series arrives at Dignity Health Sports Park in Los Angeles on Saturday with the health and some say the dignity of the shortened game under unusual strain. Thanks to the coronavirus, the showpiece Hong Kong Sevens and the Singapore event that follows have been postponed to October, after the Tokyo Olympics in July, should the Games survive the outbreak themselves. On the circuit, meanwhile, a row about the format of individual events shows no sign of quietening down. Under the auspices of World Rugby, men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments are now often staged together, as a way to \u201ccreate more opportunities for the women\u2019s game\u201d. But unless three days are available that means there is not enough time to play the traditional three pool games, quarters, semis and final, plus ranking games for losers. The men\u2019s teams have made their displeasure known. Speaking to the Guardian, so did USA coach Mike Friday. \u201cAll 16 teams are totally 100% disappointed,\u201d he said. \u201cNot only is it depriving the passionate rugby supporter that comes to the stadiums, and putting them off coming to the stadiums, by the fact you don\u2019t have the ebb and the flow that quarter-finals bring and you don\u2019t get to see your team play as often as you\u2019d want. \u201cAlso, taking away that bottom-eight tournament on the second day deprives the developing nations of an opportunity to get battle scars in the coliseum, so to speak. That hurts sponsors of those nations and it hurts their unions. \u201cOf course we understand the broadcasting bit, getting that golden two hours right, but I think we have to recognise the essence of the game. We need a healthy balance on the integration with the women\u2019s game, to make sure the game grows globally. We\u2019re hoping World Rugby will get it right \u2026 we need further engagement with the stakeholders, the players and the coaches and those who are in it day to day. \u201cIn Sydney and Hamilton the stadiums were empty and at times in Cape Town they were empty. We need to be very careful we don\u2019t allow that to continue.\u201d In LA, in fact, the issue is on hiatus. The women\u2019s Eagles won their event in Glendale, Colorado in October so at the home of the Chargers of the NFL and the Galaxy of Major League Soccer, Friday\u2019s hard-running stars will play the regular format across Saturday and Sunday. But Dan Lyle, the former Bath, Leicester and USA No8 leading LA for the sports and entertainment giant AEG, pointed to the strains of organising any sevens tournament when he described what that will mean: \u201cNBC has to go off the air at 5pm PT on Sunday because they want to go to hockey. So that means our final has to be at 4.30, which means our first game of the day has to be at 8.15 in the morning.\u201d In a way, the punishing schedule conveys authenticity: sevens tournaments began 140 years ago in the Scottish borders and were played from dawn to dusk. The whole idea is to test fitness and resilience to breaking point, something which Friday talks of doing during the break enforced by the coronavirus. \u201cIt means a massive shift and reshuffle but we have our plans,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are going to use that period wisely and it will be a tough, dark one for the boys. We\u2019ll probably get some competition to keep ticking over but we\u2019ll keep them doing heavy resilience work to make them battle-ready for what\u2019s coming down the track.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 As Bob Dylan almost sang, other things have changed. Most immediately, the US tournament is back in LA after 16 years away, having been played in San Diego from 2007 to 2009 before moving to Las Vegas for a successful 10-year run, the last two producing American victories. Off the record, players and coaches talk of Vegas having had problems in terms of facilities and infrastructure, including a field of narrow football dimensions and hotels devoted, obviously, to tourism rather than elite athletes. On the record, Steve Lewis of Rugby Wrap Up has written about the switch in organiser, from United World Sports to AEG. \u201cThe proof will be in the pudding,\u201d said Lyle, adding: \u201cSales are good, although I don\u2019t know if it will match or exceed Vegas. There and in San Diego we found 50% of tickets were sold in the week of the event and a large proportion were walk-ups. In America we have not conditioned people to buy. Rugby doesn\u2019t sell out, you know?\u201d All Blacks visits to Chicago aside that\u2019s true, though Major League Rugby is now staging 15-a-side in 12 cities and awareness is growing, slowly. Lyle talks of \u201cgetting communities actively involved\u201d and \u201cpushing the reset button for a new start, even given how successful Vegas was\u201d. Most of the model, however, has been transferred: LA will host a huge club Invitational and beach and junior tournaments too, all as part of a \u201crunway to the Olympics\u201d given that in 2028, the Games will come to LA. \u2022\u2022\u2022 On the field, last season was the Eagles men\u2019s best: they went into the last tournament in Paris with a chance of the series title. As it happened Fiji, the Olympic champions, took gold again but second was enough to make the USA automatic qualifiers for Tokyo. Now, the Eagles are sixth on the ladder.

Asked to name less well-known players to keep an eye on this weekend, Friday picks out Naima Fuala\u2019au and Cody Melphy, young \u201ctempo playmakers\u201d out of California and Colorado vying to fill the hole left by Niua. Friday confesses to having \u201cvery happy memories of Los Angeles\u201d, because his England team won the last tournament there, in 2006. \u201cWe smashed Fiji,\u201d he said, laughing, \u201cby 50-odd points in the final.\u201d In fact it was 38-5 but if his US team can get even close to repeating that feat, the rugby world will surely take notice.",

It\u2019s not for a lack of trying \u2013 I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to buy a private health insurance plan on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Since I can\u2019t afford to see a doctor, my healthcare strategy as a 32-year-old uninsured American has been simply to sleep eight hours, eat vegetables, and get daily exercise. But now that there are confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, the deadly virus could spread rapidly, thanks to others like me who have no feasible way to get the care we need if we start exhibiting symptoms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/27/mike-pence-coronavirus-response-experts\">Mike Pence \u2018not up to task\u2019 of leading US coronavirus response, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are confirmed coronavirus cases in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/locations-confirmed-cases.html\">at least 50 countries</a> on six continents, and <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">more than 2,800 patients</a> have died from the virus. This certainly <a href=\"https://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/89/7/11-088815/en/\">qualifies as a pandemic</a> under the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) definition of the term, which, under a typical presidency, should necessitate a swift response from US health officials. However, the Trump administration appears to still be prioritizing the profit margin of the healthcare industry over preventing the spread of a deadly pandemic.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, (<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/leadership/secretary/alex-m-azar/index.html\">a former senior executive</a> at pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmcauliff/status/1232789512490799104\">refused to commit</a> to implementing price controls on a coronavirus vaccine \u201cbecause we need the private sector to invest \u2026 price controls won\u2019t get us there\u201d. Even the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, notably didn\u2019t use the word \u201cfree\u201d when referring to a coronavirus vaccine, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ABC/status/1233064567464439808\">instead used the word \u201caffordable\u201d</a>. What may be considered affordable for the third-most powerful person in the US government with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/projects/how-much-are-they-worth/nancy-pelosi/\">net worth of $16m</a> may not be affordable for someone who can\u2019t afford a basic private health insurance plan that still requires a patient to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket.</p> <p>Given the high cost of healthcare in the US, I haven\u2019t seen a doctor since 2013, when I visited an emergency room after being run off the road while riding my bike. After waiting for four hours, the doctor put my arm in a sling, prescribed pain medication and sent me home. That visit cost more than $4,000, and the unpaid balance eventually went to collections and still haunts my credit to this day, making it needlessly difficult to rent an apartment or buy a car.

      "bodyText": "Like 27.5 million other Americans, I don\u2019t have health insurance. It\u2019s not for a lack of trying \u2013 I make too much to qualify for Medicaid, but not enough to buy a private health insurance plan on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Since I can\u2019t afford to see a doctor, my healthcare strategy as a 32-year-old uninsured American has been simply to sleep eight hours, eat vegetables, and get daily exercise. But now that there are confirmed coronavirus cases in the United States, the deadly virus could spread rapidly, thanks to others like me who have no feasible way to get the care we need if we start exhibiting symptoms. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are confirmed coronavirus cases in at least 50 countries on six continents, and more than 2,800 patients have died from the virus. This certainly qualifies as a pandemic under the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) definition of the term, which, under a typical presidency, should necessitate a swift response from US health officials. However, the Trump administration appears to still be prioritizing the profit margin of the healthcare industry over preventing the spread of a deadly pandemic. Earlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary, Alex Azar, (a former senior executive at pharmaceutical manufacturer Eli Lilly) refused to commit to implementing price controls on a coronavirus vaccine \u201cbecause we need the private sector to invest \u2026 price controls won\u2019t get us there\u201d. Even the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, notably didn\u2019t use the word \u201cfree\u201d when referring to a coronavirus vaccine, and instead used the word \u201caffordable\u201d. What may be considered affordable for the third-most powerful person in the US government with an estimated net worth of $16m may not be affordable for someone who can\u2019t afford a basic private health insurance plan that still requires a patient to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket. Given the high cost of healthcare in the US, I haven\u2019t seen a doctor since 2013, when I visited an emergency room after being run off the road while riding my bike. After waiting for four hours, the doctor put my arm in a sling, prescribed pain medication and sent me home. That visit cost more than $4,000, and the unpaid balance eventually went to collections and still haunts my credit to this day, making it needlessly difficult to rent an apartment or buy a car. But even a low-premium bronze plan on the exchange comes with a sky-high deductible in the thousands of dollars, meaning even if I was insured, I\u2019d have still paid for that ER visit entirely out of pocket. This system is exactly why a 2018 West Health Institute/NORC at the University of Chicago national poll found that 44% of Americans declined to see a doctor due to cost, and why nearly a third of Americans polled said they didn\u2019t get their prescriptions filled due to the high cost of their medicine. This is the same system that killed 38-year-old Texas public school teacher Heather Holland, who couldn\u2019t afford the $116 co-pay for her flu medication and later died from flu complications. It\u2019s the same system that Guardian contributor Luke O\u2019Neil refers to as \u201cGo viral or die trying\u201d, in which Americans who can\u2019t afford life-saving healthcare procedures are forced to become their own advocate and PR agency by launching a viral GoFundMe campaign to ask strangers on the internet to save their lives. When you multiply my situation by 27.5 million, you end up with a country full of people who won\u2019t see a doctor unless they\u2019re extremely sick. And when you combine a for-profit healthcare system \u2013 in which only those wealthy enough to get care actually receive it \u2013 with a global pandemic, the only outcome will be unmitigated disaster.

Covid-19 case in sub-Saharan Africa raises pandemic fears After a day on which the Dow Jones plunged by a record 1,190 points, analysts have warned that a coronavirus pandemic could trigger a financial crisis on the same scale as 2008. Donald Trump\u2019s pick to lead the US response, his vice-president, Mike Pence, has been widely criticised for his record on health issues, while low-income Americans without paid sick leave or, in many cases, health insurance, remain the most at risk from a Covid-19 outbreak.

Scott\u2019s relatives tell Oliver Laughland they hope criminal justice reform remains on the ballot. Trump\u2019s conservative faithful plan for second term at CPAC Taking time out from his new role managing the administration\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis, Mike Pence took to the stage at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday to promise another four years of Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp,\u201d he said, to rapturous applause from the crowd.

Opinion Carl Gibson is one of 27.5 million Americans with no health insurance. If a coronavirus pandemic hits the US, he says, they could all be left without a feasible way to get the care they need. When you multiply my situation by 27.5 million, you end up with a country full of people who won\u2019t see a doctor unless they\u2019re extremely sick. And when you combine a for-profit healthcare system \u2013 in which only those wealthy enough to get care actually receive it \u2013 with a global pandemic, the only outcome will be unmitigated disaster. Sport After six years of delays, David Beckham\u2019s MLS franchise Inter Miami will at last make its debut this weekend. Chris Smith asks whether the city of Miami will actually care, while Francisco Navas and Jakub Frankowicz assess the best new players in the North American league. High school junior Heaven Fitch has become the first girl ever to win one of North Carolina\u2019s individual state wrestling championships, claiming victory over all seven male contenders in the 106lb weight class. \u201cI kind of dominated the match,\u201d she said afterwards.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> \n<p>Eight years after she died, Whitney Houston is to make a stadium comeback tour. At least a hologram of her is. So thousands of people will be paying to see someone who isn\u2019t really there, while a live band plays along to a recording of her voice. However much you may have loved Whitney, it\u2019s hard to think of anything more genuinely pointless. Do people imagine they are getting the same experience as if she was still alive? I\u2019ve always felt that I lost out by being too young to see Maria Callas on stage, but nothing would induce me to attend a performance of Tosca in which a hologram of her appeared alongside current opera stars. Just about the only place where such fakery might work would be Eurovision. Personally, I\u2019ve never got why so many people take the song contest so seriously. It seems self-evident both that most nations don\u2019t much like the UK and vote in blocs against us and that we actually quite like the feeling of coming nearly last. Which is why the public invariably has chosen an entirely forgettable and rubbish song. Nor does this year\u2019s attempt to professionalise the UK entry by cutting out the public middlemen and getting a record company to make the selection appear to have made any difference.

The leadership contest has dragged on for so long that they know exactly what the other is thinking and can almost finish each other\u2019s sentences. They could certainly deliver each other\u2019s election pitches as word perfectly and convincingly as they do their own. It\u2019s not so much a contest as a touring roadshow where each of them does their 90-minute act and everyone plays by the rules. Each of them tells the same stories and makes the same gags while the others pretend they are hearing them for the first time and nod and laugh appropriately. Not that there aren\u2019t some differences between them \u2013 Starmer frequently gets it in the neck for being both the architect of Labour\u2019s Brexit policy and a typical white, male politician \u2013 but none of the barbs are ever intended to inflict any lasting damage.

Starmer knows he\u2019s the frontrunner but is at pains to prove he is taking nothing for granted. There\u2019s another five weeks of this to go and all three will be glad when it\u2019s over. Whatever the result.</p> \n<h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> \n<p>In a speech to his followers in St Peter\u2019s Square, Pope Francis urged Catholics to give up insulting one another on social media for lent. \u201cThis is a time to give up useless words, gossip, rumours, tittle-tattle and speak to God on a first-name basis,\u201d he said. Judging by my own Twitter feed not too many in the UK have taken heed of the Pope\u2019s suggestion. Little more than a week after the \u201cBe Kind\u201d campaign was started following the death of Caroline Flack, some newspapers and individuals with a large number of followers seem to have gone straight back to either stirring up or condoning Twitter wars against any passing target. At times like these, I count myself lucky to have been blocked by Piers Morgan. I\u2019ve never yet gotten round to giving anything up for lent. Partly because I have already given up most of the things that are bad for you \u2013 not out of any moral superiority, rather from a health necessity \u2013 and the idea of moving on to chocolate fills me with a sense of despair. But also because I\u2019ve never been entirely sure of the purpose of giving things up for six weeks. Is it more a way of doing something positive for oneself or a form of self-punishment? My suspicion, having as a child observed my father give up alcohol every lent, is that for most people it\u2019s predominantly the latter. Part of the attraction of self-denial is the deferred pleasure you know you will get from restarting at Easter. Besides which, I don\u2019t really need any more extended trials in self-hatred as I do that regularly anyway. There hasn\u2019t been a day this year when I haven\u2019t woken up with a ball of anxiety in my gut and an overwhelming sense of failure in my head. Some days it\u2019s been a struggle even to leave the house. So in my version of lent, I would much rather take things up that make me feel like a better person than cut things out. The problem is that I don\u2019t seem to have enough will power to start.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> \n<p>Ever since Boris Johnson became prime minister, I\u2019ve had this lingering feeling that his government is trying to gaslight the country. That we are being asked to accept as normal things that just aren\u2019t. Ministers regularly shift their positions on almost everything and it is people who have the temerity to remember these reverse ferrets who get the blame for talking the UK down. Just weeks before last year\u2019s election, Boris insisted there was a million to one chance of the UK leaving the EU without a trade deal and at no point during the campaign did he do anything to correct this impression. Yet now the government is insisting that a 50-50 chance of no deal is the position it had all along. Nor does it seem normal that the prime minister should give himself a holiday during the floods \u2013 part of the job description is doing the front of house stuff, such as empathy with victims and the emergency services \u2013 or that ministers should avoid some news channels at a time when the country is threatened with a global pandemic. It feels reckless and irresponsible. I could go on as there are countless other examples, but Boris clearly believes in his own exceptionalism. That people don\u2019t care enough and that he can get away with stuff other prime ministers couldn\u2019t. I hope he\u2019s wrong, though I\u2019m starting to doubt myself. Just the other day, I found myself wondering if it was me who had got everything wrong. What if Brexit did turn out to be a wonderful success? That the north and south levelled up, the economy boomed, 40 hospitals did get built, social care and homelessness were fixed, mental health provision was available on demand, crime levels fell and the UK did become a more open, tolerant society who got on well with its European neighbours. If it did, would my own sense of identity collapse? I\u2019ve mentioned this to my therapist and several friends. They\u2019ve all told me not to worry. It\u2019s just not going to happen.</p> \n<h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> \n<p>Like many hypochondriacs I know, I\u2019ve spent much of the past six weeks being relatively unbothered by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/uk-coronavirus-cases-rise-46-as-fears-of-global-crisis-grow\">the coronavirus</a>. My health anxieties tend to be focused on conditions with a far higher fatality rate than about 2%, most of whom will be the very elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. Or, to put it brutally selfishly, people not like me. But just this week as the virus rapidly approaches pandemic proportions and it\u2019s clear both that the World Health Organization has no idea how to stop it and that the UK government has almost no contingency plans in place \u2013 15 high-dependency beds and the hope of flying a few more patients out to Sweden is unlikely to meet demand if worst fears of a 50% infection rate and 500,000 deaths prove accurate \u2013 have given me a few wobbles. Not enough to go out and buy face-masks and hand sanitiser, but enough to make me think that I could possibly be dead by the end of next month. In which case, maybe I should be putting my affairs in order. I\u2019ve also been disturbed by reports of people being infected with the coronavirus a second time, as it occurred to me that it could be a virus that keeps coming for you and coming for you until it finally eliminates you. Not that I want to alarm you. Just putting you in touch with the thoughts of someone who has never yet found a situation that could not get worse. I also did vaguely wonder if this was all a government plot. For more than six months, Boris Johnson has insisted he has a fully thought out and costed plan for social care but has so far refused to share it with the country. Maybe the coronavirus was the secret plan all along.</p> \n<p><strong>Digested week: The part-time prime minister.</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b4e20aa26800aff04d5859c2c9ee43cebdd6e31\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b4e20aa26800aff04d5859c2c9ee43cebdd6e31/0_153_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald and Melania Trump at the Taj Mahal:\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal: \u2018Disneyland does this so much better.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Monday Eight years after she died, Whitney Houston is to make a stadium comeback tour. At least a hologram of her is. So thousands of people will be paying to see someone who isn\u2019t really there, while a live band plays along to a recording of her voice. However much you may have loved Whitney, it\u2019s hard to think of anything more genuinely pointless. Do people imagine they are getting the same experience as if she was still alive? I\u2019ve always felt that I lost out by being too young to see Maria Callas on stage, but nothing would induce me to attend a performance of Tosca in which a hologram of her appeared alongside current opera stars. Just about the only place where such fakery might work would be Eurovision. Personally, I\u2019ve never got why so many people take the song contest so seriously. It seems self-evident both that most nations don\u2019t much like the UK and vote in blocs against us and that we actually quite like the feeling of coming nearly last. Which is why the public invariably has chosen an entirely forgettable and rubbish song. Nor does this year\u2019s attempt to professionalise the UK entry by cutting out the public middlemen and getting a record company to make the selection appear to have made any difference. On one hearing \u2013 more than enough \u2013 the chosen song is just as crap as ever. If we really wanted to get serious about winning the competition again, we should enter a hologram of a barefooted Sandie Shaw singing Puppet on a String. That would clean up, just as it did back in 1967.

      "bodyText": "Nigeria has reported the first confirmed case of coronavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, as investor alarm over a potential global pandemic deepened stock market losses around the world. Nigerian officials said the case involved an Italian citizen who entered the country on 24 February on a Turkish Airlines flight from Milan via Istanbul. The virus has proliferated around the globe over the past week, emerging in every continent except Antarctica, prompting many governments and businesses to try to stop people travelling or gathering in crowded places. Switzerland became the latest country to announce drastic measures on Friday, saying all events with more than 1,000 participants would be suspended until 15 March. The ban forced the cancellation of next week\u2019s Geneva international motor show \u2013 a major fixture on the global car industry calendar. The Nigerian case is just the third to be confirmed in Africa, something that has puzzled health specialists given the continent\u2019s close ties to China.

In other developments on Friday: Officials confirmed 20 new cases in France in 24 hours, after President Emmanuel Macron warned on Thursday that the country was on the brink of an epidemic. In Italy the death toll rose to 17. About 1,000 people were in quarantine in Germany\u2019s most populous state, as the number of confirmed cases in Europe\u2019s biggest economy exceeded 50. Lithuania and New Zealand reported their first confirmed cases. The first case was confirmed in Wales, taking the total in the UK to 19. China recorded 44 more deaths and 327 new confirmed cases, as the spread of the virus continued to slow in the country. South Korea announced 571 new cases, bringing the total number of infections to 2,337, by far the largest outside China. Californian health officials said they were monitoring 8,400 people for symptoms after their arrival on domestic flights. Australian doctors warned the public health system could be overwhelmed in the event of a pandemic, a day after the government launched its emergency response programme. The spread of the virus prompted investors to take decisive action on Friday, when global markets plummeted again. The Dow Jones had its biggest one-day fall on Thursday, plunging 1,190 points, or 4.4%, with analysts warning the virus could cause as much damage as the 2008-09 global financial crisis. Shares followed suit in the Asian trading session on Friday, while Brent crude was poised to dip below $50 a barrel for the first time in four years. Donald Trump was upbeat about the virus for a second day, saying on Thursday night that US agencies were doing a \u201cfine job\u201d and in the US and China, cases of Covid-19 were going down. But where the Dow led, Asian markets followed, with markets in Australia, China, Japan and South Korea all posting heavy losses. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, pledged to protect the economy, as the Japanese island of Hokkaido declared a state of emergency and urged all residents to stay home this weekend. Nigeria is Africa\u2019s most populous country, with 190 million people and numerous air links around the continent and beyond. \u201cGiven these recent developments globally and in Africa, it is not unlikely that we will have importation of Covid-19 to South Africa,\u201d that country\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases said on Friday. Separately, South Africa said two citizens who had been working on the Princess Diamond cruise ship had the virus and would remain in Japan for treatment.

The average price of a home climbed 2.3% year on year to \u00a3216,092 in February, Nationwide said, the strongest growth rate in 18 months. The news came as the estate agent Foxtons reported an \u00a38.8m loss last year, down sharply from a loss of more than \u00a317m the previous year. It expects sales to improve during 2020.

Nevertheless, Nationwide expects the UK economy to continue expanding at a modest pace, with house prices staying broadly flat. If the forecast proves correct, the fortunes of estate agents could improve. Last year proved challenging for Foxtons: sales revenues fell by 10% to \u00a332.6m as house prices and the number of home sales declined.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cOur procedures for dealing with communicable diseases are similar to those developed during the Sars epidemic and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/what-does-it-mean-if-coronavirus-is-declared-a-pandemic\">other global health emergencies</a>,\u201d the company said.</p> \n<p>IAG said: \u201cOur operating companies will continue to take mitigating actions to better match supply to demand in line with the evolving situation.

EasyJet has convened a special committee of senior managers to deal with the problems arising from the Covid-19 outbreak, the airline said. That group, which includes a company doctor, is meeting on a daily basis. The airline said it was also working closely with authorities. \u201cOur procedures for dealing with communicable diseases are similar to those developed during the Sars epidemic and other global health emergencies,\u201d the company said. IAG said: \u201cOur operating companies will continue to take mitigating actions to better match supply to demand in line with the evolving situation. Cost and revenue initiatives are being implemented across the business.\u201d Walsh said this included restrictions on hiring: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to grow as fast as planned.\u201d The BA and Iberia parent has already suspended flights to mainland China and reduced services for other routes in Asia, including Hong Kong, where it is now only offering one daily flight instead of two. Next month it will significantly cut its capacity on Italian routes by cancelling flights and using smaller aircraft, and will take similar action on short-haul flights across the business. By 13 March, IAG will also cut a daily service to the South Korean capital, Seoul, where it will now only fly three to four times a week. IAG, which also owns the Aer Lingus and Vueling airlines, said it would boost the number of flights on some of BA\u2019s long-haul routes where there is greater demand, including to India, South Africa and the US. The update was released as part of IAG\u2019s full-year results, which showed a 34% drop in pre-tax profits to \u20ac2.3bn (\u00a32bn) despite a 5% rise in revenue to \u20ac22bn (\u00a318.8bn).",

It wasn\u2019t his first offence \u2013 many objected to the misleadingly edited video his team had put out after the debate in Nevada \u2013 and the Sanders tweets were deleted. \u201cIt\u2019s the embracing of a cynical outlook: \u2018Lol nothing matters\u2019,\u201d Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s leaning into nihilism.\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s national poll ratings have flatlined since his disastrous first debate performance \u2013 he remains in third place behind Biden and Sanders \u2013 and he has dipped back below Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg too in the crucial Super Tuesday state of California, when he enters the race proper. Bad week: Donald Trump The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned this week that the coronavirus Covid-19 could could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Donald Trump didn\u2019t like that. On a trip to India earlier that day he had already told reporters that the coronavirus was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. He later hit out at the media for \u201cdoing everything possible to make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That last element seemed key \u2013 an economic slowdown caused by the virus could seriously damage Trump\u2019s chances of re-election, and the stock market is his favourite measure of his own success. The day after a less-than-reassuring press conference in which Trump put the vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the anti-virus effort, the Dow had its worst ever daily drop and the S&amp;P 500 posted its largest fall since August 2011. Worst week: Mike Pence Well, would you want to head up the coronavirus response? Such a poisoned chalice is the vice-president\u2019s new job that there was even speculation Trump could eventually use it as a pretext for dropping Pence from the 2020 ticket \u2013 perhaps replacing him with a telegenic woman such as the former UN ambassador Nikki Haley. Not to worry, though, Pence is \u201creally very expert at the field\u201d of healthcare, as Trump told his press conference on Wednesday. So expert that he notoriously wrote on his website in 2000: \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d And as governor of the midwestern state of Indiana, he faced heavy criticism for his handling of the situation when the state experienced the worst HIV crisis in its history.",

A 2014 CDC study found one in five food service workers said they worked at least once in the previous year while sick with vomiting or diarrhea. These workers cited fear of job loss and not wanting to leave co-workers short-staffed as significant factors in their decision to go to work ill. Karen Scott, a PhD student in management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, warned in an article for the Conversation that when sick employees head into work \u201ca manageable health crisis can spiral out of control\u201d. Scott advised consumers to ask about paid sick leave policies at their favorite restaurants, which could affect company culture. There is also legislation moving to create national paid family and medical leave insurance called the Family Act, and the Healthy Families Act to set a baseline of seven paid sick days each year. That said, the situation isn\u2019t much better for workers who do have paid leave. Workplace culture in the US does not support taking sick days, even when they are needed. An October 2019 study from the global staffing firm Accountemps found 90% of professionals have gone to work with cold or flu symptoms. Private sector workers who do have sick days are given an average of seven days of paid sick leave per year, whether they have been at a company for one, five or 10 years, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. At 20 years of service, the average bumps up to eight paid sick days. This is half the amount of time recommended for a self-quarantine. Even the most basic recommendation: to wash your hands more frequently with soap and water, was challenged by the writer Talia Jane on Twitter. \u201c\u2018Wash your hands\u2019 is great advice to folks who don\u2019t engage with hundreds of people a day,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the floor to wash my hands after each customer whose money and food I touched while bagging their groceries. We also can\u2019t wear gloves or masks.\u201d",

As stocks nosedived on fears of global recession, the Bank of England governor warned of a slowdown in the UK, oil-rich countries considered slashing output and the Geneva motor show was cancelled. The FTSE 100 in London shed more than 3%, recording more than \u00a3200bn of losses in a week that proved to be the most brutal for investors since the depths of the financial crisis in 2008. A day after Wall Street suffered its biggest one-day slump on record, losing 1,190 points in a day, the Dow Jones industrial average went into freefall again, losing just over 1,000 points \u2013 or 4% \u2013 in early trading . It ended the day down 357 points. This took its weekly losses over 12% , the worst since autumn 2008. Reuters calculated that global investors have lost $5tn since Monday as markets priced in the threat of a global recession. Oil-rich countries are considering deep production cuts, according to reports, reflecting the expected impact on global economic activity. The Geneva motor show became the latest major international business event to be cancelled after the Swiss government imposed a ban on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. Amazon told its 798,000 employees to avoid non-essential travel domestically and internationally. In the UK, the law firm Baker McKenzie shut its London office and sent more than 1,000 staff home after a possible coronavirus case was detected. Following warnings from economic analysts that the virus could take a toll akin to the 2008 financial crisis, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, cautioned on Friday that UK growth could be hindered by the effect the outbreak was having on global trade. \u201cWe would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK,\u201d said Carney, who is due to hand over leadership of the Bank to Andrew Bailey on 15 March. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking that up yet at all in the European and UK economic indicators but if the world is slower than the UK, a very open economy, it will have an impact.\u201d Carney told Sky News: \u201cThings are getting tight,\u201d adding that while it was impossible to be precise about the severity or the duration of the effect, \u201cthe direction is down\u201d. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods. There\u2019s less tourism \u2013 as you can see on our streets here in the UK. That\u2019s lower activity as well.\u201d With economic growth at risk, the Opec group of oil-producing nations is expected to discuss increasing planned production cuts at a meeting in Vienna next week. Oil prices reached a 13-month low of $50 a barrel for brent crude this week and any slowdown in economic activity would weigh even heavier on prices, adding to pressure to cut output to balance supply and demand. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer, is expected to discuss with fellow Opec members such as Iran and Iraq whether plans to cut production should be ramped up from 600,000 barrels per day to 1m. The Geneva motor show organisers said Geneva\u2019s economy could lose \u20ac250m (\u00a3213m) this year owing to the cancellation of a show that typically attracts as many as 600,000 executives and car fans.

TUI, which is the only major tour operator in the UK since the demise of Thomas Cook, lost 29% of its value over five days. The no-frills airline easyJet and IAG, the owner of British Airways, have been also particularly badly hit because of the effect on global travel, down 27% and 24% respectively. Both reported significant drops in demand and announced emergency measures on Friday, including cancelling flights, changing the size of planes used on routes and freezing pay.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts have warned that schools could be closed and major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/six-nations-stormzy-mabel-athletics-olympics-which-events-could-be-cancelled-by-coronavirus\">sporting events, concerts and other public gatherings</a> could be cancelled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>Whitty said the country should prepare to face disruption to many normal activities \u201cfor quite a long period of time, probably more than two months\u201d and to pay a heavy \u201csocial cost\u201d for efforts to thwart the virus.</p> \n<p>The NHS may have to cancel planned operations during the peak of a major outbreak to free up beds and staff for patients with coronavirus, he said, adding that the service would find it \u201cquite tricky\u201d to deal with a huge increase in the number of cases.</p> \n<p>The World Health Organization also warned that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51665631\">the outbreak had reached a \u201cdecisive point\u201d</a> and had \u201cpandemic potential\u201d.</p> \n<p>UK ministers are finalising the government\u2019s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cThere is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That\u2019s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.\u201d</p> \n<p>Public Health England is due to launch a major public information campaign next week to educate people about how to minimise the risks of contracting or spreading the virus. Experts have repeatedly stressed that regular hand washing remains the single best way of reducing risk.</p>",

A spokesperson for Jet2 said its responsibility to its \u201ccustomers, our colleagues and the general public remains paramount\u201d. \u201cWe will not fly any customer who has stayed at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace during the quarantine, until this incubation period has passed or unless they have been explicitly tested for Covid-19 by a recognised authority and are confirmed as clear of the virus,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cWe will continue to release more information as it becomes available.\u201d More than 700 were quarantined in the Tenerife hotel after at least four Italian guests were diagnosed with coronavirus. On Thursday, the Canary Islands minister of health said a group of 130 low-risk guests \u2013 including about 50 British nationals \u2013 would be able to leave because they had arrived on Monday and had not come into contact with the four Italians who tested positive. Elsewhere the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Northern Ireland and Wales, with a further two people diagnosed in the UK. Northern Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, said the patient had travelled from northern Italy via Dublin. He told a press conference on Thursday night: \u201cWe have been planning for the first positive case in Northern Ireland and have made clear that it was a question of when, not if.\u201d He added the virus had the potential to become a \u201cglobal pandemic\u201d but there were \u201crobust infection control measures in place\u201d. On Thursday, health officials confirmed two cases of the virus in England in people who had contracted it in northern Italy and Tenerife. On Friday England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said two more patients in England had tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in England to 17 and the UK to 19. Experts in infectious diseases said the two cases identified in the UK early on Thursday were not a cause for concern and that the measures of isolating confirmed cases and tracing potential contacts was working so far. Experts have warned that schools could be closed and major sporting events, concerts and other public gatherings could be cancelled in an effort to contain the spread of the virus. Whitty said the country should prepare to face disruption to many normal activities \u201cfor quite a long period of time, probably more than two months\u201d and to pay a heavy \u201csocial cost\u201d for efforts to thwart the virus. The NHS may have to cancel planned operations during the peak of a major outbreak to free up beds and staff for patients with coronavirus, he said, adding that the service would find it \u201cquite tricky\u201d to deal with a huge increase in the number of cases. The World Health Organization also warned that the outbreak had reached a \u201cdecisive point\u201d and had \u201cpandemic potential\u201d. UK ministers are finalising the government\u2019s plan to respond to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus, which is expected to be published next week. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: \u201cThere is a good chance that we can avoid a pandemic. That\u2019s a potential outcome but not a definite outcome.\u201d Public Health England is due to launch a major public information campaign next week to educate people about how to minimise the risks of contracting or spreading the virus. Experts have repeatedly stressed that regular hand washing remains the single best way of reducing risk.",

      "bodyText": "PARTY IN THE CITY WHERE THE HEAT IS ON When David Beckham announced his intention to buy a new Major League Soccerball franchise in Miami, he was asked which three players it would like to sign. \u201cIt would be disrespectful for me to say which players I want in the team,\u201d he cooed, ever the diplomat. \u201cBut we have a list of players. I\u2019ve been fortunate to play with some of the best players in the world and some of them are calling me up to ask me when Miami is happening.\u201d And while the notion of Roy Keane, Ronaldinho and Luis Figo all having been stuck on hold listening to Will Smith\u2019s Miami on a loop for the past six years is an amusing one, neither they nor any other of Beckham\u2019s former teammates will be on the field when Club Internacional de F\u00fatbol Miami (aka Inter Miami) line up against Los Angeles FC to play their first MLS game this Sunday. There have been pitfalls along the way: an inability to get permission to build a sw@nky new stadium in Miami\u2019s bijoux downtown waterfront area, the protracted construction of the team\u2019s 25,000-seater alternative in Miami Freedom Park and an ongoing legal battle with Italian side Internazionale that could yet force an embarrassing climbdown and name change. Of course, should the unthinkable occur, this tea-timely email\u2019s moody, bestubbled, Miami-dwelling, Corvette-driving, Ray-Ban-Wayfarers-pink-pastel-T-shirt-and-Armani-jacket-wearing, drug-busting cousin Sonny Crockett Fiver is willing to give up his claim to Miami Vice. \u201cThere\u2019s been moments where I doubted it would happen,\u201d chirped Becks, who owns the franchise along with four businessmen who have even more money than he does. \u201cPeople turned around to me and said, y\u2019know: \u2018Why don\u2019t you take your franchise to another city?\u2019 I always knew Miami is the city and the fact that we are now a few days away from starting the season is very exciting.\u201d Coached by former Uruguayan international Diego Alonso, boasting a roster of players The Fiver has never heard of and ready to play in a kit that will be all too familiar to supporters of London hipster club Dulwich Hamlet, Beckham\u2019s dream will become a reality this weekend. But while he always knew Miami would be the city, it won\u2019t be the city for at least two years until their new stadium is ready. Until then, fans of the team that \u201cwas always destined to be based in Miami\u201d will be driving 45 minutes up the Florida coast to their temporary digs in Fort Lauderdale. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Ed Aarons from 8pm GMT for hot Premier League MBM coverage of Norwich City 0-0 Leicester City. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI heard yesterday that if we win the league, we will have a medal.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Newcastle boss Steve Bruce has revealed that the threat of coronavirus has led to a ban on handshakes at the club\u2019s training ground. \u201cWe\u2019ve stopped that on the advice of our club doctor,\u201d said Bruce. \u201cWe\u2019re like everybody else, we\u2019re glued to the TV for where it\u2019s going to go next.\u201d Meanwhile at West Ham, David Moyes added: \u201cWe\u2019ve also agreed to no shaking hands at the moment, just fist bumps.\u201d Swiss league suits have called off all of this weekend\u2019s matches after the government banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people as a measure to curb the coronavirus epidemic.

Mikel Arteta almost shed hot salty tears of woe after Arsenal were dumped out of Big Vase by Olympiakos. \u201cIt hurts, big time,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cWe had a lot of hope in this competition \u2026 sometimes it is very cruel.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is confident that his Manchester United side will be nothing like the sorry shower who got whacked 4-0 by Everton last season when they revisit Goodison on Sunday. \u201cThat was the lowest I\u2019ve been. That was a capitulation. I can with hand on heart 100% say these boys will never give in and never give up like that team did,\u201d he blabbed, inviting trouble. And Woking have signed former England international Matt Jarvis. STILL WANT MORE?

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Diabetes UK has <a href=\"https://www.diabetes.org.uk/about_us/news/coronavirus\">recently updated the information pages</a> on its website after calls for advice; while Asthma UK posted a <a href=\"https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/news/Coronavirus/\">comprehensive blog</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIor_czMX05wIVjLHtCh1WvgUYEAAYASAAEgLeBfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\">British Heart Foundation</a> has issued <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/coronavirus-and-your-health\">guidance</a>.

      "bodyText": "Organisations representing people vulnerable to coronavirus are stepping up preparations for a UK outbreak, in a bid to allay growing fears among those with underlying health conditions. According to the World Health Organization, older people and those with pre-existing medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are more vulnerable to the virus. Diabetes UK has recently updated the information pages on its website after calls for advice; while Asthma UK posted a comprehensive blog and the British Heart Foundation has issued guidance. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Primary Immunodeficiency UK (PID UK), Macmillan UK and the Mental Health Foundation have also sought to allay fears and provide support. But people with respiratory conditions and compromised immune systems have described facing crippling anxiety about what could happen to them should an outbreak of coronavirus hit the UK. Georgie Wishart, a 30-year-old charity worker with ankylosing spondylitis, a condition which requires her to take immunosuppressants, described the daily battle to deal with her anxiety. \u201cWhen it first came into the news, I was on the verge of having anxiety attacks because I didn\u2019t know how I was going to cope,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was genuinely a part of me thinking this is how I might die. \u201cI keep reminding myself of the facts: there aren\u2019t that many confirmed cases, precautions are being taken, and that if it becomes a problem I will deal with it.

      "bodyText": "The rapid spread of the coronavirus has triggered the biggest plunge in global stock markets since the financial crisis, amid rising fears over the impact on the world economy of the deadly disease and the efforts to contain it. An increasing number of countries and companies are imposing tough measures to limit the spread of the Covid-19 disease, with mounting costs for company profits and growth. The outbreak has led to the fastest reversal for the stock market since 1933 during the Great Depression. Wall Street has slumped from record-breaking highs to the lowest point since 2016, with more than $5tn (\u00a33.9tn) wiped off the value of global markets over the past week alone. The economic consequences are becoming increasingly evident in a fast-moving crisis. Markets Global stock markets have had their worst week since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, reflecting the growing fear over the economic catastrophe as it rapidly unfolds. Wall Street suffered its worst one-day fall ever \u2013 with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting 1,190 points on Thursday. The FTSE 100 lost 823 points over the week \u2013 equal to \u00a3206bn wiped off the value of the top 100 companies \u2013 to finish at 6,580.61. Shares in airline companies including easyJet and the British Airways owner, IAG, have been among the hardest hit. The cruise firm Carnival \u2013 the operator of the Diamond Princess ship, quarantined for coronavirus cases with one Briton among those killed by the disease on board \u2013 has lost a fifth of its stock market value. Global investors rushed to buy assets considered safe havens in times of stress \u2013 including government bonds and gold \u2013 sending the yield of US Treasury bonds to the lowest level on record. Economics The halting of activity to contain the virus, the fear factor keeping consumers away from shops, and the disruption to complex international supply chains will dramatically drag down global growth. Although the mortality rate remains comparatively low, the actions to control the virus are now having a big impact, as business travel and conferences are cancelled and world trade and consumer activity falter. David Owen, the chief European economist at the US bank Jefferies, said: \u201cThe bottom line is we really don\u2019t know what will happen, but what we do know is that the fear factor and the way people change their behaviour makes the difference.\u201d Two weeks ago economists were estimating that the coronavirus outbreak would have an impact similar to the Sars outbreak of 2002-03, when growth faltered in China then rebounded rapidly.

All things are possible. Everybody\u2019s fired up and ready, everyone\u2019s had a good training week and wants to play.

But I\u2019m delighted with the spirit, quality and togetherness that the lads have been showing this week - now we have to transfer it into Saturday.\u201d</p> <p>Brighton are seven matches without a win in the Premier League, drawing the last three, and they head into tomorrow\u2019s game four points above the relegation zone. Potter has called on the supporters to play their part in helping the team return to winning ways against their rivals.</p> <p>\u201cMy message to the fans is to enjoy the game and get behind the team in the right way in order to help us get the three points,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big game for our fans. I understand that football is an emotional experience and that people can get disappointed or frustrated, but our fans are fair-minded and know we need them.

Thanks for reading - have a great weekend, enjoy the football, and good luck to your team. See you next time! Bad news from the bean counters at the Emirates. Arsenal have been left to count the cost of their failure to qualify for the Champions League, posting a \u00a327.1million loss in their latest accounts: Fifa president Gianni Infantino has said \u2018health is beyond anything\u2019 when asked about the prospect of football postponements, or matches taking place behind closed doors, due to the current coronavirus outbreak. Speaking in Belfast ahead of Saturday\u2019s annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board, Infantino said: \u201cThe health of persons is much more important than any football game. The health is beyond anything and that\u2019s why we have to look at the situation and hope that it will decrease rather than increase. \u201cAt the moment it looks like it is still increasing. If games have to be postponed or played without spectators until it is over then we have to go through that.\u201d Infantino said he thought the European Championship would still go ahead in June but that the world governing body was monitoring the situation. Asked whether March\u2019s international friendlies could be called off, though, he said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exclude anything at this moment. I hope we will never have to get into this direction.\u201d If you\u2019ve taken the ball to the corner flag ahead of your imminent weekend escape from the office, why not take our sport quiz of the week? It\u2019s right here: Could the coronavirus lead to the cancellation of the Tokyo Olympics? Football-wise, is it going to affect Euro 2020? We take a look at the current state of play across various sports here: Watford team news: Ismaila Sarr came off the bench against Manchester United last weekend, following a hamstring injury, so Nigel Pearson may restore him to the starting line-up for Liverpool\u2019s visit tomorrow evening. Kiko Femenia and Danny Welbeck - who like Sarr have been suffering from hamstring injuries - are also nearing a return to first-team action. Nigel Pearson says the Hornets are almost back to having a fully-fit squad, as Daryl Janmaat has returned to training and is available for selection after a knee injury. GOOD NEWS for Southampton ahead of their meeting with West Ham: Kyle Walker-Peters is back in training, and available for selection. BAD NEWS for Southampton: Attacking talisman Nathan Redmond is still out with a muscle injury. Burnley team news: Ashley Barnes and Matt Lowton are out for the trip to Newcastle, and winger Johann Berg Gudmundsson also looks likely to be on the sidelines after sustaining an injury in training. But the good news is that top-scorer Chris Wood has recovered from the hamstring strain that kept him out of last week\u2019s win against Bournemouth. Newcastle team news: It\u2019s good news on the fitness front for Newcastle United and their manager Steve Bruce. He says Jonjo Shelvey is back in the frame for this weekend\u2019s match against Burnley, along with Javier Manquillo. \u201cJonjo\u2019s trained for the last ten days or so, so it\u2019s good to see him back,\u201d Bruce said. \u201c[Javier] Manquillo\u2019s back, so it\u2019s good to see him back as well. \u201cAll of a sudden we\u2019ve got probably 20 outfield players to choose from rather than what we did two or three weeks ago with probably 12.\u201d Andy Carroll and Paul Dummett remain out for the clash with Sean Dyche\u2019s mob, though. Quotes courtesy nufc.co.uk Yes! It\u2019s match preview time again. \u2018Steady\u2019 Eddie Howe vs. \u2018Super\u2019 Frankie Lampard, AKA AFC Bournemouth v Chelsea, AKA #BOUCHE: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion team news: After a hamstring injury, Dale Stephens has returned to training this week, and is available for selection for the 12.30pm kick-off on Saturday. Jose Izquierdo remains sidelined with a knee injury. Crystal Palace team news: Mamadou Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate are expected to be fit following respective hamstring and ankle knocks. But the Eagles manager Roy Hodgson will leave a decision on Luka Milivojevic, who has been ill, until the last minute. Leicester City team news: Defensive midfielder Hamza Choudhury is available for selection again after serving a one-match suspension. Wilfrid Ndidi, another midfield lynchpin, is back in training after having knee surgery. Manager Brendan Rodgers said on Wednesday: \u201cWilf Ndidi has been training so we\u2019ll see how he is on Friday. But if he\u2019s not right for this week we\u2019ll look for next week, which is good news for us. We have to be cautious. We don\u2019t want to lose him again.\u201d Norwich team news: Sam Byram, Onel Hernandez, Timm Klose and Christoph Zimmermann are all ruled out for tonight\u2019s visit of Leicester City, which kicks off in under four hours\u2019 time. Klose is a long-term absentee due to a knee injury, but manager Daniel Farke says he is not far away from a return to action. Pretty Klose, I guess. His centre-back colleague Christoph Zimmermann misses a second game with a hamstring injury. Onel Hernandez is expected to be out for eight weeks after surgery on a knee injury. Meanwhile, Byram will miss the rest of the season with a hamstring complaint. West Ham\u2019s Tomas Soucek has been added to the Hammers\u2019 injury list, much to the chagrin of manager David Moyes. They\u2019ll have to do without him for the visit of Southampton tomorrow - here\u2019s the match preview: Andriy Yarmolenko and Jack Wilshere are both on their way back - Yarmolenko is closer than Wilshere, by the sounds of it: After manning this very blog earlier on, the irrepressible Barry Glendenning turned his attention to The Fiver. Read it right here: Here\u2019s Jamie Jackson on the latest injury to Manchester City centre-back Aymeric Laporte: As far as commercially-related football player banter goes, Liverpool have come up trumps with this YouTube video for the club\u2019s official coconut, oil and milk partner, Chaokoh. Sit back, relax and marvel at Jordan Henderson\u2019s actually quite impressive acting skills: And if you can believe it ... the bloopers and outtakes clip is even more hilarious: In news that broke a little earlier today, Tranmere\u2019s League One match with Fleetwood which was scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed. The pitch is unplayable, so they say. In women\u2019s football, Chelsea take on Arsenal in Nottingham tomorrow in the Continental Cup final. Here is Suzanne Wrack\u2019s preview: In seemingly-very-random-kick-off-time news, Red Bull Salzburg\u2019s Europa League match with Eintracht Frankfurt will kick off behind closed doors at 5pm GMT today. The match was scheduled to take place last night, but was postponed due to a storm warning. \u201cThis is going to be quite easy - in fact, I\u2019m thinking of fielding our reserves,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said of tonight\u2019s match. NO! Wait. That\u2019s wrong. This is what he really said: \u201cAll the games are difficult, and Norwich have shown that they\u2019re a dangerous team. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that when we drew here earlier on in the season. They sit at the bottom, but for us, it doesn\u2019t really matter where they are in the league. They\u2019re a good side, they\u2019ve got creative players, they\u2019re a dangerous team to play against, especially at home, where they\u2019ve had some very good results. \u201cI saw their performance against Liverpool, one of their last games at home, and they played very, very well.\u201d Quotes courtesy of lcfc.com There is, of course, a Premier League match occurring this evening, as Norwich City take on Leicester City at Carrow Road. Canaries coach Daniel Farke was asked if Norwich can pull off a miraculous escape, like Leicester in 2014-15, at his press conference yesterday: \u201cTo be honest, it shows that everything is possible and that\u2019s a great example. Everyone was writing them off and then they got seven wins from their last ten. \u201cIf I\u2019m honest, we weren\u2019t on our top level in the last game [a 3-0 loss at Wolves], so I don\u2019t want to speak about winning seven of the next ten games. It\u2019s more important that we are focused on being back at the top of our game. \u201cWhat I want is that we leave our heart out on the pitch, always work and show great unity and spirit as well as tactically smart behaviour to be at the top of our game. Then everyone can say, \u2018they tried everything\u2019.\u201d Quotes courtesy of Norwich City\u2019s official website. If you missed it (ICYMI, as the social media editor would put it) here are 10 things to look out for in the Premier League this weekend: Handshakes have been banned at Newcastle and West Ham because of the coronavirus outbreak. High-fives are clearly still OK at Manchester United, particularly if you\u2019re wearing goalie gloves: Who remembers the time when Brighton played Palace and the referee gave five penalties in 27 minutes? It rings a vague bell with me. Here\u2019s Richard Foster with a piece from 2018, on the match that took place all the way back in 1989: Everton team news: Morgan Schneiderlin sustained a torn meniscus (cartilage) in the match against Arsenal last weekend, and will be out for an unspecified amount of time. He had surgery on the injury this week, according to the club website. Meanwhile, winger Theo Walcott has recovered from a knee injury and could return to the starting line-up at home to Manchester United on Sunday. Left-back Lucas Digne, who also missed last weekend\u2019s defeat at Arsenal with a calf problem, faces a late fitness test as he has been training on his own this week. Midfielder Jean-Philippe Gbamin (thigh) remains a long-term absentee. Anthony Martial is a doubt for Manchester United\u2019s return to Premier League action at Goodison Park. Manchester United team news: Striker Anthony Martial is a doubt for the Red Devils\u2019 trip to Goodison Park on Sunday. Martial was injured in training on Wednesday ahead of the 5-0 thumping of Club Brugge on Thursday night. \u201cHe went off during training and had treatment,\u201d said Solskjaer, speaking after the match on Thursday night. \u201cHe reported this morning and had a fitness test. It\u2019s not his hamstring, it\u2019s his thigh, in and around the knee.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r added that new signing Odion Ighalo will be ready if called upon. \u201cOdion has definitely shown what type of a striker he is. He will be ready for Sunday,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. Marcus Rashford (back) and Paul Pogba (ankle) remain long-term absentees, while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants Axel Tuanzebe and Tim Fosu-Mensah to get some minutes under their belt before returning to first-team action. Relegation-threatened Watford entertain relegation-unthreatened Liverpool in the Premier League tomorrow evening. Here\u2019s the match preview: How about another nice, historic hit of video content off the Premier League\u2019s Twitter feed? Are you keen? Of course you are. On this day in 2010, Tottenham defeated Everton thanks to goals from Roman Pavlyuchenko and Luka Modric - and a howling miss by Landon Donovan: West Ham team news The Hammers will be without Tomas Soucek and Ryan Fredericks for tomorrow\u2019s Premier League date with Southampton. January signing Soucek suffered a hip injury at Liverpool on Monday night and faces three weeks out, while Fredericks had a shoulder operation this week. Jarrod Bowen could make his full debut after two substitute appearances since his deadline-day switch from Hull. Kyle Walker-Peters is back in contention for Southampton\u2019s trip to the London Stadium. The Tottenham loanee has shaken off a calf concern and has trained all week with the south coast club. Now, here\u2019s Jacob Steinberg with news from the Spurs camp: Here\u2019s a story on that UEFA Europa League draw from earlier, in which Wolves were paired with Olympiakos and Rangers booked a date with Leverkusen. Sevilla v Roma is another tasty tie ... Here is Stephen Cross, of the Hammers United supporters\u2019 club, on why he and others will protest against the board on Saturday: Chelsea team news: Pulisic, Kante, Abraham and Hudson-Odoi are all missing for the visit to Bournemouth on Saturday, says Frank Lampard. \u2018Pulisic is still injured and Kante is still injured,\u2019 he said. \u201cAbraham is injured with the same problem as before. We\u2019re trying to find a solution with him. It\u2019s frustrating that he has come in and out somewhat but he\u2019s injured for tomorrow. Asked how long Abraham would be sidelined, Lampard said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, we need to see. I speak to the doctors every day about it but we are not actually clear on that one. \u201cAt the minute he\u2019s not doing anything active for the next couple of days. So I don\u2019t know. And I don\u2019t know how long that will be. Callum is another one who isn\u2019t fit this weekend.\u2019 On Pulisic\u2019s groin injury, Lampard said: \u201cThe projected time out was a lot less than what it\u2019s turned out to be. I had a similar injury myself as a player and was out for three months, the worst injury I had so I can certainly sympathise and speak with him about the detail of the injury because it\u2019s not an easy one. \u201cI actually re-injured it trying to be too keen to come back so I know it\u2019s a delicate injury. I expected him back quicker but knowing the injury I can see that it\u2019s a difficult one.\u2019 Those quotes courtesy of the Chelsea website. Spurs team news: Sissoko, Foyth and Sessegnon are all still sidelined for the meeting with Wolves on Sunday afternoon: For those needing, Pep Guardiola\u2019s full press conference from earlier is available on Manchester City\u2019s YouTube: BBC reporter: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot going on at Manchester City this season with the Uefa investigation, Premier League investigation, there\u2019s been a story this week about claims of your emails being hacked, there\u2019s coronavirus, talk about your contract - how would you describe your season off the pitch, has it been a bit unique in that sense? Pep Guardiola: \u201cWell ... a little bit, yeah. [laughs]\u201d \u201cJohan Cruyff told me once the problem with managers at big clubs is that 70% is issues off the pitch, and 20-30% is on the pitch. In that time, I thought - he\u2019s crazy - but again, he was true. You have to handle it.\u201d After six years of delays, Inter Miami will play their first-ever league game this weekend. There are still obstacles to overcome though, writes Chris Smith: The football never ends - it\u2019s the Carabao Cup final on Sunday! Aston Villa v Manchester City, to see who wins that. Ahead of the showpiece occasion, Villa manager Dean Smith has confirmed that Manchester City are a fantastic team, and Pep Guardiola is a fantastic manager: \u201cWe\u2019re massive underdogs against a world-class team, but I can only name one or two other teams who wouldn\u2019t be underdogs going into the game against City,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThey\u2019re a fantastic team, no matter which 11 they put out, and they\u2019ve a fantastic coach which is why they can go to the Bernabeu and get a result. But I like sometimes being the underdog because we can go and have a good fight without people expecting anything of us.\u201d On the team news front, Smith confirmed that midfielder John McGinn will definitely miss the final, having done his level best to recover from an ankle injury sustained before Christmas. What is it about young footballers and romance-based reality shows? Gavin Willacy is wondering ... Burnley coach Steve Stone has returned to the club following the conclusion of an independent investigation, according to PA media. Former Nottingham Forest midfielder Stone, the Clarets\u2019 under-23s coach, was placed on an \u201cagreed break\u201d in October following reports of an allegation of bullying. Burnley did not make public the reason for 48-year-old Stone\u2019s absence, nor have they disclosed the findings of the investigation. The Premier League club revealed in October that the matter was being handled independently and Stone has now returned to the club. More Moyesy now, courtesy of West Ham\u2019s official website. \u201cEvery game is the biggest game of the season, as you\u2019re required to win every one. We\u2019ve got eleven games to go and every one is going to be big. I think the players have done a good job in recent matches in different ways, but we need to show better quality when we\u2019ve got the ball and got opportunities. I think we\u2019ll go into the game [at home against Southampton] confident and feeling that we\u2019ve got a good chance of winning.\u201d On Southampton\u2019s recent strong away form, Moyes had this to say: \u201cUp until the last week or two, they\u2019ve had a good record and are very hard working and high pressing. Sometimes it makes it easier away from home when you play that way. Without the ball they\u2019re excellent and we\u2019ll need to be ready for them.\u201d Like Newcastle, West Ham have apparently banned handshakes at the training ground due to fears over the coronavirus. \u201cWe have supplied all the players with hand gel to keep with them. We\u2019ve also agreed to no shaking hands at the moment, just fist bumps,\u201d Moyes said in his pre-match press conference ahead of the visit of Southampton. \u201cIf we score tomorrow, of course they\u2019ll be able to celebrate!\u201d Why not just replace handshakes and fist bumps with military salutes? They involve no physical contact, and may even help to improve discipline in the ranks. Bournemouth team news now ahead of fourth-placed Chelsea\u2019s visit to the south coast tomorrow. Nathan Ake and Jefferson Lerma might both be back to face Frank Lampard\u2019s side after missing last week\u2019s defeat by Burnley. Ake had concussion and Lerma had a rib knock. Coach Eddie Howe said: \u201cNathan has trained this week so, hopefully, should be okay providing there are no ill effects from his head injury. It\u2019s a similar case with Jeff and he has come through a couple of days\u2019 training.\u201d Howe added that David Brooks, Arnaut Danjuma, Chris Mepham and Lloyd Kelly continue to make progress as they recover from injuries. He said: \u201cThey are running on grass but haven\u2019t joined us in training yet. Chris is a bit behind the others and they are improving quite quickly. We would hope to get them back in training, if not next week then the week after.\u201d The Cherries sit 16th going into the match, just two points above the relegation places. Let\u2019s have another helping of Klopp quotes. Here he is, denying that midfielders Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are competing for a starting spot in his Liverpool juggernaut: \u201cThey\u2019re not competing against each other and hopefully they don\u2019t see it like this. It\u2019s not like this,\u201d he said during his press conference earlier. \u201cThey offer naturally different things. Naby can play better, obviously, and has played better. But that wasn\u2019t the reason the (West Ham) game was like it was. \u201cThen Oxlade came on, really fresh and with his natural skill, having direction, speed, it\u2019s a different player. In different situations we need different players and they all are exceptional. Until the change, we were more fixed in positions. It wasn\u2019t flexible enough or unpredictable enough, we were too easy to defend, we didn\u2019t really come through. In other situations we were too high on the wings and were hit on counter-attacks.\u201d Don\u2019t forget! You can drop me a line on email or Twitter @LukeMcLaughlin should you so desire. More quotes from Liverpool manager Klopp, who has been speaking about the dramatic 3-2 win against West Ham on Monday night - the first time his team have trailed in a match since against Aston Villa in early November last year: \u201cI watched the game back, and in that game being 2-1 down helped us a little bit because the direction after that, a lot of things were different,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it was the first time since Villa, but the boys reacted well and that\u2019s the only thing we have to know. Some people used the word complacency, that they saw glimpses of that. I didn\u2019t see that at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a long season and the concentration level can drop from time to time in all teams, in games and between games. How much the boys fight for a result is exceptional. There is no fear about anything, but we also don\u2019t take it for granted that there will just be one or two goals up. This game (against Watford) will be tough. I said it, 100 per cent. I don\u2019t want people to think we are going to win 6-0. It just will not happen.\u201d A Twitter trip down memory lane from the Premier League - and a goal by Benito Carbone for Bradford in 2000: Influential Manchester City centre-back Aymeric Laporte will be out for three to four weeks, says manager Pep Guardiola, following the injury he sustained in Madrid in the Champions League tie earlier in the week. The Frenchman will therefore definitely miss this weekend\u2019s Carabao Cup final, a Manchester derby and the second leg against Real Madrid. \u201cLife is not easy and always in the world the people who survive are the ones who cope with the bad moments,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt is what it is. Accept it, work hard to come back as soon as possible.\u201d Meanwhile German international winger Leroy Sane, who has been out with a knee injury since the Community Shield, will play for Manchester City\u2019s under-23s against Arsenal on Friday. Guardiola said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to put targets on him, we want him to play the game then speak with him, (about) how he felt.\u201d Ahead of the Premier League leaders\u2019 trip to Watford tomorrow, Liverpool manager J\u00fcrgen Klopp says Jordan Henderson, James Milner and Xherdan Shaqiri are making progress as they recover from injury - but all will be ruled out this weekend. \u201cHendo is running, Millie is running and even more. It was not enough for this game now, but we will see \u2013 especially with Millie \u2013 what we can do for Tuesday [the FA Cup tie against Chelsea],\u201d Klopp said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about Hendo, and Shaq not yet, but they are all coming closer.\u201d In Serie A, Juventus v Inter Milan on Sunday night - a crunch clash as far as the title race is concerned - will be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Bianconeri released a statement last night announcing the move. Juventus top the table on 60 points, Lazio are second on 59 with Inter Milan in third on 54. Juventus said the decision is part of \u201curgent measures regarding the containment and management of the epidemiological emergency that is COVID-19.\u201d Meanwhile on the Reuters news wire, news that the entire Swiss league football programme for the weekend has been called off due to the ever-worsening coronavirus outbreak: The Swiss soccer league (SFL) has called off all of the weekend\u2019s football matches after the government banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people as a measure to curb the new coronavirus epidemic. The SFL also said that it would have to consider playing future matches behind closed doors in order to finish the season. \u201cThe five matches in each of the Super League (top tier) and the Challenge League (second tier), which were scheduled from Friday to Sunday, will be postponed to an indefinite date,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe SFL will inform about the further course of the championship in close cooperation with the authorities and the clubs next week.\u201d The average attendance for the Swiss Super League this season is 11,116. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Switzerland has risen to 15, and more than 100 people are in quarantine. Now for a story off the wires stemming from Celtic\u2019s 3-1 Europa League defeat by FC Copenhagen last night. Ugly scenes reported by PA media: A player and steward from FC Copenhagen have been charged over an alleged assault on a police officer during the club\u2019s Europa League match with Celtic. Michael Santos, who scored in the 3-1 victory at Celtic Park, and the steward were spoken to by Police Scotland, according to the Danish club. Footage from the televised game appeared to show an incident involving another Copenhagen goalscorer, Pep Biel, in which the club say he was grabbed by \u201can official\u201d. Copenhagen said a steward \u201ctried to prevent a clash\u201d before being taken away by officers, with Santos also speaking to police. Both have since been charged over the incident. A statement on the Danish club\u2019s website said: \u201cAfter Pep Biel\u2019s 2-1-goal at Celtic Park there was turmoil in front of the FCK fan section after an official grabbed Pep Biel during the celebration. One of our stewards tried to prevent a clash and was led away and talked with Scottish police. Michael Santos also talked with the police, who subsequently have charged them both. They travelled home with the team, and we are now waiting to see if the Scottish police will pursue the case. We will co-operate if they want more information from the club.\u201d Thank you Barry, and good afternoon to our readers everywhere. Let\u2019s crack straight on with a couple of match previews for this weekend. Will Steve Bruce give Dwight Gayle the nod to start for Newcastle against Burnley? As for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, they are winless so far in 2020, something they\u2019ll be desperate to remedy in tomorrow\u2019s lunchtime game against \u2018local\u2019 rivals Crystal Palace. Watch out for those Patrick van Aanholt free-kick thunderbolts ... That\u2019s all from me for today, but worry not - I\u2019ll be handing over the reins to Luke McLaughlin, who\u2019ll bring you news from the rest of this afternoon press conferences as they take place. The Telegraph reports ... \u201cThere is no guarantee Liverpool would be crowned Premier League champions if the season was curtailed by the coronavirus,\u201d they say, in news that could cause panic on the red half of Merseyside. The broadsheet also reports that there is no guarantee the bottom three clubs in the Premier League would not be relegated, with no specific regulation in place governing such a scenario. Europa League: It\u2019s difficult to imagine Wolves or their supporters being particularly intimidated by anyone left in the draw, but they\u2019ll be happy enough to have got Olympiacos, conquerers of Arsenal in the last round. Rangers fans, meanwhile, can look forward to a trip to Cologne, which is the place to stay if you\u2019re heading to the BayArena for a day or two. Currently fifth in the Bundesliga just six points behind Bayern Munich, Bayer will prove challenging opponents for Steven Gerrard\u2019s men. Europa League: As Manchester United fans across the world Google \u201cLASK\u201d, I can reveal they\u2019re an Austrian club, from the Upper-Austrian state capital Linz, who normally play in the 8,000-capacity Waldstadion. As this is not deemed fit for Uefa\u2019s purposes, they have been playing their Europa League home games in the 21,000-capacity Linzer Stadion.

Europa League draw: Giorgio is still holding court before an audience who are almost certainly hopeful of getting this over with as soon as possible so they can have lunch. Less jawing and more drawing, please. Europa League draw: Uefa deputy something-or-other Giorgio Marchetti is currently addressing a fairly bored looking audience of besuited middle-aged men ahead of the big draw. He introduces former Liverpool midfielder Didi Hamann, who will be assisting with the draw. Europa League draw: Dashing Uefa media man Pedro Pinto is chair proceedings in Nyon. Depending on you whereabouts, you may be able to follow them here ... We\u2019re less than 10 minutes away from the draw for the Europa League\u2019s Round of 16 in Nyon. Brighton news: Speaking ahead of his team\u2019s lunchtime game against Crystal Palace tomorrow, Brighton manager Graham Potter insists Neal Maupay and Glenn Murray provide ample options in the club\u2019s fight for Premier League survival. Potter has been alternating the two strikers in recent weeks, with summer signing Maupay getting the nod last week and scoring in the draw at Sheffield United. \u201cBoth can play together or on their own, we\u2019re lucky to have both of them and they\u2019re different types of players in their own right,\u201d Potter told the club\u2019s official website. \u201cThey\u2019ll both score goals. All things are possible. Everybody\u2019s fired up and ready, everyone\u2019s had a good training week and wants to play. It\u2019s a challenge because you have to choose the right combinations and team. But I\u2019m delighted with the spirit, quality and togetherness that the lads have been showing this week - now we have to transfer it into Saturday.\u201d Brighton are seven matches without a win in the Premier League, drawing the last three, and they head into tomorrow\u2019s game four points above the relegation zone. Potter has called on the supporters to play their part in helping the team return to winning ways against their rivals. \u201cMy message to the fans is to enjoy the game and get behind the team in the right way in order to help us get the three points,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big game for our fans. I understand that football is an emotional experience and that people can get disappointed or frustrated, but our fans are fair-minded and know we need them. They\u2019ve been brilliant with us so far this season and we want to give them something to cheer this Saturday.\u201d Europa League draw: A gentle reminder that the draw for the last 16 of the competition is coming up at 12pm (GMT). In the UK, fans of Wolves, Manchester United Rangers will tuning in with particular interest to see who their team\u2019s are paired with as we approach the business end of the competition. FYI: unlike in previous rounds, there are no restrictions on teams being drawn against each other, so we could get an all Premier League clash, or an Anglo-Scottish affair. Those last 16 teams in full: Basel, Bayer Leverkusen, Copenhagen, Eintracht Frankfurt or Slazburg, Getafe, Inter, Istanbul Basaksehir, LASK, Manchester United, Olympiakos, Rangers, Roma, Sevilla, Shakhtar Donetsk, Wolfsburg, Wolves. Newcastle v Burnley team news: Jonjo Shelvey is back in the Newcastle squad for Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with Burnley. The midfielder missed the last six games after misplacing his shin-pads, but returned to training this week after finding them under the passenger seat of his car. He was joined by defenders Emil Krafth (ankle) and Javier Manquillo (hamstring). However, loan signing Valentino Lazaro is suspended following his red card at Crystal Palace last weekend and Ciaran Clark will miss the rest of the season with ankle ligament damage, joining fellow defenders Paul Dummett (hamstring) and Jetro Willems (knee ligaments) and striker Andy Carroll (hamstring) on the sidelines. Burnley striker Chris Wood will return to contention after missing last week\u2019s home win against Bournemouth with a hamstring injury. He has returned to full training and boss Sean Dyche must decide whether to recall him or retain Matej Vydra, who has chipped in with cracking goals in each of Burnley\u2019s past two games. Midfielder Johan Berg Gudmundsson has had a minor setback in his recovery from a hamstring problem, while Ashley Barnes (hernia) and Matthew Lowton (knee) are still out. Southampton news: Ralf Hassenh\u00fcttl and his Southampton side travel to West Ham this weekend, hoping to pile the misery on hosts who sit one place above the relegation zone and have not won a league match since New Year\u2019s Day. West Ham will take heart from the fact that they have won all three league games they have played against Saints since Hassenh\u00fcttl took charge. \u201cAt home we had very tight games, and West Ham once we were without any chances,\u201d he said. \u201cWith two big mistakes we went two down and then it was difficult. So we\u2019re really keen to show a better performance because we have to. This opponent so far was not our best. But records are there to be broken, as always. And it\u2019s important to go there with all the self-confidence we\u2019ve created in away games and show a different face.\u201d Carabao Cup final: Like a gun-toting maniac in a cheese shop, Aston Villa skipper Jack Grealish has been shooting the breeze withSky Sports ahead of leading out his beloved Aston Villa against Manchester City at Wembley on Sunday. A year after being appointed Villa captain, young Jack says his growing maturity has helped him realise what he wants to achieve in his career. Grealish previously made headlines as a teenager, earning himself a reputation as a wrong \u2018un after being pictured passed out in a gutter on his summer holidays. While most of us who have been there, done that and vomited down the front of the T-shirt could see the funny side, some po-faced commentators felt compelled to clutch their pearls and swoon like Victorian ladies. \u201cI feel like everything that\u2019s happened in my life, good or bad, football-wise has set me up to be the person I am today,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change anything. Everyone knows I had a bit of bad press when I was a bit younger, but like I said, I wouldn\u2019t change that for anything. That\u2019s made me who I am today. When I was young I might have been a bit immature at times, but now I know what I want to do in my career - I want to play for England, I want to play for Aston Villa, I want to win trophies. That\u2019s the aim.\u201d Watford news: Nigel Pearson\u2019s side will get a chance to end Liverpool\u2019s astonishing 27-game unbeaten Premier League run when the champions elect visit Vicarage Road tomorrow. dropped two points all campaign. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our own agenda and that is to save our own season and I think that is enough,\u201d he said. \u201cFor players to go into these games, if they can prove they are capable of playing against the best sides of the country, that is the motivation players need. \u201cBut we have to win games for our own season, not necessarily to change history for another club. It\u2019s about our season, our own circumstances and if that\u2019s a spin-off from it [ending Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten record], it is a spin-off from it.\u201d Since a 3-0 win at Bournemouth on 12 January, Watford have been knocked out of the FA Cup and dropped back into the relegation zone. Manchester United news: Ahead of his side\u2019s visit to Goodison Park on Sunday, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is convinced this group will not fold like a deckchair in a similar fashion to the Manchester United side that capitulated and lost 4-0 on their last visit to Everton. \u201cThat was the lowest I\u2019ve been,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cI think you all know that and remember that. That was a capitulation. We had absolutely nothing about us, even though their goals were more or less counter-attacks from set plays and long throw-ins. \u201cEverything you didn\u2019t want to see you saw in that game. Against Everton at home, they\u2019re hard to play against with two up front. They put players in the box and we knew what we were up against. I\u2019m 100 per cent sure we\u2019ll put a better performance up. \u201cThat was the day, the lowest. I knew probably before then but one or two had their last chance, more or less, but we had to get to the summer first. I can with hand on heart 100 per cent say these boys will never give in and never give up like that team did. These are the boys we want to build the next team around.\u201d Europa League: Bruno Fernandes is shaping up to be a very astute January signing for Manchester United and was on the scoresheet again as they walloped Club Brugge at Old Trafford to go through 6-1 on aggregate. Over to you Jamie Jackson ... Europa League: Wolves ensured they\u2019d be in the last 16 tombola for today\u2019s draw by finishing the job against Espanyol that they started so emphatically at Molineux last week. Sid Lowe saw Nuno Espirito Santo\u2019s side lose on the night at the Estadi Cornell\u00e0-El Prat, but breeze through 6-3 on aggregate. Europa League: Celtic joined Arsenal in crashing out of the tournament, their manager Neil Lennon declaring he and his side \u201cshot ourselves in the foot\u201d as they were put to the sword by Copenhagen. Ewan Murray was there ... Europa League: In case you missed it last night, Olympiacos supporters created one hell of a din at the Emirates last night, getting fully behind their team and making far more noise than the home fans as the Greek side eliminated Arsenal from the Europa League. Nick Ames was there for the Guardian. Newcastle news: No end of Newcastle United players and coaching staff could be left hanging should they forget their club has introduced a training ground handshake ban in an attempt to guard against the spread of the Coronavirus. The club has put a stop to a morning ritual of players and staff shaking hands each morning as fears over the spread of the disease increase. \u201cThere\u2019s a ritual here that everybody shakes hands with everybody as soon as we see each other every morning - we\u2019ve stopped that on the advice of the doctor,\u201d said Steve Bruce. \u201cWe\u2019re like everybody else. Thankfully, we\u2019ve got a superb doctor here and he will keep us informed of what we have to do. We\u2019re like everybody else, we\u2019re glued to the TV for where it\u2019s going to go next and let\u2019s hope it doesn\u2019t get any worse in this country.\u201d Asked if he had known anything like it in the past, Bruce added: \u201cNo, not a all. Look, in confined areas like we\u2019ve got here ... there was a time over Christmas when if there\u2019s a virus knocking around - which is not Coronoavirus - then you have to be careful so we\u2019re a bit mindful of it, the fact that a bug can sweep through. \u201cWe had four or five at Christmas and two of my staff, so you stay at home, basically. But it\u2019s always something you\u2019re looking at.\u201d Ahead of Sunday\u2019s Carabao Cup final and another busy weekend of Premier League action, we\u2019re here to bring you all the football news that\u2019s fit to print - and much more that isn\u2019t \u2013 as various managers pitch up to training ground media rooms to face a barrage of interrogatory projectiles from the journalists they respect and admire so much. Away from \u201cpressers\u201d we\u2019ll bring you any other matters of interest (warning: may not be of interest to everyone) that crop up as the day meanders by, before your footballing weekend gets under way when Norwich attempt to get back to winning ways when they host Leicester City tonight.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The claim follows laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome.</p> \n<p>Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said preliminary evidence suggested the virus could have been spreading below the radar in the quarantined areas.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t absolutely confirm any safe estimate of the time of the circulation of the virus in Italy, but \u2026 some first evidence suggest that the circulation of the virus is not so recent in Italy,\u201d he said, amid suggestions the virus may have been present since mid-January.</p> \n<p>The beginnings of the outbreak, which has now infected more than 821 people in the country and has spread from Italy across Europe, were probably seeded at least two or three weeks before the first detection and possibly before flights between Italy and China were suspended at the end of January, say experts.</p> \n<p>The findings will be deeply concerning for health officials across Europe who have so far concentrated their containment efforts on identifying individuals returning from high risk areas for the virus, including Italy, and people with symptoms as well as those who have come in contact with them.</p> \n<p>The new claim emerged as the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak was getting bigger and could soon appear in almost every country. The impact risk was now very high at a global level, it said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while,\u201d a spokesman said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

      "bodyText": "The new coronavirus may have circulated in northern Italy for weeks before it was detected, seriously complicating efforts to track and control its rapid spread across Europe. The claim follows laboratory tests that isolated a strain of the virus from an Italian patient, which showed genetic differences compared with the original strain isolated in China and two Chinese tourists who became sick in Rome. Massimo Galli, professor of infectious diseases at the University of Milan and director of infectious diseases at the Luigi Sacco hospital in Milan, said preliminary evidence suggested the virus could have been spreading below the radar in the quarantined areas. \u201cI can\u2019t absolutely confirm any safe estimate of the time of the circulation of the virus in Italy, but \u2026 some first evidence suggest that the circulation of the virus is not so recent in Italy,\u201d he said, amid suggestions the virus may have been present since mid-January. The beginnings of the outbreak, which has now infected more than 821 people in the country and has spread from Italy across Europe, were probably seeded at least two or three weeks before the first detection and possibly before flights between Italy and China were suspended at the end of January, say experts. The findings will be deeply concerning for health officials across Europe who have so far concentrated their containment efforts on identifying individuals returning from high risk areas for the virus, including Italy, and people with symptoms as well as those who have come in contact with them. The new claim emerged as the World Health Organization warned that the outbreak was getting bigger and could soon appear in almost every country. The impact risk was now very high at a global level, it said. \u201cThe scenario of the coronavirus reaching multiple countries, if not all countries around the world, is something we have been looking at and warning against since quite a while,\u201d a spokesman said. A viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 83,000 people globally, with almost 3,000 deaths. As the list of countries hit by the illness edged towards 60, with Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan and the Netherlands reporting their first cases, the threats to livelihoods were increasingly eyed as warily as the threats to lives. While there were some tentative indications the outbreak may be slowing in China, South Korea\u2019s tally of infections exceeded 2,300, while cases in France and Germany continued to rise. With new cases being reported across Europe, and the first case confirmed in sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 in an Italian man who recently returned to work in Nigeria \u2013 governments were increasingly moving towards proposing ever more stringent measures to control the global outbreak As $5tn (\u00a33.9tn) has been wiped off global stock markets amid fears over the impact of the virus, Switzerland moved to ban all gatherings of more than 1,000 people until 15 March, announcing the postponement of the Geneva Motor Show. The British budget airline easyJet announced it would axe 500 flights to Italy, alongside plans for freezes on hiring and pay, as other airlines announced similar measures. In Iran, where there has been one of the most serious outbreaks outside of China, with 34 people known to have died and 388 infected, the government announced on state television on Friday that all schools would be closing for three days from Saturday. \u201cBased on assessments, it was felt that there was a need for closing all the schools in the country and for this reason all the schools in the country will be closed for three days starting from tomorrow,\u201d the country\u2019s health minister, Saeed Namaki, said. Similar measures were under way in Japan, prompting angry reactions from parents and teachers, who on Friday were told by the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, that all schools would close for a month. In another drastic move, the northern island of Hokkaido, where there has been the largest number of cases in Japan, on Friday declared a state of emergency. Its population of about 5 million people were told to refrain from venturing outside their homes over the weekend. Meanwhile authorities in Moscow announced they were deporting 88 people who they said had violated the country\u2019s quarantine measures. The Nigerian case is just the third to be confirmed in Africa\u2013 a fact that has puzzled health specialists given the continent\u2019s close ties to China \u2013 and was not picked up for 48 hours, part of a familiar pattern in the spread of the disease from California to Germany. According to Nigerian officials, the Italian man affected by Covid-19 stayed in a hotel near the airport on the evening of 24 February, then continued to his place of work in neighbouring Ogun state. He was treated on 26 February at his company\u2019s medical facility before health practitioners called government biosecurity officers, who transferred him on 27 February to a containment facility in Yaba, Lagos. This World Health Organization warned that porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems meant the risk of an outbreak across Africa was \u201cvery, very high\u201d and raised significant concerns about the ability of \u201cfragile health systems\u201d to cope. Experts, meanwhile, said the scale of the task involved in tracing suspected cases would put strain on developed countries. \u201cThe worry is that there may be other countries that are less prepared, and that the virus may become more widespread worldwide,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious disease at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIf that were to happen, even [developed] systems would possibly struggle to be able to check every possible suspect.\u201d In other developments, Mexico\u2019s assistant health secretary announced that the country now had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. And at least 23 guests left H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife on Friday, four days into a 14-day imposed quarantine, after the Canary Islands regional government on Thursday cleared 130 holidaymakers to leave the hotel. About 700 holidaymakers remained quarantined in the compound.",

      "body": "<p>The coronavirus crisis is a war against a disease, but it\u2019s also the most serious battle yet in the war on truth. That much was clear from the start, as China moved to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/the-reaction-to-the-outbreak-has-revealed-the-unreceonstructed-despotism-of-the-chinese-state\" title=\"\">hush up</a> the first outbreak and gag the doctor who had spotted it. It was a classic case of what we might call Chernobyl syndrome: the tendency of authoritarian systems to react to disaster by rushing to downplay or cover up the problem, focusing more on shifting blame than tackling the threat head on. Viewers of last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/29/chernobyl-horrifying-masterful-television-that-sears-on-to-your-brain\" title=\"\">TV dramatisation</a> of the Chernobyl nuclear accident could recognise the pattern immediately, as the priority of those in charge becomes avoiding embarrassment rather than saving lives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update\">Coronavirus: man from Diamond Princess cruise first Briton to die from illness \u2013 latest updates</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There was some of that in the Iranian reaction to the virus, as the country\u2019s deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference called to reassure citizens, only later for it to be confirmed that he had himself <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/irans-deputy-health-minister-i-have-coronavirus\" title=\"\">been infected</a>. (There were already suspicions, since Tehran\u2019s official numbers didn\u2019t add up.) And there was a grim logic to the fact that at the heart of the outbreak in South Korea is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/were-treated-like-criminals-south-korean-sect-feels-coronavirus-backlash\" title=\"\">religious sect</a> similarly devoid of transparency.</p> \n<p>Usually, the democratic world can contrast itself flatteringly with such closed, controlled societies, proud that its approach to calamity is openness and the free flow of information. Indeed, crises like this one can serve as test cases for the competing merits of free systems v authoritarian ones. True, democracies cannot match Beijing\u2019s ability to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-spreads-in-china-with-three-cities-in-lockdown\" title=\"\">lock down whole cities</a> and build an entire hospital in a week.

That\u2019s because the current leader of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, the US, has the same instincts as the authoritarian rulers he so admires, and those instincts have coloured his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/feb/27/trump-says-coronavirus-spread-not-inevitable-video\" title=\"\">response to coronavirus</a>. The result is that what for many must have seemed an abstract concern \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s assault on facts, experts and science \u2013 is now a matter of life and death.</p> \n<p>So while US medical officials have been at pains to brace Americans for the inevitability of coronavirus \u2013 a matter of when, not if \u2013 Trump and his outriders have worked hard to minimise the threat. On Thursday, Trump <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-miracle-stock-markets/index.html?utm_content=2020-02-28T11%3A12%3A35&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_source=twCNNi\" title=\"\">repeatedly referred</a> to the figure of \u201c15\u201d cases in the US, when the actual figure was 60, and promised that that number would go down rather than up: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1232375865054547968?s=20\" title=\"\">breezily assured</a> the US public that the bug had been contained and that the country was sealed \u201cpretty close to airtight\u201d against the disease, when of course it is not. One of the administration\u2019s most influential propagandists \u2013 for whom Trump paused his state of the union address this month so that his wife, Melania, might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/04/rush-limbaugh-presidential-medal-of-freedom-trump\" title=\"\">garland him</a> with America\u2019s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has been <a href=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/02/24/overhyped-coronavirus-weaponized-against-trump/\" title=\"\">telling his vast audience</a> that \u201cthe coronavirus is the common cold, folks\u201d, and that it had been \u201coverhyped\u201d and \u201cweaponised \u2026 to bring down Donald Trump\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dfde4960-3d7f-4f2c-a6d8-8e9dbfb106e4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/btZxPdatUSc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232652371832004608\" title=\"\">Trump has nodded</a> in a similarly conspiracist direction, tweeting that the media are doing all they can \u201cto make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That reference to the markets is key.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis is a war against a disease, but it\u2019s also the most serious battle yet in the war on truth. That much was clear from the start, as China moved to hush up the first outbreak and gag the doctor who had spotted it. It was a classic case of what we might call Chernobyl syndrome: the tendency of authoritarian systems to react to disaster by rushing to downplay or cover up the problem, focusing more on shifting blame than tackling the threat head on. Viewers of last year\u2019s TV dramatisation of the Chernobyl nuclear accident could recognise the pattern immediately, as the priority of those in charge becomes avoiding embarrassment rather than saving lives. There was some of that in the Iranian reaction to the virus, as the country\u2019s deputy health minister coughed and sweated his way through a press conference called to reassure citizens, only later for it to be confirmed that he had himself been infected. (There were already suspicions, since Tehran\u2019s official numbers didn\u2019t add up.) And there was a grim logic to the fact that at the heart of the outbreak in South Korea is a religious sect similarly devoid of transparency. Usually, the democratic world can contrast itself flatteringly with such closed, controlled societies, proud that its approach to calamity is openness and the free flow of information. Indeed, crises like this one can serve as test cases for the competing merits of free systems v authoritarian ones. True, democracies cannot match Beijing\u2019s ability to lock down whole cities and build an entire hospital in a week. But when it comes to a global pandemic, it\u2019s free speech, full disclosure and cross-border scientific cooperation that ultimately save lives. Except this time, the familiar authoritarian v democratic contrast has become muddled. That\u2019s because the current leader of the world\u2019s most powerful democracy, the US, has the same instincts as the authoritarian rulers he so admires, and those instincts have coloured his response to coronavirus. The result is that what for many must have seemed an abstract concern \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s assault on facts, experts and science \u2013 is now a matter of life and death. So while US medical officials have been at pains to brace Americans for the inevitability of coronavirus \u2013 a matter of when, not if \u2013 Trump and his outriders have worked hard to minimise the threat. On Thursday, Trump repeatedly referred to the figure of \u201c15\u201d cases in the US, when the actual figure was 60, and promised that that number would go down rather than up: \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear. One day it\u2019s like a miracle, it will disappear.\u201d Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, breezily assured the US public that the bug had been contained and that the country was sealed \u201cpretty close to airtight\u201d against the disease, when of course it is not. One of the administration\u2019s most influential propagandists \u2013 for whom Trump paused his state of the union address this month so that his wife, Melania, might garland him with America\u2019s highest civilian honour, the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh has been telling his vast audience that \u201cthe coronavirus is the common cold, folks\u201d, and that it had been \u201coverhyped\u201d and \u201cweaponised \u2026 to bring down Donald Trump\u201d. Trump has nodded in a similarly conspiracist direction, tweeting that the media are doing all they can \u201cto make the Caronavirus [sic] look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible\u201d. That reference to the markets is key. Trump believes his chances of re-election in November hinge on his stewardship of the economy, betting that voters will back him if their pensions \u2013 linked to the stock market \u2013 are up. That the Dow Jones suffered the biggest one-day drop in its history on Thursday has him rattled. And so his first instinct is that of the Manhattan hustler-hotelier loudly assuring guests that the strong smell of burning coming from the ground floor is merely the chef trying out a new barbecue rather than a sign that the building is on fire. Crucial to that effort is talking loudly over the fire marshals, or even gagging them altogether. You could see that when Trump spoke in the White House briefing room, brazenly contradicting the experts by his side. But it\u2019s now become formal policy, with Trump\u2019s insistence that all federal officials \u2013 including those with deep scientific expertise \u2013 are to say nothing that has not first been authorised by the White House. Note the fate of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease. On Thursday he dared say that \u201cwe are dealing with a serious virus\u201d with a higher mortality rate than regular flu. That was deemed insufficiently upbeat for the great leader. According to the New York Times, \u201cDr Fauci has told associates that the White House had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance.\u201d The new mantra, it seems, is to be one of Trump\u2019s favourite phrases: repeated again on Thursday: \u201cNobody really knows.\u201d That could be the motto of post-truthists such as Trump, conveying the hope that voters will become confused, concluding that no truth is ever even possible, and that in the fog of information and rumour it\u2019s best simply to trust the man in charge. That\u2019s what Trump wants every American to believe, about coronavirus and everything else for that matter: nobody really knows. Now Trump has put his slavishly deferential vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the coronavirus effort. Put aside Pence\u2019s appalling record as governor of Indiana, when his response to an HIV outbreak was to veto a medically recommended needle exchange programme and to offer his prayers instead.

The UCI insisted on Friday that the decision had been taken by the organisers RCS Sport before the results of tests were known, with at least one of those checked now understood to have not contracted Covid-19. \u201cThe Union Cycliste Internationale confirms that the two final stages of the UAE Tour, which were to be raced on Friday and Saturday, were cancelled late on Friday evening after two cases of coronavirus were suspected among two staff members of one of the participating teams,\u201d a UCI statement said. \u201cWhile waiting for the results of tests and their communication, the United Arab Emirates authorities, the event\u2019s organising committee and the UCI, by mutual agreement, took the decision to interrupt this event, the third race on the 2020 WorldTour calendar, in the interests of the health of riders and their staff, and to avoid the virus spreading.\u201d The four-times Tour de France winner Froome and veteran sprinter Mark Cavendish were among the riders tested for the virus having also been confined to their rooms at their Abu Dhabi hotel, with concerns that Morkov\u2019s transit to Europe could have implications for the event in Berlin. Yet a spokesperson for the Danish team said the team still expected the 34-year-old \u2013 who is training on a stationary bike in his room \u2013 to be able to race in the madison this weekend. Mattia Binotto said Ferrari have encountered problems travelling to an F2 test event in Bahrain because of fears over the virus and urged clarity for the first F1 race of the season in Melbourne on 15 March. \u201cSome of our engineers going there have remained home, so instead of taking the risk to be there and eventually staying there for a few days or many days, they stayed home,\u201d he said. \u201cI think what we will need is simply to have assurance before leaving. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can discover when [we are there] what can be or what will be the situation. So if there are any medical screenings, we need to know about them. You need to know exactly what\u2019s about. We need to understand what are the consequences in case of any problem?\u201d It has emerged that England\u2019s rugby team have been training at a school in Oxford where pupils have been placed in self-isolation as a preventative measure against the threat of the coronavirus. St Edward\u2019s school has taken the precautionary steps \u2013 in line with advice from Public Health England \u2013 after a group of pupils had travelled to an affected area, or came into contact with those who had. On Thursday, Eddie Jones\u2019s 25-man squad spent the morning training at the school grounds, as has become customary in recent years for the second fallow week of the Six Nations. Jones\u2019s squad are currently preparing for their must-win match against Wales on Saturday week. A school spokesperson for St Edward\u2019s told the Oxford Mail: \u201cA small number of our pupils who have recently travelled to an affected area, or had close contact with someone who has travelled to an affected area, either have been, or are currently, undergoing a period of quarantine at home.\u201d An RFU spokesperson said: \u201cHaving spoken to the school and applied the Government\u2019s current advice regarding the risk of transmission of coronavirus, we are satisfied that there is no additional concern to the England Senior team players coaches and management.\u201d",

A person briefed on Jingye's thinking said the company wanted to preserve as many jobs as possible, but could not say how many of the company's 4,000 workers would keep their jobs. British Steel accounts for a third of UK production, so is seen as a key national asset in many quarters.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What went wrong at British Steel?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When Greybull Capital bought British Steel in 2016 it promised great things. The private equity firm pledged to invest \u00a3400m and within months it was boasting of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/01/scunthorpe-steelworkers-enjoy-happy-outcome-to-act-of-faith\">return to profit and a bright future ahead</a>. Three years later it collapsed. In a letter to staff, the British Steel chief executive blamed weak market demand, high raw material prices, the weakness of sterling and uncertainty over the outcome of Brexit discussions.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is Jingye?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Jingye emerged as the most likely owner after talks with Ataer, a division of the Turkish military pension fund Oyak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/23/british-steel-turkish-army-fund-takeover-in-danger-of-collapse\">fell through in October</a>. Founded in 1988 by a former Communist party official, Li Ganpo, the Chinese conglomerate has hotel and retail interests. However, steelmaking, which it started doing in the early 1990s, is now its primary focus: its Chinese mills produce about 15m tonnes of steel a year, exporting to 80 countries.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How much is Brexit to blame?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>It is not the only factor in the crisis, but it is important and will remain crucial even if Jingye buys British Steel. Steel contracts are typically agreed well in advance of the product being delivered. As things stand, the UK is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/28/eu-agrees-brexit-extension-to-31-january-flextension\">due to leave the EU on 31 January after another delay,</a> and the terms of that separation are yet to be agreed, meaning British Steel\u2019s overseas customers do not know what tariffs will apply to steel they buy from the company. Sources close to the company said orders from customers in the EU and further afield had dried up as a result.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is the whole UK steel industry in trouble?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK steel industry has been in decline for some time because of a variety of factors such as overcapacity in EU steelmaking and Chinese state-subsidised firms flooding the global market with cheap product. An industry that employed 323,000 people in 1971 now employs less than a tenth of that, at 31,900. The closure of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/02/redcar-steel-plant-goes-into-liquidation\">Redcar steelworks in 2015</a>&nbsp;was a significant blow to the sector and left the UK with only two blast furnace steelworks: Scunthorpe and the Tata Steel-owned Port Talbot in south Wales.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hayange is one of the few profitable parts of British Steel, prompting concern that opposition from France, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/france-threatens-to-block-chinese-firm-rescue-of-british-steel-jingye\">signalled its misgivings</a>, could cause the deal to collapse.</p> \n<p>France has dragged its feet over the decision, while travel restrictions due to the coronavirus crisis are thought to be hampering the movement of senior Jingye staff from China to British Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe headquarters, adding further delays.</p> \n<p>UK government officials had hoped that the sale would be tied up by the end of this month, when an indemnity from the Treasury to fund British Steel\u2019s loss-making operations was due to run out.</p> \n<p>But the indemnity has been extended, allowing the firm\u2019s major site, the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks, to continue operating.</p> \n<p>A source close to the negotiation said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a hard deadline, it can be extended a bit like the Brexit talks.

France\u2019s finance ministry is expected to say next week whether it will allow the Chinese industrial firm Jingye to buy British Steel\u2019s Hayange plant, which supplies France\u2019s rail track and is considered a strategic national asset. Hayange is one of the few profitable parts of British Steel, prompting concern that opposition from France, which has signalled its misgivings, could cause the deal to collapse. France has dragged its feet over the decision, while travel restrictions due to the coronavirus crisis are thought to be hampering the movement of senior Jingye staff from China to British Steel\u2019s Scunthorpe headquarters, adding further delays. UK government officials had hoped that the sale would be tied up by the end of this month, when an indemnity from the Treasury to fund British Steel\u2019s loss-making operations was due to run out. But the indemnity has been extended, allowing the firm\u2019s major site, the Scunthorpe blast furnace steelworks, to continue operating.

The article, written by officials at the National Institutes of Health and the CDC, said if it is assumed that the cases of people who have no or mild symptoms is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be \u201cconsiderably less than 1%\u201d. The authors said the US should still be prepared for coronavirus to gain a foothold in the US, which might require isolation of ill people, closing schools and working from home.",

He is the first patient in England to catch the illness in the UK. The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was unclear whether they contracted it directly or indirectly from someone who had recently returned from abroad. \u201cThis is being investigated and contact tracing has begun. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 [hospital].\u201d As part of the official action plan being drawn up by ministers and Whitty, military medics, and British Red Cross and St John Ambulance personnel will be drafted in to help the NHS cope with a major outbreak. The number of confirmed cases in the UK has jumped from 13 to 20 in the last 24 hours, with five emerging in England and one each in Wales and Northern Ireland. Separately, the Guardian has been told that a GP may also have been infected with the virus. If this were to be confirmed it would prompt particular concern among health officials trying to limit the spread of Covid-19. The GP would routinely have seen scores of patients over the course of the last week before he became ill in the last 24 hours. His diagnosis has yet to be publicly confirmed by Public Health England (PHE), NHS England or the Department of Health and Social Care. Public health chiefs are also worried about the unnamed doctor\u2019s diagnosis because his wife is also a GP. PHE is \u201ccontact tracing\u201d everyone with whom either of the couple has been in contact \u2013 including all patients they have seen \u2013 so they can also be tested for evidence of the virus. That exercise involves scores of patients as the couple are understood to have been working normally for several days before he was identified as a carrier of the virus. It is not yet known if his wife has also contracted the virus, which for the first time has claimed the life of a Briton \u2013 a passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Public health officials looking into the GP\u2019s case have not yet established how he might have caught the virus but he has not recently visited any of the places abroad where there have been recent outbreaks, such as northern Italy, Tenerife, Iran and China. Contact tracing of his patients is likely to look into whether anyone he has seen in recent days has been to any of those destinations.

      "bodyText": "PS: European stock markets are currently being called HIGHER on Monday, thanks to the late recovery on Wall Street. But there\u2019s a long way to go yet, depending what happens this weekend on the coronavirus pandemic. Time for a closing summary, after some of the most turbulent days we\u2019ve seen in the City recently. Stock markets around the globe have suffered their worst week since the heights of the financial crisis more than a decade ago. After a blistering few days of selling, the European, UK and US stock markets all slumped by over 10% this week amid escalating fears of a global virus pandemic and a worldwide downturn. In the last few minutes, the US stock market had closed -- with the Dow Jones industrial average losing another 1.4% today. That takes its weekly losses to 12%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 shed more than \u00a3200bn this week, after tumbling by another 3.2% today. It\u2019s slumped by over 11% since Monday morning, after coronavirus cases jumped sharply outside of China - its third worst week since 1984. These charts show the story of the Footsie\u2019s wobble. Airline and holiday stocks have had an exceptionally bad week, with TUI down 30%. The slump may be alarming consumers -- Ocado has reported exceptional demand for its delivery slots. The corporate world continues to struggle - easyJet, British Airways and Lufthansa all announced they were cutting flights due to lack of demand. The Geneva motor show, one of Europe\u2019s big trade events, has been cancelled after Switzerland banned large gatherings. Gold price also fell, as some traders sold bullion to cover their stock market losses. Government bonds, though, have hit fresh record highs as investors bolt for safety. The scale of the sell-off has alarmed investors - just a week after the S&amp;P 500 was at an alltime high. Pension pots will already have been badly hit, and some economists fear the sell-off has further to run. Policymakers are attempting to calm the markets, but it\u2019s not clear how much they can do to tackle the crisis. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell issued a statement, insisting the \u2018fundamentals\u2019 of the US economy are still strong, but acknowledging that the virus is a threat. Donald Trump\u2019s economic advisor, Larry Kudlow, claimed that the market selloff had gone too far, as the White House tries to get a grip on the crisis. In the UK, the 20th patient to contract Covid-19 has been detected as the authorities brace for an emergency plan that would involve the military. That\u2019s all for tonight. Hope you have a good weekend, and stay safe. GW Newsflash: The US stock market has posted its worst weekly loss since autumn 2008. This is the seventh straight day of losses, pushing Wall Street down to levels not seen since last autumn. It inflicts more pain on investors large and small. So far this week, the S&amp;P 500 index of US companies has shed 11.5% while the Dow Jones industrial average has slumped by 12.3%. But it\u2019s not a complete disaster. Stocks have bounced off their lows in the final few minutes of the trading session, meaning the losses aren\u2019t quite as brutal as earlier in the day. So, the S&amp;P 500 ended down 0.8%, or 24.54 points lower, at 2,954.22. The Dow has closed down 1.39%, losing 357 points to 25,409. And lets give a big hand to the Nasdaq, which actually ended the day flat. There\u2019s no sign of a late rally on Wall Street. With 20 minutes to go, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 907 points or 3.5% -- ending the week on a real low point. Money is continuing to pour into US government bonds tonight, driving the yield (or interest rate) to fresh record lows. 10-year Treasury bills are now yielding just 1.12% - a remarkably low interest rate that flashes danger signs. If investors are buying bond at that level, they\u2019re desperate to preserve capital and worried about a recession. The US stock market is now over 13% below its record highs, set just last week(!). That\u2019s officially a correction. And if the markets keep falling at their current rate, it\u2019ll be a full-blown bear market - defined as a 20% decline. Michael Every, senior strategist at Rabobank, thinks its a logical risk. \u201cWe are now past a mere 10% technical correction and seem to be heading for a bear market, which is only logical when one considers the global backdrop. We really can\u2019t blame Jerome Powell for trying to reassure the markets with his statement tonight. But the reality is that central banks are somewhat powerless in the face of a virulent pandemic. Indeed, earlier today another senior US central banker dampened hopes that interest rates might be slashed in response to the Covid-19 crisis. St. Louis Federal Reserve president James Bullard told the Arkansas chamber of commerce that a rate cut is possible if the situation deteriorate, but not as nailed on as markets think. He said: \u201cFurther policy rate cuts are a possibility if a global pandemic actually develops with health effects approaching the scale of ordinary influenza, but this is not the baseline case at this time.\u201d Bullard also expressed optimism that Covid-19 will be brought under control, helping markets to recover. Here\u2019s confirmation that Britain\u2019s stock market just suffered its third-worst week since 1984, from Sky\u2019s Ed Conway. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker has said the Federal Reserve will act \u201cas appropriate\u201d to protect the US economy from the coronavirus crisis. In a statement just released, Jerome Powell says: \u201cThe fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong \u201cHowever, the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook. We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.\u201d This appears to be an attempt to reassure the markets. But while stocks are coming off their earlier lows, they are still sharply down today. The Dow is currently 2% lower, down 538 points at 25,228. The coronavirus will have a massive impact on the world economy, affecting techology, transport, retail and telecoms as well as the market. Here\u2019s our round-up of what\u2019s happening, and what could happen next: Here\u2019s our news story about today\u2019s market losses, including the \u00a3200bn wiped off the FTSE 100: UK online grocer Ocado has emailed some customers tonight, saying it is experiencing a lot more demand than usual. I suspect this is households looking to stock up, in case the coronavirus leads to shortages in the shops. Ocado says: We want to let you know that we\u2019re experiencing exceptionally high demand at the moment. More people than usual seem to be placing particularly large orders. As a result, delivery slots are selling out quicker than expected. Ocado wants its customers to place their orders \u201ca little further in advance\u201d, and ideally not on Friday and Saturday as they\u2019re \u201cunusually busy\u201d. With two hours to go until the closing bell, Wall Street is still deep in the red. Unless there\u2019s a dramatic and frankly implausible turnaround, the New York market will post its worst week since October 2008. And the Dow could yet post another 1,000-point slump. Here\u2019s the damage right now: Dow: down 924 points or 3.5% at 24,842 S&amp;P 500: down 78 points or 2.62% at 2,900 Nasdaq: down 168 points or 2% at 8,397 Vanguard, the asset management giant, appears to have had some technical issues today: Presumably a lot of Vanguard\u2019s 30 million investors have been checking how much this week\u2019s turmoil has cost them. Some will have been trying to cash out, while some brave souls will have been buying. We\u2019ll soon know which was the right strategy.... German airline group Lufthansa has just announced it is cutting flight capacity, due to the Covid-19 crisis. It plans to cut short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25%, and will also drop some long-haul flights too. Lufthansa also warned that it cannot assess the impact of coronavirus on its profits - echoing similar comments from British Airway\u2019s parent company IAG this morning. Analysts at MUFG bank fear we could see further losses before this correction has played out. The US election race, and the UK-EU trade calks, could both rattle markets - they told clients tonight: The near 15% collapse in the S&amp;P 500 this week could have more to go. We see more fundamental justification for this extending than the fundamental backdrop to the 15% correction in December 2018.... Amongst the unfavourable backdrop of COVID-19 risks, next week we have Super Tuesday; the start of the UK-EU trade negotiations and a Bank of Canada policy meeting. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says fears of a global recession and serious disruption to our lives is behind the selloff: \u201cIt is official: this is worst week for the UK stock market since the global financial crisis. The FTSE 100 has dropped 11.1% (or 823 points) on the week to 6,580, the third worst weekly showing for the index since records began in 1984.... \u201cCompanies are already experiencing supply chain problems and the idea that many people might be forced to work from home could impact productivity. Shutting schools would also compound the problem as parents would have to look after their children and may not be able to work, and consumer spending would likely fall.\u201d Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets finds the stock market reaction severe. \u201cTo be sure, we sympathize with the narrative that some economic activity could be lost for good. In other words, you don\u2019t double up on certain services spending once the dust settles because you put it off on COVID-19 fears. [But]Even if we are looking at a supply shock where postponed activity does not fully get recaptured, it still does not warrant a [more than] 10% repricing in a market that is supposed to be forward-looking in nature and ultimately realigns with fundamentals,\u201d Stock brokers AJ Bell have very helpfully worked out the biggest fallers on the London stock market this week. And it\u2019s no surprise that holiday firms TUI tops the list, with several airlines close behind, due to concerns that tough travel restrictions will be imposed (and that consumers will shun foreign holidays anyway). Here are the stocks you really didn\u2019t want to own this week, across the blue-chip FTSE 100 and smaller FTSE 350 BIGGEST LOSERS ON THE WEEK TUI -30% Playtech -28% EasyJet -27% SIG -27% Premier Oil -24% International Consolidated Airlines -24% SSP -24% Jupiter Fund Management -23% William Hill -23% Wizz Air -23% The FTSE 250 index of medium-sized UK companies also had a thoroughly dire week. It fell by 2.29% today, meaning it has lost 11% of its value since Monday morning (just like its big sibling, the Footsie). Although the markets have a very painful week, it pales alongside the suffering of those who have lost loved ones to Covid-19. The death toll is rising towards 3,000, including the first Briton today. With more than 80,000 cases already officially reported, the virus is causing an awful lot of misery. But while it can feel impersonal to bang on about the stock market, the unfortunate truth is that falling share prices will have an impact on people too. For example, British pension funds have lost 5%-6% of their value in the last five days, as my colleague Miles Brignall and Rupert Jones report: Until a week ago, employees who were about to retire were looking at their pension statements with some confidence after share prices had hit record highs around the world. Shares in the US tech stocks, in which many UK pension funds are invested, had seemingly been on an ever-upward trajectory. However, after a week in which global stock markets plunged and predictions that the outbreak could match the financial crash of 2008, imminent retirees are facing a far less certain future, than even a week ago. European stocks markets have also suffered their worst week since the financial crisis of autumn 2008. The Stoxx 600 has shed 12.2% this week, with big losses on the German Dax (-12.4% this week) and the Italian FTSE MIB (-11.3%), as well as the FTSE 100 (-11.1%). Daniel Grosvenor of Oxford Economics fears more turmoil ahead, as fears of a global downturn mount: We believe equities will remain under pressure. The sell-off is now in-line with the average \u2018non-recessionary\u2019 correction, but a recession is a growing risk and it is difficult to see how conventional policy easing can calm investor\u2019s nerves. Reuters has calculated that the coronavirus panic has now wiped almost $6 trillion off global markets this week, thanks to the latest losses in Wall Street and Europe. That\u2019s based on the MSCI All-Country World Index, a broad measure of global equities. Here\u2019s their take: The rout showed no signs of slowing as Europe\u2019s main markets slumped 3-5% and the ongoing dive for safety sent yields on U.S. government bonds, widely seen as the world\u2019s most secure asset, to fresh record lows. Hopes that the epidemic which started in China would be over in months and that economic activity would quickly return to normal have been shattered this week as the number of international cases spiralled. Bets are now that the Federal Reserve will cut U.S. interest rates as soon as next month and other major central banks will follow to try and nurse economies through the troubles and stave off a global recession. \u201cThe volatility isn\u2019t as surprising as the fact that it took so long to rear its head. However, the recent swings indicate the complacency that appears to have settled over markets during the earlier stages of the outbreak has been dislodged,\u201d said Paras Anand, CIO, Asia Pacific at Fidelity International. Here\u2019s a chart showing how the FTSE 100 slumped by 11% this week, its worst run since autumn 2008 when the financial sector was on the brink. As you can see, it fell sharply on Monday - losing 3.5%, after Italy reported a shock jump in coronavirus cases. It followed this with a 1.9% drop on Tuesday, as more cases were reported globally. Wednesday provided some stabilisation. But fears of a global pandemic, triggering a world recession, triggered yesterday\u2019s 3.5% tumble -- dragging the Footsie into a correction. With Wall Street plunging again last night, today only saw more pain, taking total losses on the blue-chip index to over 800 points, or more than \u00a3200bn. This chart of the FTSE 100 over the last five years gives some sense of the scale of this week\u2019s rout: Newsflash: More than \u00a3200bn has been wiped off Britain\u2019s leading shares this week, as the Covid-19 crisis triggered the worst sell-off in over a decade. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has just closed for the day, down 3.18%. That\u2019s a fall of 215 points, taking the index down to 6580 points. I think that\u2019s the lowest closing level since July 2016. Today\u2019s losses knock another \u00a353bn off the blue-chip index, and mean it has lost more than 11% this week. And that takes the total weekly losses to around \u00a3206bn -- which will have a serious impact on the nation\u2019s pension pots, ISA, trust funds and other savings. European stock markets have provisionally closed with a 3.8% slump. We\u2019re just waiting for the final numbers on the FTSE 100 now (it\u2019s gone into a closing auction, which could take a little while). Precious metals, such as gold, are falling sharply. Gold is meant to provide protection in times of crisis -- but it appears that some investors are selling their bullion to cover losses on other financial positions. The pound is also falling, down over a cent against the US dollar at $1.276. That\u2019s its lowest level since last October, when Boris Johnson was renegotiating Britain\u2019s withdrawal agreement from the EU. Reuters is reporting that traders are ditching sterling in favour of safer currencies such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and the US dollar. Jonas Goltermann of Capital Economics predicts that the US central bank could be forced to slash interest rates, if the coronavirus epidemic worsens: The S&amp;P 500\u2019s 14% plunge this week is the fastest such correction on record; the VIX index is now at its highest level since the euro-zone crisis in 2012; and the 10-year US Treasury yield has fallen to a record low. These moves may force policymakers to respond whether they want to or not. The London stock market is staggering towards the sanctuary of the weekend, after another torrid session. Indeed, it\u2019s been a thoroughly awful week in the City, wiping more than 10% off blue-chip stocks. Here\u2019s David Madden of CMC Markets on the \u201cbrutal\u201d selloff: Equity markets in Europe have gone from bad to worse to awful as the selling pressure has gained momentum all week. What started out as a tumble on Monday has turned has turned into panic selling as traders are terrified about the possibility of Europe undergoing an economic slowdown or a possible recession because of the coronavirus. The fear of the unknown is causing traders to lose their nerve and just cut and run as far as stocks are concerned. The airline sector has endured a brutal sell-off this week as dealers took the view that travel would be greatly diminished on account of the coronavirus taking hold in Europe. It has been non-stop for the aviation industry as short-sellers stepped up their activity. Dealers\u2019 fears were confirmed today when, BA\u2019s owner International Consolidated Airlines Group, warned that demand will be negatively impacted, and that it will be hard to make a profit projection. Finn Air warned on profits on account of the health emergency, while easyJet said that flights will be cancelled. Bloomberg\u2019s Joe Wiesenthal has spotted something interesting.... Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s national economic council director, was doing his best to calm the markets, arguing the fall has gone too far. But he has a big problem here: Donald Trump. Usually presidents avoid taking credit for rises in the markets because they realize they know events beyond their control can wipe out those gains. Trump, however, has boasted time and again about how he has driven recent rallies in the markets. As criticism mounts about his handling of the outbreak, he runs the risk of owning the fall as well. Despite Larry Kudlow\u2019s best efforts, the Dow Jones industrial average is still DEEP in the red - currently down over 900 points (3.5%). Larry Kudlow, director of the United States National Economic Council, is trying to calm the markets. Kudlow has told reporters that the US economy is still sound, and is downplaying the impact of this week\u2019s rout. Speaking at the White House, Kudlow has suggested that \u201cshort-run corrections\u201d have been seen in the past, without causing major economic pain. Kudlow says: We\u2019ve been through this many, many times before. And I don\u2019t think, even though it\u2019s a front page story and no-one likes to see their asset values go down, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have much of an impact [on the wider economy]. He adds, though, that it depends how long the sell-off lasts and how deep it does. Here are more tweets from White House reporters: This tweet from Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough shows how the US stock market turned south in recent days: Sky News\u2019s Ed Conway points out how historic this week\u2019s slump is: The S&amp;P 500, which give a broader picture of the US stock market, is having a torrid day - down another 3.5% right now. That takes the index deeper into correction territory, inflicting further heavy losses on investors. At 2,869 points, the S&amp;P 500 is on track for its lowest close since last August. Nearly every stock on the Dow is down, many heavily so. Major consumer-focused companies are among the top fallers, including Coca Cola (-5%), Procter &amp; Gamble (-5%) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (-4.8%). European stock markets are falling further, as traders watch the slump on Wall Street with alarm. In London, the FTSE 100 index has plunged by another 4.3%, or 290 points. That takes it down to 6506 points -- almost 900 points down this week. This puts the Footsie on track for its lowest close since July 2016, with one hour\u2019s trading to go. Holiday operator TUI is the top faller, down 9%. OMG. The Dow has shed another 1,000 points in early trading! This is the index\u2019s third quadruple-digit fall this week -- after its record fall (nearly 1,200 points) yesterday. It takes the Dow down to 24,766 points, wiping another 3.8% off the index. After falling into a correction last night, Wall Street isn\u2019t managing to find its feet at all. This is now the seventh day of big losses on Wall Street, and the sell-off is accelerating. Heavy selling has pushing the Dow below the 25,000-point mark for the first time since last June. The index is now down 922 points, or 3.5% -- as fears of a Covid-19 pandemic and a global recession hit stocks. Apple is leading the Dow fallers, down 5.4%, followed by JP Morgan (-4%) and Procter &amp; Gamble (-3.9%). Today\u2019s losses have pushed the Dow Jones industrial average to its lowest level since last June, as this chart shows: Newsflash: Stocks are falling sharply in New York, as the coronavirus market rout continues. The Dow dropped by 761 points at the start of trading. That\u2019s a drop of 2.96%, to 25,005 points The S&amp;P 500 is down just over 3%, and the technology-focused Nasdaq dropped by 3.1%. Just in: UK travel retailer On The Beach has warned it won\u2019t achieve market expectations this financial year, due to the coronavirus. It blames a \u201csmall but noticeable\u201d drop in demand for summer holidays, saying: The Group experienced a small but noticeable reduction in demand for Summer 2020 travel following the early reports of COVID-19 cases in early February. The reduction in demand has accelerated significantly following the increase in COVID-19 cases in Europe, particularly the spread of the virus to Tenerife. Whilst this reduction in demand has led to a natural reduction in marketing spend, the Board does not now expect the Group to achieve payback in the current financial year on its previously outlined strategic marketing investment. With less than 10 minutes until Wall Street opens, the future market is predicting fresh heavy falls. The Dow is currently priced to fall around 750 points, or another 3%. We\u2019ve also learned today that US personal incomes rose in January, but spending growth slowed. Associated Press reports: Americans pulled back on their spending in January, even as their incomes surged, a sign the economy was growing modestly before the threat of coronavirus arose. The Commerce Department said Friday that consumer spending increased 0.2% last month, down from 0.4% in December and the smallest gain since October. Incomes, however, rose 0.6%, the biggest rise in nearly a year, spurred by bigger paychecks and an increase in Social Security benefits stemming from a cost of living adjustment. Canada\u2019s economy barely grew in the last quarter of 2019, fresh data shows. Canadian GDP increased by just 0.1% in October-December, which highlights that the world economy was already weak, before the coronavirus struck. We already knew that the UK and Germany both stagnated during the quarter, while the French, Italian and Japanese economies shrank. The US grew by around 0.5%. There\u2019s no sign that this week\u2019s rout is over. The world\u2019s stock markets are either trading sharply lower (Europe), closed deep in the red (Asia-Pacific), or waiting nervously to open (US) Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is currently down 3% - or 204 points - at 6593 points. That\u2019s up from this morning\u2019s lowest points, but still another very hefty loss. It takes the index back to its December 2018 lows, and means it\u2019s down over 10% this week. But shares in jet engine maker Rolls-Royce are still up, around 6%, after it told reporters that its supply chain had not been disrupted by the coronavirus. CEO Warren East says: Building on the strength of our performance into the end of 2019, we are looking forward to 2020 with some degree of conviction and confidence. Not many other companies can say that today. US government bonds have hit fresh records today, as traders continue to sell shares and pile into less risky assets. This has pushed the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Treasury bills below 1.2% - a record low. That would typically signal that investors are anticipating very weak growth, but also shows they\u2019re desperate to put their money somewhere safe. Roughly $5trn has been wiped off global stock markets this week, during the worst rout since the financial crisis. That\u2019s based on the losses suffered by the MSCI All-Country World Index, which covers roughly 85% of global equities. It had slumped by nearly 9% this week, even before today\u2019s losses, dropping to its lowest level since October. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take: Coronavirus panic sent world share markets skidding again on Friday, compounding their worst crash since the 2008 global financial crisis and pushing the week\u2019s wipeout in value terms to $5 trillion. \u201cInvestors are trying to price in the worst case scenario and the biggest risk is what happens now in the United States and other major countries outside of Asia,\u201d said SEI Investments Head of Asian Equities John Lau. \u201cThese are highly uncertainty times, no one really knows the answer and the markets are really panicking.\u201d Wall Street is expected to fall again when trading begins in two hours. The Dow Jones industrial average is currently down 286 points in the futures market, or slightly over 1%. It has already lost nearly 2,200 points this week, taking the index down to 25,766 last night. There\u2019s so much uncertainty today, so we could see plenty of volatility. It\u2019s already the worst week for US stocks since the financial crisis. Palexpo have now confirmed that the Motor Show has been cancelled altogether (not merely postponed, as first thought). They are citing the legal principle of \u2018force majeure\u2019 -- unforeseeable circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract. Cancelling the motor show will cost the Geneva economy between \u20ac200m and \u20ac250m of lost spending, they say. It also appears that exhibitors will not be compensated, with Palexpo citing Switzerland\u2019s ban on large gatherings. Workers at the Palexpo exhibition centre in Geneva had been working hard to get the motor show ready for next week\u2019s opening - but have now downed tools. Here\u2019s the scene: It\u2019s official: the Geneva Motor Show has been cancelled. More to follow.... (updated: we initially thought it was only postponed). In other news, three former Barclays bankers accused of funnelling secret fees to Qatar in exchange for emergency funding at the height of the 2008 financial crisis have been found not guilty of fraud. More here: Reuters are reporting that the Geneva motor show will been cancelled, as we expected, following the ban on large gatherings in Switzerland. Here\u2019s the story: The organisers of the Geneva car show, Palexpo, have informed carmakers that the international auto show has been called off due to coronavirus concerns, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. A spokeswoman for Palexpo declined to comment. After two and a half hours of trading, European stock markets are still deep in the red. Fears of a global recession remain elevated. The main indices are all down over 3%, meaning we\u2019re still looking at the worst week since the financial crisis of 2008. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is still sharply lower too, although a little higher than its 3.5-year low struck this morning. Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital, predicts that markets will remain volatile until there is some good news on Covid-19. Equity markets have finally caught up with what the bond markets have been signalling which is the clear threat of global recession as the coronavirus spreads and results in further disruption of supply chains, reductions in demand out output. Until there is a vaccine, the coronavirus will spread and market volatility we persist. US equities have made a 10% correction and it can easily end up being a 20%+ correction or \u201ccrash\u201d. The US 10 year Treasury yield has now fallen to a record low and further declines are likely. Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at The Share Centre, argues that investors should hunker down: \u201cWith the markets already down by 11% over a week, those who haven\u2019t already sold have obviously made losses and need to reconsider whether selling now is to risk missing out from a future recovery. A recovery will come but it may not necessarily be V shaped but more likely a U shape since the virus in the West is still spreading and we do not know the full economic fallout. However, the longer it takes to get over this crisis the more likely we are to see certain economies who are already weak, go into recession, I\u2019m thinking Germany and Italy as most likely. Monetary and fiscal stimulus will help with financial and economic confidence but it may do little for people who are afraid to catch a virus and avoid going out and spending money. \u201cWe take the view that from here, the best course of action may be for investors to sit tight and do nothing.\u201d Germany\u2019s central bank governor has warned that Europe\u2019s largest economy could miss its growth forecasts due to the coronavirus. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said this morning: \u201cAll in all, economic growth this year could come in slightly lower than our experts estimated in December.\u201d Those forecasts are already low - with the Bundesbank expecting just 0.6% growth in 2020. Germany\u2019s economy stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2019. A significant economic shock (as investors are fearing) would surely push Germany even closer to recession, or into one. And here\u2019s my colleague Jasper Jolly\u2019s story: It certainly looks like the Geneva Motor Show, which was due to run from 5-15 March, must be either postponed or cancelled: The official announcement from the Swiss Office of Public Health is online here (although their website is struggling right now). It says: In view of the current situation and the spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Council has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018particular\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act. Large-scale events involving more than 1000 people are to be banned. The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March 2020. The Federal Council is responding to the latest developments in the coronavirus epidemic and has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018particular\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act. This enables the Federal Council, in consultation with the cantons, to order measures that are normally the responsibility of the cantons. In Switzerland, infections with the new coronavirus have confirmed in fifteen cases. There have been reports of diseases from the cantons: Ticino, Geneva, Grisons, Aargau, Zurich, Basel-City and Vaud. All persons have been infected abroad. Their health condition is good. All those who are ill are isolated.The public health authorities are contacting people who have been in close contact with the person infected. More than 500 people in Switzerland have so far been tested for the new coronavirus. Nose and throat swabs were taken and sent to laboratories for screening. A number of people are in quarantine in their canton of residence. They must stay at home and avoid contact with other people. The FTSE 100\u2019s latest tumble comes as UK officials announced they have now detected 19 cases of Covid-19, including the first cases in Wales. Our main coronavirus liveblog has all the details: Newflash: Switzerland has just banned large events expected to draw more than 1,000 people - a move that surely means the Geneva Motor Show will be cancelled. The Swiss cabinet says: \u201cIn view of the current situation and the spread of the coronavirus, the Federal Council has categorised the situation in Switzerland as \u2018special\u2019 in terms of the Epidemics Act \u201cLarge-scale events involving more than 1,000 people are to be banned. The ban comes into immediate effect and will apply at least until 15 March.\u201d Oil prices are also sliding again, on fears of a global recession. This has sent Brent crude below $50 per barrel for the first time in over a year. Newsflash: UK stocks have now slumped to their lowest level in three and a half-years. As the sell-off intensifies, the FTSE 100 is now down nearly 4.5% - or 300 points - at just 6495 points. That\u2019s its weakest level since July 2016, shortly after the Brexit referendum. It started this week at 7,404 points, before fears over the coronavirus hit the markets. It means the blue-chip index has now slumped by 12% this week. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe, says: Stock markets are well on their way to their worst week since the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no easing up, with losses on course to accelerate across Europe. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, describes today as \u201canother catastrophic day for investors\u201d. \u201cThis has been one of the worst weeks on the markets in a very long time, leaving investors\u2019 portfolios battered and bruised. \u201cThere is no sign of widespread bargain hunting by investors despite the cut-price shares on offer. That might not happen until there is a clearer picture of how far and wide coronavirus has spread and how different countries are trying to contain it.\u201d Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor, has warned that the Covid-19 outbreak could hit Britain\u2019s economic growth. In an interview with Sky News, Carney (who leaves the bank next month) said the UK is already feeling the impact - and it could get worse. He explains: What we are picking up with some of our bigger companies and companies around the world is that supply chains... are getting a little tight. That\u2019s lower activity. There\u2019s less tourism - as you can see on our streets here in the UK. That\u2019s lower activity as well. \u201cWe would expect world growth would be lower than it otherwise would be, and that has a knock-on effect on the UK. \u201cWe\u2019re not picking that up yet at all in the European and UK economic indicators, but if the world is slower than the UK, a very open economy, will have an impact.\u201d Virtually every company on the FTSE 100 is down this morning, with IAG now shedding almost 10%. The tech sector (-4.4%), miners (-4.3%), utilities (-4.25%) and consumer firms (-4.2%) are leading the rout. Only Rolls-Royce is defying the slump, after posting a 25% jump in underlying profits this morning. Bloomberg has calculated that six trillion dollars has been wiped off global markets since January 20th. That was the moment when the first human-to-human transmission of coronavirus was confirmed by Chinese authorities. Finland\u2019s national airline has added to the gloom, by warning that its profits will be hit hard by the coronavirus. Finnair has also scrapped its capacity growth target for this year, and hopes to slash \u20ac50m off its costs -- which could include temporary layoffs. Chief Executive Topi Manner said: \u201cAs the coronavirus situation has entered a new phase with outbreaks in several new countries, we will take appropriate measures to adapt our costs, operations and resources to better match our revenues.\u201d Today\u2019s early morning slump means the FTSE 100 is down around 800 points this week, or roughly 11% -- its worst performance since October 2008. There\u2019s still time for it to recover. But as things stand, the total losses this week are heading towards \u00a3200bn (it was \u00a3152bn last night). Newsflash: Britain\u2019s stock market has plunged by another 3.3% at the start of trading, to a fresh 14-month low. The FTSE 100 index has shed another 220 points, taking it down to 6582 points - its lowest level since December 27 2018. A week ago, the Footsie closed at 7404 points, before the coronavirus crisis triggered this week\u2019s selloff. Nearly every stock is down, some very sharply. British Airways owner IAG is the top faller, shedding 7% after it warned that Covid-19 was hurting its operations. Easyjet are down 5% after its announcement. Holiday firm TUI is also deep in the red, down another 5.7%. Mining companies are also being hit hard, with BHP Group and Antofagasta down over 5%. Demand for their iron ore and copper will slump if we enter a global recession. British Airways\u2019 parent company, IAG, has warned that its earnings outlook is \u201cadversely affected\u201d by the coronavirus outbreak. IAG has told the City that it is experiencing demand weakness on various European and Asian routes -- meaning it cannot give profit guidance for 2020 It has suffered a weakening of business travel, due to the cancellations of recent industry events such as trade shows, and \u201ccorporate travel restrictions\u201d. British Airways has already suspended flights to mainland China, and cut flights to Hong Kong, and is now cutting flights to Italy. These cutbacks will hurt IAG\u2019s capacity growth this year. It says: Capacity on Italian routes for March has been significantly reduced through a combination of cancellations and change of aircraft gauge and further capacity reductions will be activated over the coming days. We also expect to make some capacity reductions across our wider shorthaul network. Shorthaul capacity is not being redeployed at this stage. Budget airline easyJet has just announced that it is cutting some flights to Italy, due to the impact of the coronavirus. It is also cutting planning to cut costs -- by freezing \u201crecruitment, promotion and pay\u201d across its network, postponing non-critical spending, and cutting discretionary spending. Planes that would normally fly to Italy (where there are over 650 Covid-19 cases and 17 deaths) will be redeployed to other destinations. In a statement to the City, it says: Following the increased incidence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy, we have seen a significant softening of demand and load factors into and out of our Northern Italian bases. Further, we are also seeing some slower demand across our other European markets. As a result we will be making decisions to cancel some flights, particularly those into and out of Italy, while continuing to monitor the situation and adapting our flying programme to support demand. EasyJet has been badly hurt by this week\u2019s market rout, losing a third of its value, on fears that tourism to key destinations such as Italy will be badly hit. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the finacnial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stock markets are in freefall again today as investors are gripped with anxiety that the coronavirus will trigger a global recession. Last night the UK, European and US stock markets all fell into corrections, more than 10% below their peak. The Dow Jones suffering its worst points fall ever - shedding nearly 1,200 points in a heavy, panicky wave of selling (its worst percentage fall in two years). Further heavy losses are expected today in Europe, with the FTSE 100 called down another 3%, or 210 points, to around 6575 points. That would take its weekly losses to over 1,000 points, the worst week since the financial crisis a decade ago. Other European markets are also facing another day of wild swings, with France and Germany both called down 3%. There have already been further heavy falls in Asia today, as traders respond to the news that Covid-19 has now been detected in Nigeria, New Zealand and Lithuania for the first time. There have also been a further 44 deaths in China, and 327 new cases, plus another 256 cases in South Korea as the human cost of the coronavirus mounts. Here\u2019s the situation in Asia: The Nikkei has closed down 3.67% in Tokyo In Sydney the ASX200 finished off 3.2%. The Kospi ended 3.6% worse off. Hang Seng currently down 2.65% Shanghai down 2.95% Oil is also under pressure, dropping another 3% to fresh one-year lows. The scale of the market plunge is truly shocking, as investors brace for a global pandemic: The markets are \u201cfluttering between risk aversion and full-on capitulation\u201d, says Stephen Innes, chief market strategist at AxiCorp. The full impact of the outbreak is still unclear. But if schools and offices around the globe are forced to close, and if Chinese factories struggle to reopen, then there will be a massive impact on growth. But such a gloomy scenario could be avoided. As Richard Clode of asset managers Janus Henderson puts it: A worst case scenario of a global pandemic would undoubtedly have a significant economic impact and given the fragile nature of the global economy could tip the world into recession. For now that remains a low probability outcome and our on the ground reports from an assortment of technology companies in China give us confidence that with the right measures in place the virus could potentially be contained. We\u2019ll be tracking all the market action through the day. We\u2019ll also be watching the latest US trade and consumer confidence data, plus Canada will become the final G7 country to report growth figures for the last quarter.

The Spurs manager, who suggested that Son Heung-min could also ease his team\u2019s crisis in attack by making a swifter return than expected from a fractured arm, said Kane must be realistic after surgery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/28/chelsea-prescribe-rest-for-tammy-abrahams-troublesome-ankle\">Chelsea prescribe rest for Tammy Abraham's troublesome ankle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is what we are going to be,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cTottenham doesn\u2019t finish, doesn\u2019t end in May. There is going to be Tottenham for many, many years so we would never risk Harry in a difficult situation, no chance. He is going to be back when he is ready to be back.\u201d</p> <p>Mourinho has previously suggested that Kane could be out until the last two Premier League matches and even raised the prospect of him missing Euro 2020. However, Kane is progressing well and Mourinho now thinks the 26-year-old has a chance of a mid-April return.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives me a hope of, instead of [Kane playing] one or two matches, three, four or five,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThe feelings are good. Every time he has a problem, he\u2019s the kind of guy that doesn\u2019t accept protocols, a date, a fixture. He always tries to go ahead. Sometimes the players break protocol and come [back] earlier than expected. He\u2019s obviously a great professional and a fighter.\u201d</p> <p>Kane will not take any shortcuts in his recovery and Mourinho said the situation is different to when the forward recovered from an ankle injury to start when Spurs lost to Liverpool in the Champions League final last season.</p> <p>\u201cI would play only with one leg if I was a player and I was playing in a Champions League final,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWith crutches. How can you stop a player playing in a Champions League final? There are some matches where protocols mean nothing. I think it isn\u2019t the case to blame Harry or medical departments.\u201d</p> <p>Spurs lack cover for Kane and their problems were exacerbated when Son injured his right arm during the victory over Aston Villa two weeks ago.</p> <p>Son is in Seoul and will have to self-isolate for a fortnight after he returns to England this weekend because of government protocols regarding the coronavirus. However the South Korean, who had an operation this week, could play with a cast before the season is over. \u201cWe\u2019ll try all the possibilities to have him back for some matches,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI cannot imagine when. But there\u2019s a good possibility that before the end of the season, we have Harry and Sonny playing together.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has said Tottenham will not take risks with Harry Kane\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury, even though the striker is ahead of schedule in his rehabilitation and is expected to play before the end of the season. Kane has made speedy recoveries from injuries in the past and although the England captain started his on-field rehabilitation this week, Mourinho does not want to rush him back. The Spurs manager, who suggested that Son Heung-min could also ease his team\u2019s crisis in attack by making a swifter return than expected from a fractured arm, said Kane must be realistic after surgery. \u201cThat is what we are going to be,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cTottenham doesn\u2019t finish, doesn\u2019t end in May. There is going to be Tottenham for many, many years so we would never risk Harry in a difficult situation, no chance. He is going to be back when he is ready to be back.\u201d Mourinho has previously suggested that Kane could be out until the last two Premier League matches and even raised the prospect of him missing Euro 2020. However, Kane is progressing well and Mourinho now thinks the 26-year-old has a chance of a mid-April return. \u201cIt gives me a hope of, instead of [Kane playing] one or two matches, three, four or five,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cThe feelings are good. Every time he has a problem, he\u2019s the kind of guy that doesn\u2019t accept protocols, a date, a fixture. He always tries to go ahead. Sometimes the players break protocol and come [back] earlier than expected. He\u2019s obviously a great professional and a fighter.\u201d Kane will not take any shortcuts in his recovery and Mourinho said the situation is different to when the forward recovered from an ankle injury to start when Spurs lost to Liverpool in the Champions League final last season. \u201cI would play only with one leg if I was a player and I was playing in a Champions League final,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cWith crutches. How can you stop a player playing in a Champions League final? There are some matches where protocols mean nothing. I think it isn\u2019t the case to blame Harry or medical departments.\u201d Spurs lack cover for Kane and their problems were exacerbated when Son injured his right arm during the victory over Aston Villa two weeks ago. Son is in Seoul and will have to self-isolate for a fortnight after he returns to England this weekend because of government protocols regarding the coronavirus. However the South Korean, who had an operation this week, could play with a cast before the season is over. \u201cWe\u2019ll try all the possibilities to have him back for some matches,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI cannot imagine when. But there\u2019s a good possibility that before the end of the season, we have Harry and Sonny playing together.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me today. Thanks for following. I\u2019ll leave you with Nick Ames\u2019s report from Carrow Road \u2026 While we wait to hear from the managers, here\u2019s something for Leicester fans to ponder More here from goalscorer Lewis, who thinks Norwich can still make it. \u201cWhen the season started we knew it would be a battle from the beginning but with the squad and togetherness we always thought we could push through and survive in this league.\u201d Norwich\u2019s flying fullbacks Jamal Lewis and Max Aarons have been revelling in their victory tonight. \u201cI cut across it and aimed for that spot,\u201d says Lewis of his goal, which came from an Aarons cross. \u201cThe finish wasn\u2019t a surpise for me, he works on it every day,\u201d adds Aarons. \u201cThis is massive for us. We will go to Sheffield United with all guns blazing.\u201d Leicester\u2019s poor run continues and that unexpected defeat means it\u2019s just one win in the last seven for them in the Premier League. Their top four spot is looking more precarious by the week but they still have quite a gap to defend so I\u2019m sure Brendan Rodgers won\u2019t be panicking just yet. That\u2019s Norwich\u2019s fifth win of the season and second clean sheet at home. More importantly, it leaves them four points from safety with 10 games still to play. Not impossible with a fair wind... They couldn\u2019t, could they? Norwich have given themselves a fighting chance of survival with a crucial win. Well done them. 90min+4 Norwich have a free kick deep in the Leicester half with only a minute to play Drmic almost makes it 2-0. Time\u2019s almost up now anyway and Carrow Road is jumping... 90min+1 Five minutes added time as another cross from Chilwell goes astray. Norwich are almost home and hosed. 89 min Nothing doing again as Leicester are frustrated in attack. A break from Norwich then sees Schmeichel called into action to deny Stiepermann. 87 min Stiepermann enters the fray in what will be the last change of the night. He comes on for Duda, who has played well but should really have scored. 85 min It\u2019s not looking great for Leicester, who are struggling to create anything as the clock ticks down. Lots of sideways passing but no killer ball. 81 min That\u2019s enough for Pukki, who has been replaced by Josip Drmic as Norwich look to see this through. \u201cIt may not look sexy stats-wise but this has been a very watchable match between two likeable teams,\u201d emails Speakeasy Ray seven minutes ago. \u201cNorwich hardly look cowed and the Foxes look dangerous - that Canaries goal sets this up for a brilliant 20 minutes.\u201d 78 min Barnes smashes a wayward shot into the River Yare. They\u2019ll need a boat for that one. On comes Marc Albrighton for Perez in a last throw of the dice for Rodgers. 75 min Leicester are pushing forward and almost found a way through down the right just now after good play from Ricardo. Can Norwich stand firm for a second clean sheet of the season at home? 73 min That\u2019s Norwich\u2019s first goal from open play for nearly 700 minutes and a first Premier League goal for Lewis. The ball came to him after a cross from Aarons from the right eluded everyone in the middle but the finish was briliant, swerving right into the corner to leave Schmeichel helpless. Meanwhile Ndidi spurns a chance to equalise almost immediately... Jamal Lewis scores from a crazy angle to give the Canaries hope. What a strike! 68 min Wilfred Ndidi is on for Leicester in his first appearance since 22 January. Meanwhile a knackered Cantwell is replaced by Lukas Rupp 66 min Best chance of the night so far for Norwich and Duda should really have made it 1-0 after a lovely pass from Buendia. He went for power over placement though and Schmeichel was able to make a comfortable save. 65 min Barnes has been a real livewire for Leicester all night and he is the latest to test Krul but again his shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Where\u2019s Jamie Vardy when you need him? At home nursing his calf injury probably. 61 min Schmeichel produces an important reaction save to deny a fierce shot from Duda. Much better from Norwich, who haven\u2019t had a shot on target since the ninth minute apparently. Then Praet brings down Aarons and is duly booked. 57 min Kenny McLean tried his very best to take out Barnes with a cynical challenge but the winger is too quick for him! Lucky boy... 55 min Perez connects well with Chilwell\u2019s cross but the header is well off target. Just had another look at that Iheancho decision and it was incredibly harsh, with the ball just brushing his hand as it fell to his feet. 53 min Grant Hanley takes one for the team to bring down a flying Harvey Barnes and is shown a yellow card for his troubles. The free kick is cleared but it\u2019s been a strong start to this half from the visitors. 51 min The decision to disallow the goal certainly hasn\u2019t gone down well with the Leicester fans, who serenade Carrow Road with a chorus of \u2018Fuck VAR\u2019. It was harsh but them\u2019s the rules these days 49 min Iheanacho has the ball in the net but it\u2019s been disallowed by VAR after replays showed the ball hit his arm as he was bringing it under control. A shame because it was a brilliant finish from outside the box. 47 min Teemu Pukki thought he was in for a second but was correctly flagged offside. There needs to be a big half coming up for him if Norwich are to kick off their great escape. The teams are back out and it doesn\u2019t look like there have been any changes. Let\u2019s go! Some half-time reading if you will forgive the shameless self-promotion.... Both sides had their chances but Leicester will be more disappointed not to be ahead. Now where\u2019s Delia? 45 min+2 Another foul from Maddison gives Norwich a late opportunity in stoppage time but they can\u2019t make it count. 44 min Leicester\u2019s latest chance from a corner falls to Evans but his header is tame and easy for Tim Krul to gather. Maddison is always such a danger from set-pieces. 42 min Cantwell\u2019s mazy run sets up Pukki for a shot at goal but the Finland striker scuffs his shot well wide. Some lovely touches again from the England Under-21 player in the buildup, he\u2019s having a great season despite Norwich\u2019s struggles. 39 min Iheanacho wastes a brilliant opportunity to give Leicester the lead after a mistake from Jamal Lewis but the Nigerian blazes the chance over from six yards out. Replays suggested it may have been disallowed anyway by VAR but it was still a bad miss. 35 min Delia Smith has just been spotted in the stands but it doesn\u2019t look like she is in the mood for another speech. That could change if Norwich concede before half-time of course... 33 min Cantwell prevents Ricardo from whipping in another cross but concedes a corner in the process. But Soyuncu\u2019s overhead kick is so bad it doesn\u2019t even go for a throw-in!! 30 min Ben Chilwell has been receiving treatment next to the dugouts which has allowed Brendan Rodgers to have a quick chat with Maddison and Jonny Evans. More of the same is the instruction I\u2019d imagine. Chilwell is back on his feet again now so we\u2019re all good. 28 min Grant Hanley comes to Norwich\u2019s rescue after great work from Ayoze Perez sees him square the ball across the box. A corner routine then almost sees Iheanacho steal in to convert a brilliant cross from Maddsion. The pressure is building. 26 min Leicester hit the post! Ricardo\u2019s cross from the right is diverted onto the woodwork by Praet, much to the relief of the home supporters. 24 min Some more free-flowing football from Norwich with Cantwell at the heart of it once more. But then his mistake allows Praet to break only for Iheanacho to plant his shot into the river. 22 min Caglar Soyuncu is good looking enough to be a Hollywood movie star but is also pretty good at defending. He had to be at his best to block Pukki\u2019s shot there after some nice buildup play from Norwich. 19 min Nice footwork from Harvey Barnes to set up Dennis Praet for a shot outside the area but it\u2019s straight at the keeper. This game is bubbling up nicely... 14 min Maddison lucky to escape a booking after a foul on Aarons. \u201cNext one,\u201d says referee Craig Pawson 12 min Todd Cantwell is a real talent, as shown by his burst up field just now that saw him brought down for a foul 35 yards out. Buendia shapes to take it but only finds the wall. 9 min Poor defending from Ben Chilwell gives Ondrej Duda the opportunity to cross from the right after a corner and Ben Godfrey\u2019s header is on target but straight at Schmeichel. 7 min An excellent corner from Maddison picks out Hamza Choudhury totally unmarked but his header flies over the bar. A decent chance that 5 min A big night for Kelechi Iheanacho, who has enjoyed something of a revival under Brendan Rodgers. He gets the better of his marker but Leicester can\u2019t make the most of it in the end 2 mins And we\u2019re under way with Max Aarons putting in an early cross for Teemu Pukki which is easily gathered by Schmeichel The rain is coming down hard now in Norwich as the teams emerge onto the pitch. The home manager knows they are up against it but clearly won\u2019t be giving up before it\u2019s all over. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult - we\u2019re realistic,\u201d admits Daniel Farke. \u201cBut you have a chance in every game.\u201d Perhaps they could do with some kryptonite at the back, suggests Richard T. W. Arthur via email \u201cOn my way to the ophthamologist\u2019s, I notice that Norwich have Supermann on the bench,\u201d he writes. \u201cSurely he should be playing? They could certainly use his help.\u201d Norwich have the fewest points at home this season in the Premier League with just 12 so it\u2019s no surprise they are rock bottom. They have kept just one clean sheet at home this season and will be wary of the threat posed by Leicester even in Vardy\u2019s absence. A nice interview with James Maddison, who has admitted he has been looking forward to facing his former club all season. He spent two seasons at Carrow Road after joining from Coventry in 2016 but says there will be no room for any sentimentality once the game has started. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a nice occasion but, make no mistake, we\u2019re here to get three points,\u201d Maddison told Sky just now. The erudite Efan Ekoku is a pundit for Sky this evening and he has been assessing why his former side Norwich have struggled so much this season . \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d said the former striker. \u201cThere have been lots of good performances but they\u2019ve not been able to get across the finishing line enough.\u201d By way of pure coincidence, it happens to be exactly 15 years to the night since Delia Smith\u2019s infamous half-time teamtalk during their match against Manchester City. Here\u2019s a reminder of her stirring words as you\u2019ve never heard them before... So much for my bit about Vardy in the preamble then! As well as Leicester fans, I\u2019m sure there are a few Fantasy League managers also reeling from his absence tonight. This could be a big opportunity for Norwich to get three points but then again it\u2019s not all about Vardy with this Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team... And there\u2019s a boost for Norwich fans who like their playmakers with the news that Emi Buendia is back in the team having been left on the bench recently by Daniel Farke. Some early team news and it\u2019s a big shock with Jamie Vardy not in the Leicester squad due to a reported calf injury. Kelechi Iheanacho comes in up top Evening all. Welcome to our coverage of tonight\u2019s Premier League game between Norwich and Leicester at Carrow Road. It\u2019s almost do-or-die for the Canaries with games quickly running out to save themselves from the drop as they prepare to welcome the high-flying Foxes to East Anglia. Seven points stand between Daniel Farke\u2019s side and safety going into this match but you can bet their supporters will be up for a bit of Friday football under the lights, even with Storm Jorge expected to wreak havoc in the UK this weekend.

Fast forward 10 weeks and Arsenal\u2019s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has drawn level on 17 so it\u2019s up to Leicester\u2019s talisman to hit back. It could be a thriller. Join me...",
