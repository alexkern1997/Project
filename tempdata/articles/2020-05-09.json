Although there have been rumours of an outbreak before, it is the first time the outbreak has been so directly confirmed.<br></p> \n  <p>Ashoori said inmate Loghman Roozchang showed symptoms of the disease very soon after returning from furlough this week. He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> \n  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive.

The campaigners say prisoners are also moving between halls so making the quarantine a largely symbolic exercise designed to satisfy the World Health Organization, the UN body that advises national governments on how to defeat the infection.</p> \n  <p><strong>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</strong>, the best-known of the jailed British-Iranian dual nationals, had been kept in Evin for four years but was released on furlough in April and has spent the time on release at her parent\u2019s home on a tag in Tehran. She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety.

But if steps are not taken the world could see 31 million cases of gender-based violence, he warned. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence \u2013 including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response.</p> \n   <p>Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. </p> \n   <p>Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear \u2013 if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He added that governments and local authorities should consider it to be a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to make sure services are available, while calling on communities to look out for their friends, family and neighbours and speak out. </p> \n  <p>To victims, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Violence against you is <em>never</em> your fault. It is <em>never</em> your fault. Your home should be a secure place.

New Zealand\u2019s cabinet will meet on Monday to decide the future of the country\u2019s tough but effective lockdown \u2013 though Kiwis have been told not to visit their mums this Mother\u2019s Day. Next week, Ardern\u2019s government will plot a path back to something close to normality, meeting to decide a timetable for the removal of social and business restrictions. The prime minister has already released what level two restrictions will look like, including the re-opening of restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, cinemas and public facilities like museums and libraries. Social restrictions could end immediately, with provisions for schools, business and personal movement more likely to be phased in. Any decision will come too late for Kiwi mums to enjoy visits from sons and daughters not already in their household bubbles. Ardern has banned socialising outside of existing households, with few exceptions, and told Kiwis this week to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d ahead of Monday\u2019s review. Russia has registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row, after emerging as a new hotspot of the pandemic. A government tally on Friday showed 10,669 new cases over the last 24 hours, fewer than Thursday\u2019s record of 11,231, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 187,859. The country also recorded 98 new deaths from the virus, for a total of 1,723, and while some officials are considering softening the current lockdown, the WHO warned Russia is going through a \u201cdelayed epidemic.\u201d Russia now ranks fourth in Europe in terms of the total number of cases, according to an AFP tally, behind countries where the epidemic hit considerably earlier: Britain, Italy and Spain. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in a virtual briefing that \u201cRussia is probably experiencing a delayed epidemic\u201d and must \u201clearn some of the lessons\u201d which came at great cost in other parts of the world. On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an extension of a lockdown in the capital, where most cases are concentrated, to May 31. He also brought in a rule that people must wear masks and gloves in public transport and shops and announced that lockdown will be lifted for industries and construction projects. Residents of the capital are only allowed to leave their homes for brief trips to a shop, to walk dogs or to travel to essential jobs with a permit. Hello, Rebecca Ratcliffe here in Bangkok, taking over from Molly Blackall. The White House has instituted daily, as opposed to weekly, coronavirus tests of US president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence, Reuters reports. Earlier today, it was confirmed that Pence\u2019s press secretary, the wife of one of president Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, had tested positive for the coronavirus, raising alarm about the virus\u2019 potential spread within the White House\u2019s inner most circle. The diagnosis of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Friday, a day after news that Trump\u2019s personal valet had tested positive for the virus. Earlier on Friday, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. \u201cThey\u2019ve already started,\u201d he said on the network\u2019s \u201cFox and Friends\u201d morning program. Trump told Fox News he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure.

The Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has said that he will receive a proposal on Monday from his cabinet on the reopening of the country. This would include measures to reopen the economy after more than a month of quarantine measures. \u201cThey\u2019re going to present me with an initial proposal on Monday,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador told reporters on Friday. \u201cAnd we want to announce it to you and to the Mexican public on Wednesday or Thursday.\u201d Brazil has registered 10,222 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 751 deaths, the health ministry has said. That brings the total number of cases to 145,328 and the death toll to 9,897. Thanks to all those sending in tips and pointers, it\u2019s very much appreciated!

More than 500 workers at an industrial facility in the country tested positive, out of 1,300 tested. The overall number of cases in Ghana rose to 4,012, including 18 deaths, from 3,091 on Thursday. This figure is the highest in West Africa, but it\u2019s important to note that Ghana has conducted many more tests than other countries in the region. Boris Johnson will announce on Sunday that all travellers coming to the UK will be quarantined for a fortnight, according to the Times newspaper. \u201cPassengers arriving at airports and ports including Britons returning from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days,\u201d the paper said, citing a government source. Travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will be exempt, as will lorry drivers bringing crucial supplies. The measures are believed to be coming into force in early June. Authorities will carry out spot checks and hand out to fines of up to \u00a31,000, or possibly deportation, for those found to be breaking the rules, the report said. It added that travellers will have to provide the UK address at which they intend to self-isolate. Registered voters in California will receive mail-in ballots for the November election, state governor Gavin Newsom has said. He added that the state was also working to set up safe places for in-person voting. California\u2019s secretary of state, Alex Padilla, who joined Newsom by phone during the state\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, said California was the first state to send every voter a ballot in advance of the election. Return postage will be prepaid. Concerns have been growing about the effect of coronavirus on in-person voting. Airline company Delta is to suspend services to 10 US airports until at least September, due to the massive drop in air travel caused by the pandemic. Delta Air Lines Inc is halting flights to Chicago Midway; Oakland International Airport; Hollywood Burbank; Long Beach; Providence, RI, Westchester County Airport; Stewart International; Akron-Canton, Ohio; Manchester, NH; and Newport News/Williamsburg. It has chosen these airports as it services other airports nearby. Delta is cutting flights by 85% in the second quarter and seeking permission from American regulators to suspend flights to nine cities that could be served by other airports, including three in Michigan. According to the company, between April 1 and April 22, between just one and 14 passengers flew daily on the airline\u2019s planes each way from those nine airports. In the last two weeks, demand for air travel has begun to rise again, but is still down approximately 94% compared to last year. The US has accused China and Russia of increasing cooperation to spread false narratives about the coronavirus pandemic, AFP are reporting. Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the State Department\u2019s global engagement centre, which tracks foreign propaganda, said Beijing was increasingly adopting techniques honed by Moscow. \u201cEven before the Covid-19 crisis, we assessed a certain level of coordination between Russia and the PRC in the realm of propaganda,\u201d Gabrielle told reporters. \u201cBut with this pandemic the cooperation has accelerated rapidly. \u201cWe see this convergence as a result of what we consider to be pragmatism between the two actors who want to shape public understanding of the Covid pandemic for their own purposes.\u201d The global engagement centre said earlier that thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts were spreading conspiracies about the pandemic, including notions that the virus, detected in Wuhan, China, was created by the United States. Tensions have increased recently, as the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, persisted with allegations that coronavirus originated in a Wuhan laboratory \u2013 despite the WHO and the US government\u2019s own top epidemiologist saying there was no evidence the virus came from a lab. Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed cooperation over the pandemic in a phonecall with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday. Putin told him that Russia \u201copposes the attempts by some forces to use the epidemic as a pretext to blame China and will stand firmly by China\u2019s side\u201d, according to China\u2019s state-run Xinhua news agency. Thousands of cyclists have taken to the streets of the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana, to protest against the government and its coronavirus restrictions. The demonstration came after allegations of government corruption in purchasing face masks and ventilators surfaced last month. The government has denied wrongdoing. Protesters also accuse the government of using coronavirus to restrict personal freedoms. Slovenia has confirmed 1,450 coronavirus cases and 100 deaths, and introduced lockdown measures in mid March. Here are some photographs: Second world war soldiers, sailors and airmen would \u201crecognise and admire\u201d the efforts NHS, care and key workers, Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth has said in her VE (Victory in Europe) day speech. She praised the nation\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying that empty streets have been filled with \u201clove and care\u201d, as she commemorated 75 years to the day Britain and its Allies formally accepted Nazi Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender at the end of the Second World War. The Queen also highlighted the relevance of the VE day message to the coronavirus pandemic - \u201cnever give up, never despair\u201d. Peru is extending its lockdown for another two weeks after 54 days of quarantine, Peru\u2019s president Mart\u00edn Vizcarra announced in a press briefing. \u201cWe are in an extreme situation. We all have to work together,\u201d he said on Friday, stressing that the country had been unable to sufficiently cut the rising rate of infections amid several outbreaks in different parts of the country. Covid-19 hotspots have flared up on the country\u2019s northern coast, where social distancing rules have been routinely flouted, and in the isolated Amazon city of Iquitos which suffered from a critical lack of medical supplies, particularly oxygen. Despite one of the most stringent lockdowns in Latin America, Peru recorded more than 58,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 1,627 deaths by Friday. Even in the capital Lima, medical attention was on the verge of collapse despite the best efforts of hospital workers who lacked PPE. However, Vizcarra announced an increase in the number of intensive care beds to 937. The popular leader pointed out that banks, bus stops, and, most of all, food markets had been the principal points of contagion. He ordered the closure of 36 \u201ccritical\u201d markets where spot tests revealed an infection rate of up to 40% among stallholders, and clampdowns in a total of 380 across the country. With Mother\u2019s Day looming on Sunday, Vizcarra issued a stark warning to his family-minded compatriots, as he paid tribute to all the Peruvian mothers working through the pandemic. \u201cThe greatest desire is to go to your mother and give her a big hug (\u2026) but we cannot do that, because we are responsible,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best way of protecting your mother is to keep her far away. It\u2019s hard but we will beat this [virus].\u201d Amid the growing toll on mental health after close to two months of quarantine, Vizcarra said that children under the age of 14 would be allowed to venture out with an adult up to 500m from their homes from Monday 18 May. The press secretary of US vice-president Mike Pence, who is married to one of President Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisors, has tested positive for coronavirus. The test result of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican members of congress on Friday. \u201cKatie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,\u201d Trump said. He noted that he had not personally been in contact with her but that she had spent time with the Vice President. \u201cI understand Mike has been tested...and he tested negative.\u201d The news comes a day after it was revealed that Trump\u2019s personal valet had tested positive for the virus. The news of the infections has raised concern about the spread of coronavirus in the White House\u2019s inner circle. However, a senior administration official stressed that Trump and Pence have not been in recent contact with Miller, according to a media pool report referenced by Reuters. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has sought to defend administration efforts to protect Trump and Pence, including contact tracing and adherence to national guidelines. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,\u201d McEnany insisted to reporters at a White House news briefing on Friday. Car company Honda says it will gradually resume production at its US and Canadian auto plants from May 11, Reuters are reporting. However, Tesla has not been approved to resume production, a health official for Alameda County, California, has said. It\u2019s currently unclear exactly where these restrictions for Tesla apply - I\u2019ll update you as I find out more. Apple will reopen a handful of stores across four US states from next week. The company said it will open \u201csome\u201d stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina. Its Boise, Idaho location will open Monday, with others to follow later in the week. However, the company says it will require customers to wear masks and undergo temperature checks before entering its stores. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of customers in the store at a time, which could create delays for walk-in customers, the company warned. Apple executives have said they are examining local health data at the county and city level in each community where the company has physical stores to determine when to reopen. Barcelona will also be prevented from moving on to the next stage of Spain\u2019s exit from lockdown, Spanish Health Emergency Coordinator Fernando Simon has said. Like Madrid, reported earlier, the metropolitan areas of Barcelona were not deemed ready to ease lockdown restrictions. The Spanish government is conducting a four stage end to lockdown, with an easing of restrictions contingent on the measures like the rate of infection in the region. The second stage allows bars, restaurants and places of worship to open with limited capacity. The highly populated regions of Madrid and Catalonia - home to Barcelona - account for around half of the confirmed infected cases in the country. Regional Spanish news reports suggest Malaga and Costa del Sol will also be prevented from moving forward. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the first diagnostic coronavirus test that allows patients to collect saliva samples at-home, the administration has said. The test will cost $150 and needs to be fully supervised by a practitioner via telemedicine to ensure proper sample collection. The decision is part of the FDA\u2019s efforts to expand testing capabilities for the fast-spreading virus, which has caused over 70,000 deaths in the United States. Here is an update from Will Costa in Asunci\u00f3n on the coronavirus pandemic in Paraguay: Escalating levels of COVID-19 infection in Brazil are causing concerns in the neighbouring country of Paraguay as large numbers of cases of the disease are being recorded among Paraguayan citizens returning across the border between the two countries. Of 101 new reported cases of COVID-19 in Paraguay on Friday, 99 were from Paraguayans being held in compulsory quarantine centres after returning from Brazil. This represented by far Paraguay\u2019s largest daily jump in cases of the virus. Paraguay has recorded some of the lowest levels of COVID-19 in South America\u2014currently 563 cases of infection and 10 deaths. It was one of the first countries in Latin America to implement strict containment measures and on Monday also became one of the first countries in the region to ease total lock-down measures. In contrast, Brazil has the highest levels of COVID-19 infection in Latin America with 140,023 cases of infection and 9,600 deaths. The handling of the pandemic by the government of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticised. In a press conference on Friday morning, Paraguayan health minister Julio Mazzoleni said, \u201cThere is a very high risk that Brazil could drag Paraguay down. That\u2019s why we are taking the necessary measures of implementing holding centres, quarantine and restricted access to the country\u201d. Paraguayan land borders have been closed since March 24. Local press reports that approximately one hundred Paraguayans are continuing to arrive at the border at Paraguay\u2019s second city, Ciudad del Este, each day in the hope of crossing back into Paraguay from Brazil. According to the Paraguayan Human Rights Coordination Group (CODEHUPY), many of these people have been forced to wait in dire and unsanitary conditions on a bridge between the two countries while waiting to enter Paraguay and be housed in obligatory quarantine centres. While the Paraguayan government has expressed its concerns about the high possibilities of importing the virus from Brazil, videos circulating on social media have also raised large concerns that very poor conditions within the quarantine centres are contributing to mass transmission among those being held. President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez travelled to Ciudad del Este, Paraguay\u2019s second city, on Monday to inspect increased military presence along the Brazilian border. The Paraguayan military has also acted to reinforce the famously open border between the neighbouring cities of Pedro Juan Caballero (Paraguay) and Ponta Por\u00e3 (Brazil) by digging a trench. Colombia\u2019s capital of Bogota will lift restrictions which required men and women to shop on separate days, the city\u2019s mayor has said. The rule has been in place for nearly a month, but will end on Monday. Similar measures have been put in place across Latin America, and have been criticised by LGBT groups and transgender people, who say the restrictions have exposed them to discrimination and violence from people questioning their right to be out. US president Donald Trump has just said coronavirus \u201cwill go away without a vaccine\u201d, but there may be \u201csome flare ups next year\u201d. However he has said this may not be until after autumn, or next year, and did not offer any scientific evidence for that prediction. \u201c[Viruses] die too, like everything else,\u201d he said. On that cheery note - Trump is speaking at the moment with Republican members of Congress. I\u2019ll update you with some of the highlights as we go. Local authorities in Germany are set to reimpose some lockdown measures, after seeing a spike in new coronavirus cases. In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany\u2019s most populous state, there has been a rise in cases at a slaughterhouse in the Coesfeld district, with 150 of 1,200 employees testing positive for coronavirus. The spike has caused local officials to postpone the lifting of restrictions, which would have seen restaurants, fitness studios, tourist spots and larger shops, open on 11 May, for one week. However, the gradual reopening of schools and daycare centres will go ahead as planned. The state\u2019s health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, ordered the closure of the slaughterhouse and testing of all meat processing plant employees in the state. It comes after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday that Germany could slowly return to normal, after the country\u2019s infection rate slowed and mortality rate remained relatively low. Germany\u2019s 16 federal authorities are able to decide on the lifting of restrictions in their own state. The coronavirus death toll in France has risen by 243, to 26,230. Friday\u2019s daily death toll marks an increase on Thursday\u2019s, which was 178. The number of people in intensive care units (ICU) fell by 93, or 3%, to 2,868, the French Health Ministry said in a statement. This is well below half of the peak of 7,148 people in ICU, seen on April 8. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus also fell to 22,724 from 23,208. This marks a continuation of an uninterrupted three-week fall, and is down 30% from an April 14 peak of 32,292. France, which has been in lockdown nationally for almost two months, will begin to lift restrictions on Monday. My colleague Julian Borger, the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, has this update from Washington: The US has stopped a vote on a UN Security Council resolution to support Secretary General Antonio Guterres\u2019s call for a global ceasefire during the Covid-19 pandemic. After more than six weeks of wrangling, France thought it had achieved a breakthrough last night. But the French underestimated the determination of the Trump administration when it comes to demonising the World Health Organisation. The US mission wanted no references to the WHO in the resolution. So the French watered down the reference in the resolution to \u201cspecialised health agencies\u201d of the UN (of which there is really only one - the WHO). The US mission seemed to be on board last night, but this morning they signalled that the wording was still not acceptable, leaving western diplomats at the UN to suspect that someone high up in Washington must have intervened. Hello, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the blog for the next few hours. I hope you\u2019re all staying safe and well, wherever in the world you\u2019re reading from. If you spot anything I miss, feel free to drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will endeavour to read it all! Thanks in advance. African Americans in parts of New York City are being arrested for violating social distancing rules at a far higher rate than white people, according to data from the Brooklyn district attorney. Adam Gabbatt reports that data showed that between 17 March and 4 May, 40 people were arrested in Brooklyn for breaking social distancing rules. One was white, four were Hispanic and 35 were black. The figures lend weight to anecdotal evidence which suggests that whiter and more affluent areas of the city are less likely to be targeted by police. More than a third of the arrests were made in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Brownsville, while no arrests were made in the predominantly white neighbourhood of Park Slope. A 43-year-old British man may undergo a lung transplant in Vietnam, where he is critically ill with Covid-19. The man, a Vietnam Airlines pilot, developed a fever and cough on 17 March, and was later admitted to Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Tropical Diseases. He is on a extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, a form of life support used when a person\u2019s heart or lungs are unable to function fully, the government\u2019s news portal VGP News reported, and is being treated with antibiotics and dialysis. Lung ultrasound scans indicate his right lung has collapsed, according to a Ministry of Health report published on Monday. The man is reportedly experiencing cytokine storms, an overreaction of the immune system. Regular updates are published in state media, and many in the country have commented online, wishing him well. You can read the full story here \u2013 The Spanish government has refused the Madrid region permission to loosen its coronavirus lockdown, saying the area is not yet ready to move to the next phase of de-escalation. The area in and around the capital is the region of Spain that has been hit hardest by the virus. More than 13,500 people have died there from Covid-19, or with associated symptoms, while 64,333 cases have been confirmed. The health ministry said that while the region had sufficient care capacity, the detection capabilities of its primary medical facilities needed to be strengthened further. The widely anticipated refusal of permission came 24 hours after the Madrid region\u2019s director of public health resigned in protest at the Madrid regional government\u2019s decision to seek a loosening of the lockdown from Monday. In her resignation letter, Yoland Fuentes said that the bid to relax restrictions \u201cwas not based on health criteria\u201d. Spain\u2019s deputy prime minister, the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, went further, accusing the Madrid region\u2019s conservative president, Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, of \u201cplaying with people\u2019s lives\u201d for political ends. D\u00edaz Ayuso hit back, saying Iglesias had no idea of the situation in Madrid and had \u201cnever lent a hand\u201d there. Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe following the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March, is easing its way out via a four-phase lockdown aimed at reaching \u201ca new normality\u201d by the end of June. Spain reported 221 deaths on Friday, down from daily totals of more than 900 deaths a month ago. To date, the country has confirmed 222,857 cases and 26,229 deaths. Desperate times call for desperate measures and at one care home in Portugal, under severe coronavirus lockdown, that means employing a crane to facilitate meetings between residents and their loved ones, reports AFP. \u201cHow are you?\u201d Cremilde Pereira asks her older brother Jose from the crane that has parked her level with his first floor window. \u201cLike a bird in a cage!\u201d replies the 79-year-old who is seated at his window in his wheelchair, flanked by two caregivers wearing clear plastic visors. \u201cWhen all this is over, you will have rice pudding and cake,\u201d says 68-year-old Cremilde, regretting that she was not able to celebrate Jose\u2019s birthday. This visit marks the first time the pair have seen each other in two months of confinement. \u201cWith everything that has happened in retirement homes, I am always worried about him,\u201d says Cremilde, a former grocer. Portugal as a whole has been relatively lightly touched by the pandemic with just over a thousand deaths. That has prompted the authorities to begin the process of loosening the lockdown from Monday but no date has yet been set for when retirement homes can welcome visitors again. With far more Indigenous languages than any other country in Central America, Guatemala faces a particular challenge in communicating information on the coronavirus, reports Jeff Abbott in Guatemala City. \u201cIt is critical to inform the people in their language,\u201d said Freddy G\u00e1lvez, who works with the Academy of Mayan Languages of Guatemala. \u201cIf we want to protect the lives of all Guatemalans, it is important that the state tell them what to do in their own languages,\u201d he said. Guatemala\u2019s Indigenous populations - the Xinca, the Garifuna, and the 22 Mayan peoples - have historically faced intense discrimination and racism. Indigenous regions suffer from extreme economic inequalities, resulting in higher levels of poverty, lack of opportunity, and extreme levels of malnutrition, as well as lack of access to essential services such as education and health care. While the 2018 census states that only 44 percent of residents of Guatemala identify as indigenous, according to G\u00e1lvez over 60 percent of the Guatemalan population speaks an indigenous language. Many of these people are monolingual or speak little Spanish. The Guatemalan government has reported 832 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 23 deaths since 13 March. The Academy of Mayan Languages of Guatemala is working with local translators to produce videos, radio spots, and materials for social media to provide communities with information and means of prevention. Local mayors, Indigenous ancestral authorities, and activists have also launched campaigns in Indigenous languages in towns across the highlands to inform communities and to provide translations of government decrees through community radio stations, local television, and via social media. Mauricio M\u00e9ndez, the mayor of the Tz\u2019utujil Maya town of San Pedro la Laguna in the Department of Solol\u00e1, is working to provide translations. \u201cThe entire message about how to prevent coronavirus is translated to Tz\u2019utujil,\u201d said M\u00e9ndez. \u201cOur population is indigenous, we have our language, and that is how we communicate within our community.\u201d Critics say the government\u2019s efforts to inform indigenous communities have largely been limited to information on prevention, leading to criticism. \u201cThe President\u2019s campaign is very weak,\u201d said Byron Paredes, Indigenous Rights Defender with the Human Rights Ombudsman office. Paredes also points out that there remains limited information about the curfew and other means taken to present the spread of the virus. Added to this, according to Paredes, there exists no state campaign in the Xinca or Garifuna languages. \u201cThe Garifuna and Xinca languages are left out,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have not received any information.\u201d Dr Michael Ryan says that he and his colleagues also long to see and hug their families, but that social distancing is important to \u201cprotect those we love and to make sure we end this as quickly as possible\u201d. He says the WHO is looking at the whole selection of measures that have been introduced in different countries and then lifted, and they will examine the epidemiology of each of those. \u201cA careful and measured return of those kind of normal activities of work and school - especially when they are done with density reduction\u201d seems to work, he says, but mass gatherings are much more tricky. We may have to live with a significant change to our lifestyles until we have a vaccine, he says. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t necessarily all bad.\u201d He says we have seen benefits to the environment and, in some ways, to our connectedness. Ryan finishes: Through solidarity we will win the fight and nobody is safe until everybody is safe. Dr Michael Ryan says Russia is experiencing a \u201cdelayed epidemic\u201d and could learn lessons from what has happened in asian countries and countries in western Europe. He says the country has increased its testing and and that that could be part of the reason for the increased number of cases, but that they have also seen increased deaths. Ryan says the Russian government has shifted its approach, introducing strict social distancing rules. He says that the country is struggling, as many countries have struggled, with introducing \u201csystematic contact tracing\u201d when cases begin to rise very rapidly. One of the few countries to manage to do this to get on top of a big outbreak has been South Korea, says Ryan. But you need a \u201ccoherent, very well resourced and very well trained public health work force\u201d for that. The panel is asked about the idea of testing waste water to find traces of the virus. Dr Maria van Kerkhove says there is a unit at the WHO looking at this and that it is possible that this technique could be used to see where the virus is. She adds that it is more important to look at detecting the virus in people. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme, says that we should not lose focus on the simple principles of isolating, contact tracing and locking down the virus. \u201cWe indeed to go back to the basic principles of how we control this disease,\u201d he says. Dr Maria van Kerkhove is asked about a study that suggested smokers were less likely to be hospitalised from Covid 19. She says that research has not been peer reviewed and that there was a lot of evidence that coronavirus \u2013 as a respiratory disease \u2013 was more likely to kill smokers. Talking about countries that are lifting lockdown measures, van Kerkhove says that is important restrictions are lifted in a \u201cslow and controlled way\u201d. \u201cThere may be a push and pull for some time as we really work to try and suppress this virus across the globe,\u201d she says. Tedros Adhanom, the director general of the World Health Organization, is making opening remarks. He says it is the 40th anniversary of the official declaration of the eradication of smallpox. He says it is the first, and to date, the only disease we have managed to eradicate completely. It killed 300 million people in the 20th century alone. \u201cIt is the biggest public health triumph in history,\u201d he says, and a reminder of what we can achieve when we come together. The World Health Organization is due to hold a press conference on the coronavirus pandemic. You can watch it at the top of this blog. Fears of a homophobic backlash and the forced outing of gay people are growing in South Korea after a man infected with coronavirus was reported in the media to have attended clubs in Seoul\u2019s gay district. Nemo Kim reports that a 31-year-old man tested positive on Thursday and a further 14 of his contacts were on Friday confirmed to be infected with the virus. South Korea has won widespread praise for its \u201ctrack and trace\u201d model of containing the pandemic, which has used rigorous testing and isolation to reduce new cases to a handful a day \u2013 mostly from people arriving into the country \u2013 but not without privacy concerns. Members of the gay community said they fear efforts to out them after a major media outlet, Kookmin Ilbo, reported that the man had been in gay clubs in the capital\u2019s Itaewon district. Some social media users then posted video footage from its bars and clubs, urging followers for donations \u201cto help put a stop to these disgusting goings-on\u201d. You can read the full story here \u2013 Denmark will reopen museums, theatres, cinemas, outdoor amusement parks and zoos on 8 June, the country\u2019s government has said. A restriction on gatherings, currently limited to 10 people, will also be revised to between 30 and 50 people depending on the type of event, AFP reports. The announcement came hours after the Scandinavian country said it would allow shopping centres to reopen from 11 May, while restaurants, places of worship and schools for 11- to 15-year-olds would resume a week later. Bars, nightclubs and smaller concert venues will have to wait until sometime in August to reopen. Meanwhile, most office workers will be allowed to return to work as soon as their workplace meets social distancing and hygiene regulations. The timeline is the result of an agreement reached by political parties in parliament. \u201cThe parties note that the reopening is expected to lead to a rise in infections and hospital admissions,\u201d a statement from the office of the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said. She added that authorities would monitor the situation closely and restrictions would be reimposed in the event of a sharp rise in cases. Denmark was among the first countries in Europe to roll out measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, doing so in mid-March. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has recorded 10,281 cases, with 514 deaths. Deaths and infections are higher than its similarly-sized Nordic neighbours Norway, which has 7,995 cases and 209 deaths, and Finland with 5,673 cases and 255 deaths. Sweden, which is about twice the size but has adopted softer measures than the other Nordic countries, has 24,623 cases and 3,040 deaths. Hello, this is Frances Perraudin in London again. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest updates in the coronavirus pandemic for the rest of the day. You can contact me with comments and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on Twitter @fperraudin. Nearly 20,000 prisoners in South Africa are to be released to help curb the spread of Covid-19 in jails, the country\u2019s president has announced. Cyril Ramaphosa said around 19,000 low-risk inmates would be freed, following a United Nations call for countries to reduce their prison populations so that social distancing and self-isolation conditions can be observed. South Africa, beset by high crime rates and violence against women and children, has 155,000 prisoners. The country of 58 million people has recorded 8,232 coronavirus cases of COVID-19 and 161 deaths. Ramaphosa said in a statement: In South Africa, as in many other countries, correctional facilities have witnessed outbreaks of coronavirus infections among inmates and personnel.\u201d South Africa has registered 172 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three deaths at its correctional facilities including inmates and staff, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola said at a briefing outlining details of the release. \u201cWe are confronted with a glaring impossibility of maintaining social distancing in our centres due to overcrowding,\u201d said Lamola. Italian opposition parties have filed a motion of no-confidence in Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede, who has come under fire over the release of 376 top mafiosi due to the risk of Covid-19 infection. Since the beginning of the ourbreak, Italian judges set free hundreds of ageing mobsters suffering from specific illnesses because they are \u201cat risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection.\u201d Prosecutors, anti-mafia associations and parties have protested against the judges\u2019 decisions, fearing mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release. Although Bonafede clarified last week that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and called for a new norm to revise rules on releasing mafia bosses to house arrest, centre-right opposition filed a motion of no-confidence. Bonafede, who is a member of the 5-Star Movement (M5S), told ANSA that the centre right\u2019s move would mean \u201cundermining confidence in the fight against corruption, the fight against the mafias, reforms to make trials shorter and more efficient, and measures to make sure no one goes unpunished\u201d. Mobsters recently released from prison and placed under house arrests include Cosa Nostra\u2019s influential boss Francesco Bonura, 78, who was serving a 23-year sentence, and alleged \u2019Ndrangheta bosses Vincenzino Iannazzo, 65, and Rocco Santo Flipppone, 72. Judges feared that a Covid-19 infection could be lethal for Filippone since he suffers from serious cardio-vascular disease. Another Cosa Nostra mafia boss, Franco Cataldo, 85, was released on Monday. Cataldo was among those convicted of kidnapping 15-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo, son of informant Santino Di Matteo. The boy was later strangled and dissolved in acid at the orders of superboss Giovanni Brusca. In China, tickets for the first days of Shanghai Disneyland\u2019s re-opening, after a three-month shutdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic, have sold out. Disney fans have snapped up the chance to go to the park from Monday, with tickets no longer available on the park\u2019s online booking service through to next Thursday. Entry to the attraction is also sold out on the following weekend, on May 16 and 17. But, in a sign there is still some hesitation about large numbers passing in one place, the Chinese government has asked Disney to cap attendance of the re-opened park at 30% of capacity, or roughly 24,000 people, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said on Tuesday. The park was first closed on January 25 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the country, with the attraction among venues forced to shut to comply with social distancing rules. Disney, which later closed its other resorts worldwide as the coronavirus spread, shuttered its other parks across the globe with executives saying the closures will cost the company roughly $1 billion in profits. In March, Disney re-opened some dining and shopping attractions at its Shanghai site, though its main theme park has remained closed. Disney will restart operations with \u201cfar below\u201d that number for a few weeks while it adjusts to new safeguards including social distancing, masks and temperature screenings for visitors and employees, Chapek said. Hello readers, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the global live blog for a short while as my colleague, Frances Perraudin, takes a break. Here\u2019s an update on the terrible news that a group of migrant workers has been killed by a train in India \u2013 from our South Asia correspondent Hannah Ellis-Petersen. India may have been under the world\u2019s largest lockdown for almost two months but the exodus of its tens of millions of migrant workers, who, without any transport or any way to earn money have taken to walking sometimes thousands of miles in baking heat to get back home, has continued unabated. In one of the most tragic incidents so far, it has emerged that 16 exhausted migrant workers, who were attempting to walk the 150 miles home to Bhusaval in the state of Maharashtra, died after falling asleep on the train tracks. According to Virendra Singh, the 22-year-old who was the only one of the group who survived, they had presumed that because trains had been stopped during lockdown, it would be safe to briefly rest on the tracks. They were run over at 5:15am on Friday morning by a train travelling from Mumbai. \u201cWe wanted to go back to our village as for the past month and a half there was no work and no money,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe had started walking at 7pm on Thursday and at 4am everyone\u2019s legs were in pain, and so we took a rest on the tracks. When I heard the train sound from the distance I screamed at them to move, but they were asleep and did not hear, and the train mowed them over.\u201d The train tracks were left littered with the meagre possessions they were carrying, including battered shoes and the few roti they were surviving on. India\u2019s lockdown of its 1.3bn people has been described as one of the largest and harshest in the world, depriving the 80% of India\u2019s workforce who work in the informal sector of a way of earning a living. Migrant workers who did not attempt to walk home have been confined to camps and reliant on food donations from government and NGOs. Cases of coronavirus in India currently stand at 56,516, with 1,895 deaths. Experts say the country has not yet reached its peak. More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April and the unemployment rate more than trebled as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the global economy, triggering a financial crisis unseen since the Great Depression. My colleagues in New York report an announcement by the Department of Labor that the US unemployment rate rose to 14.7% from just 4.4% in March and a near 50-year low of 3.5% in February before the US was hit by the virus. A decade\u2019s worth of job gains have now been wiped out in under two months. The latest jobs losses are the worst monthly figure on record. The previous peak for unemployment was 10.8% in 1982 and the largest monthly job loss, close to 2m, came in September 1945 at the end of the second world war, when the country was demobilizing. April\u2019s job losses also easily eclipsed the 800,000 jobs lost in March 2009, the height of the last recession. \u201cThese are truly mind-blowing numbers,\u201d said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d You can read the full story here \u2013 Hong Kong has begun to ease major social distancing measures today with bars, gyms, beauty parlours and cinemas reopening their doors, reports AFP. Queues formed outside gyms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city on Friday morning for employees to check temperatures as people celebrated the return of some normalcy to the city. Doris, a 39-year-old yoga teacher, said her first classes were already filled after weeks of teaching online. \u201cI\u2019m excited to share again... and see my students,\u201d she told the news agency. \u201cI was quite impatient to get back to the gym,\u201d added Alexandre, a 26-year-old finance worker after completing a workout in the city\u2019s commercial district. \u201cIt shows that life is starting to get back to normal even though we haven\u2019t been locked up like in Europe.\u201d The less health-conscious flocked to watering holes, some of which opened their doors as soon as the clock struck midnight. \u201cLast month we lost a lot of money,\u201d bar manager Nikita told AFP as he received the first punters in four weeks. \u201cBut still, we are just super happy to be back open.\u201d Most of Hong Kong\u2019s entertainment venues were shuttered in early April when the city suffered a second wave of infections \u2013 primarily residents returning from Europe and North America as the pandemic spread rapidly there. But health officials have made impressive headway against the disease thanks to efficient testing, tracing and treatment programmes with just over 1,000 infections and four deaths. New Covid-19 cases have been in the single digits for the last 18 days - with eleven days showing a zero tally. All new infections are residents returning from overseas who are quickly quarantined. The economic fallout from coronavirus has come to Silicon Valley, with major tech firms announcing layoffs in recent weeks, reports Kari Paul in San Francisco. On Wednesday, Uber became the latest company to announce cuts, revealing in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will lay off 3,700 workers \u2013 roughly 14% of its global workforce. Uber cited the pandemic in its filing, saying Covid-19 had affected its entire business, including financial performance, investments in new products, ability to attract drivers, and corporate strategy. Uber\u2019s announcement came after several other tech companies said they were making cuts amid the crisis. Uber\u2019s biggest rival, Lyft, announced last week it would lay off 982 members of its staff and furloughing a further 288. Airbnb announced this week it would lay off 1,900 people \u2013 roughly 25% of its staff. The vaping company Juul announced in April it would lay off 800 members of its staff and move its headquarters to Washington DC. Yelp announced last month it would lay off 1,000 employees and furlough 1,100 more. WeWork announced in March it would lay off 250 employees and is expected to cut more jobs by the end of May. You can read the full story here: The Middle Eastern kingdom Jordan identified 21 cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, a disturbing rise after more than a week in which zero cases were recorded each day. Jordanians had thought they were successfully eradicating the disease thanks to a harsh lockdown that has gradually started to be eased in the past fortnight. Mafraq, a town on the Syrian border with a large refugee population, recorded 16 of the new cases and has been sealed off by authorities. Elements of the lockdown that were supposed to be cancelled this week will remain in place as a result of the surge in infections. The new cases have underscored that containing the virus is a long-term challenge and that it may be impossible to completely erase it from the country, especially as its borders to the outside world are reopened over the coming months. Several hundred Jordanians have been repatriated in the past weeks and are being quarantined, including a group of students. They are supposed to be practising social distancing but video footage went viral this week showing them dancing a traditional \u201cdabke\u201d outside their caravans at the Dead Sea. The video sparked outrage and the government announced on Thursday it had come up with a novel punishment for the young men: they have had their heads shaved. The Foreign Office has paid tribute to the British Gurkhas who rescued 109 UK nationals and 28 other nationals stranded in remote parts of Nepal. Disclosing details of the mission, which took place last month, the government said they travelled more than 4,000 miles through the Himalayas to 13 different districts, negotiating river crossings and landslides, to reach the tourists scattered across dozens of mountainous towns, villages and national parks. In some instances, the soldiers had to set up camp on the side of the road overnight to reach the tourists. One, Sgt Prakash Gurung, drove nine and a half hours solo to Manang in the north-west of the country. The journey was almost aborted due to a landslide. \u201cI stepped up to volunteer because I thought it was a part of my job. Helping people in dire situations gives me a sense of satisfaction. The gratitude people expressed in messages has encouraged me to do more of this sort of work,\u201d said Gurung, who is based in a barracks in Folkestone, Kent. The UK ambassador in Nepal, Nicola Pollitt, said 700 British travellers were brought home with the help of the Gurkas. Here is the map the embassy put together ahead of the rescue operation: Israel\u2019s weekly confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped below 500 for the first time following a strict eight-week lockdown that is being lifted in stages, reports the Guardian\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent. The health ministry said the total number of confirmed cases stood at about 16,300, with 42 new infections during the past 24 hours. In total, 240 people have died. In recent days, Israel has reported fewer than 50 new cases a day, with recovers vastly overtaking new infections. Hospitals have begun to close coronavirus wards, although they have been kept on standby in anticipation of a possible second wave of infections. Restrictions have also been reduced, with malls, gyms, hairdressers and some school classes reopening this week. Pre-schools are due to open on Sunday, with class-size limits. Russia\u2019s coronavirus cases rise by more than 10,000 for sixth straight day The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia rose by 10,699 over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide tally to 187,859, the coronavirus crisis response centre said on Friday. It also reported 98 new fatalities from COVID-19, bringing the total death toll in Russia to 1,723. German exports see worst month-on-month decline since 1990 reunification Exports in Germany plunged by 11.8% in March, their worst month-on-month fall since the country\u2019s 1990 reunification, statistics authority Destatis said Friday. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus. Up to 190,000 people in Africa could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. The organisation also warned that the virus could \u2018smoulder\u2019 on the continent for years. UN chief warns of \u2018tsunami\u2019 of hate The coronavirus pandemic is unleashing a global tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. The UN chief said anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred. Facebook and Google allow staff to work remotely until end of the year Facebook and Google have both said they will allow workers who are able to work remotely to do so until the end of the year. Facebook said it would reopen its offices on 6 July as coronavirus lockdowns are gradually lifted; Google expects to reopen offices at the start of July. Record daily deaths in Mexico Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,982 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 257 additional fatalities, its most lethal day. The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases to 29,616 and 2,961 deaths. Australia prepares to ease coronavirus restrictions in four-week stages Australia will ease social distancing restrictions in four-week increments, two sources told Reuters, as the country\u2019s national cabinet meets on Friday to decide which curbs to remove first amid dwindling numbers of coronavirus cases White House reportedly blocking release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was abruptly shelved by the White House. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. The Italian province of Bolzano-Alto Adige, located in the northern part of the country, which enjoys a high degree of autonomy in running its affairs, voted overnight to speed up the reopening of activities in phase two of the coronavirus emergency. Shops will reopen on Saturday and hairdressers, bars, restaurants and museums on Monday. Last Monday, Italy, which has endured Europe\u2019s longest lockdown, entered what the government has described as phase two of its coronavirus emergency. Italians are now able to travel within regions to visit relatives, provided they wear masks, but schools, hairdressers, gyms and many other commercial activities will stay closed. Cafes and restaurants will offer takeaways only and all travel between regions will be banned except for work, health or emergency situations. Restrictions on funerals have been relaxed, with a maximum of 15 mourners allowed to attend, but masses and weddings will have to wait. Millions of people were overcome with feelings of anger and disappointment as their hopes were dashed by what many described as a \u201cfalse reopening\u201d. Expectations had been high for a quick return to normality, especially in the south, where there have been fewer Covid-19 cases than in the north. The mood is sombre, not only because the virus, despite its slackening, continues to claim lives, but also because people are on edge after having been forced to stay at home for more than 50 days. According to the latest decree introduced by the central government, bars, hairdressers and restaurants should fully reopen on 1 June; museums and retailers from 18 May. Factories already geared towards exports and public construction projects resumed activity last Monday. Several regions, including Calabria and Sicily, are working on a plan to speed up the reopening before the date set by the central government. In the Italian autonomous province of Bolzano-Alto Adige, the nationwide rules will still apply for the closure of schools and universities and, so far, the ban on sporting events. A little bit more on those German export figures from the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, Philip Oltermann. German exports have suffered the biggest collapse since reunification, as the country is starting to feel the effect of a slowdown in both the Chinese and European economy. In March, German companies exported goods worth \u20ac108.9bn, the country\u2019s statistics office announced today \u2013 an 11.8% decline from February, the most severe drop since records began in 1990. Compared with March 2019, exports were down 7.9% year on year. \u201cGermany\u2019s exports in March were being ground down by two millstones\u201d, said Andreas Scheuerle, an expert for Germany\u2019s saving banks finance group. \u201cGerman exporters did not just feel the weakness of the Chinese market, but also the increasingly strong collapse of the European single market.\u201d Hello, I\u2019m Frances Perraudin, taking over from Alexandra Topping for the rest of the day. You can contact me with comments and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on Twitter @fperraudin. The World Bank has approved $400m in help for Afghanistan to help the war-torn country fight coronavirus. The number of infections continue to surge amid intensified war across the country, while the health minister has also been infected. Henry Kerali, World Bank country director for Afghanistan, said: This assistance will help Afghanistan maintain its reform momentum throughout a difficult period and provide vital financial support to the government to manage revenue shortfalls arising from coronavirus impacts. Yesterday, the government confirmed that Ferozuddin Feroz, the country\u2019s health minister, has been infected to Covid-19. The minister is in stable condition and isolated at home. The ministry has recorded 215 new infections and three of Covid-19 overnight, pushing the total number of infections to 3,778 and death toll to 109. There have so far been 472 recoveries. Afghanistan\u2019s struggle with a shortage of diagnostic testing equipment known as \u201cRNA extraction kits\u201d, which scientists use to isolate the RNA (ribonucleic acid) in samples of the novel coronavirus, has been given a lifeline after it received equipment from the WHO. Heath ministry has so far tested around 15,000 suspected patients. Most of new cases confirmed in western province of Herat, which borders Iran, one of the world\u2019s worst affected countries. 57 new cases confirmed in Herat. Thousands of Afghans have returned home from neighbouring Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The number of new infections slowed down in Kandahar compared with recent days as 17 new cases were reported in the province. Concerns are high in the capital, Kabul, which has so far been the country\u2019s worst affected area as one-third of 500 random coronavirus tests in came back positive, health officials said last week. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, has warned that the threat of the virus is at its \u201chighest level\u201d. Despite a government-authorised lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded, which raises fears of a surge in number of death and infections among experts. Facebook and Google have both said they will allow workers who are able to work remotely to do so until the end of the year. Facebook was among the first tech firms to ask its employees to begin working remotely. It gave employees $1,000 (\u00a3807) bonuses for their work-from-home and childcare costs. In a statement today, a spokesman for the tech firm said: Facebook has taken the next step in its return to work philosophy. Today, we announced anyone who can do their work remotely can choose to do so through the end of the year. As you can imagine this is an evolving situation as employees and their families make important decisions re: return to work. Facebook said it would reopen its offices on 6 July as coronavirus lockdowns are gradually lifted, but is still determining which employees will be asked to come in. The Google chief executive, Sundar Pichai, said employees who need to return to the office will start being able to do so from July with enhanced safety measures in place. Google originally said it would keep its work from home policy until 1 June, but is extending it for a further seven months. The majority of employees who can carry out their jobs from home will be able to do so until the end of the year, Pichai added. An outbreak of coronavirus in the top-security Tehran prison housing most of Iran\u2019s political prisoners has been confirmed by a jailed British-Iranian dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori. Although there have been rumours of an outbreak before, it is the first time the outbreak has been so directly confirmed. Ashoori said inmate Loghman Roozchang showed symptoms of the disease very soon after returning from furlough this week. He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine. But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive. The three brothers Yadollah, Loghman and Anvar are serving sentences of between 20 to 23 years. Early in Iran\u2019s outbreak in April tens of thousands of prisoners were released on furlough, including as many as half of the political or security prisoners, but with the official figures, until this week, showing a decline in new infections, prisoners have started to be instructed to return to jail. The 66-year-old Ashoori was never released, since his conviction was longer than five years, although in practice this rule has been frequently overridden by the authorities. Campaigners for Ashoori\u2019s release say there is no logic to the quarantine in Hall 2 since the 14-day period is widely ignored and newly arrived prisoners are put in alongside those that have been in the hall for a few days. The campaigners say prisoners are also moving between halls so making the quarantine a largely symbolic exercise designed to satisfy the World Health Organization, the UN body that advises national governments on how to defeat the infection. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the best-known of the jailed British-Iranian dual nationals, had been kept in Evin for four years but was released on furlough in April and has spent the time on release at her parent\u2019s home on a tag in Tehran. She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity. Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety. Two are reported dead. Spain will decide on Friday in which regions bars, restaurants and places of worship will open under the next phase of a gradual exit from the coronavirus lockdown, reports Reuters. It looks likely that Madrid and Catalonia will not reopen further, but in a sign of life returning to normal, Barcelona beaches opened for a short window from 6am to 10am on Friday to allow people to swim and jog. People paddled on boards and swam in the water under the supervision of police. Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries globally from the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 26,000 fatalities. The regions of Madrid and Catalonia, home to Barcelona, account for around half of all recorded infections. The government will decide which regions will move to the second phase of its four-stage exit on Friday and the results will be officially published on Saturday. The country is aiming for a return to normality by the end of June. The government has loosened the terms this week, with people allowed to take exercise and small businesses such as hairdressers receiving clients with restrictions to allow social distancing. Under the next stage, bars, restaurants and places of worship will be able to open with limited capacity. In the fourth and final phase, expected around the end of June, beaches will open for sunbathing and restrictions on shops and restaurants will be further loosened. The end to the strict lockdown in France does not mean an end to form-filling. Anyone travelling more than 100km after Monday will need to have an \u201cimperative\u201d professional or personal reason and carry sworn declarations to that effect. To enforce the regulations, extra police and gendarmes will be posted on major roads, motorways, service stations and popular holiday destinations. We now have more details on what those \u201cimperative\u201d reasons might be. Work. If your journey is more than 100km you may \u2013 it\u2019s not clear entirely yet \u2013 need an attestation from your employer stating the journey is necessary. There are obvious exceptions to the 100km rule including transport workers. Family emergency. If you need to travel more than 100km to take urgent care of a child or sick relative. Just visiting a family member is not allowed. People can travel to funerals, but there is a limit on gatherings to 10 people. Moving house. Only if this cannot be postponed and you face being homeless ie, your current lease is ending. Returning home. Foreign nationals have the right to return to their home country. French people who fled the lockdown to second homes can return to their main residence even if it\u2019s over 100km but journeys in the opposite direction will not be allowed. Medical appointments, legal and administrative procedures. The 100km limit is the total length of the journey as the crow flies from your home address but you can travel between departments whatever its colour on the coronavirus map. The government has helpfully put online a tool that allows people to calculate the distance. As well as the declarations and attestations you will need something proving your principal address like an utility bill or rental contract. Much of the UK is on tenterhooks, waiting to see what lockdown measures - if any - will be relaxed on Sunday, when the prime minister Boris Johnson will make an announcement. While the UK government has talked down the extent of any impending changes, this morning the country\u2019s culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the prime minister would set out \u201ctentative\u201d steps leading out of the lockdown. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: We can start to look to the future but we\u2019ll have to do so in a very tentative and cautious way, so people should not expect big changes. If there is any indication that things are starting to get out of control, we won\u2019t hesitate to step back. But people should be able to look forward to the weeks and months ahead to know where we are going and the order in which we are doing it. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, reiterated that any changes made to its lockdown measures \u2013 extended for another three weeks on Thursday \u2013 would be \u201cminor\u201d and \u201cnuanced\u201d in order to keep the \u201cR-rate\u201d of infection below 1. She said: We don\u2019t want to take any chances that it will go above the number 1 again. Everything will stay as it is. We don\u2019t just look at the public health, of course that is the priority, we do have to look at the economic damage that is being done to our country and the societal damage and the wider health issues we have to take into account as well. We will look to see if we can make minor amendments within those three weeks. For all updates on the situation in the UK, please do visit our UK coronavirus live blog South Korean health authorities are investigating a small but growing coronavirus outbreak centred in a handful of Seoul nightclubs, seeking to keep infections in check as the country moves to less restrictive social distancing measures, Reuters reports. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Friday at least 15 people have confirmed cases of the virus linked to the clubs in Itaewon, a neighbourhood popular with Koreans and foreigners in the city. South Korea has reported only a handful of cases in recent days, the majority of them in people arriving from overseas. The nightclub infections, while still limited, are expected to increase, and come at a time when the country has eased some social distancing restrictions. KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said: These venues have all the dangerous conditions that we were the most concerned about. We think it is necessary to strengthen management for such facilities and we urge you to refrain from visiting such facilities as much as possible. You can read my colleague Andrew Roth\u2019s report on Russia becoming Europe\u2019s coronavirus hot spot below. Here\u2019s an excerpt: Russia has the highest growth rate of infections in Europe and as of Thursday has the fifth highest number of cases in the world, surpassing Germany and France. Mikhail Mishustin, the Russian prime minister, and two other cabinet members have fallen ill. Putin\u2019s approval ratings have dropped to their nominal lowest in 20 years, the independent Levada Centre said, and the IMF has forecast that the country\u2019s economy will contract by 5.5% this year. Russia\u2019s official death toll has remained mercifully low for the number of cases, although medics are dying at worrying rates. In discussions with his subordinates, Putin at times has looked deeply bored. As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide. \u201cPutin not only doesn\u2019t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,\u201d said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. \u201cHe cannot adjust \u2026 I think partly Putin\u2019s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.\u201d [...] The Kremlin\u2019s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure. \u201cIt appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,\u201d said Petrov. \u201cThe epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.\u201d One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin\u2019s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable. The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia rose by 10,699 over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide tally to 187,859, the coronavirus crisis response centre said on Friday. It was the sixth consecutive day that cases had risen by more than 10,000, but down on Thursday\u2019s record daily rise of 11,231. It also reported 98 new fatalities from COVID-19, bringing the total death toll in Russia to 1,723. Over in Greece this morning news has broken that a former health minister, and respected heart surgeon, has succumbed to coronavirus, writes Helena Smith in Athens. Dimitris Kremastinos, 78, was admitted to a hospital in Athens two weeks ago where he was described as having waged an intense battle against the virus. Tributes poured in for the British-trained doctor politician, with Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis saying the world of science had lost a respected figure who had worked \u201cwith dignity, responsibility and efficacy.\u201d Kremastinos, an MP until last year, had been health minister under the late socialist leader Andreas Papandreou. As the most high-profile casualty of the virus in Greece his death was announced by the current health minister Vassilis Kikilias. Greece has recorded one of the lowest infection rates in Europe to date, after enforcing draconian lockdown measures early on. A total of 2,678 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded and 148 deaths with health ministry officials saying the country, which hopes to open up to tourists in July, has almost \u201cflattened the curve.\u201d Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO Regional Director for Europe has called for more action from every country that has seen a surge in domestic violence during the coronavirus pandemic, saying \u201cviolence remains preventable, not inevitable\u201d. But if steps are not taken the world could see 31 million cases of gender-based violence, he warned. He said: WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence \u2013 including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response. Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear \u2013 if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported. He added that governments and local authorities should consider it to be a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to make sure services are available, while calling on communities to look out for their friends, family and neighbours and speak out. To victims, he said: Violence against you is never your fault. It is never your fault. Your home should be a secure place. Get in touch -safely- with family, friends, shelters or community groups that have your safety and security at heart.

Moving away from that very sad news now to Germany, where exports plunged by 11.8% in March, their worst month-on-month fall since the country\u2019s 1990 reunification, statistics authority Destatis said Friday. The data illustrated the first monthly impact of the coronavirus epidemic on Europe\u2019s biggest economy. The drop was far steeper than a five percent forecast from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Some \u20ac108.9bn (US$118 billion) of German goods were sold abroad, while the country bought imports worth \u20ac91.6bn - down by 5.1% from the level in February. The bigger plunge in exports than imports reduced Germany\u2019s widely-criticised trade surplus to \u20ac17.4bn, compared with \u20ac22.3bn a year before, Reuters reports. In Germany, late March brought the first shutdowns of much of public life to limit the spread of the coronavirus. But some vital trade partners like Italy and China had already been battling the disease for weeks or months by the time such decisions fell in Berlin and regional capitals. In a geographic breakdown, March brought a bigger fall for exports to Germany\u2019s European Union neighbours, at 11.0% from March 2019, compared with a 4.3%-drop in shipments to the rest of the world. Exports to the eurozone single currency area were particularly hard-hit, falling by 14%. An Indian train killed 14 migrant workers who had fallen asleep on the track on Friday while they were heading back to their home village after losing their jobs in a coronavirus lockdown, police said. Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from India\u2019s big cities after being laid off because of the lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus since late March, Reuters reports. The driver tried to stop the freight train when he saw the workers on the tracks in the western state of Maharashtra, the railway ministry said, adding it had ordered an inquiry. Fourteen people were killed and five were injured, said a railway spokesman, CH Rakesh. \u201cI have just heard the sad news about labourers coming under the train, rescue work is underway,\u201d railway minister Piyush Goyal said on Twitter. Under the lockdown, all public transport has been suspended so migrant workers heading home often have to walk long distances to get there. Police said the labourers worked for a steel company and were walking to their village in the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. \u201cThey had been walking all night, they were exhausted and fell asleep on the tracks,\u201d a police officer said. Because of the lockdown, they were probably not expecting any trains to be moving, an official said. \u201cThe Murdoch media\u2019s China coronavirus conspiracy has one aim: get Trump re-elected,\u201d writes Australia\u2019s former prime minister, Kevin Rudd. This brings us to the Covid-19 pandemic and the public health and economic mayhem it has unleashed across the globe. The sheer magnitude of the damage means that the people of the world have every right to know how this came about. Whether China\u2019s new class of \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats care to recognise it or not, there are fundamental questions we can all legitimately demand answers to. But amid all these questions, and the parallel debate about the mechanism now needed to conduct an effective international inquiry, we suddenly have a unilateral declaration by the US president and his secretary of state that the body of evidence overwhelmingly points to the virus having leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where research projects have been under way into various categories of coronavirus borne by bats. Enter the \u201cglobal exclusive\u201d story of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian Daily Telegraph last weekend, headlined \u201cChina\u2019s batty science \u2013 bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d. Global death toll nears 270,000. The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,846,949 confirmed cases. White House blocks release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was abruptly shelved by the White House, according to Associated Press. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. US unemployment claims hit 33.3m, while the death toll passed 75,000. Trump revives theory that virus originated in a lab. \u201cSomething happened,\u201d Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d the US president added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China has denied the claims. Trump meanwhile tested negative for coronavirus, after his personal valet was confirmed to be infected. The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. Australia outlines three-step plan for easing restrictions. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison outlined the three steps the country will take to achieve a \u201cCovid-safe economy in July of this year\u201d. However, the final decisions on the easing of restrictions remains in the hands of state governments. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus. Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organization (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. The organisation also warned that the virus could \u2018smoulder\u2019 on the continent for years. Record daily deaths in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,982 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 257 additional fatalities, the most lethal day since the pandemic reached the Latin America\u2019s second largest country. Infections in Pakistan have risen by 1,764 over the previous 24 hours, officials said on Friday, taking the total to 25,837. Deaths rose by 30 to 594. Global report: China \u2018open to cooperate\u2019 with WHO on virus origin as Trump repeats lab claim China has said it is \u201calways open to cooperate\u201d with World Health Organisation (WHO) investigations into the origins of the coronavirus, as Donald Trump repeated claims that the outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory. China has denied the claim, for which the US is yet to provide evidence. Late on Thursday Trump insisted that \u201csomething happened\u201d at the Wuhan lab. \u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d he said. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed earlier this week he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab, but has not released any evidence. Pompeo has since walked back his remarks, telling a US radio station on Thursday: \u201cthere\u2019s evidence that it came from somewhere in the vicinity of the lab, but that could be wrong.\u201d Chinese officials and state media have reacted harshly to the claims, accusing Trump, Pompeo, and US officials of blaming China to cover up US failings in its outbreak-response, and seeking to improve Trump\u2019s electoral chances.

Once again a battle-scarred Britain must find a new role in the world As the UK prepares to celebrate VE Day, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson\u2019s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart. Those institutions, in which the UK thrived, are either paralysed, or a battleground. Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny. Sir Simon McDonald, the foreign office senior mandarin, says it is a \u201cwatershed moment for humanity\u201d, and a chance for \u201ca world reset\u201d. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday the coronavirus pandemic keeps unleashing a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering and appealed for an all-out effort to end hate speech globally,\u201d AP reports. The UN chief said anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred. Guterres said migrants and refugees have been vilified as a source of the virus and then denied access to medical treatment. With older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable, he said. And journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs. Guterres called on political leaders to show solidarity with all people, on educational institutions to focus on digital literacy at a time when extremists are seeking to prey on captive and potentially despairing audiences. Coronavirus could \u2018smoulder\u2019 in Africa for several years, WHO warns The Guardian\u2019s Jason Burke and Emmanuel Akinwotu report: The Covid-19 pandemic could \u201csmoulder\u201d in Africa for several years after killing as many as 190,000 people in the coming 12 months, the World Health Organization has said. The WHO warned last month that there could be 10m infections on the continent within six months, though experts said the pandemic\u2019s impact would depend on governments\u2019 actions. A study released by the organisation this week predicts that between 29 million to 44 million people could become infected in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail. This \u201cwould overwhelm the available medical capacity in much of Africa\u201d where there are only nine intensive care unit beds per million people. \u201cWhile Covid-19 likely won\u2019t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots,\u201d said the director of the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa region, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. \u201cCovid-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.\u201d The research looked at 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of one billion. More than 51,000 people in Africa have been infected and 2,012 have died. The total number of cases has risen sharply in the past week. Podcast: Blind Date takeover \u2013 looking for love in lockdown Lockdown has changed the way we date. Is it possible to form the same kind of connection through a screen? To find out, we set up six strangers on three virtual blind dates ... Global death toll nears 270,000. The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,846,949 confirmed cases. US death toll passes 75,000. The US death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 75,000 people, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths in the US are the highest globally at 75,447, a rise of around 2,000 in a day, followed by the UK at 30,689 deaths. Record daily deaths in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,982 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 257 additional fatalities, the most lethal day since the pandemic reached the Latin America\u2019s second largest country. US President Donald Trump continues to push theory that virus originated in a lab, without evidence. \u201cSomething happened,\u201d Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \u201cProbably it was incompetence.

Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out that a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to the US president. US unemployment claims hit 33.3 million. A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from coronavirus continued to mount. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus. Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. France virus deaths fall. France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall on the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March. International tourism to plunge by up to 80%. The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60-80% in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization has said. Russia overtakes Germany and France after record rise in cases. Russia overtook France and Germany for coronavirus cases on Thursday, giving it the fifth-highest total in the world at 177,160. Donald Trump offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said. Thailand reported eight new cases of coronavirus on Friday, and no new deaths. The country has almost 3,000 cases and 55 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Stock markets in Asia have enjoyed a good day so far helped by news of trade talks between US and Chinese trade officials. The Nikkei was up nearly 2% in Tokyo while the FTSE100 is expected to be 0.5% higher in London later. Wall Street looks like rising even further, by around 1.5%. There are concerns that the war of words about the origin of the virus between Washington and Beijing could derail phase one of their trade deal. But investors are betting that things are looking up, despite the prospect of data in the US on Friday that is expected to show the highest unemployment rate for more than 70 years. Remarkably, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index in New York has regained all the losses incurred since the crisis began earlier this year. Read the full story here: India has ramped up output of an anti-malarial drug hailed by US President Donald Trump as a \u201cgame-changer\u201d in the fight against coronavirus, even as its pharmaceutical industry struggles to make other key medicines in a lockdown, AFP reports. Drug companies have seen demand for hydroxychloroquine soar since March when Trump\u2019s remarks sparked a run on the medication and caused a global shortage - despite health agencies warning over its safety in the treatment of Covid-19. India accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the challenges, Indian companies have managed to export the medicine to 97 countries during the pandemic, the health ministry said. To meet the growing demand, Ipca Laboratories, one of four key makers of hydroxychloroquine, is increasing output by a third to 130 million tablets a month in May - despite having only 40% of its 18,000 workers on deck. Zydus Cadila, another major producer, said it would boost production tenfold to about 150 million tablets a month in May. Coronavirus cases in Pakistan surged past 25,000 on Friday, just hours before the government was due to lift lockdown measures, with the country reporting some of the biggest daily increases in new infections in the world, Reuters reports. Officials reported 1,764 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours on Friday, taking the total to 25,837. Deaths rose by 30 to 594. Prime Minister Imran Khan has announced plans to begin lifting Pakistan\u2019s poorly enforced lockdown from Saturday, amid fears for the country\u2019s economy as it sinks into recession. Khan said the easing of restrictions, aimed at helping the country\u2019s most impoverished citizens, would be lifted in phases and warned people that the epidemic could get out of control if they did not take precautions. He added that restrictions could be restored if the outbreak worsens. The government\u2019s handling of the virus has been strongly criticised by scientists and doctors who fear the outbreak will gather pace among a population of around 210 million and overwhelm the country\u2019s struggling health system. After reporting just a handful of Covid-19 cases in late February, Pakistan\u2019s numbers began to surge from mid-March. It has reported an average of just over 1,000 cases and around 27 deaths per day for the past week, according to a Reuters tally based on official data. North Korea condemned the South on Friday for holding military drills, saying the situation was returning to before the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018, as leader Kim Jong Un - whose health was the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks - reached out to traditional ally Beijing, Reuters reports. Kim sent Chinese leader Xi Jinping a diplomatic communication congratulating him for China\u2019s \u201csuccess\u201d in controlling the novel coronavirus epidemic, the state news agency KCNA reported. The nuclear-armed North has closed its borders to try to protect itself from the disease that first emerged in its giant neighbour, and insists it has not had any cases even as the virus has swept across the world. Kim told Xi he was as pleased with China\u2019s successes as his own, KCNA reported, adding he \u201csent militant greetings to every member of the Communist Party of China\u201d. Rumours swirled for weeks about Kim\u2019s health after he failed to appear at the 15 April celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North\u2019s founder \u2013 the most important day in the country\u2019s political calendar \u2013 until he reappeared at the weekend at a factory opening. Kim\u2019s temporary disappearance triggered a series of unconfirmed reports and fevered speculation over his condition, while the United States and South Korea insisted they had no information to believe the conjectures were true. New Zealand on Friday weighed in on the debate around whether Taiwan should be allowed to join the World Health Organisation saying the country has a lot to offer given its success in limiting the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cTaiwan has something to offer at the WHO right at the moment,\u201d Finance Minister Grant Robertson said at a news conference when asked if New Zealand would support Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in WHO as an observer. Robertson was addressing a daily media briefing on the country\u2019s fight against the coronavirus. Taiwan\u2019s exclusion from the UN body, due to objections from China which claims the island as one of its provinces, has infuriated the Taiwanese government which has reported fewer cases of coronavirus than many neighbours due to early detection and prevention work. That press conference with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has now ended. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking now about Australia\u2019s position on the theory repeated by Trump and Mike Pompeo that the virus emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan. As my colleagues Daniel Hurst and Ben Doherty wrote, Scott Morrison has carefully declined to buy into the lab origin theory over the past week, saying he had \u201cnot seen anything that suggests that conclusively\u201d. First of all, in terms of Secretary Pompeo, I want to extend my best wishes to him and his family. He just lost his father, andI know from recent experience how difficult that must be. He\u2019s an extraordinary fellow and I\u2019m sure his father would have been incredibly proud of him. So, all my best to you, Mike. I\u2019ve already made comment on these matters. I think what is important is we find out, and the world doesn\u2019t yet know \u2013 I raised this at the meeting with international colleagues last night. ... It\u2019s not directed at anyone, we just want to know what happened so it doesn\u2019t happen again. It\u2019s a pretty honest question, with an honest intent and an honest motive. Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, says international travel will not be happening in the foreseeable future. Australia\u2019s treasury says that 850,000 jobs will be restored in coming months. Morrison says: Those 850,000 jobs I\u2019m advised by treasury, that includes those who may be on JobSeeker or JobKeeper now. People stood down, going back to full employment. And those, that work is being done based on the steps you can see here today.\u201d Australia\u2019s process for easing restrictions will still ultimately be up to states and territories, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Morrison is taking questions now. On the timing of step one, he says the premiers and chief ministers will announce their own timetables. They\u2019ll be announcing their own timetables for when they\u2019re making those statements. I think you can expect to see some of them later today, making some initial comments and I\u2019d expect to see them making further comments in the days ahead, over the weekend, and early next week. That\u2019s when you can expect them to outline those timetables. There\u2019s some states like Western Australia where step one has ticked the box. They\u2019re very much well advanced on that. South Australia, Northern Territory, quite similarly. But those on the east coast, a very different situation. They all got different starting points. The whole country has the same end point, to get to a COVID safe economy Australia\u2019s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison is speaking now. He is outlining the steps the country will take to achieve a \u201cCovid-safe economy in July of this year\u201d. There are three steps: Step one will \u201cenable greater connection with friends and family\u201d Things that will be allowed include: Gatherings up to 10 people, and five guests in your own home. Children back in classrooms and in playgrounds in their communities. Recreational activities such as golf, lap swimming and boot camps. Retail and small cafes and restaurants reopening. Interstate recreational travel, starting again. An easing of restrictions for funerals. Step two, Morrison says, \u201cwill allow larger size gatherings up to 20 people, including for venues such as cinemas and galleries, more retail openings on sector-based Covid-safe plans, organised community sport, and beauty parlours, and you\u2019ll be pleased to know, barre classes open once again.\u201d Step three, Morrison says, will see gatherings of up to 100 people. But its timing, he says, will depend on the success of the previous steps. \u201cBut most workers, by then, will be back in the workplace. Interstate travel will likely resume. Pubs and clubs with some restrictions will be open. And also possibly gaming venues. As I said, steps three, step three, but also step two, will get greater definition as we move through the success of step one.\u201d Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s South-east Asia correspondent, and Aanya Piyari have this report: Trouble is brewing for the world\u2019s tea producers as the coronavirus lockdown shut down the harvest in several important regions, including the picking of India\u2019s \u201cchampagne of teas\u201d. Despite forecasts of increased demand from drinkers stuck at home across the world, producers have become frustrated by the enforced quarantining of their workforce, with India\u2019s output expected to drop by 9% in 2020. Lockdown measures in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam halted work for more than a month. The global coronavirus outbreak escalated at the worst possible time for Indian tea producers, just as the most valuable harvest of the year was ready to be plucked. India has very specific production periods, experts said, called flushes. The prized first flush of Darjeeling, the \u201cchampagne of teas\u201d harvested in the country\u2019s north-eastern, has been severely hit. This harvest, which is generally picked between March and April, accounts for as much as 40% of annual revenue. Other tea exporting countries, including China, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, have also experienced disruption, though Kenya - the main supplier of tea to the UK - has so far avoided major problems. The International Tea Committee has predicted the country may see output rise by 15% this year. Also Thursday, the government said four unaccompanied Guatemalan minors tested positive for the novel coronavirus after being deported by Mexico this week, AP reports. The cases are the first that the government has acknowledged for deportees arriving from Mexico. The three boys and one girl all teenagers arrived by bus Monday, said Anaeli Torres, director of Special Protection and Non-Residential Attention for Guatemala\u2019s social welfare agency. All four arrived with paperwork from Mexico certifying that they were asymptomatic and Torres said they continue to be asymptomatic. But the government is testing all minors when they arrive before sending them back to their families, she said. Since the cases were identified, the adolescents have been moved to the appropriate health services, Torres said. She also called on Guatemalans living near shelters where deported children are housed to not stigmatise them. Virus fears have led to aggressive rejection of deportees in some communities. They have the right to return to their country and a dignified family reunification,\u201d Torres said. Ten other children who arrived with them from Mexico were still awaiting their test results, according to Torres. A Guatemalan man deported from the United States tested positive for the new coronavirus, the government said Thursday, despite assurances from US authorities that the Guatemalans had been tested and were negative before being flown back to their country, AP reports. The man arrived Monday on a flight carrying 75 Guatemalan migrants, all of whom had paperwork stating they had been tested and were not infected. But an employee of Guatemala\u2019s Health Department speaking on condition of anonymity said the man was one of 10 migrants chosen at random for a test after he returned. He was the only one who came back positive. There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting results, but it appears some of those tests may have been done a week before they were deported. Prior testing had been a condition for Guatemala to accept the resumption of deportation flights, after the Guatemalan government reported at least 100 deportees from the United States tested positive for the virus after arriving in Guatemala in recent weeks. Those cases led the government to twice suspend deportation flights from the US. US senators propose renaming street outside Chinese embassy after Wuhan whistleblower US lawmakers have proposed renaming the street in front of the Chinese embassy in Washington after the late Wuhan doctor punished for warning about the spread of coronavirus, a step sure to outrage Beijing. The measure would rechristen the section of the Washington street in front of the embassy \u201cLi Wenliang Plaza\u201d, instead of the innocuous current name of International Place. Li was one of a group of doctors who shared posts on social media in December warning that a virus was spreading in Wuhan. He was reprimanded by police and made to sign a statement promising not to commit any more \u201claw-breaking actions.\u201d He died from the illness in February, triggering a nationwide outpouring of grief and a rare apology by police for his treatment. \u201cWe\u2019ll ensure the name Li Wenliang is never forgotten \u2013 by placing it permanently outside the embassy of the nation responsible for the deaths Dr Li tried to prevent,\u201d said Tom Cotton, a Republican senator known for his hawkish views on China. Here\u2019s the full story on News Corp\u2019s Rupert Murdoch giving up his bonus, as the global media empire loses US$1bn in the three months to the end of March \u2013 and is expecting more financial pain: A black lawmaker came to Michigan\u2019s capitol with an escort of armed black citizens on Wednesday, days after white protesters with guns staged a volatile protest inside the state house, comparing the Democratic governor\u2019s public health orders to \u201ctyranny\u201d. The state representative Sarah Anthony, 36, said she wanted to highlight what she saw as the failure of the Michigan capitol police to provide legislators with adequate security during the protest, which saw demonstrators with rifles standing in the legislative chamber above lawmakers. \u201cWhen traditional systems, whether it\u2019s law enforcement or whatever, fail us, we also have the ability to take care of ourselves,\u201d she told the Guardian. Anthony became the first African American woman elected to represent her district in Lansing, Michigan\u2019s capital, in 2018. One of Anthony\u2019s constituents, a black firefighter, organized Wednesday\u2019s capitol escort. While early reports focused on three black men with large rifles escorting Anthony, there were six participants, including two women, and some of them were armed with handguns, Lynn said. Five of the participants are black and one is Hispanic. Michael Lynn Jr, a Lansing resident, said he was frustrated to see his legislator being violently intimidated in her workplace. He said the escort was the first time he had ever chosen to openly carry his AR-15 rifle. France\u2019s Safran, the world\u2019s third-largest aerospace supplier, said on Thursday it had laid off 3,000 employees in Mexico as the aerospace industry faces an unprecedented crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Safran\u2019s two plants in Queretaro, an industrial city in the center of the country, are part of a vast network of export-focused factories that have turned Mexico into a key player for global manufacturing supply chains. Those factories have been bleeding jobs in recent months as manufacturers across the globe scale down production amid forecasts of the biggest global recession in many generations. The National Confederation of Industrial Chambers, an influential industry association, estimates about 700,000 Mexican jobs were lost in March and April, and another 650,000 could be lost in May if the reopening of Mexico\u2019s economy does not start until June. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,982 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 257 additional fatalities, the most lethal day since the pandemic reached the Latin America\u2019s second largest country. The new figures bring the total number of confirmed cases to 29,616 and 2,961 deaths. However, the government has said the real number of infections is significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Mexican officials are asking residents to observe social distancing measures ahead of Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday and have closed Mexico City\u2019s main flower market and cemeteries, where people tend to congregate for the holiday. They have even suggested moving the holiday to July. Considered one of Mexico\u2019s most important holidays, Mother\u2019s Day coincides this year with what health officials calculate is the peak week for the spread of the novel coronavirus. China reported one new coronavirus case for 7 May, down from the two cases the day before, data from the national health authority showed on Friday. No new imported cases were recorded on 7 May, the National Health Commission said in a statement. The commission also reported 16 new asymptomatic cases for 7 May, versus six the previous day. China\u2019s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82,886, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,633, the national health authority said. Two piglets for a kayak: Fiji returns to barter system as Covid-19 hits economy Talei Tora reports for the Guardian from Suva: Two piglets for a pre-loved kayak, a taxi fare in exchange for fresh produce, hot cross buns for online tutoring, an old carpet for a professional photography session, vegetable seedlings for homemade pies, and offers to have backyards cleaned for prayers. These are just a few examples of the hundreds of barter trades that are taking place across Fiji since a Facebook page \u201cBarter for Better Fiji\u201d was created a few weeks ago in response to sharp falls in employment due to coronavirus. The page now has more than 100,000 members, in a country of just under 900,000 people. The Pacific region has largely been spared the Covid-19 outbreak. According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, as at the end of April, there had only be recorded cases in six Pacific countries and territories, which between them have reported 260 cases and seven deaths. However, most Pacific nations closed their borders due to coronavirus fears and are feeling the impact of the suspension of international travel. The IMF has forecast a 2.7% decline in growth for the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) with a 40% decline in tourism across the region. Australia will ease social distancing restrictions in four-week increments, two sources told Reuters, as the country\u2019s national cabinet meets on Friday to decide which curbs to remove first amid dwindling numbers of coronavirus cases. Australia in March imposed strict social distancing restrictions, which coupled with the closure of its borders, are credited with drastically slowed the number of new infections of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. With fewer than 20 new infections each day, Australia\u2019s Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday began talks with state and territory leaders to decide which restrictions will be eased. The easing will be staggered to ensure measures do not lead to a resurgence in infections, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters. \u201cThe restrictions will be removed in four-week increments,\u201d one source told Reuters. Confirming the approach, New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the gradual removal of curbs was needed to ensure fresh restrictions did not have to be introduced. Home to nearly a third of Australia\u2019s 25.7 million population, NSW reported just four new cases of Covid-19 on Friday. Australia has had fewer than 7,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and fewer than 800 people are still sick with the disease. Almost 100 people have died from the virus. South African Breweries, one of the world\u2019s largest brewers, says it may have to destroy 400 million bottles of beer as a result of the country\u2019s ban on alcohol sales that is part of its lockdown measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus, AP reports. South Africa stopped all sales of alcohol when its lockdown came into effect on March 27 and the brewery has seen beer pile up at its production facilities. The brewer is seeking special permission from government to move the beer to other storage facilities. The transport of alcohol has also been outlawed in South Africa. SAB told news station eNCA on Thursday that if it\u2019s not able to move the beer, which amounts to about 130 million litres (34 million gallons), it\u2019ll be forced to discard it at a loss of about $8 million. That loss would put 2,000 jobs at risk, SAB said. It would also be frustrating news for millions of thirsty South African beer drinkers who are going without. South Africa is one of just a handful of countries that have prohibited alcohol sales as part of its fight against the coronavirus. India and Thailand also had bans on alcohol sales, but recently lifted their restrictions. Panama and Sri Lanka still have bans in place. The South African government has also banned the sales of cigarettes. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, one of the government\u2019s top health advisers in the Covid-19 pandemic, defended the alcohol ban at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday. He said alcohol is a significant contributing factor to violent crime and road accidents in South Africa and banning its sale has reduced pressure on medical services. Representatives of the alcohol industry say the government should allow alcohol to be purchased for consumption at home only. News Corp Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch will forgo his cash bonus for the current fiscal year due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on business, the company said on Wednesday. Murdoch, who is also the chairman of Fox Corp, last month agreed to forgo his Fox salary through 30 September, in response to the coronavirus crisis. Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson will also forgo 75% of his annual cash bonus, the Wall Street Journal owner added. The collective cuts in bonuses and other cost initiatives will have a positive impact on the company\u2019s profitability and cash position, News Corp said. US President Donald Trump on Thursday said Russian President Vladimir Putin had accepted his offer to provide ventilators to aid in the fight against the novel coronavirus causes a potentially deadly respiratory illness, adding that Russia is having a hard time with the disease, Reuters reports. Trump and Putin spoke by phone on Thursday, where they discussed the coronavirus as well as arms control, according to the White House. In case you missed it, here is the full story on the Trump administration\u2019s decision to bury a document from the US Centers for Disease Control: The Trump administration shelved a document created by the nation\u2019s top disease investigators with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak. The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework, was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. The AP obtained a copy from a second federal official who was not authorised to release it. The guidance was described in AP stories last week, prior to the White House decision to shelve it. The Trump administration has been closely controlling the release of guidance and information during the coronavirus pandemic that scientists are still trying to understand, with the president himself leading freewheeling daily briefings until last week. Traditionally, it\u2019s been the CDC\u2019s role to give the public and local officials guidance and science-based information during public health crises. During this one, however, the CDC has not had a regular, pandemic-related news briefing in nearly two months. Dr Robert Redfield, the CDC director, has been a member of the White House coronavirus task force, but largely absent from public appearances. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, and I\u2019ll be taking you through the latest news from around the world for the next few hours. The White House has reportedly shelved a document created by the nation\u2019s top disease investigators, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile Trump has again claimed the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, but provided no evidence. The Australian government has hit back at the claim, saying that it has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document, but instead a compilation of open-source material \u2013 reports and studies that were publicly available. The identity of the author remains unclear. Here are the most important recent developments: Global death toll passes 265,000. The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,836,215 confirmed cases. US death toll passes 75,000. The US death toll from coronavirus has now surpassed 75,000 people, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths in the US are the highest globally at 75,447, a rise of around 2,000 in a day, followed by the UK at 30,689 deaths. US President Donald Trump continues to push theory that virus originated in a lab, without evidence. \u201cSomething happened,\u201d Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. \u201cProbably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,\u201d the US president added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China has denied the claims. White House reportedly blocking release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was abruptly shelved by the White House, according to AP News. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal. Australia hits back at US claim linking coronavirus to Wuhan lab. The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a \u201cdossier\u201d giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document. Trump tests negative for coronavirus after report valet was infected. Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out that a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to the US president. US unemployment claims hit 33.3 million. A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from coronavirus continued to mount. WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus. Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region. France virus deaths fall. France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall on the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March. International tourism to plunge by up to 80%. The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60-80% in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization has said. Death toll rises by 539 in UK. The UK coronavirus death toll has reached 30,615 after a further 539 people died, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, revealed at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. UK minister warns against abandoning social distancing rules. Raab said that if people \u201cabandon the social distancing rules\u201d the virus \u201cwill grow again at an exponential rate\u201d. Russia overtakes Germany and France after record rise in cases. Russia overtook France and Germany for coronavirus cases on Thursday, giving it the fifth-highest total in the world at 177,160. Donald Trump offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call with Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin said. France to keep borders closed until at least mid-June. France\u2019s borders will remain closed until further notice following the lifting of the coronavirus lockdown on Monday, said the interior minister, Christophe Castaner. He said the restrictions would remain in place until at least 15 June.",

Katie Miller is married to the White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller. On Thursday one of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/trump-valet-coronavirus-positive-us\">personal valets tested positive to the virus</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c018b4f-eddc-4af4-b7d9-215afe06c75a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dBvV-B6gFTU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The president again appeared to reset expectations for the final US death toll, saying he expected 95,000 or more to die. The current toll stands at just over 77,000, with nearly 1.3 million infections, including nearly 29,000 new infections added to the count on Friday.</p> \n<p>The US state department on Friday accused China and Russia of stepping up cooperation to spread false narratives over the coronavirus pandemic, saying Beijing was increasingly adopting techniques honed by Moscow.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven before the Covid-19 crisis we assessed a certain level of coordination between Russia and the PRC in the realm of propaganda,\u201d said Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the state department\u2019s global engagement centre which tracks foreign propaganda.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">20m Americans lost their jobs in April in worst month since Great Depression</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cBut with this pandemic the cooperation has accelerated rapidly,\u201d she told reporters, in a continuing war of words between Washington and Beijing.</p> \n<p>Leaders of the US congressional foreign affairs committees weighed in by writing to nearly 60 countries asking them to support <strong>Taiwan</strong>\u2019s participation in the World Health Organization, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has said coronavirus will \u201cgo away without a vaccine\u201d and is expecting 95,000 or more deaths in the US, as Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary tested positive for coronavirus. The president\u2019s comments, at an event with Republican lawmakers, capped a horror week in the US, in which it was revealed unemployment had risen to 14.7%, up from 3.5% in February, with 20 million people losing their jobs in April. The news that Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller had Covid-19, having recently tested negative, again brought the danger of the virus to the White House inner circle. Katie Miller is married to the White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller. On Thursday one of Trump\u2019s personal valets tested positive to the virus. The president again appeared to reset expectations for the final US death toll, saying he expected 95,000 or more to die. The current toll stands at just over 77,000, with nearly 1.3 million infections, including nearly 29,000 new infections added to the count on Friday. The US state department on Friday accused China and Russia of stepping up cooperation to spread false narratives over the coronavirus pandemic, saying Beijing was increasingly adopting techniques honed by Moscow. \u201cEven before the Covid-19 crisis we assessed a certain level of coordination between Russia and the PRC in the realm of propaganda,\u201d said Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the state department\u2019s global engagement centre which tracks foreign propaganda. \u201cBut with this pandemic the cooperation has accelerated rapidly,\u201d she told reporters, in a continuing war of words between Washington and Beijing. Leaders of the US congressional foreign affairs committees weighed in by writing to nearly 60 countries asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s participation in the World Health Organization, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the coronavirus pandemic. The move is likely to further inflame Sino-US relations as Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, and has been excluded from the WHO, due to objections from China, which considers Taiwan to be part of its territory. Taiwan has been seeking to join a ministerial meeting this month of the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, with backing from Washington and several US allies. Taiwan has argued that its exclusion from the WHO has created a dangerous gap in the global fight against the coronavirus. China reported one new coronavirus case on Saturday and 15 new asymptomatic cases. the country\u2019s total number of infections stood at 82,887, with the death total unchanged at 4,633, the national health authority said. In Italy, the head of the infectious diseases department at the renowned Sacco hospital in Milan, Massimo Galli, said the northern city was \u201ca bit of a bomb\u201d in terms of the virus spreading. \u201cWe have a very high number of infected people returning to circulation,\u201d he told La Repubblica, after photographs of people sitting along Milan\u2019s canals enjoying aperitifs in the sunshine, many without wearing masks or respecting physical distancing rules, were splashed over the front pages of the country\u2019s newspapers. Milan\u2019s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, said the behaviour was \u201cshameful\u201d and threatened to close the well-known aperitif area if people persisted in flouting the rules. Almost 40% of Italy\u2019s infections are in the Lombardy region, of which Milan is the capital. On Friday, Italy became the first country in the European Union to pass 30,000 deaths from the virus. Britain, which left the EU in January, passed that milestone on Wednesday, and deaths on Friday stood at more than 31,300. Travellers into the UK will be quarantined for two weeks when they arrive as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, Boris Johnson is expected to say on Sunday when he lays out his roadmap out of the lockdown. He will announce the introduction of quarantine measures for people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar train stations, including for Britons returning from abroad. People will be asked to provide the address at which they will self-isolate for two weeks on arrival by filling out a digital form, according to a report in the Times newspaper. Russia on Friday registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row, after emerging as a new hotspot of the pandemic. The total number of infections stood at nearly 188,000. The country also recorded 98 new deaths from the virus, for a total of 1,723, and while some officials were considering softening the current lockdown, the WHO warned Russia was going through a \u201cdelayed epidemic.\u201d WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in a virtual briefing must \u201clearn some of the lessons\u201d which came at great cost in other parts of the world. In other coronavirus news: Global infections stood at 3,937,813, with 276,863 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, has died after contracting Covid-19, according to US media reports. He died in Las Vegas on Friday, aged 75. The US issued a new rule on Friday tightening visa guidelines for Chinese journalists, saying it was in response to the treatment of US journalists in China. Mexico\u2019s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that he aimed to present plans next week to reopen the economy, as key sectors like car-making look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures. Argentina will extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires but relax restrictions in the rest of the country. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 May 2020 to remove an image taken in Milan with a telephoto lens that may have distorted the actual physical distance between people pictured.",

      "body": "<p>It was a grim irony that the best transport news in ages was buried in the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. On 26 March, the government published a document, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/878642/decarbonising-transport-setting-the-challenge.pdf\">Decarbonising Transport</a>, which went further in facing up to the problem of emissions from air and vehicle traffic than most campaigners had dared to hope for.</p> <p>The challenge is enormous. In 2016, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/20/the-guardian-view-on-transport-emissions-the-trouble-with-planes-and-automobiles\">transport overtook energy</a> to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions. Motor vehicles on their own are responsible for around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/16/uk-road-transport-emissions-up-since-1990-despite-efficiency-drive\">a fifth</a> of the total. On aviation, the UK is the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tourismdashboard.org/explore-the-data/carbon-emissions/\">third-worst polluter</a>, behind China and the US.</p> <p>But here was the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52064509\">declaring that</a> \u201cpublic transport and active travel will be the natural first choice\u201d, adding \u201cwe will use our cars less\u201d for anyone who missed the point. Transport was to be a centrepiece of the UK\u2019s preparations for the postponed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus\">Cop26 climate talks</a>. Finally, it appeared we were on the way to grasping the nettle of our polluting driving and flying habits.</p> <p>Six weeks on, we are in a different world. Travel of all sorts has collapsed: there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/19/air-traffic-before-after-europe-coronavirus-lockdowns-video\">90% fewer flights</a> from European airports in April compared with a year ago. In the UK there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/rail-journeys-at-5-of-normal-levels-as-uk-stays-home-due-to-coronavirus\">just 5%</a> of the normal number of rail journeys, while road traffic has fallen to levels <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/03/uk-road-travel-falls-to-1955-levels-as-covid-19-lockdown-takes-hold-coronavirus-traffic\">last seen in 1955</a>. In the short-term, this means steep drops in emissions: one estimate says the UK\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-carbon-emissions-fall-by-more-than-a-third-in-lockdown-11983721\">have fallen by 36%</a>. But already experts are warning that unless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">strong action is taken</a>, any temporary benefits could be quickly erased. </p> <p>Probably the biggest risk is that governments will take their eye off the climate emergency, bailing out airlines and car manufacturers as they have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions\">bailed out oil companies</a>. But while some observers have pointed to the collapse in vehicle sales as the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200429-are-we-witnessing-the-death-of-the-car\">end for petrol and diesel</a>, other voices warn of the even greater risk to public transport due to worries over being able to maintain social distancing. Last month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan\u2019s leaders declared</a> their determination to avoid a surge in car use, even if residents were reluctant to return to trains, trams and buses. \u201cIf everybody drives, there is no space for people, there is no space to move,\u201d said the city\u2019s deputy mayor Marco Granelli.</p> <p>Milan\u2019s authorities are among the leaders of a group of mayors working together worldwide on plans for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/city-leaders-aim-to-shape-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis\">green recovery</a>. At the heart of schemes announced so far is a radical reorientation of street space in favour of walking and cycling \u2013 a goal that is made all the more urgent given the tentative links being made by researchers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/is-air-pollution-making-the-coronavirus-pandemic-even-more-deadly\">between air pollution and coronavirus</a>. Milan has announced that 35km (22 miles) of road will be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor is spending \u20ac300m (\u00a3262m) on a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/04/22/paris-to-create-650-kilometers-of-pop-up-corona-cycleways-for-post-lockdown-travel/#7c382e3354d4\">new cycle network</a>. New York, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and Barcelona are among other cities with schemes ranging from new car-free days to the temporary reclassification of streets as recreation areas.</p> <p>So what of the UK? While it is only fair to point out that the country has been a leader on decarbonisation (after doing so much to carbonise the planet in the first place), when it comes to transport we are a laggard. For a mixture of reasons (powerful oil companies; successful car manufacturers; an unhealthy identification, nourished by popular culture, with the car-mad US), we have been painfully slow to take even obvious steps. Hence our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/01/air-pollution-falling-london-millions-still-exposed\">illegally dirty air</a>, astronomical rail fares and irrational hostility to cyclists \u2013 who are routinely pilloried for the kinds of selfish, careless behaviour that goes unremarked when the culprits are drivers.</p> <p>All is not lost, as March\u2019s draft decarbonisation document showed. This week Boris Johnson \u2013 who, when he was London mayor, shrank the capital\u2019s congestion zone \u2013 suggested that a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/prime-minister-boris-johnson-says-this-should-be-a-new-golden-age-for-cycling-455473\">golden age of cycling</a>\u201d could be about to dawn. Having started slowly, British cities are putting in place pandemic measures such as <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-06/london-s-mayor-turns-to-cycling-to-solve-transit-s-virus-problem\">temporary cycle lanes</a> in London, and a <a href=\"https://www.stockport.gov.uk/news/council-helps-to-launch-safestreetssavelives-campaign-to-support-social\">Safe Streets Save Lives</a> scheme in Greater Manchester.

      "bodyText": "It was a grim irony that the best transport news in ages was buried in the first few days of the coronavirus lockdown. On 26 March, the government published a document, Decarbonising Transport, which went further in facing up to the problem of emissions from air and vehicle traffic than most campaigners had dared to hope for. The challenge is enormous. In 2016, transport overtook energy to become the single biggest source of domestic emissions. Motor vehicles on their own are responsible for around a fifth of the total. On aviation, the UK is the world\u2019s third-worst polluter, behind China and the US. But here was the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, declaring that \u201cpublic transport and active travel will be the natural first choice\u201d, adding \u201cwe will use our cars less\u201d for anyone who missed the point. Transport was to be a centrepiece of the UK\u2019s preparations for the postponed Cop26 climate talks. Finally, it appeared we were on the way to grasping the nettle of our polluting driving and flying habits. Six weeks on, we are in a different world. Travel of all sorts has collapsed: there were 90% fewer flights from European airports in April compared with a year ago. In the UK there are just 5% of the normal number of rail journeys, while road traffic has fallen to levels last seen in 1955. In the short-term, this means steep drops in emissions: one estimate says the UK\u2019s have fallen by 36%. But already experts are warning that unless strong action is taken, any temporary benefits could be quickly erased. Probably the biggest risk is that governments will take their eye off the climate emergency, bailing out airlines and car manufacturers as they have already bailed out oil companies. But while some observers have pointed to the collapse in vehicle sales as the beginning of the end for petrol and diesel, other voices warn of the even greater risk to public transport due to worries over being able to maintain social distancing. Last month Milan\u2019s leaders declared their determination to avoid a surge in car use, even if residents were reluctant to return to trains, trams and buses. \u201cIf everybody drives, there is no space for people, there is no space to move,\u201d said the city\u2019s deputy mayor Marco Granelli. Milan\u2019s authorities are among the leaders of a group of mayors working together worldwide on plans for a green recovery. At the heart of schemes announced so far is a radical reorientation of street space in favour of walking and cycling \u2013 a goal that is made all the more urgent given the tentative links being made by researchers between air pollution and coronavirus. Milan has announced that 35km (22 miles) of road will be transformed over the summer. In Paris, the mayor is spending \u20ac300m (\u00a3262m) on a new cycle network. New York, Mexico City, Bogot\u00e1 and Barcelona are among other cities with schemes ranging from new car-free days to the temporary reclassification of streets as recreation areas. So what of the UK? While it is only fair to point out that the country has been a leader on decarbonisation (after doing so much to carbonise the planet in the first place), when it comes to transport we are a laggard. For a mixture of reasons (powerful oil companies; successful car manufacturers; an unhealthy identification, nourished by popular culture, with the car-mad US), we have been painfully slow to take even obvious steps. Hence our illegally dirty air, astronomical rail fares and irrational hostility to cyclists \u2013 who are routinely pilloried for the kinds of selfish, careless behaviour that goes unremarked when the culprits are drivers. All is not lost, as March\u2019s draft decarbonisation document showed. This week Boris Johnson \u2013 who, when he was London mayor, shrank the capital\u2019s congestion zone \u2013 suggested that a \u201cgolden age of cycling\u201d could be about to dawn. Having started slowly, British cities are putting in place pandemic measures such as temporary cycle lanes in London, and a Safe Streets Save Lives scheme in Greater Manchester. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government, has told ministers that green policies such as an accelerated transition to electric vehicles would be the strongest basis for an economic recovery. The UK\u2019s chronic overcentralisation remains a brake on progress. Properly accountable and resourced regional government is needed to engineer, both politically and practically, the modal shifts that are needed. But politics is not all top down, and the shift in behaviour during the lockdown, as millions of people have spent far more time on two wheels or feet, is also important.

      "bodyText": "On Monday the Republican governor of Nebraska, Pete Ricketts, a close ally of Donald Trump and frequent visitor to the White House, opened his daily coronavirus briefing with a big announcement. \u201cToday is May 4,\u201d he said, \u201cthe first day of loosened restrictions statewide.\u201d With his declaration, Ricketts placed Nebraska at the vanguard of America\u2019s reopening. Churches can now open their doors to worshippers, wedding bells and funeral dirges will be heard once more, hospitals can reschedule elective surgeries, and most Nebraskans will be able to resumehaving their hair cut, nails manicured, bodies massaged and skin tattooed. Restaurants are once again serving diners, though at half capacity. Nebraska Crossing has become one of the first malls in North America to welcome back shoppers. It\u2019s a happy day in sunny Nebraska. But the statistics paint a very different picture. In the last seven days, the state recorded a 57% leap in the daily number of new cases, to a total of 7,190. The death rate too is rising sharply, standing at 90. Measured in Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population, Nebraska is wrestling with the worst outbreak of the disease outside the early hotspots of New York and the north-east, Louisiana and Illinois, all of which are now seeing the pandemic declining. Nebraska\u2019s lack of preparedness for the challenges involved in reopening is even more alarming. According to the Covid Exit Strategy, a group of public health and crisis experts with White House and US government experience, Nebraska is 49th out of 50 states in terms of its readiness for rebooting its economy. It tests about a third the rate per capita of New York. By the time it started opening up this week, Nebraska has tested about 19 people per thousand of its population. Compare that with another jurisdiction with a similarly small population: Iceland. That country has managed to contain the virus, largely by testing 151 per thousand, eight times as many. \u201cOpening up prematurely, which is going on in most states in the US right now, is only going to make matters worse,\u201d said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. \u201cIt will inevitably lead to more cases of infection, then intensive care patients, then deaths. Most of the lives we\u2019ve lost so far have been unnecessary, so why do we want to add to that toll?\u201d Nebraska is not an aberration within the US \u2013 at least 42 states have begun easing restrictions. Many of those states are, like Nebraska, far from having the disease under control and insufficiently prepared to meet the challenges ahead. Nor is Nebraska\u2019s decision to reopen random or coincidental. It is the direct consequence of policy from the White House. It is the product of Donald Trump\u2019s latest \u2013 and arguably most breathtaking \u2013 gamble. He is rolling the dice not only on his own political life ahead of November\u2019s election, but also on the lives of tens of thousands of Americans. A day after Governor Ricketts heralded Nebraska\u2019s reopening, Trump praised those states moving quickly to get the economy back up even while the virus rages on. The president decided not to wear a mask while touring a Honeywell factory in Arizona that makes the very masks that he declined. In the background, the factory\u2019s sound system blasted Live and Let Die. Trump has been criticized for displaying a failure of empathy in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but even by his own standards his remarks at Honeywell were cold-blooded. \u201cWe have to get our country open, we can\u2019t keep our country closed,\u201d he said. Asked whether reopening the economy too soon could have a cost, he replied with a euphemism for death. \u201cWill some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d he said. For the army of epidemiologists, health crisis experts, biostatisticians and other scientists who have hands-on experience of combatting global disease, Trump\u2019s insistence on pressing ahead with reopening America while the virus is still ascendant is tantamount to waving the white flag. \u201cYou don\u2019t stop fighting a war in the middle, just because it\u2019s gotten expensive or burdensome. And you can\u2019t ask a virus for a truce,\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, a key player in the US response to Ebola in 2014, wrote on Twitter. Trump, he added, was \u201csurrendering to the virus rather than fighting it\u201d.

      "body": "<h2>The rolling succession of a stream in Wales</h2> <p>It is a place I\u2019d discovered before the virus: a left-hand bend in a narrow stream, a couple of steps off the footpath. There is nothing remarkable there, or not at first glance. There are breeze blocks in the stream bed and plastic bags deeply embedded in the roots of an alder tree. With a few variations, it could be anywhere in Britain: the neglected corner of a city park, the back of a private garden, behind a national park cafe. It\u2019s just one of those spots that no one ever thinks to stop at and, if not for Covid-19, I would not have begun visiting daily, pausing for a few breaths before continuing. I saw the first snowdrops appear there, followed by primroses; then they were swamped by wild garlic and wood anemone. One morning a weasel shot out of a hole under a root and sprinted up the opposite bank. It was the first of several surprises.</p> <p>I have never experienced a spring like this one: the first season in 38 years that I\u2019ve stopped travelling and stayed, more or less, in one place. This spring, I realise, is the first to unfold before me in its entirety. And the world, having noticed that I\u2019ve given up travelling, has started to travel past me. It is, I reckon, a kind of exploration, the kind done at the extreme outer limits of slow travel.</p> <p>It was when the <a href=\"https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/wildlife-explorer/wildflowers/wood-anemone\">wood anemones </a>appeared that I first checked the identity of the plant. I was fairly sure, but not entirely. Wildflowers are like bird songs to me: I identify them, then faster than they can fade away, I forget. This year I am determined to halt this habit. I downloaded the <a href=\"https://www.picturethisai.com/\">Picture This</a> app and have never looked back. Simply take a picture of the flower with the app and wait for the identification.</p> <p>The primroses and wood anemones are still flowering as I write, but others have stepped forward and taken the limelight. Wild garlic grabbed me by the nose, then came celandine, jack-in-the hedge, red campion, violet and speedwell. The gentle succession is what has astonished me: how one morning, quite abruptly, a new species seems to have completely taken over, only to be superseded within days by another. This morning cow parsley came flouncing on to the stage and shouted down the stitchwort. And away in the wings, in the shadows, there are cameo appearances going on that I would have missed in previous years: the satin purple of vetches and early orchids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38d6be6fcbd8557c00edde856670bfbf0ce7bdce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38d6be6fcbd8557c00edde856670bfbf0ce7bdce/0_103_3772_2265/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sparrowhawk is the bird of prey you\u2019re most likely to spot in your garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sparrowhawk is the bird of prey you\u2019re most likely to spot in your garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Markus Varesvuo/Getty Images/Nature Picture Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I am not the only one to be experiencing this unexpected lockdown bonus: watching the world on its journey past my eyes, a world refreshed and reoxygenated by a reduced human presence.

One unexpected benefit of confining wildlife enthusiasts to their homes, he reckons, is going to be a massive upsurge in useful data.</p> <p>Will Scott, an ecology student at Lincoln, has also found new insights through simply revisiting local walks. \u201cI\u2019m noticing changes in bird numbers that I\u2019d never have seen without the lockdown.\u201d One highlight was a night recording of a bittern over his house.</p> <p>For me, it\u2019s the sheer joy of observing the rolling succession of life: as each day goes by, something new will happen. Choose your spot. Take notes. Download the apps and get the guides. And the changes are occurring inside you too. One morning a shadow swept across the grass under me and I glanced up to see a sparrowhawk. Afterwards I realised I had looked immediately towards the right spot: some deep instinctive calculation of solar angles had occurred that I know, for sure, would not have happened a year ago. This is what <a href=\"https://www.naturalnavigator.com/tristan-gooley/\">Tristram Gooley</a>, author of Natural Navigator, has been writing about for years and now, at long last, I finally get it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60ee760ead4f50218784840ecdcad99d2e0ca48a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60ee760ead4f50218784840ecdcad99d2e0ca48a/0_147_5427_3255/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kevin saw a lamprey in the stream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin saw a lamprey in his stream.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Age Fotostock/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The best moment came in mid-April. Passing that familiar bend in the stream, I saw that the roots of the alder, the lines in the water, were red. Were they always red? Had I just noticed? Then a movement caught my eye on a tiny bed of shingle over which a few inches of water was rippling. It looked like an eel, but peering closely I saw seven tiny dots along the head rather than gills. This was a lamprey.

They were spawning. Next day they were at it again. The following day they were gone and I\u2019ve not seen them since.

My latest book is Nan Shepherd\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/20/living-mountain-nan-shepherd-review\">The Living Mountain</a> \u2013 the Scottish writer\u2019s legendary geo-poetic epic and love letter to the Cairngorm mountains where, over the course of her life, she spent hundreds of days hiking.</p> <p>On the first page, Nan sets out to \u201cknow the essential nature\u201d of the mountain, acknowledging: \u201cThis is not done easily nor in an hour. It is a tale too slow for the impatience of our age, not of immediate enough import for its desperate problems.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a remarkable sentence, particularly given that Nan was writing of the \u201cimpatience\u201d of the late 1940s, half a century before smartphones or social media declared war on the public attention span. How rare a thing it is in the era of fast travel for someone to truly know any patch of land, anywhere in the world, in the way that Nan Shepherd knew her Cairngorms.</p> <p>The Living Mountain is a book that teaches patience in a landscape. Acutely detailed but never exclusionary or gatekeeping, Nan describes the changing of the seasons in humble, unpretentious fashion. She uses her curiosity as a vehicle to investigate both the mountain and her own position within it. \u201cThat it was a traffic of love is sufficiently clear,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut love pursued with fervour is one of the roads to knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Many of us might walk in local nature spots regularly but dismiss, or not even consider, their beauty, having seen far greener grass or grander mountains elsewhere. Now that we are being forced to re-explore these spots by the restrictions of our coronavirus lockdown, it\u2019s the perfect time to find these \u201cdoorstep adventures\u201d, to rediscover the local.</p> <p>So it is with this eye that I have taken to my daily walks in the local park, however modest they may be compared with a hike in the Cairngorms. I have realised that, like many, I know little of the birds that call there, or of the specifics of its trees or plants. But I have become a budding birdwatcher and can now separate the calls of bullfinch and chaffinch. Inspired by Nan\u2019s message that \u201ceach of the senses is a way in to what the mountain has to give\u201d, I have begun noticing scents around the park, and touching the fallen petals of the cherry blossom. I\u2019m finding a new peace, free from the anxiety of the daily news cycle.</p> <p>Nan writes that there \u201cis no getting accustomed\u201d to her mountains. Let\u2019s face it, there <em>is</em> getting accustomed to a local park, but there has never been a better time to become reacquainted with a park, a garden, a river or whatever you have on your doorstep. The Living Mountain is testament to the value in knowing what bird\u2019s call is waking you up in the morning or what flowers and trees are endemic to your area. That value comes in the form of connectivity, and at a time of such national anxiety and widespread isolation, the value of that connectivity should not be underestimated.</p> <p>In the conclusion to The Living Mountain, Nan notes that she has begun to \u201cdiscover the mountain in itself.\u201d She writes: \u201cThis process has taken many years and is not yet complete\u2026 The thing to be known grows with the knowing.\u201d I\u2019m trying to use my daily walks to know even a little more about the nature around me.<br>\u2022 <em>The Living Mountain (Canongate Books, \u00a39.99) is available at <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-living-mountain-9780857861832.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a> for \u00a38.89 excluding p&amp;p </em><br><strong>Stuart Kenny</strong></p> <h2>Skylarks and speedwell on the South Downs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47c05aee895c05af220f7f508a8180722c83bd7f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47c05aee895c05af220f7f508a8180722c83bd7f/0_0_4896_3672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dixe Wills on the South Downs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dixe Wills on the South Downs</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lying in the sun beside a river, bored to tears, academic and amateur poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/20/birds-in-a-cage-derek-niemann-review\">John Buxton</a> noticed a family of redstarts flying through a wood. The moment sparked an epiphany: henceforth he would devote himself to the study of this colourful migrant songbird and write up his findings. There may seem little remarkable about this but for one thing: Buxton had been captured while serving with the commandos in Norway and was now a prisoner of war.</p> <p>Undeterred by his lack of binoculars, ornithological books and even paper (he wrote many of his observations on cigarette packets), Buxton threw himself into the task. During stints at two camps in Bavaria, he and fellow prisoners would spend countless hours watching the birds, their vigils interrupted only by meals and interminable roll calls.</p> <p>The result was Buxton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Redstart-New-Naturalist-Monograph/dp/B0000CHLOR\">The Redstart</a>, published in 1950 and widely recognised as not only a classic work of nature writing but the definitive book on the subject. Perhaps just as importantly, the author\u2019s intense connection with <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/wildlife-guides/bird-a-z/redstart/\">redstarts</a> had offered him a means of escape both mentally and spiritually during his long years ofconfinement. \u201cOne of the chief joys of watching them in prison,\u201d he wrote of the birds, \u201cwas that they inhabited another world than I.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b1c148ff8d623363ce9323bf9ff23ccdbbd1063\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b1c148ff8d623363ce9323bf9ff23ccdbbd1063/0_0_4896_3672/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wildflowers on the South Downs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wildflowers on the South Downs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While today\u2019s lockdown can hardly be compared to the privations of wartime prison camp life, the notion that we too can escape through close observation of the natural world in our vicinity still holds true.<br><br>Having moved last year from the inner city to the South Downs national park, I\u2019m keenly aware of how fortunate I am to be able to cycle from my home up on to green hills in a matter of minutes. I pack a flask of tea for me and a little hip-flask of sugar-water in case I come across an exhausted bee (in my experience there\u2019s no human interaction with the insect world quite so satisfying as nursing an ailing bee) and climb the thigh-testing slopes. My goal is a spot beside a bridleway crossing a tract of exposed and wind-scoured arable land.<br><br>In fine weather, my chosen patch provides views across an undulating ridge to gleaming chalk cliffs and a hazy sea beyond. But I\u2019m more intent on looking down, for the subjects of my survey (one very much humbler than Buxton\u2019s) are below me: the wildflowers in a wide field margin. With just a handful of species \u2013 plantains, red campion, vetch and ox-eye daisies predominate \u2013 this highly regulated concession to nature has little of the romantic chaos of a meadow. However, I\u2019ve found great pleasure noting down the doings of individual plants week by week.</p> <p>While one prospers and blooms, another\u2019s withered leaves cry up to the skies to end April\u2019s unfamiliar drought, and a third defies the odds with its dogged colonisation of soil as hard as stone. And then last week came an unexpected delight: a cheeky unauthorised sprig of speedwell carving out a space below sheltering brambles.</p> <p>There may be no redstarts up here, but my inspections of this small swath of downland are accompanied by the almost constant trilling of skylarks. Numbers of this bird have declined alarmingly in Britain, and their spiralling song seems charged with a reckless hopefulness I can\u2019t help but admire.<br><strong>Dixe Wills</strong></p>",

The Living Mountain is a book that teaches patience in a landscape. Acutely detailed but never exclusionary or gatekeeping, Nan describes the changing of the seasons in humble, unpretentious fashion. She uses her curiosity as a vehicle to investigate both the mountain and her own position within it. \u201cThat it was a traffic of love is sufficiently clear,\u201d she writes, \u201cbut love pursued with fervour is one of the roads to knowledge.\u201d Many of us might walk in local nature spots regularly but dismiss, or not even consider, their beauty, having seen far greener grass or grander mountains elsewhere. Now that we are being forced to re-explore these spots by the restrictions of our coronavirus lockdown, it\u2019s the perfect time to find these \u201cdoorstep adventures\u201d, to rediscover the local. So it is with this eye that I have taken to my daily walks in the local park, however modest they may be compared with a hike in the Cairngorms. I have realised that, like many, I know little of the birds that call there, or of the specifics of its trees or plants. But I have become a budding birdwatcher and can now separate the calls of bullfinch and chaffinch. Inspired by Nan\u2019s message that \u201ceach of the senses is a way in to what the mountain has to give\u201d, I have begun noticing scents around the park, and touching the fallen petals of the cherry blossom. I\u2019m finding a new peace, free from the anxiety of the daily news cycle. Nan writes that there \u201cis no getting accustomed\u201d to her mountains. Let\u2019s face it, there is getting accustomed to a local park, but there has never been a better time to become reacquainted with a park, a garden, a river or whatever you have on your doorstep. The Living Mountain is testament to the value in knowing what bird\u2019s call is waking you up in the morning or what flowers and trees are endemic to your area. That value comes in the form of connectivity, and at a time of such national anxiety and widespread isolation, the value of that connectivity should not be underestimated. In the conclusion to The Living Mountain, Nan notes that she has begun to \u201cdiscover the mountain in itself.\u201d She writes: \u201cThis process has taken many years and is not yet complete\u2026 The thing to be known grows with the knowing.\u201d I\u2019m trying to use my daily walks to know even a little more about the nature around me. \u2022 The Living Mountain (Canongate Books, \u00a39.99) is available at Guardian Bookshop for \u00a38.89 excluding p&amp;p Stuart Kenny Skylarks and speedwell on the South Downs Lying in the sun beside a river, bored to tears, academic and amateur poet John Buxton noticed a family of redstarts flying through a wood. The moment sparked an epiphany: henceforth he would devote himself to the study of this colourful migrant songbird and write up his findings. There may seem little remarkable about this but for one thing: Buxton had been captured while serving with the commandos in Norway and was now a prisoner of war. Undeterred by his lack of binoculars, ornithological books and even paper (he wrote many of his observations on cigarette packets), Buxton threw himself into the task. During stints at two camps in Bavaria, he and fellow prisoners would spend countless hours watching the birds, their vigils interrupted only by meals and interminable roll calls. The result was Buxton\u2019s The Redstart, published in 1950 and widely recognised as not only a classic work of nature writing but the definitive book on the subject. Perhaps just as importantly, the author\u2019s intense connection with redstarts had offered him a means of escape both mentally and spiritually during his long years ofconfinement. \u201cOne of the chief joys of watching them in prison,\u201d he wrote of the birds, \u201cwas that they inhabited another world than I.\u201d While today\u2019s lockdown can hardly be compared to the privations of wartime prison camp life, the notion that we too can escape through close observation of the natural world in our vicinity still holds true. Having moved last year from the inner city to the South Downs national park, I\u2019m keenly aware of how fortunate I am to be able to cycle from my home up on to green hills in a matter of minutes. I pack a flask of tea for me and a little hip-flask of sugar-water in case I come across an exhausted bee (in my experience there\u2019s no human interaction with the insect world quite so satisfying as nursing an ailing bee) and climb the thigh-testing slopes. My goal is a spot beside a bridleway crossing a tract of exposed and wind-scoured arable land. In fine weather, my chosen patch provides views across an undulating ridge to gleaming chalk cliffs and a hazy sea beyond. But I\u2019m more intent on looking down, for the subjects of my survey (one very much humbler than Buxton\u2019s) are below me: the wildflowers in a wide field margin. With just a handful of species \u2013 plantains, red campion, vetch and ox-eye daisies predominate \u2013 this highly regulated concession to nature has little of the romantic chaos of a meadow. However, I\u2019ve found great pleasure noting down the doings of individual plants week by week. While one prospers and blooms, another\u2019s withered leaves cry up to the skies to end April\u2019s unfamiliar drought, and a third defies the odds with its dogged colonisation of soil as hard as stone. And then last week came an unexpected delight: a cheeky unauthorised sprig of speedwell carving out a space below sheltering brambles. There may be no redstarts up here, but my inspections of this small swath of downland are accompanied by the almost constant trilling of skylarks. Numbers of this bird have declined alarmingly in Britain, and their spiralling song seems charged with a reckless hopefulness I can\u2019t help but admire. Dixe Wills",

      "body": "<p>Almost one in five UK mortgage holders have now been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/lenders-in-uk-grant-12m-mortgage-deferments\" title=\"\">granted a payment holiday</a>, it was estimated this week \u2013 but people\u2019s experiences of the process have been very different. Some struggled to get a holiday while others say it was almost too easy. And while for some it will add just a few pounds to their monthly mortgage bill, others say their outlay will rise by a lot more.</p> <p>The Guardian asked readers who had applied for a mortgage payment holiday, or help with other debts, how they got on. Almost 200 people contacted us to tell us their stories.</p> <p>Here we look at their main concerns and provide essential need-to-know information and expert advice for anyone considering a mortgage holiday.</p> <h2><strong>For most, a mortgage holiday will mean higher repayments</strong></h2> <p>The increases people face vary hugely. One reader, a Londoner who is currently out of work because of a brain tumour, said he called his bank to explain he was struggling, and that the tenant in his buy-to-let flat had stopped paying rent, and was instantly told he could take a three-month mortgage holiday.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cI was shocked to be told that the \u2018holiday\u2019 is no such thing \u2013 merely a pause, after which my payments would increase by nearly \u00a3200 per month \u2026 When I pointed out that a true holiday would be to extend the life of the mortgage by three months and not increase payments, I got a very frosty response.\u201d</p> <p>David Porter, who works in IT and also lives in London, also deferred his mortgage payments for three months. His home loan has 14 years left to run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/04/ask-the-experts-split-mortgage\">How can we 'do the splits' on our mortgage?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> \u201cThe payment break will add about \u00a320 a month to my mortgage, which seems manageable, but of course this will all add up over the course of the mortgage lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all is well income-wise, I intend to overpay over the next year or two.\u201d</p> <p>Lee Young, 49, who lives in Nottingham and has been furloughed, has a 28-year mortgage with 15 years left to run. The current balance is roughly \u00a360,000 and his current monthly payment is about \u00a3350. It will rise by about \u00a35 a month.</p> <p>Perhaps worryingly, quite a few of those who contacted us appeared to have little or no idea how much extra they will have to fork out. Several told us that when they called to ask about a break, their lender had given them no information about how much the new payments would be.</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> \u201cPayment holiday is a misleading description for what is actually a payment deferment,\u201d says Mark Harris at the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients.</p> <p>The standard position at most lenders appears to be that you pay more each month in the future, while the term stays the same.</p> <p>Typically, lenders are spreading people\u2019s deferred payments over the outstanding term of their mortgage. On top of this, during the holiday, the lender continues to charge interest and adds this to the amount you owe, which increases the balance it charges interest on.</p> <p>As a result your payments will be a bit higher when the holiday ends and there will be a (slightly) bigger total amount to repay.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance indicates the default should be a three-month holiday, though it says firms can offer a shorter period in certain situations.</p> <p>Because the missed payments are being spread over the rest of the mortgage, the shorter the term left on your loan, the larger the monthly rise once the holiday is over.</p> <p>Halifax gives the example of someone with a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage at a rate of 2.75% with a 20-year term remaining. Following a three-month holiday, their monthly payment will rise by \u00a39 \u2013 from \u00a3542 to \u00a3551. Because the balance is remaining higher for three months, the total amount to repay goes up by \u00a3485 to \u00a3130,605.</p> <p>If you change a couple of numbers \u2013 reduce the term remaining to seven years and halve the mortgage size to \u00a350,000 \u2013 the monthly increase is a lot bigger: \u00a327 (from \u00a3655 to \u00a3682). That\u2019s \u00a3324 extra over a year. In that case the total amount to repay goes up by \u00a3195 to \u00a355,219.</p> <p>However, let\u2019s now assume the mortgage is interest-only rather than repayment, but keep the other details the same. In that scenario, the monthly increase is very small: \u00a32 for the \u00a3100,000 loan and \u00a31 for the \u00a350,000 one.</p> <p>According to Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert.com, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of mortgage holiday applicants are being told their monthly payments will increase by less than \u00a350.</p> <p>The UK\u2019s official Money Advice Service says: \u201cYour lender should explain the impact of any option on your monthly payments.\u201d So if you have not been told this information, you must ask for it. MoneySuperMarket\u2019s website has an easy-to-use <a href=\"https://www.moneysupermarket.com/mortgages/search/payment-holiday\" title=\"\">payment holiday calculator</a> that will give you a good idea of the increase.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Payment holidays and credit ratings</strong></h2> <p>Many people told us they had been informed that taking a payment holiday would not affect their credit rating \u2013 though some were worried this might not be the case.</p> <p>Luke May, 31, who lives in Derbyshire, said he and his partner were coming up to their first year in their first home together, and have had to defer their mortgage payments for three months. \u201cMy partner will need a new car soon, and we are due to remortgage next year \u2013 we are worried our good credit scores will not be enough to secure better deals,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> The government, the FCA and lenders have all stated that taking a payment holiday will not affect an individual\u2019s credit rating. </p> <p>But remember that while the UK\u2019s credit reference agencies hold the data that makes up someone\u2019s credit score, these bodies do not decide whether someone can obtain credit \u2013 that is up to individual lenders, who are free to choose to whom they wish to lend. If you are expecting to apply for any kind of credit in the next couple of years, the fact you took a break may limit your options.</p> <h2><strong>Seeking future borrowing</strong></h2> <p>Again, some were concerned about whether taking a payment holiday may have an adverse impact when they later come to switch their mortgage to another firm or want to increase their borrowing. Jim, a 42-year-old train driver from Kent who has been furloughed from work, told us: \u201cHopefully it will not affect any future borrowing. However, you never know with the banks. The proof will be in the pudding when we go to remortgage.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> Mortgage holders on payment holidays can switch to a new deal offered by their existing lender at the end of their term, but it\u2019s not so simple when it comes to remortgaging to another lender.</p> <p>Chris Sykes, a consultant at the mortgage broker Private Finance, says if you require new finance in the next six months \u2013 a remortgage with a new lender, say \u2013 a payment holiday will make your application less likely to be accepted.</p> <p>He told Money that while some lenders are becoming more flexible, \u201cothers who are more reserved in terms of what they lend \u2026 would look unfavourably on you having a payment holiday\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s fair to say that using a mortgage broker may not be a bad move, as they will have a good idea about which lenders are most likely to be accommodating.</p> <h2><strong>What about if you still can\u2019t afford payments when the holiday is over?</strong></h2> <p>This is clearly a worry for many \u2013 though it may be that the holidays are extended beyond three months.</p> <p>Joanna, a freelance writer in Edinburgh, was granted a payment holiday on her mortgage and on two bank loans.</p> <p>She fears more debt when the crisis is over. \u201cI know I will struggle to get work again when things calm down, and it will take me months to get back on my feet \u2013 but all these banks and utility providers will come for their money in three months. It is giving me sleepless nights and chronic anxiety.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Need to know</strong> The FCA says that at the end of the holiday, if you are still not able to make your full payments due to the crisis, your lender may, if appropriate, offer you a further payment holiday or other assistance.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/debt-and-money/if-you-cant-pay-your-bills-because-of-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">Citizens Advice points out</a> that at the moment your mortgage provider should not try to repossess your home, and should pause any action it is already taking until at least 18 June 2020.</p> <h2><strong>So should I apply for a mortgage payment holiday?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s not too late to ask for one, but Sykes says his view is that if you can avoid applying for one, do. Those who do request one will need to self-certify their income has been either directly or indirectly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>In many cases there will be other options: Barclays is among the banks allowing some borrowers to switch to interest-only payments for up to 12 months. Alternatively, some will allow you to increase the length of your mortgage term. Both of these will mean reduced monthly payments, but at a cost in the future.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Almost one in five UK mortgage holders have now been granted a payment holiday, it was estimated this week \u2013 but people\u2019s experiences of the process have been very different. Some struggled to get a holiday while others say it was almost too easy. And while for some it will add just a few pounds to their monthly mortgage bill, others say their outlay will rise by a lot more. The Guardian asked readers who had applied for a mortgage payment holiday, or help with other debts, how they got on. Almost 200 people contacted us to tell us their stories. Here we look at their main concerns and provide essential need-to-know information and expert advice for anyone considering a mortgage holiday. For most, a mortgage holiday will mean higher repayments The increases people face vary hugely. One reader, a Londoner who is currently out of work because of a brain tumour, said he called his bank to explain he was struggling, and that the tenant in his buy-to-let flat had stopped paying rent, and was instantly told he could take a three-month mortgage holiday. But he added: \u201cI was shocked to be told that the \u2018holiday\u2019 is no such thing \u2013 merely a pause, after which my payments would increase by nearly \u00a3200 per month \u2026 When I pointed out that a true holiday would be to extend the life of the mortgage by three months and not increase payments, I got a very frosty response.\u201d David Porter, who works in IT and also lives in London, also deferred his mortgage payments for three months. His home loan has 14 years left to run. \u201cThe payment break will add about \u00a320 a month to my mortgage, which seems manageable, but of course this will all add up over the course of the mortgage lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIf all is well income-wise, I intend to overpay over the next year or two.\u201d Lee Young, 49, who lives in Nottingham and has been furloughed, has a 28-year mortgage with 15 years left to run. The current balance is roughly \u00a360,000 and his current monthly payment is about \u00a3350. It will rise by about \u00a35 a month. Perhaps worryingly, quite a few of those who contacted us appeared to have little or no idea how much extra they will have to fork out. Several told us that when they called to ask about a break, their lender had given them no information about how much the new payments would be. Need to know \u201cPayment holiday is a misleading description for what is actually a payment deferment,\u201d says Mark Harris at the mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. The standard position at most lenders appears to be that you pay more each month in the future, while the term stays the same. Typically, lenders are spreading people\u2019s deferred payments over the outstanding term of their mortgage. On top of this, during the holiday, the lender continues to charge interest and adds this to the amount you owe, which increases the balance it charges interest on. As a result your payments will be a bit higher when the holiday ends and there will be a (slightly) bigger total amount to repay. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) guidance indicates the default should be a three-month holiday, though it says firms can offer a shorter period in certain situations. Because the missed payments are being spread over the rest of the mortgage, the shorter the term left on your loan, the larger the monthly rise once the holiday is over. Halifax gives the example of someone with a \u00a3100,000 repayment mortgage at a rate of 2.75% with a 20-year term remaining. Following a three-month holiday, their monthly payment will rise by \u00a39 \u2013 from \u00a3542 to \u00a3551. Because the balance is remaining higher for three months, the total amount to repay goes up by \u00a3485 to \u00a3130,605. If you change a couple of numbers \u2013 reduce the term remaining to seven years and halve the mortgage size to \u00a350,000 \u2013 the monthly increase is a lot bigger: \u00a327 (from \u00a3655 to \u00a3682). That\u2019s \u00a3324 extra over a year. In that case the total amount to repay goes up by \u00a3195 to \u00a355,219. However, let\u2019s now assume the mortgage is interest-only rather than repayment, but keep the other details the same. In that scenario, the monthly increase is very small: \u00a32 for the \u00a3100,000 loan and \u00a31 for the \u00a350,000 one. According to Martin Lewis\u2019s MoneySavingExpert.com, the \u201cvast majority\u201d of mortgage holiday applicants are being told their monthly payments will increase by less than \u00a350. The UK\u2019s official Money Advice Service says: \u201cYour lender should explain the impact of any option on your monthly payments.\u201d So if you have not been told this information, you must ask for it. MoneySuperMarket\u2019s website has an easy-to-use payment holiday calculator that will give you a good idea of the increase. Payment holidays and credit ratings Many people told us they had been informed that taking a payment holiday would not affect their credit rating \u2013 though some were worried this might not be the case. Luke May, 31, who lives in Derbyshire, said he and his partner were coming up to their first year in their first home together, and have had to defer their mortgage payments for three months. \u201cMy partner will need a new car soon, and we are due to remortgage next year \u2013 we are worried our good credit scores will not be enough to secure better deals,\u201d he said. Need to know The government, the FCA and lenders have all stated that taking a payment holiday will not affect an individual\u2019s credit rating. But remember that while the UK\u2019s credit reference agencies hold the data that makes up someone\u2019s credit score, these bodies do not decide whether someone can obtain credit \u2013 that is up to individual lenders, who are free to choose to whom they wish to lend. If you are expecting to apply for any kind of credit in the next couple of years, the fact you took a break may limit your options. Seeking future borrowing Again, some were concerned about whether taking a payment holiday may have an adverse impact when they later come to switch their mortgage to another firm or want to increase their borrowing. Jim, a 42-year-old train driver from Kent who has been furloughed from work, told us: \u201cHopefully it will not affect any future borrowing. However, you never know with the banks. The proof will be in the pudding when we go to remortgage.\u201d Need to know Mortgage holders on payment holidays can switch to a new deal offered by their existing lender at the end of their term, but it\u2019s not so simple when it comes to remortgaging to another lender. Chris Sykes, a consultant at the mortgage broker Private Finance, says if you require new finance in the next six months \u2013 a remortgage with a new lender, say \u2013 a payment holiday will make your application less likely to be accepted. He told Money that while some lenders are becoming more flexible, \u201cothers who are more reserved in terms of what they lend \u2026 would look unfavourably on you having a payment holiday\u201d. It\u2019s fair to say that using a mortgage broker may not be a bad move, as they will have a good idea about which lenders are most likely to be accommodating. What about if you still can\u2019t afford payments when the holiday is over? This is clearly a worry for many \u2013 though it may be that the holidays are extended beyond three months. Joanna, a freelance writer in Edinburgh, was granted a payment holiday on her mortgage and on two bank loans. She fears more debt when the crisis is over. \u201cI know I will struggle to get work again when things calm down, and it will take me months to get back on my feet \u2013 but all these banks and utility providers will come for their money in three months. It is giving me sleepless nights and chronic anxiety.\u201d Need to know The FCA says that at the end of the holiday, if you are still not able to make your full payments due to the crisis, your lender may, if appropriate, offer you a further payment holiday or other assistance. Citizens Advice points out that at the moment your mortgage provider should not try to repossess your home, and should pause any action it is already taking until at least 18 June 2020. So should I apply for a mortgage payment holiday? It\u2019s not too late to ask for one, but Sykes says his view is that if you can avoid applying for one, do. Those who do request one will need to self-certify their income has been either directly or indirectly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. In many cases there will be other options: Barclays is among the banks allowing some borrowers to switch to interest-only payments for up to 12 months. Alternatively, some will allow you to increase the length of your mortgage term. Both of these will mean reduced monthly payments, but at a cost in the future.",

On the same day, the US accused China and Russia of cooperating to spread false narratives about the coronavirus, and tightened visa guidelines for Chinese journalists. Travellers arriving in Britain to face two weeks of self-isolation Travellers to the UK will be quarantined for two weeks when they arrive as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic, Boris Johnson is expected to say on Sunday when he lays out his roadmap out of the lockdown. He will announce the introduction of quarantine measures for people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar train stations, including for Britons returning from abroad. Trump says virus will \u2018go away without a vaccine\u2019 Donald Trump has said the coronavirus is \u201cgoing to go away without a vaccine\u201d, but warned there could be \u201cflare ups\u201d next year. Speaking to Republican lawmakers, he also said the US death toll could top 95,000. His vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to one of Donald Trump\u2019s senior advisers, has tested positive for coronavirus. She is the second White House staffer to test positive this week. US lawmakers urge support for Taiwan at WHO The leaders of US congressional foreign affairs committees have written to more than 50 countries asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s inclusion in the World Health Organization. Taiwan, which is not a member of the United Nations, has been excluded from the WHO, which is a UN agency, due to objections from China. The letter was sent to \u201clike-minded\u201d countries, large and small, seen as friends and allies of Taiwan, including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Mexico looks to reopen its economy Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Friday that he aims to present plans next week to reopen the economy, as key sectors like car-making look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures. Industry sources say 18 May is seen as the tentative date for reopening the automotive sector in Mexico, provided it gets a green light from president Lopez Obrador. Argentina extends quarantine for Buenos Aires Argentina confirmed it will extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires but relax restrictions in the rest of the country. The national quarantine South America\u2019s second largest economy began on 20 March and will be extended in the capital until 24 May. Until Friday, the country had registered 5,611 confirmed cases of the virus and 293 deaths. Brazil\u2019s President Bolsonaro must \u2018drastically change course\u2019, says The Lancet The British medical journal The Lancett says the biggest threat to Brazil\u2019s ability to successfully combat the spread of the coronavirus and tackle the unfolding public health crisis is the country\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. Its editorial said his disregard for and flouting of lockdown measures was sowing confusion across Brazil, which reported a record number of Covid-19 deaths on Friday. Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, dies Roy Horn, of the Las Vegas double act Siegfried and Roy, has died after contracting Covid-19. He died in Las Vegas on Friday, aged 75. The duo\u2019s performances - in which the illusionists would ride on elephants, cavort with tigers and make animals disappear - became one of Las Vegas\u2019s biggest attractions. Horn was critically injured in 2003 when a tiger attacked him on stage.",

More than four-firths (83%) agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health worse, and a quarter of those who had been accessing support said they were no longer able to do so.</p> \n<p>The combination of being siloed with their family and separated from their friends has many young people living inside a pressure cooker, says Loades.</p> \n<p>Her <a href=\"https://osf.io/qh5fp/\">review</a> of 63 studies on isolation and loneliness in teenagers suggested physical distancing was likely to put them at higher risk of depression, and probably anxiety. The longer the lockdown restrictions go on, the worse outcomes are likely to lead to, says Loades.</p> \n<p>The long-term effects of isolation on teenagers will differ greatly by individual,as well as factors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/26/dont-despair-if-your-child-is-glued-to-a-screen-it-may-be-keeping-them-sane\">such as access to technology</a>, amount of personal space and relationship with their family, says says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit at the University of Cambridge. \u201cWe can already see inequalities arising.\u201d</p> \n<p>Orben predicts that teenagers will at least find being apart from their peers a negative experience. \u201cThe importance of the social world for adolescents can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>For some teenagers, the isolation coronavirus has caused is nothing new. Last year, research by the charity <a href=\"https://www.mencap.org.uk/learning-disability-explained/research-and-statistics/friendships-research-and-statistics\">Mencap</a> found one in three young people with a learning disability spend less than an hour outside their home on a typical Saturday.</p> \n<p>Joey Mander, 21, is an NHS sterile services technician and youth activist in Coventry. He hopes one silver lining of the pandemic is recognition that \u201cfor some of us, this is just our ordinary\u201d. At 16 he was diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a rare genetic mutation, and now uses a wheelchair.</p> \n<p>He says the restriction and loss of autonomy \u201cthe world has been forced to experience, is the very thing that people\u201d with a disability face as part of their day-to-day experience.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I\u2019m having to fight very hard to get through each day.

That\u2019s what I keep saying,\u201d says Mander.</p> \n<p>Loades says it is important for teenagers to know coronavirus is a challenge for everyone \u2013 and that within that there may be opportunity to gain new perspectives, skills and maturity. Her previous research, on the experience of isolation by young people with chronic illness, has shown that \u201cthrough adversity comes strength\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some teenagers are using lockdown to challenge themselves and support their family. Betsy often cooks dinner, and bakes \u201cjust for something to do\u201d. Ava says she appreciates her friendships more, and has enjoyed the extra bonding time with her parents: \u201cI\u2019ve learnt more about them as people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charlotte and her friends are each keeping journals on a different aspect of life during a pandemic: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite interesting to look back and tell the kids about.\u201d</p> \n<p>She is interested in going into journalism, and coronavirus has proved a crash course in media literacy. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking: is what we\u2019re being told scaremongering?

It\u2019s the knowledge that I\u2019m losing my teenage years.\u201d Betsy checks herself before adding: \u201cWell \u2013 one or two years, probably.\u201d The coronavirus has affected all our lives, but six weeks since schools shut across the UK there is evidence that teenagers in particular are struggling. A study of 60,000 people in lockdown by University College London found that the youngest in the sample, 18- to 24-year-olds, had the lowest levels of life satisfaction, while the highest was recorded in the over-60s. \u201cTo some degree, this [the lockdown] is not a different experience for teenagers \u2013 but teenagers are more vulnerable,\u201d says Dr Maria Loades, a senior lecturer and clinical psychologist at the University of Bath who studies the effect of social isolation and loneliness in young people. It is easy to see why that may be the case. Exams young people have been told will shape the rest of their lives have been cancelled, future plans \u2013 for work, travel or further study \u2013 cast into uncertainty. Incipient independence has been rudely interrupted. Physical distancing goes against adolescent impulse, says Loades: to assert themselves as individuals, away from their parents; to spend time with their friends, to take risks, to act without thinking of consequences. \u201cWe\u2019re asking teenagers to be very responsible and mature, and to make sensible decisions for the greater good of society,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably quite a conflict.\u201d Loades says school leavers in particular will be suffering the loss of milestones such as exams, last-day rituals such as shirt signing and leavers\u2019 assemblies, and end-of-year parties. \u201cThose kinds of experiences help us to make sense of endings that might feel painful and difficult, and to move on from one stage of life to another,\u201d she adds. For many young people, the cancellation of exams comes not as relief, but as anticlimax. \u201cObviously no one really wants to do exams, but \u2026 there were subjects that I knew I could push myself in,\u201d says Betsy. She expects to pass her GCSEs on the strength of her mock exam marks, and is relieved she put in the effort. \u201cYou get told that your mock exams don\u2019t mean anything \u2013 now it means a lot. For people who were going to try during \u2018the real thing\u2019, it\u2019s probably quite hard.\u201d Others have already had to adapt to online learning.

The learning curve has been steep: lessons are dense, self-directed and marred by technical difficulties. \u201cAt school you can bounce off each other \u2013 it\u2019s a lot harder to do that now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have some teachers who have never used the platform before, so we had to teach them.\u201d Her friend Josh Foster, also 17, says some people have already started muting the teacher and watching Netflix instead. \u201cAs long as they\u2019ve logged into class,\u201d she adds. Josh says teachers seem to be overcompensating with homework, forcing him to cram until 2am and seek extensions to keep up. \u201cI feel that we\u2019re quite hindered compared to last year\u2019s year 12s.\u201d Support from both his school and prospective universities has been lacking, he continues. \u201cI\u2019m in a position where I don\u2019t know what to do to have the best chance of getting into a university.\u201d The economic fallout from the pandemic has already darkened the outlook for the 800,000 school leavers and graduates in the UK. The Resolution Foundation thinktank predicts that the \u201ccorona class of 2020\u201d are the group most at risk of unemployment, and face long-term damage to their career and pay prospects. Ava Twomey, 17, from south London, is having to reckon with her chosen industry going into freefall, just as she finished her Btec qualification. She has dreamed of working as an airline cabin crew member since she was 13. \u201cI really love travelling, airplanes, airports \u2013 I\u2019m a bit obsessed.\u201d British Airways was her first choice, after she did work experience there last year and \u201cfell in love\u201d. But BA has been upended by the collapse in aviation, and recently set out plans to make up to 12,000 staff redundant. \u201cIt\u2019s not looking too good at the moment,\u201d says Ava, \u201cbut I\u2019m trying to stay positive.\u201d Exercise helped, until she overdid the running and tore her tendon; now she FaceTimes her friends and binge-watches Made in Chelsea and The Only Way Is Essex. \u201cIt\u2019s just so comforting,\u201d she says apologetically. Many teenagers have sought solace in Netflix. Betsy is storming through Gossip Girl at a rate of 2.5 series a week. Charlotte and her friends have watched the Twilight and Harry Potter films together using the Netflix Party app (\u201cShe made me watch Clueless,\u201d says Josh, grumbling). They used to go to Wetherspoons to do their homework, says Charlotte; now they gather on FaceTime and Zoom. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing what we normally do, but online.\u201d Tope Olufemi, 19 , abruptly returned from his first year at the University of Warwick to his parents\u2019 home in north London. He says screen time has gone \u201cthrough the roof. People are on social media 24/7.\u201d Jakob McMaster, 17, from Belfast, has found it harder to adapt. He used to spend his days at school or outdoors, exploring abandoned buildings and forests with his friends. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stayed inside the house this long since I was 12 \u2026 We thrive off being outside.\u201d He has also been separated from his boyfriend of one year, who attends the same school. Before lockdown, the longest they had been apart was three days. Two months into isolating with his parents and younger siblings, Jakob says he feels bored and uncharacteristically irritable, like \u201ctime is merging together\u201d. \u201cI get peaks of motivation where it\u2019s like: \u2018I have all the time in the world, I should start baking!.\u2019 But as soon as I get the stuff ready for it, I\u2019m like: \u2018This is meaningless \u2013 we\u2019re just stuck here.\u2019\u201d Jakob has had weekly therapy since he was 11, but now his sessions have been put on hold. He has noticed the impact of the loss of support and being confined on his depression: \u201cI have the kind that makes me want to bounce off the walls.\u201d In mid-March the charity YoungMinds surveyed 2,100 people under 25 who had previously sought help for their mental health. More than four-firths (83%) agreed that the pandemic had made their mental health worse, and a quarter of those who had been accessing support said they were no longer able to do so. The combination of being siloed with their family and separated from their friends has many young people living inside a pressure cooker, says Loades. Her review of 63 studies on isolation and loneliness in teenagers suggested physical distancing was likely to put them at higher risk of depression, and probably anxiety. The longer the lockdown restrictions go on, the worse outcomes are likely to lead to, says Loades. The long-term effects of isolation on teenagers will differ greatly by individual,as well as factors such as access to technology, amount of personal space and relationship with their family, says says Dr Amy Orben, a research fellow at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit at the University of Cambridge. \u201cWe can already see inequalities arising.\u201d Orben predicts that teenagers will at least find being apart from their peers a negative experience. \u201cThe importance of the social world for adolescents can\u2019t be overstated,\u201d she says. For some teenagers, the isolation coronavirus has caused is nothing new. Last year, research by the charity Mencap found one in three young people with a learning disability spend less than an hour outside their home on a typical Saturday. Joey Mander, 21, is an NHS sterile services technician and youth activist in Coventry. He hopes one silver lining of the pandemic is recognition that \u201cfor some of us, this is just our ordinary\u201d. At 16 he was diagnosed with hereditary spastic paraplegia, a rare genetic mutation, and now uses a wheelchair. He says the restriction and loss of autonomy \u201cthe world has been forced to experience, is the very thing that people\u201d with a disability face as part of their day-to-day experience. For Mander, who also has autism, the pandemic has disrupted his routines and led to a cut in the hours of his support worker just as own his job has become more high-pressured than ever. \u201cI\u2019m having to fight very hard to get through each day.\u201d He has found solace in drawing \u2013 he is adapting Rosie the Riveter to show \u201ca person in scrubs like mine\u201d \u2013 and CYA Saturdays, a group of young disability advocates, now meeting twice weekly on Zoom. \u201cI just want to touch someone\u2019s hand. That\u2019s what I keep saying,\u201d says Mander. Loades says it is important for teenagers to know coronavirus is a challenge for everyone \u2013 and that within that there may be opportunity to gain new perspectives, skills and maturity. Her previous research, on the experience of isolation by young people with chronic illness, has shown that \u201cthrough adversity comes strength\u201d. Some teenagers are using lockdown to challenge themselves and support their family. Betsy often cooks dinner, and bakes \u201cjust for something to do\u201d. Ava says she appreciates her friendships more, and has enjoyed the extra bonding time with her parents: \u201cI\u2019ve learnt more about them as people.\u201d Charlotte and her friends are each keeping journals on a different aspect of life during a pandemic: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be quite interesting to look back and tell the kids about.\u201d She is interested in going into journalism, and coronavirus has proved a crash course in media literacy. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking: is what we\u2019re being told scaremongering? Is it actually as serious as they\u2019re saying, or more serious?\u201d A survey by the US non-profit Common Sense Media on 13- to 17-year-olds\u2019 response to the coronavirus pandemic found that about half were turning to news media for information, up from 30% last year. For Tope, the lockdown has reinforced the importance of politics. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not affecting us equally, it\u2019s affecting all of us.\u201d He has been talking about the government response and mismanagement scandals with his friends. \u201cA lot of people are realising that politics affects you on a daily basis, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.\u201d With many teenagers concerned for their essential-worker parents or elderly parents, the stakes of the crisis are not lost on them. Nor is it the fact that it will pass \u2013 and sooner, if they follow the rules. Betsy says most people she knows have been adhering to physical distancing. When one posted on social media about meeting up with their friends, the response was of anger. \u201cThere was a lot of: \u2018What do you not understand about not going out?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of people got quite vocal, just the ignorance of it. \u201cObviously the more people that go out, the longer we\u2019re in it.\u201d Betsy is already looking forward to the party that will be thrown once this is all over. For now, she says: \u201cMe not being able to hang out with my friends is not the biggest problem.\u201d",

With almost half a billion citizens, it brings together peoples and nations from all over Europe who are proud of their history and culture but know they will be stronger together. It is telling that this year, we also mark the 25th anniversary of the accession to the union of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and the 40th anniversary of the historic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2019/sep/18/the-birth-of-solidarity-in-poland-archive-1980\">Solidarity</a> movement in Poland.</p> <p>All this and much more is what we are proudly celebrating today. We do so while looking forward, with confidence, to the future of our union, focused on finding a common way out of the health emergency, ensuring an inclusive economic recovery and building the foundations for sustainable development in Europe and around the world.</p> <p>The United Kingdom made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the European Union. It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country.</p> <p>The current unprecedented health emergency has brought us closer together \u2013 within each of our countries and among the 27, as well as between all of us in the EU and our British friends. We all know that Covid-19 spares no one \u2013 no family, no country. We all know that only together will we be able to overcome it.</p> <p>In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic.</p> <p>An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely. British flights did the same for EU citizens. These examples illustrate how the most challenging situations bring to the fore the best in each of us, as the Queen so eloquently highlighted in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/queen-urges-britons-stay-strong-coronavirus-covid-lockdown\">broadcast to the nation</a> on 5 April.</p> <p>A democratic decision, which we regret but fully respect, was made by the United Kingdom to leave the EU. We are now implementing the transitional provisions of the withdrawal agreement while negotiating the terms of our future relations. For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought.</p> <p>Indeed, in today\u2019s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states \u2013 and peoples \u2013 is essential. A good example is what the UK and Italy are doing together on the climate crisis, in jointly ensuring that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/cop-26-glasgow-climate-change-conference-2020\">Cop26</a> conference delivers a high level of global ambition to overcome this major challenge for mankind. Another is the ongoing global pledge to finance treatment and vaccination against Covid-19, of which the EU and the UK are major sponsors.</p> <p>We believe that cooperation and solidarity among countries, with full respect for sovereignty and diversity, are key factors in overcoming today\u2019s challenges, starting with the present health emergency. We trust that these principles will also inspire the future relationship between the UK and the EU \u2013 and that is the friendly message that, as a united group of 28 ambassadors and high commissioners, we would like to convey to the British people on this Europe Day.</p> <p><strong>This article was jointly authored by: </strong>Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida, ambassador of the European Union to the United Kingdom; Michael Zimmermann, ambassador of Austria; Ellen De Geest, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Belgium; Marin Raykov, ambassador of Bulgaria; Igor Pokaz, ambassador of Croatia; Andreas S Kakouris, high commissioner of Cyprus; Libor Se\u010dka, ambassador of the Czech Republic; Lars Thuesen, ambassador of Denmark; Tiina Intelmann, ambassador of Estonia; Markku Kein\u00e4nen, ambassador of Finland; Catherine Colonna, ambassador of France; Julia Gross, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Germany; Dimitris Caramitsos-Tziras, ambassador of Greece; Ferenc Kumin, ambassador of Hungary; Adrian O\u2019Neill, ambassador of Ireland; Raffaele Trombetta, ambassador of Italy; Katarina Pl\u0101tere, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires of Latvia; Renatas Norkus, ambassador of Lithuania; Jean Olinger, ambassador of Luxembourg; Joseph Cole, high commissioner of Malta; Simon Smits, ambassador of the Netherlands; Arkady Rzegocki, ambassador of Poland; Manuel Lobo Antunes, ambassador of Portugal; Sorin-Dan Mihalache, ambassador of Romania; Lubom\u00edr Reh\u00e1k, ambassador of Slovakia; Tadej Rupel, ambassador of Slovenia; Carlos Bastarreche, ambassador of Spain; Torbj\u00f6rn Sohlstr\u00f6m, ambassador of Sweden.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 May 2020 to clarify in the main image caption that Winston Churchill was not the British prime minister at the time the picture was taken.</p>",

It is telling that this year, we also mark the 25th anniversary of the accession to the union of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and the 40th anniversary of the historic Solidarity movement in Poland. All this and much more is what we are proudly celebrating today. We do so while looking forward, with confidence, to the future of our union, focused on finding a common way out of the health emergency, ensuring an inclusive economic recovery and building the foundations for sustainable development in Europe and around the world. The United Kingdom made a significant contribution to European achievements before and during its 47 years of membership of the European Union. It is thus only natural for us to celebrate Europe Day also with the British people, its workers and entrepreneurs, its researchers, its teachers and scholars, its artists, its farmers and fishermen, its doctors and nurses. Today, our thoughts go out particularly to the victims of Covid-19 and their families and to all of the dedicated care and frontline workers around the country. The current unprecedented health emergency has brought us closer together \u2013 within each of our countries and among the 27, as well as between all of us in the EU and our British friends. We all know that Covid-19 spares no one \u2013 no family, no country. We all know that only together will we be able to overcome it. In our cities, towns and villages, on both sides of the Channel, we have been witnessing an outpouring of dedication, kindness and altruism. It should not come as a surprise: solidarity is indeed part of our DNA, in the European Union as in the United Kingdom. EU nationals employed by the NHS have worked tirelessly, side by side with their British colleagues, to save lives since the outbreak of the pandemic. An EU repatriation programme helped almost 2,000 British citizens stranded around the globe to return home safely. British flights did the same for EU citizens. These examples illustrate how the most challenging situations bring to the fore the best in each of us, as the Queen so eloquently highlighted in her broadcast to the nation on 5 April. A democratic decision, which we regret but fully respect, was made by the United Kingdom to leave the EU. We are now implementing the transitional provisions of the withdrawal agreement while negotiating the terms of our future relations. For anyone who may have doubted that a close future partnership between the UK and the EU is of mutual interest, the ongoing health emergency has certainly provided ample food for thought. Indeed, in today\u2019s globalised, interconnected and interdependent world, cooperation among nations and states \u2013 and peoples \u2013 is essential. A good example is what the UK and Italy are doing together on the climate crisis, in jointly ensuring that the Cop26 conference delivers a high level of global ambition to overcome this major challenge for mankind. Another is the ongoing global pledge to finance treatment and vaccination against Covid-19, of which the EU and the UK are major sponsors. We believe that cooperation and solidarity among countries, with full respect for sovereignty and diversity, are key factors in overcoming today\u2019s challenges, starting with the present health emergency. We trust that these principles will also inspire the future relationship between the UK and the EU \u2013 and that is the friendly message that, as a united group of 28 ambassadors and high commissioners, we would like to convey to the British people on this Europe Day.

You can literally just step out of your door and begin your government-approved exercise but, if you want to make the most of it and improve your health and fitness, a few small things can go a long way. The basics Shoes A good pair of running shoes is essential to help keep your feet in healthy shape. Most will need regular road shoes, with proper cushioning for pavement and Tarmac, unless you\u2019re running trails. Everyone\u2019s feet are different so specialist shops offer gait analysis for free. With that not an option, the wet foot test, where you look at the print your foot makes on a step might help \u2013 you can find details of how to do it at home on Runnersneed.com. The majority of people have what is called overpronation, where the foot rolls inwards during the stride, but some people under pronate where the opposite is true, while others have neutral pronation. Stability or motion control shoes can help those who overpronate, while neutral shoes are normally recommended for everyone else.

Different brands have different fits, too, with some being wider in the toe or shallower in depth, while each manufacturer will have a range of models differing in weight, cushioning and support. All the big brands sell running shoes, but there are also many specialist makes. I wear Brooks but Asics is a good place to start with some excellent value shoes such as the Gel Contend series (RRP \u00a355). Shopping around for last year\u2019s models can also save you large sums. Buy for comfort and fit rather than looks, and be aware sizes are not usually the same between brands. Replace your road shoes every 500 to 800km as the shock absorbing foam wears out. Socks Running socks are worth buying if you\u2019re running regularly. Most include padding on impact- or rub-points, are moisture-wicking and fit far better than your average sports socks. Some people like synthetic materials, others wool. There are single-layer socks, but I swear by Hilly\u2019s TwinSkin (RRP \u00a314) dual-layer socks which cured my blister problem from first wear. Apps, planners and gear Just stepping out the door and running is a great start, but joining a scheme or tracking your progress is more likely to keep you at it. Couch to 5K Couch to 5K is a nine-week plan that progresses from brisk walking to a total of 30 minutes running by week nine. There are lots of versions to choose from, but the free NHS- and BBC-supported One You Couch to 5K app for Android or the iPhone is one of the better options.

Other popular alternatives include the Nike Run Club, Asics Runkeeper, Adidas Runtastic, Under Armour\u2019s Map My Run, Google Fit and Apple Workout/Activity. Air quality If you run in London, King\u2019s College London\u2019s Tenzing Clean Air Tracker is also worth looking at. You can plan lower-pollution routes, or analyse the air quality of your existing runs tracked on Strava, to help you make the most of the health benefits of running.

Many Democrats believe Biden\u2019s fate may well rest on his ability to persuade their own side to vote. \u201cTrump has shown no desire or ability to moderate for those swing voters in this election,\u201d said Addisu Demissie, who served as Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign manager. \u201cSo those voters are now likely going to end up either Biden voters or non-voters or third-party voters, and that\u2019s the competition.\u201d This week, Trump traveled to the battleground state of Arizona, where he toured a medical mask facility without wearing one himself. The visit was a symbolic show of his administration\u2019s push to reopen the US economy but there were unmistakable elements of his signature campaign rallies, including the music that played when Trump finished his remarks (the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want). Trump\u2019s cross-country venture stood in striking contrast to Biden\u2019s virtual swing through Florida \u2013 which included a rally, a roundtable in Jacksonville and an appearance on the local news in Tampa. The technical glitches only further highlighted the limitations of his confinement. But the coronavirus has also upended Trump\u2019s strategy, erasing the booming economy he has made a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In recent weeks, his campaign has all but abandoned championing the president\u2019s leadership, instead focusing its efforts on diminishing Biden. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, previewed the onslaught on Twitter this week, comparing the Trump re-election juggernaut to the Death Star from the Star Wars movies. \u201cIn a few days we start pressing FIRE for the first time,\u201d he wrote. As Trump prepares to make even greater use of the advantages of incumbency, Biden faces his biggest test yet. Can he really lead a Rebel Alliance from his basement?",

      "bodyText": "Good evening and here is our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Elias Visontay bringing you the main stories on Saturday 9 May. Don\u2019t cuddle your mum, deputy chief medical officer says Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, has pleaded with Australians to resist any urges \u201cto cuddle our mums\u201d ahead of Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday. \u201cAbsolutely if you are feeling sick yourself, do not go and visit your mum. Please don\u2019t. If you are feeling well and you really want to see your mum, I\u2019m sure it is fine. But for elderly mums, just be a little bit cautious and probably keep that 1.5-metre distance for now,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cI know it is hard and we all want to cuddle our mums on Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 and a big shout out to all of the mums out there \u2013 but let\u2019s just wait a little bit longer.\u201d On Saturday afternoon, there were 6,929 cases in Australia, with the death toll at 97. There had been 16 new cases in the last 24 hours, four of which were related to the Cedar Meats cluster in Victoria. The testing positivity rate was now under 1%. Of the 900 Australians who were sick with Covid-19, 51 were currently being treated in hospital, with 19 of them in intensive care and 15 of those cases relying on ventilators. As of Friday, the government\u2019s CovidSafe app had been downloaded 5.4 million times. One country, one direction, different speeds The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said: \u201cWe have a clear three-step roadmap and plan for Australia. This has been adopted and embraced by all of the states and territories and, to just give an update, what we see is that in seven of the eight states and territories they have already indicated their date and commenced with particular steps. \u201cThe last state will start on Monday with their steps \u2026 So one country, one direction, different speeds, but all heading towards the common goal of keeping Australians safe but getting Australians back to work.\u201d Labor says the Coalition has no post-Covid economic plan The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has accused the federal government of lacking an economic plan to go with its roadmap to lift coronavirus-related restrictions. \u201cWe have said there needs to be a full release of the budget outlook, something the government is ducking at this stage,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Queanbeyan on Saturday, campaigning in the Eden-Monaro electorate ahead of the byelection. He said the government\u2019s promise of a \u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have an economic plan\u201d. \u201cWe will be calling for the government to outline its economic plan.\u201d A 17th resident of Newmarch House dies A 17th resident of Sydney\u2019s beleaguered Newmarch House died overnight. The 92-year-old great-grandmother Fay Rendoth, who grew up in the Blue Mountains and only recently moved to Newmarch, is believed to have died after recovering from coronavirus. She leaves behind three daughters, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Five new cases in NSW There have been five new cases recorded in NSW, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,051. NSW has also set a new record for a single day, with 13,692 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours. The state has tested 294,949 people since the declaration of the pandemic.

It\u2019s not an individual sport and you need to do things sometimes that are not in your comfort zone, or that are not in your best interests, for the greater good of the team.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s what great teams are built on ...

Fellow Titan <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and Manly\u2019s<strong> Marty Taupau</strong> both hesitated to get the shot due to past adverse reactions, but eventually had the injection.</p> \n  <p>As of Saturday afternoon, the Titans were still awaiting confirmation from Cartwright and Kelly over whether they would agree to be immunised and resume training.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s understood <strong>Dylan Walker</strong>, <strong>Addin Fonua-Blake</strong>, <strong>Josh Papalii</strong>, <strong>Joseph Tapine</strong>, <strong>Iosia Soliola</strong> and Canterbury\u2019s <strong>Sione Katoa </strong>all signed a waiver to remain compliant under the NRL\u2019s guidelines and continue training.</p> \n  <p>It has sparked confusion over how different states and territories will enforce the NRL\u2019s return to training protocols, and casts doubt over whether unimmunised players will be allowed to play in Queensland.</p> \n  <p>Graham, who sits on the RLPA\u2019s board of directors, said the confusion was always a risk as the game rushed to resume training. He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up.</p> \n  <p>Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s simple in my eyes ... It depends on how strong their convictions are on an individual level. If they want to sacrifice their rugby league game for their personal preference not to get a flu shot, that\u2019s their prerogative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a52fa0f2edbd31f05fe57c073d4ffff8b27a9e93/0_18_3448_2068/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Peats (centre) at a Gold Coast Titans training session on Saturday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:58:57.411Z\">at 7.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb64bbc8f0858b1a8106e0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-09T06:21:04.369Z\">7.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy chief medical officer, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, has also doubt on the chances of fans attending finals footy this year \u2013 another rubbing of salt into an already heavily seasoned wound.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are some iconic moments in Australian sport coming up in that period \u2013 the last weekend in September is dear to many of us.

<div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Opposition Leader <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has accused the federal government of lacking an economic plan to go with its road map to lift coronavirus-related restrictions.</p> \n  <p>AAP reports:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cWe have said there needs to be a full release of the budget outlook, something the government is ducking at this stage,\u201d Mr Albanese told reporters in Queanbeyan on Saturday, campaigning in the Eden-Monaro electorate ahead of the by-election.</p> \n   <p>He said the government\u2019s promise of a \u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have economic plan\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe will be calling for the government to outline its economic plan.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Albanese said there is a \u201cbig threat\u201d to the economy if people suddenly get cut off from their jobkeeper and jobseeker payments on some arbitrary date.</p> \n   <p>Prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and state and territory leaders agreed on Friday to a three-step plan to restart business and community activities.</p> \n   <p>However, the states and territories are set to move through the three stages at different speeds, depending on their health situation and local conditions.</p> \n   <p>Treasury says it is possible to restore 851,000 jobs in coming months if things go to plan.</p> \n   <p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said regional and interstate travel restrictions need to be lifted as soon as is practicable to breathe life back into regional and urban economies.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAustralian businesses depend on operating as seamlessly as possible

(Cognisant that last week the federal education minister <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise).</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member <strong>Josh Wilson</strong> (the member for Fremantle, no relation (<em>at least I don\u2019t think so!</em>) about different states easing restrictions at different times.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tim Wilson</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. <strong>Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the </strong><strong>clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him</strong>, <strong>and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back.</strong> </p> \n   <p>So, people will have their own opinions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the <strong>Herald Sun</strong> as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201c<strong>Because I think.</strong>\u201d</p> \n  <p>Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW.</p> \n  <p>Andrews said on Thursday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And yesterday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to.</p> \n   <p>These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently.

      "bodyText": "To recap, this afternoon there were 6,929 Covid-19 cases in Australia, with the death toll at 97. There had been 16 new cases in the last 24 hours, four of which were related to the Cedar Meats cluster in Victoria. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, pleaded with Australians to resist any urges \u201cto cuddle our mums\u201d ahead of Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday, urging people to be cautious as coronavirus restrictions begin to be eased. Here\u2019s our summary of today\u2019s major developments. That concludes our coverage for the day. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow, but in the meantime follow the Guardian\u2019s global live coverage here. Thanks for reading and stay safe. There are just two people in South Australia considered to be active cases of Covid-19. No further cases were recorded when the state health department released updated statistics on Saturday, with South Australia\u2019s total tally remaining at 439. It comes as the state is set to loosen restrictions from Monday, with leaders keen to encourage South Australians to travel within their state. The premier, Steven Marshall, has reassured South Australians regional travel is safe because the state is \u201cone of the safest places in the world at the moment\u201d. We want people to get out and explore our fabulous regions. It is safe for regional travel in South Australia. AAP reports that from Monday, all country accommodation can reopen, including caravan parks, hotels, motels and Airbnb services. Other restrictions to be lifted in SA include the return of alcohol-free outdoor dining at cafes and restaurants and the resumption of outdoor sports training. Universities and Tafe colleges will be allowed to resume face-to-face learning, public swimming pools, places of worship and libraries can reopen, and open house inspections and home auctions will be permitted. In almost all cases, numbers will be limited to 10 people at a time and all social distancing provisions will still apply. However, SA will allow up to 20 people to attend a funeral indoors and up to 30 people outdoors. AAP is reporting that the Cronulla captain, Wade Graham, has called on those NRL players who are refusing to get a flu shot to remember they have chosen to compete in a team sport. The NRL\u2019s restart on 28 May has hit a hiccup with around 20 players refusing to be vaccinated for various reasons, including past adverse reactions to the flu shot and religious reasons. However, speaking on Triple M on Saturday, Graham said getting the flu shot was a \u201cno brainer\u201d, and refusing to do so based on just personal preference goes against a team-first mentality. If it was a pure personal preference, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a team sport boys. It\u2019s not an individual sport and you need to do things sometimes that are not in your comfort zone, or that are not in your best interests, for the greater good of the team. That\u2019s what great teams are built on ... I think in this situation, you have to not think about your own personal situation and think about the rest of the playing group. On Friday, the Gold Coast Titans confirmed Bryce Cartwright and Brian Kelly were both stood down for refusing the vaccination after an intervention by the Queensland government. Fellow Titan Nathan Peats and Manly\u2019s Marty Taupau both hesitated to get the shot due to past adverse reactions, but eventually had the injection. As of Saturday afternoon, the Titans were still awaiting confirmation from Cartwright and Kelly over whether they would agree to be immunised and resume training. It\u2019s understood Dylan Walker, Addin Fonua-Blake, Josh Papalii, Joseph Tapine, Iosia Soliola and Canterbury\u2019s Sione Katoa all signed a waiver to remain compliant under the NRL\u2019s guidelines and continue training. It has sparked confusion over how different states and territories will enforce the NRL\u2019s return to training protocols, and casts doubt over whether unimmunised players will be allowed to play in Queensland. Graham, who sits on the RLPA\u2019s board of directors, said the confusion was always a risk as the game rushed to resume training. He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up. Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods. I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab. It\u2019s simple in my eyes ... It depends on how strong their convictions are on an individual level. If they want to sacrifice their rugby league game for their personal preference not to get a flu shot, that\u2019s their prerogative. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has also doubt on the chances of fans attending finals footy this year \u2013 another rubbing of salt into an already heavily seasoned wound. There are some iconic moments in Australian sport coming up in that period \u2013 the last weekend in September is dear to many of us. I must admit I am doubtful that we will be able to fill the MCG by that time, but let\u2019s see how we go on this road. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has also pleaded with Australians to resist any urges \u201cto cuddle our mums\u201d ahead of Mother\u2019s Day on Sunday. Absolutely if you are feeling sick yourself, do not go and visit your mum. Please don\u2019t. If you are feeling well and you really want to see your mum, I\u2019m sure it is fine. But for elderly mums, just be a little bit cautious and probably keep that 1.5-metre distance for now. I know it is hard and we all want to cuddle our mums on Mother\u2019s Day and a big shout out to all of the mums out there, but let\u2019s just wait a little bit longer. He also reiterated that Australians over 70 should be more cautious about rushing back into normal life as lockdowns are eased in some states. For people over the age of 70, I would just say be cautious over these next couple of weeks. Even if things are opening up and people are gathering, shops, cafes and so forth are now available. But for people over the age of 70, I would just urge caution about your own health and consider that, including having people over to your house. The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has defended the government\u2019s roadmap out of Covid-19 restrictions unveiled by Scott Morrison on Friday, as NSW and Victoria indicate they will keep current restrictions in place for the time being. This is a roadmap, we are all on the same road across Australia. It is just that different states and territories have had different starting points and they will be using that same roadmap, but at slightly different speeds. I want to really be clear there are no roadblocks in this roadmap. Kelly also revealed there are 6,929 cases in Australia as of Saturday afternoon, with the death toll at 97. There have been 16 new cases in the last 24 hours, four of which are related to the Cedar Meats cluster in Victoria. He also said the testing positivity rate is now under 1%, and said of the 900 Australians who are sick with Covid-19, 51 are currently being treated in hospital, with 19 of them in intensive care and 15 of those cases relying on ventilators. Those figures are way less than what we were having even a couple of weeks ago and this is all very good news. Kelly also said there had been \u201cextraordinarily good uptake\u201d of the CovidSafe tracing app, with 5.4 million downloads as of Friday. Over on the Guardian global live blog my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe reports that Roy Horn, of the double act Siegfried and Roy, has died after contracting Covid-19. He died in Las Vegas on Friday, aged 75. The duo\u2019s performances \u2013 in which the illusionists would ride on elephants, cavort with tigers and make animals disappear \u2013 became one of Las Vegas\u2019s biggest attractions. In 2003, Horn was left in critical condition after being mauled by an albino tiger during their stage act. He eventually recovered and was able to return to the stage. The cause of his death was complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Horn\u2019s publicist, Dave Kirvin told the New York Times. Another 10 cases of Covid-19 were reported Saturday morning in Victoria, with four linked to an outbreak at the Cedar Meats facility, AAP reports. Victoria\u2019s coronavirus tally is a 1,477, with just over 100 of those being active cases. My colleague Matilda Boseley has been covering the Cedar Meats outbreak, and you can read her latest piece here. WA records no new cases. The WA health department has released updated Covid-19 statistics, with the state\u2019s tally not rising above its previous total of 552. There are now seven active cases across the state, with just one in regional WA. Four people are being treated for Covid-19 in Perth hospitals, with one in intensive care. The state has performed 54,563 Covid-19 tests, 490 of which were conducted yesterday. So far 536 people in the state have recovered from the virus. Just to further clarify the death on Friday night of 92-year-old Fay Rendoth at Newmarch House that was announced this morning. AAP reports that NSW Health\u2019s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the infectious disease doctor looking after the Newmarch residents does not believe her death was related to Covid-19. The doctor is in the best place to understand what the illness was and the cause of death. Without going into personal details, we understand that the person had Covid, had recovered, had other illnesses and was elderly and died. He acknowledged Covid-19, like any other illness, could influence the person\u2019s stamina and ability to recover. The Guardian has sought clarification from Anglicare, the operator of Newmarch House. The 17th resident to die since the outbreak was declared at Newmarch, Rendoth\u2019s granddaughter, Savannah Robinson, believes her death was Covid-19 related. It was the confinement in her room and the by-product of Covid-19 social, physical isolation that had detrimental impacts on her health and led to her passing. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has accused the federal government of lacking an economic plan to go with its road map to lift coronavirus-related restrictions. AAP reports: \u201cWe have said there needs to be a full release of the budget outlook, something the government is ducking at this stage,\u201d Mr Albanese told reporters in Queanbeyan on Saturday, campaigning in the Eden-Monaro electorate ahead of the by-election. He said the government\u2019s promise of a \u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have economic plan\u201d. \u201cWe will be calling for the government to outline its economic plan.\u201d Albanese said there is a \u201cbig threat\u201d to the economy if people suddenly get cut off from their jobkeeper and jobseeker payments on some arbitrary date. Prime minister Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders agreed on Friday to a three-step plan to restart business and community activities. However, the states and territories are set to move through the three stages at different speeds, depending on their health situation and local conditions. Treasury says it is possible to restore 851,000 jobs in coming months if things go to plan. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said regional and interstate travel restrictions need to be lifted as soon as is practicable to breathe life back into regional and urban economies. \u201cAustralian businesses depend on operating as seamlessly as possible between states and territories, as many supply services and source goods interstate,\u201d ACCI CEO, James Pearson, said in a statement. \u201cWe recognise state and territory-specific timetables for the three-stage plan will be based on the current pandemic impact trend and will be subject to any change in health outcomes and ongoing reviews. We hope there are no significant detours or U-turns on the road to recovery. The Business Council of Australia has set up a series of expert working groups, headed by some of the country\u2019s top executives, to identify practical and achievable solutions to create jobs and boost the economy. The groups will not only look at how to restart business and industry but put in place structural reforms to drive growth and higher wages. Good afternoon, it\u2019s Elias Visontay here. Thanks to my colleague Ben Doherty for taking us through the morning. Foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has announced a government-organised evacuation flight for Australians stranded in India that will leave Delhi tonight: Our high commission in India has so far assisted over 3,500 Australians to leave, with another Qantas flight departing Delhi this evening. The government has arranged four additional Qantas flights to Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in the coming fortnight. More than 300,000 Australians and permanent residents have returned from overseas since the government recommended that people reconsider the need to travel abroad. We have facilitated the return of 16,500 of those Australians, including around 6,500 from cruise ships around the world. This has been one of the largest consular challenges Australia has dealt with. Dfat staff in Canberra and at posts abroad have been committed to providing Australians with practical solutions to return to Australia. The NSW Health department has released updated Covid-19 statistics, which are current up to 8pm on Friday. There have been five new cases recorded in NSW, bringing the state\u2019s total to 3,051. NSW has also set a new record for a single day, with 13,692 tests conducted in the previous 24 hours. The state has tested 294,949 people since the declaration of the pandemic. No new deaths have been reported in the state as of Friday evening, but this doesn\u2019t include the recent death announced at Newmarch House. However this is not so straightforward because while the resident who died did have Covid-19, it has been reported they recovered before passing away. There are now 2,504 people who have recovered from Covid-19 in NSW, while 110 cases are being treated in hospital. Eight of those people are in intensive care, with seven of them requiring ventilators. On Saturday, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard also announced a $12.7m initiative to employ final year medical students in NSW to work in hospitals across the state. If the students opt in to the program and are deemed to have the required skills, they will be supervised in roles including admitting and reviewing patients and performing procedures including taking blood. Thank you all for your company and correspondence. Ben Doherty signing off now. I\u2019m handing you over to my charming, brilliant, and incorrigibly handsome colleague Elias Visontay. Be well. Stay safe, and look after each other. The ACT government has updated its Covid-19 statistics. There have been zero new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the ACT in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is still 107. A total of 103 cases have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation. The ACT has recorded three deaths. The number of negative tests in the ACT is now 11,167. The ACT has further eased Covid-19 restrictions to support families and our economy. From today, all indoor and outdoor gatherings can have a maximum of 10 people (including children). This includes gatherings at a person\u2019s home. Many public spaces are closed across the territory, but parks, reserves and sports grounds are open. Cafes, restaurants and bars are closed for dining, but open for take-away and home delivery. \u201cWe hope that by easing the restrictions we can support the mental and physical wellbeing of Canberrans,\u201d ACT chief health officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said. \u201cWe still want families to be able to visit each other, and two households that come together resulting in a gathering of more than 10 people is allowed. However, this is not an invitation to bring together people from multiple households for parties. \u201cWe still need Canberrans to play their part to prevent a new wave of Covid-19 cases in the ACT.\u201d This is beautiful and profound. A vital piece. A 17th resident of Sydney\u2019s beleaguered Newmarch House has died overnight. 92-year-old great-grandmother Fay Rendoth died late yesterday. Rendoth, who grew up in the Blue Mountains and only recently moved to Newmarch, leaves behind three daughters, eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Her granddaughter, Savannah Robinson, said she was somewhat comforted that her grandmother would no longer be missing her husband of more than 70 years, who died five years ago. \u201cWe don\u2019t want my grandmother to be another Covid-19 statistic, there is a person and a family behind the news,\u201d she said. Rendoth tested positive to Covid-19 three weeks ago but initially showed only mild symptoms. Robinson said the physical isolation and lack of interaction had been difficult for her grandmother, who had previously been healthy for her age. \u201cIn her final days we couldn\u2019t be there by her bed, couldn\u2019t sit there and talk to her,\u201d Robinson said, thanking the staff at Newmarch House who kept her company. \u201cWe were somewhat comforted by knowing Newmarch staff went in and sang to her, read the bible to her. \u201cThe hard thing about this virus is it\u2019s so isolating.\u201d Sixty-nine people associated with Newmarch House have now tested positive for Covid-19: 32 staff and 37 residents. An independent external adviser was appointed yesterday to oversee operations at the aged care facility. In a statement, Anglicare Sydney, which runs Newmarch House has issued a statement: Tragically, a resident of Newmarch House passed away last night. The family and all relevant authorities have been contacted. We are devastated at the passing and extend our deepest sympathies to the family as they grieve the loss of their loved one. The incomparable Murpharoo. Do read. Such a fine mind. Just to dig into the \u201cCovid kills fewer people than flu\u201d argument that has been posited by some government members of parliament. This is an excellent (and very accessible) article in the Lancet comparing fatality rates of Covid-19, Sars, and influenza. The authors, led by Dimple D Rajgor from the department of paediatrics, Yong Loo Lin school of medicine at the National University of Singapore, examined the delimited situation of passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship. As articulately explained here: A unique situation has arisen for quite an accurate estimate of the case fatality rate (CFR) of Covid-19. Among individuals onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, data on the denominator are fairly robust. The outbreak of Covid-19 led passengers to be quarantined between 20 January and 29 February 2020. This scenario provided a population living in a defined territory without most other confounders, such as imported cases, defaulters of screening, or lack of testing capability. 3,711 passengers and crew were onboard, of whom 705 became sick and tested positive for Covid-19 and seven died, giving a CFR of 0\u00b799%. If the passengers onboard were generally of an older age, the CFR in a healthy, younger population could be lower. Although highly transmissible, the CFR of Covid-19 appears to be lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (34.4%), but higher than that of influenza (0.1%). So, acknowledging the careful caveat in those figures, Covid-19 has a case fatality rate ten times that of seasonal flu. * An addendum to this post, following some (constructive and supremely helpful) correspondence with readers, and further research into the Covid-19 outbreak on board the Diamond Princess. Since the publication of the Lancet piece quoted above, there have been more deaths of former Diamond Princess passengers from Covid-19. The case fatality rate of 0.99% was calculated on seven deaths from 712 cases. That total has since risen to 13 deaths. The CFR, based on those 13 deaths, is 1.83%. Fifty-four cases are still active, with four are classed as serious/critical. Not the best strapline for a movie to be honest. Greg Hunt, federal health minister, has spoken to the media (well, perhaps a medium, it appeared there was only one journalist at his press conference). We have a clear three-step roadmap and plan for Australia. This has been adopted and embraced by all of the states and territories and, to just give an update, what we see is that in seven of the eight states and territories they have already indicated their date and commenced with particular steps. The last state will start on Monday with their steps. In New South Wales, family visits are allowed. In the ACT there have already commenced hospitality. Northern Territory, hospitality changes. In WA, travel within state, a schools plan, playgrounds. In Tasmania, a clear timetable has been set out. In South Australia, outdoor dining and regional tourism. In Queensland, a timetable for all three steps along that plan and in Victoria, commencing on Monday, they begin with outlining the steps. So one country, one direction, different speeds, but all heading towards the common goal of keeping Australians safe but getting Australians back to work. Hunt was invited to join the federal government pile-on onto Victorian Labor premier Dan Andrews, but sidestepped said invitation with balletic grace. \u201cI respectfully, wouldn\u2019t categorise it that way,\u201d he said of Tim Wilson\u2019s comments (see earlier posts) this morning. More federal government backbench MPs critical of Victorian premier Dan Andrews. This on Friday from Katie Allen, member for Higgins. (Argument somewhat undermined by using \u201cless\u201d when it clearly should be \u201cfewer\u201d. Don\u2019t @ me with \u201ccommon usage\u201d. It\u2019s wrong.) A caravan-led recovery in South Australia. Steven Marshall, the SA premier has praised the citizens of that state for their adherence to social distancing measures. Yesterday, of course, we announced our road map back to a Covid-safe environment in Australia.I think it was very well received by the people of Australia. They have been asking for some certainty. They have been asking for hope. And what they received yesterday from the prime minister is a three-stage process on our way back to a Covid-safe environment. And we\u2019ve all agreed, as members of the national cabinet, that we will get back to a Covid-safe environment in July of this year. And he has made this declaration: Today we\u2019re announcing that caravans and camping will be available as of Monday next week. We\u2019ll be the only jurisdiction in the entire country which will have this eased restrictions. We want people to get out and explore our fabulous regions in South Australia, but we also want people to get out from the country to come down to Adelaide. We\u2019ve got lots and lots of caravan parks in metropolitan Adelaide, so they are going to be open. The country caravan parks are going to be open. Our national parks are going to be open for camping again. And we want people to get out and explore our regions, our fabulous regions. Speaking of events overseas. Donald Trump has named the White House staffer who has tested positive to Covid-19 as vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary Katie Miller. The story is here: My colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe in Bangkok is running a global coronavirus live-blog. There you will find all of our international updates. Much happening around the world. From our friends at AAP: There have been only 11 new cases of Covid-19 this week and restrictions will be eased for Queenslanders from Mother\u2019s Day, with the reopening of the state\u2019s restaurants, libraries, pools and beauty salons to follow a week later. \u201cWe now have just 20 active cases of Covid-19 in Queensland. Just 20. A figure that was unimaginable only five or six weeks ago,\u201d said the state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles. \u201cNine of those cases are currently in hospital. Three of them are in intensive care. \u201cOf course, all of those figures support the decisions that we\u2019ve been making to ease restrictions.\u201d Up to five people from the same home will be allowed to visit another household from tomorrow. From next Saturday, personal training sessions, retail shopping, weddings with up to 10 people, and funerals of up to 20 inside or 30 outside, will be allowed. Restaurants, libraries, pools and beauty salons can also reopen. Open home inspections and auctions will be allowed to go ahead. Bars and gaming facilities will remain closed, but up to 10 people at a time will be allowed to dine in at restaurants, pubs, licensed clubs, RSL clubs and hotels. Recreational travel for day trips up to 150km from home will be allowed. In the outback, where there have been no Covid-19 cases, locals can travel up to 500km from home and up to 20 will be allowed to dine in at outback pubs and cafes. Birdsville Hotel general manager Ben Fullagar said the announcement was great news for the tiny border town, known for its annual racing carnival. \u201cEveryone has done really well social distancing and staying clear of each other \u2026 It will be nice for them to come in and catch up in the dining room and enjoy a meal and a cold drink.\u201d Further restrictions will be eased next month. \u201cAll things going well, from June school holidays, Queenslanders will be able to drive and stay at accommodation for the first time since the pandemic hit,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Friday. The announcement has been welcomed by the tourism sector. \u201cThe only thing that will save us is to get businesses back to work,\u201d Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said. Federal member for Goldstein Tim Wilson has had some strong words for Victorian premier Dan Andrews that have not gone unnoticed. (Cognisant that last week the federal education minister Dan Tehan similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise). I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member Josh Wilson (the member for Fremantle, no relation (at least I don\u2019t think so!) about different states easing restrictions at different times. Tim Wilson: I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it. I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him, and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back. So, people will have their own opinions. Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the Herald Sun as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to. I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing. But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201cBecause I think.\u201d Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW. Andrews said on Thursday: Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business. And yesterday: I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to. These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently. Many of us are making all sorts of different changes in our lives. More than 120 asylum seekers and refugees are being held in the Kangaroo Point Central Hotel in inner-city Brisbane. They are forced to live in close proximity to each other, sharing rooms for sleeping as well as communal spaces for eating and recreation. They are not allowed out, but are exposed to security guards and other workers coming in and out of their confined space. A steadily building protest movement is urging the government to release people into the community \u2013 a significant number have families living in Australia, other friends \u2013 where they could more easily practice social distancing. The Australian government\u2019s health department has warned that people held in detention are at greater risk of contracting Covid-19, and at greater risk of having serious illness from it. On Friday, supporters who came to protest the ongoing detention of asylum seekers and refugees, by having picnics and by exercising along the footpath next to the hotel, were fined by police \u2013 at least six were fined $1,334 Guardian Australia understands \u2013 while others were told by officers to move on. Some people laid down rugs on the edge of the footpath to have a picnic \u2013 legal in Queensland as long as social distancing is observed \u2013 but were forced to move on. Refugees and asylum seekers protesting on the balconies of the hotel unfurled a two-storey banner from the hotel\u2019s balcony reading \u201cno crime, 7 years in detention\u201d while police officers issued fines and move-on orders. Farhad is a refugee currently held inside the hotel: For the past seven years our dreams were taken from us, we were exiled to manus island, we were tortured mentally and we lost some of our friends at Manus. Last year some of us were taken here, thinking it was the end of the torture. Now we are locked up here in this situation, especially at this crazy time and it seems that no one in power that can make decisions about our future have any interest in taking action. All of you are going through a tough time, somewhat locked up and I\u2019m so sorry for that, hopefully now some Australians can begin to understand what we have gone through for the past seven years. What we are asking for in this moment, is to forget about the political game that you [in government] have put us in. This is a dangerous situation, why are you not letting us be amongst those that care about us? (A democracy hey? Lucky that robotic dog from Singapore wasn\u2019t around.) The NT is open for business. I love the NT News. A newspaper that knows its audience so well (and knows they will love the phrase \u2018peasant Southerners\u2019). New Zealand\u2019s cabinet will meet on Monday to decide that country\u2019s roadmap out of lockdown \u2013 but it will be too late for mums to be visited on Mother\u2019s Day. From AAP in NZ: Hugs and visits to mums across New Zealand have been banned this Mother\u2019s Day by prime minister Jacinda Ardern, seeking a final push from Kiwis to end the country\u2019s lockdown. Sunday could be the final day of New Zealand\u2019s tough but effective lockdown, credited as one part of a world-leading response to the spread of Covid-19. On Monday, Ardern\u2019s government will plot a path back to something close to normality, meeting to decide a timetable for the removal of the social and business restrictions. The prime minister has already outlined what level two restrictions will look like, including the reopening of restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, cinemas and public facilities like museums and libraries. Social restrictions could end immediately, with provisions for schools, business and personal movement more likely to be phased in. Any decision will come too late for mums to enjoy visits from sons and daughters not already in their household bubbles. Ardern has banned socialising outside of existing households, with few exceptions, and told Kiwis this week to \u201cstick to the plan\u201d before Monday\u2019s review. \u201cI know it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day this weekend and the urge to reach out will be strong,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we remain at level three. And so if your mum is not in your bubble, then reach out over the phone or video. \u201cSend a wee local present, and make plans to catch up when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d New Zealand has recorded just five new cases in the past five days. While the bubble restrictions will be removed when New Zealand makes the jump, a ban on gatherings over 100 people will be retained. \u201cWe are still requiring people to play it safe,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThat means not having large gatherings, cramming people into your home, and dispensing of all of the advice we\u2019ve had over this period of time. \u201cYes, do catch up with your family, do catch up with your friends, but large gatherings are still a no-no.\u201d This is not Covid-19 related, but this story broke late last night, and it is outrageous. (Five police watchdog reports were dropped on a Friday afternoon \u2013 amazing how often that happens with bad news). A New South Wales police watchdog investigation into seven strip searches including one in which a 16-year-old Aboriginal boy was physically forced to remove his shorts and squat has found that all of them were unlawful. Every search the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission examined was deemed unlawful and the commission repeated what has been previously revealed in hearings: many police don\u2019t understand the law with regards to search powers. But no disciplinary action was recorded against any officer. My colleague Michael McGowan has been following this story. Deep recessions have long shadows, Wayne Swan writes today. After the initial stimulus of 2008 and 2009 most advanced countries too quickly flicked the switch to austerity and then experienced half-a-dozen years of high and prolonged unemployment. Exhibits A and B are the US and Great Britain. I have to say I find this, from a Singapore park, discomfiting. My question is: okay, the four-legged zoomorphised robot mounted with cameras and security sensors is monitoring social distancing today, what\u2019s it going to be monitoring tomorrow? The robot\u2019s name is Spot, by the way. How do others feel about this? The Straits Times has the story. It\u2019s a Saturday in Australia, so we must go \u201caround the grounds\u201d. There have been significant developments overseas in the global effort to combat Covid-19. Grateful thanks to my colleague Molly Blackall who compiled this excellent global summary. (The story out of Italy is pretty extraordinary ...) US unemployment reaches record heights More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April, more than trebling the unemployment rate. The pandemic has triggered a financial crisis in the US unseen since the Great Depression. Hong Kong eases physical distancing measures Hong Kong has begun to relax physical distancing measures, with bars, gyms, cinemas and beauty parlours opening today. Denmark to relax lockdown Denmark will reopen museums, theatres, cinemas, zoos and outdoor amusement parks on 8 June, the country\u2019s government has announced. \u2018Significant changes to lifestyle\u2019 until vaccine found, WHO warns People may have to live with a significant change to their lifestyles until a vaccine for coronavirus has been found, Dr Michael Ryan has warned at today\u2019s World Health Organization briefing. He said that the WHO\u2019s examination of global lockdown measures and their easing shows that a \u201ccareful and measured return of those kind of normal activities of work and school \u2013 especially when they are done with density reduction\u201d seems to be effective, but mass gatherings are much more difficult. South Africa to release 20,000 prisoners Almost 20,000 prisoners will be released in attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus in South African prisons. The president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said the low-risk inmates would be freed. Italian opposition file motion of no-confidence against justice minister Opposition parties in Italy have filed a motion of no confidence in the justice minister, Alfonso Bonafede, who was criticised for releasing 376 top mafiosi because of the risk of coronavirus infection. Israel\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases drop below 500 The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Israel has dropped below 500 for the first time since a strict eight-week lockdown was imposed. In recent days, the country has recorded fewer than 50 new cases a day. South Korea fears anti-gay backlash Fears of a homophobic backlash in South Korea are mounting after a man infected with coronavirus was reported to have visited clubs in Seoul\u2019s gay district. The 31-year-old tested positive for the virus on Thursday, and by Friday, 14 of his contacts were also confirmed to have contracted the disease. Good morning beloved readers, I hope these missives find you well. Ben Doherty at Guardian HQ (this morning, the quietest room in my noisy, noisy house). I\u2019ll be with you this morning. Friday was a signal day in Australia\u2019s fight against Sars-Cov-2. The federal and state governments outlined a three-stage roadmap to recovery. Restrictions will be lifted in phases, over four-week blocks, with the final phase likely to be implemented by July. But different states will move at different times with some, at the moment notably the Northern Territory and Western Australia, significantly ahead of eastern seaboard states, NSW and Victoria in particular. The decision when to move on easing restrictions rests with state premiers and territory chief ministers. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the plan would get 850,000 people back to work when fully implemented. \u201cYou can stay under the doona forever and you\u2019ll never face any danger. But we\u2019ve got to get out from under the doona at some time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf not now, well, then when?\u201d Victorian premier DanAndrews will not lift any restrictions until at least Monday, refusing to apologise for his hardline approach. \u201cThis is a pandemic, this is not a popularity contest,\u201d he said. NSW is also cautious, holding off on any announcements, while NT, WA and SA have moved to adopt many of the stage one measures from the national cabinet guidelines. From this morning, gatherings of up to ten people are allowed in the ACT, Queensland and in South Australia. Tasmania is easing restrictions gradually from next week, but Queensland is moving more rapidly to allow dining in pubs and clubs for 10 people at a time from May 16. Queensland has also lifted restrictions around households visiting others - in time for Mothers\u2019 Day \u2013 with up to five people from a single household visiting another household. There have been 6,900 confirmed cases in Australia, 97 people have died. Daily infection rates remain low and there are fewer than 1,000 active cases. Chief medical officer Dr Brendan Murphy is urging people to maintain physical distancing and good hygiene to stop further outbreaks. \u201cPlease, keep that distancing. We could lose the battle that we have won so well so far,\u201d he said. Please be in touch throughout the day, @BenDohertyCorro on twitter. I\u2019ll endeavour to keep you updated on developments, here and abroad. Be well, enjoy your weekends, but stay safe.",

      "bodyText": "A 14-day quarantine period for all travellers coming to Britain would have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry and wider economy, a trade body has said. The government is expected to announce the quarantine on Sunday as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson is set to address the nation and present his roadmap out of the lockdown, and will announce the introduction of quarantine measures for people who arrive at airports, ports and Eurostar railway stations, including for Britons returning from abroad. People will be asked to provide the address at which they will self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival by filling out a digital form, according to a report in the Times. Airlines UK said it had been told by government officials that the plan would be in place by the end of the month or early June. A spokesman for the trade body said: \u201cWe will be asking for assurances that this decision has been led by the science and that government has a credible exit plan, with weekly reviews to ensure the restrictions are working and still required.\u201d Karen Dee, the chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, said she had not received any details but said it would \u201cnot only have a devastating impact on the UK aviation industry, but also on the wider economy\u201d. Quarantine should be applied selectively following the science if it was medically necessary to do so, Dee said. \u201cThere should be a clear exit strategy and the economic impact on key sectors should be mitigated,\u201d she said. \u201cIf quarantine is a necessary tool for fighting Covid-19, then the government should act decisively to protect the hundreds of thousands of airport-related and travel-related jobs across the UK. These measures should include granting immediate business rates relief to airports and related service providers as well as relief from Civil Aviation Authority charges for the whole aviation sector.\u201d Travellers from the Channel Islands, Ireland and the Isle of Man will be exempt and it is understood key workers and lorry drivers bringing in goods would also be exempt from the requirements. The Times reports that despite concerns that the UK was continuing to allow people to fly in as the death rate soared last month, ministers insisted that introducing a quarantine system would not have made a difference, because of the prevalence of the disease in the country. Visitors to Britain and those returning home have so far been able to arrive without a temperature check or the requirement to self-isolate. Figures released to Labour MP Stephen Doughty showed that fewer than 300 people arriving in the UK were quarantined in the run-up to coronavirus lockdown on 23 March. The Home Office figures showed that just 273 of about 18.1 million arrivals had to spend time in isolation in the first three months of the year, including passengers on three planes from Wuhan, the centre of the initial outbreak in China. Lisa Nandy said she had been asking ministers to clarify government policy on quarantines for weeks, saying she had raised it five times before the leak. The shadow foreign secretary said large numbers of people had returned to the UK, or were still stranded with no information about how they should behave to keep their families safe on their return. \u201cThe wider public are really worried about it, and for weeks we\u2019ve had mixed messages being briefed out of government,\u201d she said. She told BBC Breakfast that her office was in touch with about 3,000 people still stranded abroad, many of whom had concerns about travelling to the airport. She gave the example of people trapped in Spain who were travelling on coaches to crowded airports without social distancing measures. \u201cThen, of course, there\u2019s no testing facilities when they arrived back into the UK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get much, much quicker at this or we\u2019re going to see a resurgence in cases.\u201d The BBC reported on Friday night that aviation minister Kelly Tolhurst is expected to discuss the proposals with airline and airport representatives in a conference call on Saturday morning. The idea of a quarantine has been mooted for some time, and transport secretary Grant Shapps has hinted at such a measure once the infection rate within the country is under control so the government is sure that the illness is not being imported. Shapps told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: \u201cI think it is important that as we are seeing the numbers decrease and the R rate we hope decrease \u2026 that we do ensure that the sacrifices in a sense \u2013 social distancing \u2013 that we are asking the British people to make are matched by anybody who comes to this country. \u201cI am actively looking at these issues right now so that when we have infection rates within the country under control we are not importing.\u201d However, questions will be raised as to why this measure was not introduced sooner, and what the scientific reasoning is for it to be introduced at this point in the government\u2019s response. Other countries, including Australia and New Zealand, ordered 14-day isolation periods for visitors as early as March.",

      "bodyText": "Couples who have been unable to get married because of the coronavirus lockdown have had their wedding insurance claims rejected \u2013 in some cases despite being assured they were covered before buying their policy. The Guardian has heard from people who have lost thousands when claims were turned down by provider WeddingPlan Insurance. Lidia and her partner Adam were due to get married on 4 April, after the lockdown had begun. They became concerned that their plans would be affected in early March and looked for insurance that would offer cover against cancellation due to coronavirus. After checking with WeddingPlan that they would qualify, they bought a \u00a357 policy and made payments to caterers and other suppliers. \u201cOn 21 March the venue told us they would not be able to hold our wedding because they couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of staff,\u201d Lidia says. \u201cThen on 23 March came lockdown, and everything was officially shut down.\u201d They asked about a new date next summer, but the price will be much higher. The caterers said they had prepared most of the food and they will not survive if they give a refund. The couple, who marked their planned wedding day with drinks in the garden and a Zoom call with friends and family, made a claim for just under \u00a310,000 to cover costs they cannot recover. Emails seen by Guardian Money show they were told they could make a claim if the wedding had to be cancelled as a result of an infectious disease. \u201cThe rejection says they won\u2019t pay out because the venue was closed as a result of a government act,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the cancellation was made before the legislation went through.\u201d Others have had their claims turned down. Debenhams wedding insurance customers appear to be in the same position, as both brands are operated by UK General. Many bought their policies last year but others paid on the basis that they would get coronavirus cover. The competition watchdog has warned venues over refusing refunds, but some of those claiming have been told that expenses already accrued cannot be reimbursed. Screengrabs suggest WeddingPlan changed its advice. In an FAQ section on its website in late March, it said: \u201cIf the government or relevant body cancels all public gatherings due to coronavirus, would the cancellation or postponement of my wedding be covered?\u201d.

It adds: \u201cWe acknowledge that our customers expect to be able to make a claim on their wedding insurance policy as a result of having to postpone their wedding, and when their claim is turned down it is extremely upsetting ...

What does the law say about demands to pay? Couples who put down deposits for weddings that have had to be cancelled due to the lockdown have faced aggressive demands from venues to pay their final bills \u2013 which can easily be \u00a312,000-\u00a317,000 \u2013 for a wedding that can no longer take place. Faced with such a demand what should you? James Cronin, a director at the Cheltenham law firm Eight Legal, advises couples against handing over any more money. Instead, he says, they may want to argue that the original contract to provide the wedding venue has been frustrated. \u201cIf a contract exists for a wedding or holiday which is now impossible to perform in a way that resembled the original terms agreed between the parties in any meaningful way, a letter arguing that the contract has been frustrated and referring to the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 may well help,\u201d he says. \u201cFrustration applies when an unforeseeable event would make it impossible to perform the contract at all or on terms which bore any real commercial resemblance to those agreed between the parties.

It looks as if it\u2019s a lovely day: the sun is shining, the shadows dark, the sky blue. But this is not a happy picture. Is the casualty even alive, or has he already been taken by the killer virus that has wrapped itself around our planet like a python, squeezing the life from it?</p> <p>The photograph was taken at an ambulance station in Washington DC. Within the past couple of months? It could have been, if it weren\u2019t for the uniforms (I don\u2019t think today\u2019s nurses wear lace-up leather boots) and the stretcher. In fact, it was taken more than a century ago, in 1918, during the Spanish flu epidemic, which killed so many millions. The photographer is unknown, forgotten. But the black and white picture was recently \u201ccolourised\u201d by <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/\" title=\"\">Marina Amaral</a>.</p> <p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s really crazy,\u201d she says, from her home in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, about that picture\u2019s sudden and frightening present-day resonance. \u201cWe had no idea when we were working on this photo and selecting it for the book.\u201d The World Aflame, Amaral\u2019s second book with the British historian <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/danjoneshistorian/\" title=\"\">Dan Jones</a>, breathes new life into the story of global conflict, from the run-up to the first world war to the end of the second.

And she colours them, digitally.</p> <p>We\u2019ll come back to the process. But first, while we\u2019re talking about modern-day resonance, Amaral says the recent rise of populism and the far right in many countries (not least her own) is part of what motivates her work. The warning signs are there, she says. \u201cYou read some of the things people were saying then, and you can find people saying the exact same thing today.\u201d</p> <p>In her homeland, run by far-right president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/jair-bolsonaro\" title=\"\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, the then culture minister Roberto Alvim recently borrowed heavily from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda during the second world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/brazil-culture-minister-goebbels-roberto-alvim-nazi\" title=\"\">in a speech</a>: \u201cBrazilian art in the next decade will be heroic and national, he said, as Wagner played in the background (he was later sacked).</p> <p>\u201cThings like that motivate me to keep doing my job,\u201d Amaral says. \u201cIt\u2019s why I believe in the value and importance of colourising photos.

Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as media \u201chysteria\u201d and a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d, shunned social distancing, and even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/jair-bolsonaro-dictatorship-rally-protest-brazil-president-denounced\" title=\"\">joined his supporters in anti-lockdown protests</a>. \u201cI think he will commit mistakes that will cost the lives of many people,\u201d Amaral says. When we speak, her grandmother isn\u2019t well; they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s virus-related, but she\u2019s worried. \u201cI\u2019m scared, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The story of how Marina Amaral came to colour in the past is a very 21st century one. When she was 12, she had a blog and wanted to add some graphics. She didn\u2019t know how, nor did she know anyone who could help. So, using YouTube tutorials, she taught herself to use Photoshop, which she has been exploring ever since.</p> <p>A degree in international relations was abandoned; it didn\u2019t excite her. But her mother is a historian and Amaral has always been fascinated by the past. After stumbling across an online collection of colourised photographs of the second world war, she decided to have a go herself. Sourcing pictures from free image libraries, she developed her own Photoshop techniques and published the results on Facebook and Twitter, where she soon gained large followings. That\u2019s where Dan Jones came across her. The historian saw what she had done to a <a href=\"https://marinamaral.com/portfolio/lewis-powell/\" title=\"\">photograph of Lewis Powell</a>, one of the men executed in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his vice-president and the secretary of state (Amaral transformed Powell from a nondescript 19th-century Confederate soldier into a smouldering James Dean). Jones got in touch, the rest is\u2026 well, you know what. In colour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517b3116eb422f12d8c17aba7f9664d99196797e/0_0_4064_3272/1000.jpg\" alt=\"American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"805\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert F Sargent/Getty images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.

Historical research is the most important part of the process. \u201cBefore I sit down and start colourising a photo, I will analyse it deeply, often with the help of historians and experts, gathering as much detail and information as possible and cross-referencing it all with visual and written descriptions of the time. I have to dig to find pieces of a puzzle and fill in the gaps.\u201d</p> <p>The process can be time-consuming, depending on the number of details and the complexity of the image. \u201cI will spend hours, days or weeks working on a single photo. There are some that do not work in colour for various reasons \u2013 maybe the original was damaged, or it just doesn\u2019t look right \u2013 so then we have to discard it and start again. It\u2019s important to have an artistic eye, otherwise the photograph will not look real.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, the result looks less like a picture taken in the last couple of months and more like one painted centuries ago. Her colourised photograph of the Russian dancer <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ida-Rubinstein\" title=\"\">Ida Rubinstein</a> volunteering as a nurse in Paris at the start of the first world war, has something of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/29/jan-van-eyck-arnolfini-portrait-make-art-come-alive\" title=\"\">Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait</a> about it.</p> <p>The most powerful of the 200 photographs in the book are not the loudest ones: the action, horror, the famous and infamous faces. I\u2019m not sure what it adds to know that the hole in Mussolini\u2019s head leaked what looks like pink blancmange on to the body of his girlfriend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Petacci\" title=\"\">Claretta Petacci</a>. Robert F Sargent\u2019s famous D-day photograph, <a href=\"https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/exhibitions/artifact/jaws-death-photograph-d-day-normandy-landing-robert-f-sargent-june-6-1944\" title=\"\">Into The Jaws Of Death</a>, of American soldiers disembarking on Omaha beach, is powerful in colour \u2013 but no more so than it is in black and white. More startling is another landing craft photo, of US troops in Operation Torch, the 1942 invasion of North Africa, because this one was taken <a href=\"http://ww2today.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Torch-landing-craft.jpg\" title=\"\">into the faces of the soldiers</a>. One face in particular: a blue-eyed boy who looks about 15, stares into the camera. Is that fear? What happened to him, you wonder? What was his name?</p> <p>For me, Amaral\u2019s colourisation process is most moving when applied to pictures of children. The addition of eye colour, skin tone, freckles \u2013 suddenly, they look like children you might know. And children, especially, relate to her colourised pictures because they are witnessing a reality that is more similar to their own, she says. Amaral\u2019s day is made when teachers email to say her work has helped their history classes, or engaged their students more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c5ba44c5f4ad3c15f0570882da3530560840f005/0_0_2958_1359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s very powerful in black and white\u2019: 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Auschwitz Memorial and Museum</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21e8bf216042f99e3ad85aeeeff1390b4b00cde9/0_0_2741_1193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A triple head shot of 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, photographed at Auschwitz: black and white image coloured by artist Marina Amaral\" width=\"1000\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Czeslawa Kwoka, 14, photographed at Auschwitz.

He is surrounded by a group of adoring boys. They are mostly very fair, and one is wearing lederhosen; otherwise, they could be the scout group that meets down the road. They are all members of the Hitler Youth.</p> <p>But the most haunting picture shows another child, 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/27/the-holocaust-is-not-your-metaphor-to-use-in-modern-political-debates\" title=\"\">Czeslawa Kwoka</a>, who was murdered at Auschwitz. It was, Amaral says, one of the most difficult pictures she\u2019s worked on. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful in black and white, but in colour you can see that her lips are bleeding. She had just been beaten by a guard. You can really see the fear in her eyes, but you can also feel her courage. Colour allows us to understand the reality in a much deeper sense.\u201d</p> <p>The photograph of Czeslawa Kwoka is also part of a special project Amaral is involved in, <a href=\"https://facesofauschwitz.com/\" title=\"\">Faces Of Auschwitz</a>, a collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, for which she is colourising registration photographs from the museum\u2019s archive. It\u2019s the hardest work she has done, she says: \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also necessary. They send me the pictures but also the documents, so I have to spend hours looking at their faces, knowing that, after the photo was taken, they were murdered. I need to have that feeling, otherwise I will be transformed into a machine and the whole purpose will be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Amaral knows that colourisation isn\u2019t for everyone. Some see it as ersatz or interfering, even sacrilege. But it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing one or the other, she says. \u201cMy intention is not to replace the original, but to give people the opportunity to see history from a different perspective.\u201d Also to see it more as the photographer saw it, and the way it actually was. The photographer might not have had the choice, or the technology, to take a picture in colour. But looking through the viewfinder, that\u2019s what they saw; the past \u2013 even its grimmest, darkest hours \u2013 was not in black and white.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://headofzeus.com/books/9781789542028\" title=\"\">The World Aflame</a>, by Marina Amaral and Dan Jones, is published by Head of Zeus on 14 May at \u00a325.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020.

      "bodyText": "On a stretcher lies a patient; his ashen face protrudes from under a green blanket, eyes closed. Two uniformed women carry the stretcher, wearing face masks. It looks as if it\u2019s a lovely day: the sun is shining, the shadows dark, the sky blue. But this is not a happy picture. Is the casualty even alive, or has he already been taken by the killer virus that has wrapped itself around our planet like a python, squeezing the life from it? The photograph was taken at an ambulance station in Washington DC. Within the past couple of months? It could have been, if it weren\u2019t for the uniforms (I don\u2019t think today\u2019s nurses wear lace-up leather boots) and the stretcher. In fact, it was taken more than a century ago, in 1918, during the Spanish flu epidemic, which killed so many millions. The photographer is unknown, forgotten. But the black and white picture was recently \u201ccolourised\u201d by Marina Amaral. \u201cYes, it\u2019s really crazy,\u201d she says, from her home in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, about that picture\u2019s sudden and frightening present-day resonance. \u201cWe had no idea when we were working on this photo and selecting it for the book.\u201d The World Aflame, Amaral\u2019s second book with the British historian Dan Jones, breathes new life into the story of global conflict, from the run-up to the first world war to the end of the second. It follows the same arc as their previous collaboration \u2013 The Colour Of Time, a history of the world from 1850 to 1960 \u2013 but this time more closely focused, zoomed in on war. Jones is on words; Amaral does the pictures. In 1918, in Washington DC, nurses carry a Spanish flu patient.

Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images Winston Churchill as a young man. Photograph: Hulton Deutsch/Corbis via Getty Images American Confederate soldier Lewis Powell. Photograph: Library of Congress She starts by sourcing black and white photos: George V on horseback; the young Winston Churchill, fresh-faced and confident; momentous events \u2013 life in the trenches, the Christmas truce; suffrage and suffering; the Great Depression, famine, fascism, Hitler and Mussolini; more war, genocide and destruction, the atom bomb, liberation; a little bit of love as well. And she colours them, digitally. We\u2019ll come back to the process. But first, while we\u2019re talking about modern-day resonance, Amaral says the recent rise of populism and the far right in many countries (not least her own) is part of what motivates her work. The warning signs are there, she says. \u201cYou read some of the things people were saying then, and you can find people saying the exact same thing today.\u201d In her homeland, run by far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, the then culture minister Roberto Alvim recently borrowed heavily from Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister for propaganda during the second world war, in a speech: \u201cBrazilian art in the next decade will be heroic and national, he said, as Wagner played in the background (he was later sacked). \u201cThings like that motivate me to keep doing my job,\u201d Amaral says. \u201cIt\u2019s why I believe in the value and importance of colourising photos. Only when people really understand what happened, and why, will they be able to do something, to not let those moments or those radical people rise again and transform the world into something ugly and unbearable.\u201d 5th London Rifle Brigade soldiers with German Saxon regimental troops during the Christmas truce in 1914.

Photograph: Brooke/Getty Images Amaral, who is 26 and lives with her mother and grandmother, is unimpressed with the way the populist Brazilian president is dealing with the sequel to Spanish flu. Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as media \u201chysteria\u201d and a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d, shunned social distancing, and even joined his supporters in anti-lockdown protests. \u201cI think he will commit mistakes that will cost the lives of many people,\u201d Amaral says. When we speak, her grandmother isn\u2019t well; they don\u2019t know if it\u2019s virus-related, but she\u2019s worried. \u201cI\u2019m scared, to be honest.\u201d *** The story of how Marina Amaral came to colour in the past is a very 21st century one. When she was 12, she had a blog and wanted to add some graphics. She didn\u2019t know how, nor did she know anyone who could help. So, using YouTube tutorials, she taught herself to use Photoshop, which she has been exploring ever since. A degree in international relations was abandoned; it didn\u2019t excite her. But her mother is a historian and Amaral has always been fascinated by the past. After stumbling across an online collection of colourised photographs of the second world war, she decided to have a go herself. Sourcing pictures from free image libraries, she developed her own Photoshop techniques and published the results on Facebook and Twitter, where she soon gained large followings. That\u2019s where Dan Jones came across her. The historian saw what she had done to a photograph of Lewis Powell, one of the men executed in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln, his vice-president and the secretary of state (Amaral transformed Powell from a nondescript 19th-century Confederate soldier into a smouldering James Dean). Jones got in touch, the rest is\u2026 well, you know what. In colour. American soldiers disembark on Omaha beach in Normandy on D-day, June 1944.

Photograph: Branger/Roger Viollet/Getty Images American troops take part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, November 1942. Photograph: Imperial War Museums/Getty Images But is it art? \u201cI think so,\u201d Amaral says. Historical research is the most important part of the process. \u201cBefore I sit down and start colourising a photo, I will analyse it deeply, often with the help of historians and experts, gathering as much detail and information as possible and cross-referencing it all with visual and written descriptions of the time. I have to dig to find pieces of a puzzle and fill in the gaps.\u201d The process can be time-consuming, depending on the number of details and the complexity of the image. \u201cI will spend hours, days or weeks working on a single photo. There are some that do not work in colour for various reasons \u2013 maybe the original was damaged, or it just doesn\u2019t look right \u2013 so then we have to discard it and start again. It\u2019s important to have an artistic eye, otherwise the photograph will not look real.\u201d Sometimes, the result looks less like a picture taken in the last couple of months and more like one painted centuries ago. Her colourised photograph of the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein volunteering as a nurse in Paris at the start of the first world war, has something of Van Eyck\u2019s Arnolfini Portrait about it. The most powerful of the 200 photographs in the book are not the loudest ones: the action, horror, the famous and infamous faces. I\u2019m not sure what it adds to know that the hole in Mussolini\u2019s head leaked what looks like pink blancmange on to the body of his girlfriend, Claretta Petacci. Robert F Sargent\u2019s famous D-day photograph, Into The Jaws Of Death, of American soldiers disembarking on Omaha beach, is powerful in colour \u2013 but no more so than it is in black and white. More startling is another landing craft photo, of US troops in Operation Torch, the 1942 invasion of North Africa, because this one was taken into the faces of the soldiers. One face in particular: a blue-eyed boy who looks about 15, stares into the camera. Is that fear? What happened to him, you wonder? What was his name? For me, Amaral\u2019s colourisation process is most moving when applied to pictures of children. The addition of eye colour, skin tone, freckles \u2013 suddenly, they look like children you might know. And children, especially, relate to her colourised pictures because they are witnessing a reality that is more similar to their own, she says. Amaral\u2019s day is made when teachers email to say her work has helped their history classes, or engaged their students more. Czeslawa Kwoka, 14, photographed at Auschwitz. \u2018It\u2019s very powerful in black and white,\u2019 Amaral says, \u2018but in colour you can see her lips are bleeding.\u2019 Photograph: \u00a9 Auschwitz Memorial and Museum Of six pictures of Adolf Hitler in the book, the one that stays with me is one taken at the Berghof, his holiday retreat in the Bavarian Alps. He is surrounded by a group of adoring boys. They are mostly very fair, and one is wearing lederhosen; otherwise, they could be the scout group that meets down the road. They are all members of the Hitler Youth. But the most haunting picture shows another child, 14-year-old Czeslawa Kwoka, who was murdered at Auschwitz. It was, Amaral says, one of the most difficult pictures she\u2019s worked on. \u201cIt\u2019s very powerful in black and white, but in colour you can see that her lips are bleeding. She had just been beaten by a guard. You can really see the fear in her eyes, but you can also feel her courage. Colour allows us to understand the reality in a much deeper sense.\u201d The photograph of Czeslawa Kwoka is also part of a special project Amaral is involved in, Faces Of Auschwitz, a collaboration with the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, for which she is colourising registration photographs from the museum\u2019s archive. It\u2019s the hardest work she has done, she says: \u201cBut I think it\u2019s also necessary. They send me the pictures but also the documents, so I have to spend hours looking at their faces, knowing that, after the photo was taken, they were murdered. I need to have that feeling, otherwise I will be transformed into a machine and the whole purpose will be lost.\u201d Amaral knows that colourisation isn\u2019t for everyone. Some see it as ersatz or interfering, even sacrilege. But it isn\u2019t a matter of choosing one or the other, she says. \u201cMy intention is not to replace the original, but to give people the opportunity to see history from a different perspective.\u201d Also to see it more as the photographer saw it, and the way it actually was. The photographer might not have had the choice, or the technology, to take a picture in colour. But looking through the viewfinder, that\u2019s what they saw; the past \u2013 even its grimmest, darkest hours \u2013 was not in black and white. \u2022 The World Aflame, by Marina Amaral and Dan Jones, is published by Head of Zeus on 14 May at \u00a325. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 May 2020.

The youngest teenagers showed the highest rates of anxiety, while older groups showed lower levels of overall wellbeing. Those who were more anxious were more likely to comply with physical distancing measures, whereas those with higher levels of depression were more likely to break the rules. People aged between 13-24 whose parents are key workers demonstrated significantly higher levels of Covid-19-related anxiety and trauma and worse overall wellbeing. Levels of anxiety and depression were up to 10% higher among black and mixed race participants in the survey than white and Asian respondents. The research team called on the government to do more to explain the reasons for ongoing physical distancing to persuade young men in particular to follow the rules as the lockdown begins to be eased. \u201cIt is really striking how much older male adolescents stand out in terms of violating physical distancing rules,\u201d Levita said. \u201cThis is consistent with what we know about their greater tendency to take risks, and reflects their belief that following the guidelines isn\u2019t worthwhile. \u201cExplaining the reasons behind ongoing physical distancing measures will be crucial to persuading young men to follow the rules as the government begins to ease the lockdown.\u201d She added: \u201cWe should also be careful in painting an overly bleak picture. Not everyone will experience this period negatively, and we found that some of our teens are enjoying being at home with their parents more than ever, and are not more anxious or worried than before.\u201d Prof Til Wykes, from the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King\u2019s College London, said there needed to be a focus on \u201cclear and accurate advice\u201d with a focus on the responsibility of everyone to help stop the spread of coronavirus, and called for a public health approach to supporting young people. \u201cIncreased anxiety and depression has been found in China too,\u201d she said. \u201cThe crucial questions are how long this lasts and what support young people need for the world to feel safe and more predictable. This requires a public health approach, not necessarily a rush to a mental health service.\u201d She said young people living alone and those who do not have much support at home were understandably more likely to desire face-to-face communication. \u201cBeing anxious when we are facing so much uncertainty and a loss of social support is pretty normal,\u201d Wykes said. \u201cBut this can have a serious impact on those with pre-existing mental health problems and some will certainly need some formal psychological treatment.\u201d",

How this early success in flattening the curve transitions into an easing of restrictions and the prospect of a second wave remains to be seen.

It has to be for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Teams in the relegation zone will not go down to the 364-team, 18-group Tercera, but 20 teams <em>will</em> come up \u2013 18 from the accelerated play-offs, plus two hand-picked. That forces the creation of a new group in Segunda B next season and the season after that it will be reformed again, with the insertion of a new 40-team, two-group division between the Second Division and the rest of the Second Division B for 2021-22. No one knows how that will be decided. No one knows anything much.</p> <p>Players haven\u2019t been consulted \u201cat all\u201d, I\u2019Anson says. \u201cThe Federation didn\u2019t let the players\u2019 union, the AFE, get involved or express what we wanted. It\u2019s pretty much only really the teams in relegation [places] that have accepted it. Everyone looks after their own interests. But I don\u2019t think the problem is whether we were in the play-offs; it\u2019s the lack of information. That\u2019s been playing on every player\u2019s mind.</p> <p>\u201cFor 58 days, we\u2019ve been working but not been able to kick a ball. We\u2019re not living in big houses, earning millions. We needed a quick decision, our minds put at rest. If this was the decision, we needed to know a long time ago. They treat this level as if it is not professional, but it is: people\u2019s lives depend on it, it\u2019s their job.\u201d</p> <p>He continues: \u201cSalaries might be \u20ac1,000 [\u00a3870] a month, or \u20ac3,000 at the top end. Loads of clubs have had ERTEs [enforced salary reductions of up to 70% for the duration of the state of emergency, underwritten by the government] or negotiated pay cuts.</p> <p>\u201cWe took 7.5% on our annual wage and compared to some clubs Majadahonda have been bloody marvellous: terminating my contract was the best solution too. Clubs that went through ERTEs left players on \u20ac700 or \u20ac1,200 if they\u2019re married. You have the flat, phone, water, electricity, my missus lost her job [because of the coronavirus crisis]; imagine players with kids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"099215bec2669265d8d8817a99ef062954e0df91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/099215bec2669265d8d8817a99ef062954e0df91/0_200_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie I\u2019Anson (third from right) lines up at a set piece for Rayo Majadahonda.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie I\u2019Anson (third from right) lines up at a set piece for Rayo Majadahonda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel \u00c1ngel Acero/Rayo Majadahonda</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe were still under contract, still thinking we might come back. Every single day, we worked. That\u2019s your job: prepare well, look after your body, eat right, be ready. They sent bikes, gym equipment: that\u2019s a strange \u2018non-professional\u2019 club. Then in the end, they decided we couldn\u2019t go back, just as there\u2019s a de-escalation of the lockdown. If I walk my dog, I might touch a bench, say, that people have sat on; but we can\u2019t train, work like so many others going back now, even in a controlled environment, disinfected or whatever.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/09/xboxes-anxiety-crystal-palace-help-kids-lockdown\">Xboxes and anxiety: how Crystal Palace are helping kids in lockdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey have treated this division poorly; they seem to forget that the players in the first and second division \u2013 Jaime Mata and Borja Iglesias, say \u2013 come from here.\u201d</p> <p>While three quarters of the league stops, the top 16 have to keep training for six, seven, maybe eight weeks.

The club have helped. But I don\u2019t know if I can go. I\u2019ve been calling the police but getting no answer.

Players haven\u2019t been consulted \u201cat all\u201d, I\u2019Anson says. \u201cThe Federation didn\u2019t let the players\u2019 union, the AFE, get involved or express what we wanted. It\u2019s pretty much only really the teams in relegation [places] that have accepted it. Everyone looks after their own interests. But I don\u2019t think the problem is whether we were in the play-offs; it\u2019s the lack of information. That\u2019s been playing on every player\u2019s mind. \u201cFor 58 days, we\u2019ve been working but not been able to kick a ball. We\u2019re not living in big houses, earning millions. We needed a quick decision, our minds put at rest. If this was the decision, we needed to know a long time ago. They treat this level as if it is not professional, but it is: people\u2019s lives depend on it, it\u2019s their job.\u201d He continues: \u201cSalaries might be \u20ac1,000 [\u00a3870] a month, or \u20ac3,000 at the top end. Loads of clubs have had ERTEs [enforced salary reductions of up to 70% for the duration of the state of emergency, underwritten by the government] or negotiated pay cuts. \u201cWe took 7.5% on our annual wage and compared to some clubs Majadahonda have been bloody marvellous: terminating my contract was the best solution too. Clubs that went through ERTEs left players on \u20ac700 or \u20ac1,200 if they\u2019re married. You have the flat, phone, water, electricity, my missus lost her job [because of the coronavirus crisis]; imagine players with kids. \u201cWe were still under contract, still thinking we might come back. Every single day, we worked. That\u2019s your job: prepare well, look after your body, eat right, be ready. They sent bikes, gym equipment: that\u2019s a strange \u2018non-professional\u2019 club. Then in the end, they decided we couldn\u2019t go back, just as there\u2019s a de-escalation of the lockdown. If I walk my dog, I might touch a bench, say, that people have sat on; but we can\u2019t train, work like so many others going back now, even in a controlled environment, disinfected or whatever. \u201cThey have treated this division poorly; they seem to forget that the players in the first and second division \u2013 Jaime Mata and Borja Iglesias, say \u2013 come from here.\u201d While three quarters of the league stops, the top 16 have to keep training for six, seven, maybe eight weeks. And still there is a good chance the ministry of health may not authorise the play-offs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re getting paid,\u201d I\u2019Anson says. \u201cIn fact, some aren\u2019t: I know that. Those who are top, who would get promoted automatically if games can\u2019t be played are probably thinking they\u2019d prefer to just go home now.\u201d Rather like I\u2019Anson \u2013 at least, he hopes so. And like him, so many players in Spain\u2019s third tier. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can,\u201d he says. \u201cI have the paperwork that shows I have been sacked, that I don\u2019t live here any more and can\u2019t pay the rent and the contract on the flat has been terminated too, so I have to go home to my parents\u2019. The club have helped. But I don\u2019t know if I can go. I\u2019ve been calling the police but getting no answer. If they say no, I\u2019ll have to stay here for the rest of the state of emergency.\u201d",

Football returns \u2026 in the Faroe Islands As debates rage in other countries about the return of professional football, games will be played on the Faroe Islands on Saturday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak.

Indonesia records biggest daily increase in coronavirus infections Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645. But with Indonesia\u2019s low testing rate criticised by medical experts, the number of infections in the country \u2013 which has the fourth biggest population in the world \u2013 is feared to be far higher than official figures show.

      "bodyText": "The government is expected to unveil a \u00a3250m investment in UK cycle lanes to encourage commuters to ride to work instead of using public transport, as part of the effort to prevent a resurgence of coronavirus. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, is expected to make the funding announcement during his appearance at the Downing Street coronavirus briefing on Saturday. There are also plans to fast-track trials of the use of e-scooters on British roads, according to the Press Association. Currently, electric scooters \u2013 which can travel at up to 15.5mph \u2013 are banned on roads and pavements in the UK. The government launched a consultation about legalising e-scooters in March and would need to pass secondary legislation to legalise their use. Campaigners have called for a fundamental redesign of the transport system to help prevent a bounce-back in air pollution levels once the lockdown ends. Studies have shown that air pollution may play a role in higher Covid-19 mortality rates, with hearts and lungs weakened by dirty air. In Italy, coronavirus was detected in air pollution samples by scientists who are investigating whether this could enable it to be carried over longer distances and increase the number of people infected. Nine organisations including Greenpeace and the Transport Action Network have written an open letter to the UK secretaries of state for transport and the environment, as well as the chancellor, leaders of local and regional authorities and city mayors. \u201cIt would be completely absurd if, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from Covid-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution,\u201d the letter reads. The group\u2019s demands include wider pavements, protected cycle tracks and the installation of bus gates, bollards and planters to limit traffic in residential and shopping streets. The letter also calls for networks of low-traffic neighbourhoods and for walking and cycling to be prioritised along main roads. Greenpeace UK, CPRE, Cycling UK, the Environmental Defence Fund, Global Action Plan, Living Streets, Possible, Transport Action Network, and Transport and Environment have signed the letter. The campaigners also suggest introducing a 20mph speed limit in built-up areas and a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2030. Restrictions brought in to tackle the coronavirus pandemic have led to a huge drop in road traffic and a fall in air pollution of up to 60% in parts of the UK. A YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace UK found 71% of people were concerned about the possibility of air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels once restrictions are lifted. It also found that 58% backed the introduction of cycle lanes on urban main roads along with increased government funding for walking and cycling infrastructure. The letter calls for immediate action to lock in some of the reduction in road traffic and the introduction of measures to ensure that \u201cwhen the nation gets moving again, it does so in a cleaner, safer way\u201d. Rebecca Newsom, Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of politics, said Milan and Brussels had already taken steps to prioritise walkers and cyclists in their city centres. \u201cThere are many things about the lockdown people will be glad to leave behind, but cleaner air is not one of them,\u201d she said. \u201cYet there\u2019s a real risk that congestion and toxic pollution will be back on our streets as soon as restrictions are lifted.\u201d",

Photos from inside a plane landing at Chennai airport showed the flight crew, who were tested for Covid-19 beforehand, wearing protective suits and smiling behind masks and visors. Thousands of Indians have been stuck abroad since India banned all incoming flights in late March as part of a strict lockdown, which has been extended three times. Students in the UK and the US ran out of money for food and workers in the Gulf who had lost jobs had no money on which to survive. Indians who were abroad for diagnosis or medical treatment found themselves stuck there for much longer than planned, without enough money to continue paying bills. Every day for a week, eight or nine flights run by Air India will carry passengers home from 12 countries, mainly from the Gulf but also from the US, UK, Russia, Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.

The number of Indians to be repatriated over the coming weeks may be as high as 200,000. The smiling faces of those returning home on planes presented a stark contrast with the migrant labourers who have been enduring their own \u201cinternal exile\u201d in Indian cities during the lockdown.

Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador about sanctions over election interference, which were levied by Obama at the end of his presidency. Having been fired by Trump for lying to the vice-president, Mike Pence, Flynn co-operated with investigators before seeking to withdraw his plea.

It prompted fierce criticism from Democrats and many in the mainstream media, met by counter-attacks from the White House. On Friday, Yahoo News reported that it had obtained a tape of a web talk between the former president and members of the Obama Alumni Association. \u201cThe news over the last 24 hours I think has been somewhat downplayed \u2013 about the justice department dropping charges against Michael Flynn,\u201d Obama reportedly said. \u201cAnd the fact that there is no precedent that anybody can find for someone who has been charged with perjury [in fact Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI] just getting off scot-free.

She\u2019s broken a dizzying number of world records and been named one of the most 100 influential people in the world by Time. She\u2019s first-name-only levels of famous and a British cultural icon. She\u2019s got so much money that, one year, she paid <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/37935957/adele-paid-as-much-tax-last-year-as-facebook\">as much tax as Facebook</a>.</p> <p>While Adele\u2019s body of work is impressive, it\u2019s apparently not quite as interesting as her actual body. The internet has been fixated with the 32-year-old\u2019s weight loss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/08/adele-weight-loss-other-reasons-to-admire-her\">for a while now</a>, but the Adele obsession went into overdrive this week after she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_1VGc5AsoZ/?utm_source=ig_embed\">posted a photo of herself on Instagram</a> thanking people for the \u201cbirthday love\u201d and expressing gratitude to essential workers. The post went viral and started a debate about whether <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/is-it-ever-ok-to-compliment-celebrate-weight-loss-2020-5\">cheering Adele\u2019s new body is fat-phobic</a>. It also sparked a Skinny Adele meme, which juxtaposes pictures of the singer with things like fried chicken and pizza and asks which you\u2019d prefer. Which is problematic for a number of reasons; not least because it seems to be condoning cannibalism.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_1VGc5AsoZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Hello, it\u2019s me: I was wondering if we could leave Adele alone Adele has won an Oscar and 15 Grammy awards. She\u2019s broken a dizzying number of world records and been named one of the most 100 influential people in the world by Time. She\u2019s first-name-only levels of famous and a British cultural icon. She\u2019s got so much money that, one year, she paid as much tax as Facebook. While Adele\u2019s body of work is impressive, it\u2019s apparently not quite as interesting as her actual body. The internet has been fixated with the 32-year-old\u2019s weight loss for a while now, but the Adele obsession went into overdrive this week after she posted a photo of herself on Instagram thanking people for the \u201cbirthday love\u201d and expressing gratitude to essential workers. The post went viral and started a debate about whether cheering Adele\u2019s new body is fat-phobic. It also sparked a Skinny Adele meme, which juxtaposes pictures of the singer with things like fried chicken and pizza and asks which you\u2019d prefer. Which is problematic for a number of reasons; not least because it seems to be condoning cannibalism. Readers who are familiar with the hellscape that is Twitter may have an inkling of what happens next. Right on cue, Jameela Jamil, who never misses an opportunity to opine on body image issues, strode into the debate. \u201cAdele would hate this so much,\u201d the actor and activist tweeted on Thursday, with a photo montage of Skinny Adele memes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she isn\u2019t [on Twitter] to see people weaponize her body against women. These memes are everywhere. This is so offensive. So destructive. So reductive. It encourages us to demonize and become afraid of food.\u201d Those are all good points. Nevertheless, one does have to wonder exactly how helpful it is for Jamil to have shared the memes with her 1.1 million followers. You\u2019d think that during a once-in-a-century pandemic that is devastating the world we\u2019d all have gained a little perspective. You\u2019d think that we might have lost interest in how much a celebrity weighs. Alas, policing female bodies and appetites is a timeless trend. We\u2019ve been doing it since Eve was shamed for gluttonously eating that apple and, no doubt, we\u2019ll be doing it until we get hit by an asteroid or the aliens arrive to put us all out of our misery. Despite all the progress there has been around gender equality much of the world is still more interested in what goes into a woman\u2019s mouth than what comes out of it. Jacob Wohl is at the centre of yet another fake sexual assault allegation The pro-Trump smear artist reportedly paid a woman called Diana Andrade to pretend that Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sexually assaulted her. Andrade initially went through with the plan but then had second thoughts and blew the whistle. Wohl, and his equally odious sidekick Jack Burkman, have a history of trying to (very badly) fabricate sexual harassment allegations against the likes of Robert Mueller, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Last year he claimed that Warren had paid for an S&amp;M relationship with a twentysomething marine. Wohl is a complete joke but his antics do a lot of damage to the credibility of sexual assault survivors. Betsy DeVos revises campus sexual assault legislation The US education secretary (and owner of multiple yachts) has issued new rules on sexual assault in schools and colleges; equal rights groups argue these revisions \u201ctip the scales in favor\u201d of abusers and reduce the rights of survivors. The new regulations are expected to be challenged in court. Love in the time of corona That headline has already been used approximately 10 billion times so far in articles about romance during the coronavirus crisis. Now there\u2019s a quarantine dating series with that name coming to a screen near you soon. I\u2019m sure Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez would be very proud. Tara Reade calls on Joe Biden to drop out Reade, who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, called on the presumptive Democratic nominee to drop out of the presidential race during an on-camera interview with Megyn Kelly. Reade also says she is prepared to take a polygraph test if Biden also takes one. (There\u2019s a huge amount of controversy around the credibility of the polygraph, so I\u2019m not sure that would really help anything.) Women are being \u2018tossed to the wind\u2019 in birth control case The US supreme court has been hearing arguments on whether the Trump administration can make it easier for employers to stop providing free birth control coverage in their insurance plans for religious or moral reasons. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said that the government is attempting to \u201cto toss to the wind entirely Congress\u2019s instruction that women need and shall have seamless no-cost coverage\u201d. Men and women disagree about how much time they spend on chores Nearly half of men say they do most of the home schooling during lockdown, according to a poll by the New York Times.

      "bodyText": "Lewis Hamilton believes returning to grand prix racing without fans will be an \u201cempty\u201d experience as Formula One prepares to launch the new season behind closed doors. F1 expects to hold its first race on 5 July in Austria as a double header followed by two meetings at Silverstone, all without spectators. However, there remains the possibility that government quarantine restrictions may make travel for F1 teams unfeasible. Regardless, the prospect of racing before vacant grandstands does not appeal to the defending world champion. \u201cIt gave me a really empty feeling,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fans really make the race, and around the world, the more fans, the more atmosphere you have, like at Silverstone and Monza, so it is going to be very empty.\u201d That said, Hamilton says any return for F1 could be beneficial. \u201cI am getting messages from people around the world who are struggling through this period because they are not getting to watch sport,\u201d he said. \u201cIt shows how significant sport is in people\u2019s lives, it brings us together it is so exciting and captivating. I don\u2019t know how exciting it will be for people watching on tv, but it will be better than nothing.\u201d This is the longest break from the sport the Briton has had since his F1 debut in 2007, but the enforced absence has only made him conscious of how much he still enjoyed racing. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a blessing on one side because it gives you more of an appreciation of the things that you love,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has given me more energy and determination to keep delivering, keep working for this great team and I am excited for the future.\u201d F1\u2019s future remains unresolved. The government is expected to announce on Sunday that all arrivals into the country, including UK citizens, will be quarantined for two weeks. Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK. If the restriction was still in place in July the current proposals of races in Austria followed immediately by Silverstone would be impossible. A quarantine period imposed every time team members returned would require planning those periods into the calendar or having teams spend extended time on the road, neither option is likely to be realistic. It is possible the sport may gain an exemption from the measures as F1 is to implement a strict coronavirus testing regime on all team personnel before races and every two days when they are at meetings.",

      "bodyText": "France Galop, the ruling body of French racing, confirmed on Saturday it will resume with meetings at Longchamp, Toulouse and Compi\u00e8gne on Monday, but only after what is believed to have been urgent behind-the-scenes lobbying by Edouard de Rothschild, FG\u2019s president, late on Friday night that persuaded Emmanuel Macron, the French president, to finally give his approval to the resumption. De Rothschild thanked Macron and \u00c9douard Philippe, France\u2019s prime minister, for their efforts in a tweet in the early hours of Saturday morning that confirmed racing had seen off last-minute objections to its return. The protests are rumoured to have been lodged by a group of senior executives from French football, which has been suspended, along with all other professional team sports in the country, until September. \u201cI wanted to win this race more than any of the others,\u201d De Rothschild, a leading owner and breeder, said. \u201cTogether we did it! Resumption of races is accepted. Let\u2019s show them that they were right!\u201d Antoine Griezmann, the Barcelona and France striker, was among the Twitter users to respond positively. Griezmann has a growing string of racehorses and has recently retired Tornibush \u2013 who won a Group Three contest in 2018, half an hour after his owner scored a goal at the World Cup \u2013 to stand at stud. France Galop later issued a statement confirming the news that tracks in Paris \u2013 which is classified as a \u201cred zone\u201d under the French government\u2019s plans to ease its coronavirus lockdown \u2013 will be allowed to race behind closed doors. \u201cFrance Galop, LeTROT [which regulates trotting] and the National Federation of horse racing have received the government authorities\u2019 definitive approval for the resumption of racing behind closed doors from 11 May,\u201d it said. \u201cThe parent companies would like to point out the importance of respecting the barrier gestures [physical distancing] at the racecourses and thank everyone involved for following the sanitary procedures to the letter, which is crucial for the resumption of racing.\u201d Racing resumed in Germany on Thursday, but France is the first of the \u201cBig Three\u201d racing nations in Europe to start its Flat season. The British Horseracing Authority is waiting to hear the prime minister on Sunday evening before deciding whether it will be able to put plans to resume behind closed doors this month into action. In Ireland, the racing authorities are hoping to persuade the government to think again about a recent decision that racing should not resume in the country any earlier than 29 June.",

      "bodyText": "In early April, one bullish American consultant suggested on Twitter that if people didn\u2019t emerge from coronavirus quarantine having learned a new skill, gained more knowledge or having started something they\u2019d been putting off, then \u201cyou didn\u2019t ever lack the time, you lacked the discipline\u201d. As the tweet was widely shared, it met mockery and anger in equal measure, as people noted that home schooling, financial worries, stress and/or illness are making this period anything but a delightful self-improvement holiday. Getting through it is achievement enough. Rather than use gaining new knowledge and skills as some kind of laziness test, it might be better to see putting some time aside to learn a new skill as a way of gaining some focus during these precarious times. With that in mind, here are 20 apps that, if you do have the time, could prove helpful. And if you don\u2019t have time, rather than feel pressured to show \u201cdiscipline\u201d now, this list might be handy to file away for the future instead. Duolingo (Android/Apple - free + optional subscription) Duolingo\u2019s catchline \u2013 \u201cLearn a language for free. Forever\u201d \u2013 sounds a bit threatening. Thankfully, its app is excellent, with a wide range of languages covered and short, simple exercises designed for daily practice. Its optional subscription tier removes ads and adds more features. Also see: Babbel, Memrise. Simply Piano (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) If you\u2019ve always wanted to play the piano, this app can help. It sets you exercises, then uses the microphone in your device to listen to your playing and provide feedback. It has a library of varied songs to learn, with two courses for free, and many more available with a subscription. Also see: Skoove, Piano by Yousician. Mimo (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) There has been lots of \u201ckids can code\u201d rhetoric in recent years, but many adults have taken up computer programming too. Mimo makes the discipline accessible without dumbing down or being over-dry. Several popular programming languages are supported, while a subscription unlocks its full library. Also see: SoloLearn, Swift Playgrounds. Anchor (Android/Apple \u2013 free) This app is owned by Spotify, but it\u2019s focused on podcasts rather than music. Making podcasts, that is. It will soon get you recording and editing shows, adding soundtracks and then publishing them to various podcast services. The app will also give you data on your listening figures. Also see: Podcast Studio by Spreaker. Blinkist (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) Promising yourself you will read lots of books while in self-isolation might be easy, but following through with the plan may prove more tricky. Blinkist is a clever complement to traditional reading: it condenses non-fiction books into 15-minute audiobooks. A subscription opens up its full library and offline listening. Also see: StoryShots, MicroBook. Yousician (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) That guitar that\u2019s been gathering dust for years? Its time is now! Yousician is one of the best apps for learning to play guitar (or ukulele) with bite-size lessons based on familiar songs, and, like Simply Piano, constant feedback \u2013 of the good kind. A subscription removes the free version\u2019s restrictions. Also see: Fender Play, Simply Guitar. Candide Gardening (Android/Apple \u2013 free) If you have a garden, the UK lockdown may have sparked your green-fingered ambitions. Candide Gardening is an excellent app to guide you, whether it\u2019s in identifying plants, providing an archive of gardening guides or helping you find people who can answer your questions. Also see: Grow Your Own, Homefarm. Driving Theory Test 4 in 1 Kit (Android/Apple \u2013 \u00a34.99) Car journeys are being kept to essential trips at the moment and so driving lessons aren\u2019t an option. But if you were learning (or had planned to) there\u2019s nothing to stop you polishing your knowledge of the driving theory test, including, in this app, clips on hazard-prevention. Also see: Official DVSA Theory Test Kit. SketchAR (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) If you lack confidence in your artistic skills, a blank piece of paper can be intimidating. SketchAR is a clever app that uses augmented reality to teach you to draw, as you hold your device over the paper. You can start from scratch or choose various topics to explore, such as animals or graffiti. Also see: Da Vinci Eye. Yummly (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) More time at home should hopefully mean more time to trynew recipes, but sourcing ingredients at the moment could present challenges. Yummly will develop your improvisational skills in the kitchen: not only offering guided recipes, but helping you find ideas based on the ingredients you have. Also see: Tasty, SuperCook. Steezy Studio (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) Got two left feet? You can still learn to dance during the lockdown. Just make sure you move fragile heirlooms out of the way before trying this app in the living room. It offers more than 500 video classes in styles such as hip-hop, dance hall and breaking (as we said, move the heirlooms first...). Also see: Dance Reality. Learn Cryptic Crosswords (Android/Apple \u2013 free + in-app purchases) Cryptic crosswords aren\u2019t so cryptic once you start to learn some of the methods for solving them. This app does a really good job of explaining how to tackle these puzzles, testing you with exercises as you learn. The crosswords still aren\u2019t easy, but you\u2019ll be more confident. Also see: Cryptic Crossword. Google Arts &amp; Culture (Android/Apple \u2013 free) Nobody\u2019s visiting museums or galleries for the moment, let alone travelling abroad to do so. A good moment for Google\u2019s arts and culture app, then, which provides virtual tours of more than 2,000 \u201ccultural institutions\u201d around the world, using photos, videos and virtual reality. Also see: DailyArt. Elevate: Brain Training (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) Self-isolation doesn\u2019t have to mean stagnation. Brain training apps such as Elevate are designed to keep your wits sharp with short daily exercises that test your memory, maths and other skills. You can play for free or subscribe to unlock lots more exercises. Also see: Peak, Lumosity. Calm (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) If getting to grips with mindfulness and meditation has been on your to-do list for a while, a pandemic feels like the right time to finally do it. Calm offers guided (spoken) meditations, relaxing music and even stories read by the likes of Stephen Fry and Matthew McConaughey to get you to sleep. Also see: Headspace, Insight Timer. Brilliant (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) \u201cI wish I\u2019d tried harder at maths in school\u201d is a common lament for people who have belatedly realised how useful those skills would be now. Brilliant is a good way to catch up on maths and science: it covers the basics up to some surprisingly advanced topics such as neural networks. Also see: Math Brain Booster Games. Daily Yoga (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) Yoga is another discipline that tends to linger on many people\u2019s to-do lists for years. Daily Yoga is one of the best apps for beginners, taking you through the initial yoga positions to more advanced classes, complete with a \u201csmart coach\u201d that recommends what to do every day. Also see: Yoga Studio, Yoga Down Dog. Khan Academy (Android/Apple \u2013 free) Khan Academy is an American not-for-profit organisation (hence the lack of charge) that sees itself as a global classroom. That means courses on maths, computing, science and economics through to arts and humanities, with a blend of videos, articles and quizzes to test your learning. Also see: TED, MasterClass. Skillshare (Android/Apple \u2013 free + optional subscription) If Khan Academy is good for maths and sciences, Skillshare goes in the other direction: towards drawing, photography, graphic design and other creative disciplines. There are also business-focused courses in topics such as marketing. A single subscription unlocks its catalogue. Also see: CreativeLive.

This symbol of the jet age was the only option for the billionaire showman. But a decade later, the plane has become a symbolic casualty of the chaos engulfing the airline industry during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Virgin Atlantic said it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/virgin-atlantic-to-close-gatwick-operations-and-lose-3000-workers\" title=\"\">retire all seven of its 747s</a>.</p> <p>More than 1,500 of the jumbo jets have been delivered over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/gallery/2018/sep/30/fifty-years-of-the-jumbo-jet-in-pictures\" title=\"\">the 52 years</a> it has been in service, but analysts say the savage decline in passenger traffic as governments seek to contain the spread of Covid-19 could hasten the decline of the plane, heralding an ignominious end for the so-called Queen of the Skies.</p> <p>Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, last month brought forward the retirement of five 747s.

      "bodyText": "When Sir Richard Branson marked the 25th anniversary of Virgin Atlantic in 2009, he and the model Kate Moss posed on the wing of a Boeing 747. This symbol of the jet age was the only option for the billionaire showman. But a decade later, the plane has become a symbolic casualty of the chaos engulfing the airline industry during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Virgin Atlantic said it would retire all seven of its 747s. More than 1,500 of the jumbo jets have been delivered over the 52 years it has been in service, but analysts say the savage decline in passenger traffic as governments seek to contain the spread of Covid-19 could hasten the decline of the plane, heralding an ignominious end for the so-called Queen of the Skies. Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, last month brought forward the retirement of five 747s. KLM, its Dutch counterpart, has also confirmed that its jumbos will not return to the skies under its livery, as has France\u2019s Corsair, accelerating the shift to newer models. That adds to plans from British Airways to scrap its 28 747s by 2024; the largest remaining operator of the planes in the world made the announcement in early 2019. Around the world, Boeing and its bitter European rival Airbus are locked in negotiations with airlines desperate to preserve cash by delaying the delivery of new aircraft.

The 747 saw off the challenge of the Airbus A380 superjumbo, which ends production next year, but it still faces many of the problems that ultimately grounded its closest rival. Larger planes are only worthwhile financially on longer-distance, popular routes, making them less flexible for airlines. Smaller, newer aircraft are now capable of flying longer routes as well as short-haul, making them more attractive as the industry faces up to months or even years of slow recovery in air passenger demand once lockdown restrictions are eased. Fuel-efficiency savings in newer, twin-engined planes add to the attraction of retiring the four-engined 747 early, even with oil prices near historically low levels. And significant maintenance costs for older planes tip the balance further: Virgin\u2019s 747 fleet has an average age of 20 years, much higher than the rest of its planes, which have an average age of nine, according to aircraft data provider Planespotters.

      "body": "<p>The annual Met Gala would have taken place in New York last week, had it not been postponed indefinitely in March owing to the pandemic. The theme would have been About Time: Fashion and Duration, or \u201ctime itself\u201d, according to Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s partner exhibition, which is ironic now that a morning can feel like a month, and a week can feel like a minute.</p> <p>Ordinarily, it is one of my favourite celebrity bashes, sitting happily in the middle of a ridiculous/gorgeous Venn diagram, showing off high fashion so high that the people who point at Picassos and say \u201cmy five-year-old could have done that\u201d will inevitably comment that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t wear that down the shops\u201d, as if the point of a ballgown in the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/fashion/katy-perry-met-gala-2019-chandelier-a4135421.html\">shape of a chandelier</a> were to make the trip to Tesco a bit more lively. (Having said that, you could definitely have used it to carry a few extra bags home.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"969f5268830d1c387cd08e3ae63dd9c6f9f34eb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/969f5268830d1c387cd08e3ae63dd9c6f9f34eb3/0_0_1080_1350/800.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Roberts poses over a full bubble bath\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Here\u2019s me...not going to the Met Ball tonight. #stayhome #yesyoustillhavetostayhome\u2019: Julia Roberts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram/ @juliaroberts</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the run-up to this year\u2019s postponed non-event, Billy Porter, the man responsible for every key red-carpet talking point from the past two years, challenged <em>Vogue</em> readers <a href=\"https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/article/billy-porter-instagram-challenge\">to recreate the most famous Met Gala looks at home</a>. \u201cIt can be Rihanna, it can be Gaga, it can be... me,\u201d he said. Given that <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/billy-porter-met-gala-2019-the-blonds\">Porter entered the 2019 Met Gala</a> on a bed carried by six shirtless men, before showing off a pair of enormous golden wings, you <em>could</em> be him, but it would take a bit more than a creative way with some sticky back plastic and a few loo roll tubes.</p> <p>Still, it is a testament to the imagination that lockdown seems to have unleashed that people tried it, and essentially succeeded. They certainly did far better than me on a \u201cdress like a Simpsons character\u201d round during a Zoom pub quiz recently. All I can say is that a swimming cap was ruined.</p> <p>On the night the Met Gala was supposed to happen, Anna Wintour hosted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HptQEYkMrVQ\">a YouTube livestream</a>. Florence Welch performed in front of some frankly covetable wallpaper. Potential guests posted their looks on Instagram. Katy Perry, of the chandelier dress fame, showed a Gaultier baby bump, in the style of the Madonna cone bra, with the caption \u201cwhat would have been\u201d. Amanda Seyfried posted her look while posing with a chicken, next to a chicken coop. My favourite was Julia Roberts, who posed precariously in a black and white gown over a full bubble bath, holding what appears to be a cup of tea, which is surely a night in barely bothering to masquerade as the desire for a night out. It felt perfectly appropriate.</p> <h2>Daniel Radcliffe, just as much a wizard as he always was</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2407f503febebcb2c5cdbce9f859b17a9bde201\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2407f503febebcb2c5cdbce9f859b17a9bde201/0_151_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Radcliffe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Radcliffe: kicked off the Harry Potter reading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Tuesday, Harry Potter fans were surprised at the news that \u201camazing friends of the Wizarding World\u201d would be taking it in turns <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm1xuYUY0dY\">to read a chapter </a>of the first book in the series, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone</em>.</p> <p>Stephen Fry, Eddie Redmayne and Noma Dumezweni all appeared in the announcement, but there was only one candidate to read the opening chapter, and it had to be Daniel Radcliffe, although this did offer the slightly unsettling spectacle of Harry Potter at 30, reading a book about Harry Potter at 11, as if he didn\u2019t know anything about it. Perhaps it was best not to overthink it.</p> <p>In another wonderful moment for fans of children\u2019s literature, Andy Serkis conducted a live reading of <em>The Hobbit</em> on Friday from start to finish, <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/thehobbitathoncovid19appeal\">to raise money</a> for the charities NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings.</p> <p>I had been sceptical of audiobooks as an adult. I saw them as the stern-faced old-fashioned ancestor of that bright young upstart the podcast. But in lockdown I\u2019ve been devouring them.

      "bodyText": "The annual Met Gala would have taken place in New York last week, had it not been postponed indefinitely in March owing to the pandemic. The theme would have been About Time: Fashion and Duration, or \u201ctime itself\u201d, according to Andrew Bolton, the curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s partner exhibition, which is ironic now that a morning can feel like a month, and a week can feel like a minute. Ordinarily, it is one of my favourite celebrity bashes, sitting happily in the middle of a ridiculous/gorgeous Venn diagram, showing off high fashion so high that the people who point at Picassos and say \u201cmy five-year-old could have done that\u201d will inevitably comment that \u201cyou couldn\u2019t wear that down the shops\u201d, as if the point of a ballgown in the shape of a chandelier were to make the trip to Tesco a bit more lively. (Having said that, you could definitely have used it to carry a few extra bags home.) In the run-up to this year\u2019s postponed non-event, Billy Porter, the man responsible for every key red-carpet talking point from the past two years, challenged Vogue readers to recreate the most famous Met Gala looks at home. \u201cIt can be Rihanna, it can be Gaga, it can be... me,\u201d he said. Given that Porter entered the 2019 Met Gala on a bed carried by six shirtless men, before showing off a pair of enormous golden wings, you could be him, but it would take a bit more than a creative way with some sticky back plastic and a few loo roll tubes. Still, it is a testament to the imagination that lockdown seems to have unleashed that people tried it, and essentially succeeded. They certainly did far better than me on a \u201cdress like a Simpsons character\u201d round during a Zoom pub quiz recently. All I can say is that a swimming cap was ruined. On the night the Met Gala was supposed to happen, Anna Wintour hosted a YouTube livestream. Florence Welch performed in front of some frankly covetable wallpaper. Potential guests posted their looks on Instagram. Katy Perry, of the chandelier dress fame, showed a Gaultier baby bump, in the style of the Madonna cone bra, with the caption \u201cwhat would have been\u201d. Amanda Seyfried posted her look while posing with a chicken, next to a chicken coop. My favourite was Julia Roberts, who posed precariously in a black and white gown over a full bubble bath, holding what appears to be a cup of tea, which is surely a night in barely bothering to masquerade as the desire for a night out. It felt perfectly appropriate. Daniel Radcliffe, just as much a wizard as he always was On Tuesday, Harry Potter fans were surprised at the news that \u201camazing friends of the Wizarding World\u201d would be taking it in turns to read a chapter of the first book in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Stephen Fry, Eddie Redmayne and Noma Dumezweni all appeared in the announcement, but there was only one candidate to read the opening chapter, and it had to be Daniel Radcliffe, although this did offer the slightly unsettling spectacle of Harry Potter at 30, reading a book about Harry Potter at 11, as if he didn\u2019t know anything about it. Perhaps it was best not to overthink it. In another wonderful moment for fans of children\u2019s literature, Andy Serkis conducted a live reading of The Hobbit on Friday from start to finish, to raise money for the charities NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings. I had been sceptical of audiobooks as an adult. I saw them as the stern-faced old-fashioned ancestor of that bright young upstart the podcast. But in lockdown I\u2019ve been devouring them. I stare out of the window with my headphones on, marvelling at how experts can consider the increase in road usage to be \u201cslightly worrying\u201d when the road I look out on to has been back to pre-lockdown traffic levels for two weeks now. Still, the stories can be soothing. Fiction read aloud has an effect that podcasts can\u2019t always muster. It encourages a necessary depth of escapism, whether that\u2019s Harry Potter or, in my case, The Testaments. And you know things are bad when that\u2019s what you choose to listen to in order to switch off. Charlie Brooker, please carry on predicting the future \u2018At the moment, I don\u2019t know what stomach there would be for stories about societies falling apart, so I\u2019m not working away on one of those,\u201d Charlie Brooker told the Radio Times last week, when asked about the possibility of a sixth season of Black Mirror. Brooker may not have the appetite for apocalypse writing, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s right about viewers. As much as I can pass an evening at home crying along to Paul O\u2019Grady\u2019s For the Love of Dogs, there has been a huge appetite for watching or rewatching films such as Outbreak and Contagion, which are either funhouse mirrors or opportunities for the ultimate immersive viewing experience. BYO hazmat suit, although maybe mute the sound during the \u201cdon\u2019t talk to anyone, don\u2019t touch anyone, stay away from other people\u201d bit. Given that Black Mirror appears to have got ahead of several global events before they came to fruition, from the pig\u2019s head political scandal to the election of a racist cartoon character, then perhaps Brooker could write an episode where hardworking scientists quickly and efficiently come up with an immediate vaccine for a deadly virus. Granted, it lacks drama, but he\u2019d be doing us all a favour. \u2022 Rebecca Nicholson is an Observer columnist",

According to Bray, some employee activists responded by organising a petition and a video call on Thursday 16 April, featuring warehouse workers from around the world, along with guest activist the writer Naomi Klein. An announcement sent to internal mailing lists on 10 April was apparently the catalyst: Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, two members of the internal campaign group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, were dismissed that same day.

It treated its staff well, strove to allow them to achieve a proper work/life balance, made efforts to improve the diversity of the workforce, and was by and large an ethical organisation. More important, perhaps, AWS geeks have power. The average pay is very high, and anyone who is unhappy can easily get another job at a similar or better salary. So their employer has to handle them with care.</p> <p>But the events that led Bray to resign happened in the other bit of Amazon \u2013 the warehouse operation that has been serving as part of the critical infrastructure of economies under lockdown. He said it was all about the balance of power. The warehouse workers were weak and becoming ever weaker, given that coronavirus was fuelling mass unemployment and because, in the US, health insurance was often linked to your job. \u201cSo they\u2019re gonna get treated like crap, because [that\u2019s] capitalism.

      "bodyText": "Christine Taylor has lived her entire life in the shadow of London\u2019s Heathrow airport, her childhood bedroom affording a view of one of its two runways. She grew up in Sipson, a village that can trace its history back more than 1,000 years, but now sits immediately north of Britain\u2019s busiest airline hub. Now living a mile to the east in Harlington, Taylor, 62, is experiencing a rare moment of quiet, thanks to the dramatic reduction in air traffic caused by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIt struck me during the period with the volcano that I had never experienced a life without planes,\u201d Taylor says, referring to the ash cloud caused by the 2010 eruption of volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull in Iceland, which grounded aircraft over much of Europe for nearly a week. \u201cNow this prolonged period has really been life-changing. I\u2019m not sure how many of us want to go back to the old normal.\u201d For decades, Taylor and other locals have been fighting Heathrow\u2019s plans for a third runway. The pandemic has added another question mark to those ambitions \u2013 a reality acknowledged by the airport last week. Heathrow\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, told MPs that it could be up to 15 years until the UK needed a third runway at its largest airport. \u201cIn 10 to 15 years, if we are successful in rebooting the UK economy and getting back to full swing, I think we will still need a third runway,\u201d he said. Holland-Kaye was asked whether the coronavirus crisis had blown a \u201cmassive hole\u201d in the economic argument for the third runway, but he insisted the airport\u2019s expansion remained a \u201ccritical economic plank for the growth of the country\u201d. Both Heathrow and Britain\u2019s second-largest airport, Gatwick \u2013 some 30 miles south of London \u2013 have been hoping for years to increase capacity. The pandemic has undoubtedly blown a hole in the short-term business case for those plans, and indeed for any airport expansion in the UK, with air travel not expected to recover to 2019 levels for several years.

A spokesperson for Heathrow, which is owned by a consortium including Spanish group Ferrovial and Qatar\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, added: \u201cOnce the benefits of air travel and connectivity have been restored in years to come, an expanded Heathrow will be required.\u201d Even when commercial air travel attempts a concerted recovery, probably with social distancing measures on board, passengers are not expected to immediately revert to their pre-coronavirus travel habits.

This slowdown has also cast doubt on Gatwick airport\u2019s plans to develop its emergency runway for regular use, almost five years after it lost out to Heathrow in a tussle over increasing UK air capacity. The UK\u2019s second-biggest airport is facing the loss of two important customers, as Virgin Atlantic announced its departure just days after BA threatened to walk away. The airport\u2019s third-largest operator, Norwegian Air, is also expected to be much smaller post-Covid. As with Heathrow, there is debate over whether Gatwick will need the extra capacity given the industry\u2019s uncertain future. Gatwick\u2019s chief executive, Stewart Wingate, says he remains \u201cvery optimistic about the long-term prospects of the airport\u201d, despite the significant impact of the pandemic on the business and the local economy.

Just a normal radio programme, really: but tricky technically, without hordes of tech-heads in the same room as the microphone, internet server, mobile phone and host.</p> <p>Partly, Cairney\u2019s motivation was to ease lockdown loneliness. \u201cI\u2019m desperate to pour out my love for music and art and people,\u201d she said.

Cairney herself was a little scattered, but better when talking to others, especially the wonderful Bob Harris about his pirate radio years.

Two artists\u2019 tunes are put up directly against each other, track by track. Each artist has a champion, who chooses the tracks and gives out a bit of banter and argy about it.

When 10 v 10 goes out live, Twitter goes bananas (Burnaboy and his mum went live on Instagram in support of WizKid, who won 10-0, causing much emotion).

Medics and experts came on to explain the various, interlocking reasons why people from minority ethic groups have suffered so much more, and relevant points were made regarding work, housing, culture, religion and language. It was left to the callers to bring up racism directly.

There are plenty of Tory MPs who believe there is a bigger threat to health, and possibly their electoral chances, from a damaged economy. They give equal billing to the threat from a flurry of corporate bankruptcies, a steep rise in unemployment and a ballooning debt pile that would dwarf the legacy left by the 2008 banking crash. And it is this last concern \u2013 that of the mortgage to end all mortgages being left on the nation\u2019s balance sheet \u2013 to which ministers have turned and begun to debate in the most heated terms. Without a doubt, a fear of debt is the main constraint on funding the current rescue operation and on making a boost to investment once the crisis is over. If you are a traditional Conservative MP with a picture of Margaret Thatcher on the constituency office wall, you believe debts must be repaid, much like a domestic property mortgage. This is the household analogy Thatcher used to great effect during her years as prime minister, despite it being economically illiterate, and only ever deployed as a way to keep public spending in check and state power limited. Now, to tackle the coronavirus outbreak and nurse the economy until a vaccine is mass-produced, there is no choice but to watch the gap between spending and income soar. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates the government will need to borrow an extra \u00a3200bn in this financial year alone and is heading for a debt-to-GDP ratio of 95% from the current level of around 83%. A debt mountain that falls just short of the UK\u2019s \u00a32.2 trillion annual income is a level of borrowing that butts up against a significant psychological barrier \u2013 the three-figure debt-to-GDP ratio. In the mind of a conservative thinker, only countries that are reckless, and possibly morally dubious, have spent so much that their debts exceed 100% of GDP. In practical terms, a country with high debt levels can become the target of panicky investors, who can orchestrate a strike that means no one lends it money. A government borrows by issuing bonds with a maturity date, and it needs fresh lenders to step in and buy the debt from existing lenders each time it matures. \u201cBond vigilantes\u201d make money from orchestrating such bond-buying strikes and are ever watchful for countries that have left themselves vulnerable. The euro crisis is still fresh in many people\u2019s minds, when Italy and Greece found themselves bond-market pariahs. Italy\u2019s debts equalled 130% of GDP. Greece found itself with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 180%. George Osborne\u2019s career as chancellor, and his adherence to a debilitating austerity programme, was built on warnings that Britain could suffer the same fate as Greece and Italy. Like his hero Thatcher, he persuaded an anxious nation that debt was to be feared. Yet it was never true and is even less true today. Central to this argument is the path of interest rates.

The government declined to confirm these reports today and said only that the PM will make an announcement at 7pm tomorrow. </li> \n   <li><strong>The coastguard recorded the highest number of incidents in one day since lockdown began as people \u201cignored\u201d the government\u2019s stay-at-home message</strong>. The Coastguard said there were 97 incidents on Friday, 54% more than the average of 63 recorded for the previous month. Going into another warm, sunny bank holiday weekend, it urged people to continue observing the stay-at-home guidance for the sake of the NHS and first responders on the frontline.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll rose by 346 to 31,587 across all settings.</strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The government pledged a \u00a32bn package to boost cycling and walking</strong> during what the transport secretary Grant Shapps called \u201ca once-in-a-generation\u201d chance to change the way people travel in the UK. The package will include measures such as widening pavements, pop-up bike lanes, cyclist-only streets and trialling the use of e-scooters.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side.

This means from exposure to the virus, you remain well for one to 14 days before symptoms emerge. If people go home, they must work out that incubation period at home, and that\u2019s the scientific basis for quarantine.</p> \n  <p><em>Q. Is the government\u2019s messaging now looking more confused as you\u2019re looking at tightening controls on the borders yet allowing people to visit garden centres?</em></p> \n  <p><strong>Shapps</strong> says he feels people are capable of understanding what\u2019s being said.</p> \n  <p><strong>Van-Tam</strong> adds that the policy is quite consistent.

      "bodyText": "The government emphasised that any changes to lockdown measures announced by the PM tomorrow will be \u201cextremely cautious\u201d. Boris Johnson is expected to announce small changes to measures, which could include permitting outdoor exercise more than once a day, reopening garden centres and requiring passengers arriving from abroad into airports and ports to quarantine for 14 days. The government declined to confirm these reports today and said only that the PM will make an announcement at 7pm tomorrow. The coastguard recorded the highest number of incidents in one day since lockdown began as people \u201cignored\u201d the government\u2019s stay-at-home message. The Coastguard said there were 97 incidents on Friday, 54% more than the average of 63 recorded for the previous month. Going into another warm, sunny bank holiday weekend, it urged people to continue observing the stay-at-home guidance for the sake of the NHS and first responders on the frontline. The UK death toll rose by 346 to 31,587 across all settings. The government pledged a \u00a32bn package to boost cycling and walking during what the transport secretary Grant Shapps called \u201ca once-in-a-generation\u201d chance to change the way people travel in the UK. The package will include measures such as widening pavements, pop-up bike lanes, cyclist-only streets and trialling the use of e-scooters. That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side.

Shapps says at the end of May [with results of PHE inquiry] the government will be in a better position to advise on this. Van-Tam says he takes this very incredibly seriously and there is an enormous determination to get to the bottom of this with real clarity and in a proper and scientific way. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t want to offer \u201cquick fixes\u201d, he says. There are multiple risk factors and it is very complicated, so there are no quick answers, he says. I can\u2019t tell you how urgent this is, but it\u2019s not so urgent that we can make mistakes. Q. Will the government consider including convenience retailers as key workers and providing them and pharmacists with PPE so they can continue to serve the nation, or will you tell them to close so they can stay alive? This doesn\u2019t get answered. And that\u2019s it, the press conference is over. Q. As of right now and for the next 24 hours ahead of the PM\u2019s statement, should people be staying at home? Shapps says it is \u201cabsolutely unequivocal\u201d that people should be staying at home and not throwing away the efforts of the last seven weeks just because it\u2019s sunny this weekend. Please stay at home this weekend in exactly the same way that you have been previously. Q. For track and trace to really work, do we have to have new cases down to the hundreds and if so how long do you think that will take? Van-Tam says test and trace will involve the NHS app and PHE in wider traditional contact tracing. He says test and trace is part of the solution to how we continue to live with this virus after the lockdown \u2013 it\u2019s not the total solution, he adds. How extensive test and trace needs to be depends on the level of disease among the population, he says, but it is part of the overall measures that will give us more flexibility on social distancing. It\u2019s a contribution, not a total solution. Q. Will you accept that parents won\u2019t be able to cycle into work until schools are up and running? Shapps says more people than ever are working from home and this is likely to continue as long as social distancing remains at the heart of the situation. The PM will say more on this tomorrow, he adds. Q. What\u2019s going to happen to the 1.8m shielding when the volunteers they rely on go back to work? Van-Tam says shielding is extremely important to protecting the most vulnerable in society and is likely to have prevented many deaths. He says these groups and how to proceed are being kept under review. Q. Can you level with people that realistically foreign travel this summer is unlikely and recommend that people start cancelling trips? Shapps says the Foreign Office is advising strongly against all international travel at the moment and many countries aren\u2019t accepting foreign travellers at the moment. We have to see how the R rate continues to proceed before we know the answer as to how things will look in the summer, he adds. Q. Why has it been so difficult to protect people in care homes and what more needs to be done? Van-Tam says he recognises the difficult situation in care homes and is extremely sorry for the deaths that have occurred. The largely indoor environment in care homes means the virus spreads more easily among the largely elderly population in care homes \u2013 many of whom have a range of underlying health conditions, creating \u201ca perfect storm\u201d, he says. NHS England and the CQC are looking closely at this, he adds. Q. Are you open to negotiation on this quarantine arrangement with the airline industry or have you made up your mind? Shapps says nothing has been announced yet. The aviation sector has been approached to have \u201cbespoke conversations\u201d with himself and the chancellor, he says. Q. The average UK commute is 9 miles - many couldn\u2019t cycle to work if they want to. What will you do about that? Shapps says there will be further announcements on road and rail. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. Will anyone flying into UK airports be quarantined for 14 days from the start of next month? Why didn\u2019t this happen weeks ago during the peak and won\u2019t such a move damage the aviation industry even more? Shapps says people travelling from Wuhan, Iran and South Korea were quarantined in January and February. It makes sense to look at the borders, he says, but the capacity to do this exists but the PM will say more on this tomorrow. Van-Tam adds that the incubation period of this disease is understood to be between one and 14 days. This means from exposure to the virus, you remain well for one to 14 days before symptoms emerge. If people go home, they must work out that incubation period at home, and that\u2019s the scientific basis for quarantine. Q. Is the government\u2019s messaging now looking more confused as you\u2019re looking at tightening controls on the borders yet allowing people to visit garden centres? Shapps says he feels people are capable of understanding what\u2019s being said. Van-Tam adds that the policy is quite consistent. Testing and tracing means contacts will be told to self-isolate, consistent with quarantining people travelling in from abroad, he says. Tammy from Bristol asks how the government plans to implement social distancing measures in education settings. Shapps says we must wait to hear from the prime minister tomorrow at 7pm but discussions are ongoing on this matter. Van-Tam says that whatever the PM announces tomorrow, it will be \u201cextremely cautious, careful and painstaking\u201d and will take into account these factors. It\u2019s caution all the way, really. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Stephen from County Durham asks if he should follow the advice of the Scottish government or Westminster. Shapps says the four nations have largely moved in lockstep and the next phase will involve very clear messaging, as it has so far. Prof Van-Tam is speaking now. Transport use remains low and \u201cextremely impressive\u201d, he says. There is a gradual increase in the use of motor vehicles, which may reflect people returning to work but is difficult to interpret, he says. Daily tests (both completed and sent out) have reached \u201ca high plateau\u201d with some fluctuation on a day-to-day basis, he says. Mass swab testing by universities, research institutes and companies is complementing NHS swab testing to record several thousand new cases per day. This is reflected in the higher capacity, he says. There is \u201ca solid decline\u201d in the number of people in hospital in all the different regions. We must still be \u201ccautious and measured about what happens next\u201d, he says. There is \u201cplenty of capacity\u201d for critical care patients, the numbers of which continue to decline, he says. There has been and continues to be a \u201csteady and consistent fall\u201d in the number of recorded deaths, he says. Finally, on the global death comparison, the US is an outlier at the top and the UK is in company with France, Italy and Spain in the middle band. We won\u2019t get the most granular picture until we start to get excess mortality data across all countries, he says. There will be further announcements on investments in road and rail in the coming days, he says. He has met with Google, Microsoft and Citymapper to develop data and apps to help the public view crowding across the travel network in real-time, he says. He also announces \u00a310m for car charging points on streets and to accelerate the filling of potholes, as the car remains the \u201cmainstay\u201d for many families, he says. In this new world, pedestrians will need more space, Shapps says. He announces a \u00a32bn package to put cycling and walking \u201cat the heart of the government\u2019s transport policy\u201d. He will bring forward a \u201cnational cycling plan\u201d in early June to set out how they will double cycling and increase walking by 2025. The first stage worth \u00a3250m is a series of emergency interventions to make cycling and walking safer \u2013 including pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cyclist-only streets, he says. They will also publish statutory advice for councils to accommodate for cyclists and walkers. This will be a once-in-a-generation change to the way people travel in Britain, Shapps says. Once of the few positives of this crisis is the fall in levels of air pollution, he says. To try to preserve this cleaner air, he is also trialling use of e-scooters to get rental schemes up and running in cities as soon as possible. Even with public transport reverting to a full service, once the two-metre social distancing rule is accounted for, there would only be capacity for one in 10 passengers in many parts of the network, Shapps says. We must think very carefully about how and when we travel, if we are to get Britain moving again without overcrowding our transport network, he says. This is an opportunity to make us healthier in the long-term through active travel, he says. When we do get back to work, cycling and walking in a safe way should be encouraged. Tomorrow, the prime minister will set out a \u201croadmap\u201d for the next phase in the government\u2019s strategy, Shapps says. Moving beyond Covid will be \u201ca gradual process, not a single leap to freedom\u201d, he says. When we do emerge, the world will seem quite different, at least for some time, he says. The transport secretary is speaking now. An update from Cobra\u2019s data file: 96,878 tests were carried out yesterday. 215,260 have tested positive, an increase of 3,896 cases since yesterday. 11,809 people are in hospital with coronavirus in the UK, down from 12,284 yesterday and 17% down on the same day last week. 31,587 people have now died, an increase of 346 fatalities in all settings since yesterday. The transport secretary Grant Shapps will lead the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference, which is due to begin shortly. He will be joined by the deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam. Tributes have been paid to a learning disabilities nurse who died after testing positive for coronavirus. Augustine Agyei-Mensah, known to his colleagues as Gus, was a highly regarded team member at Northamptonshire healthcare NHS foundation trust. Originally from Ghana, the father-of-four had worked as a learning disabilities nurse at the trust since 2014, having qualified the year before. Before training as a healthcare worker, he was employed by South West Trains for four years. He worked closely with the team\u2019s speech and language therapist and his psychology colleagues to support people with complex cognitive and sensory needs. The chief executive of the trust, Angela Hillery, said: Our hearts break today for Augustine\u2019s wife and young family. We remain committed to supporting them through this time. Augustine epitomised what we stand for here at NHFT. He was committed to making a difference and giving people a second chance. Augustine cared for some of the most vulnerable in our society; lives have been transformed because of him. Colleagues at NHFT have set up a Just Giving page in his memory, to support his family, and donations can be made online here. The number of people to die in England\u2019s hospitals after contracting Covid-19 has risen by 207 to 22,972. NHS England confirmed on Saturday that, of the 207 new deaths: 47 occurred on 8 May 90 occurred on 7 May 23 occurred on 6 May The figures also show 23 of the new deaths took place between May 1 and May 5, 19 took place in April, while the remaining five deaths occurred in March, with the earliest new death taking place on 12 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published today by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most hospital deaths occurring on a single day, with a current total of 884. Public Health Wales said a total of 1,099 people had died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, an increase of nine on Friday\u2019s figures. A further 118 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of positive cases there to 11,121. A total of 1,847 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 36 on Friday, the Scottish government has announced. Recent statistics show 13,305 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 156 from 13,149 the day before. There are 93 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, an increase of nine on Friday. There are 1,585 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, an increase of one. Since 5 March, 3,016 people who have tested positive for coronavirus have been able to leave hospital. A \u201cdedicated and loving\u201d nurse who contracted coronavirus has died five weeks after first being placed on a ventilator. Onyenachi Obasi, 51, had been working as a health visitor and nurse, and her family said she \u201cgave her life doing what she loved\u201d. Her niece Ijeoma Uzoukwu told PA Media: We are just heartbroken. She was really loving, really sweet and a really cute person. She was a good example of unconditional love and just loved everyone. She was so giving and always had an ear - she took people as they were. She loved her job, but that is what caused her to fall ill in the first place. Obasi, who had been living in Barking and Dagenham, had no underlying health conditions and told her family that she felt she had a duty to work, and help, during the pandemic. However, a few days after caring for a Covid-positive patient, she fell ill herself before eventually being admitted to hospital. Her niece said: Any normal situation I would go and see her, and be by her side. But because of the lockdown, we weren\u2019t able to do that, and that was really hard for our family. Obasi was placed on a ventilator for five weeks and was slowly recovering before she caught an infection. She died in the early hours of 6 May at Queen\u2019s hospital, in Romford. Uzoukwu has organised an online fundraiser to help provide for her 19-year-old son, who is vulnerable and was dependant on her. Boris Johnson has issued the public a reminder to keep their distance from each other \u201cif you are leaving the house this weekend\u201d. Speaking of reminders, this is Aaron Walawalkar here. I\u2019m taking over the blog while my colleague Lucy takes a break. Thank you for following our coverage and please do DM me your UK coronavirus updates on Twitter @AaronWala. Anti-racism campaigners have staged a physically-distanced demonstration outside a Manchester petrol station where police used a stun gun on a man in front of his distressed young son. A group of about 15 people gathered at a petrol station forecourt in Stretford, Manchester, where the incident took place on Wednesday night. Mobile phone footage widely shared on social media showed an altercation between a black man and two white police officers. The man is seen standing next to a marked police car and puts down his crying son before moments later he falls to the ground as a stun gun is fired by one of the officers. Among the protesters at the event staged by Stand Up to Racism on Saturday was Paul Davidson, a minister at the Church of God of Prophecy. He told PA Media: I am here because this news has outraged black people nationally. We are obviously keen to find out what the details are and whether there are other circumstances we haven\u2019t learned from the immediate clip. But if the immediate clip is anything to go by then people have questions to answer and we should expect answers as a community. This sort of behaviour should not be expected by anyone in a civilised society. Greater Manchester police has voluntarily referred the matter to the Independence Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Read more about the incident here: Greggs has reopened a small number of stores as it continues to trial safety measures. The Newcastle-based baker is selling its popular products, including coffee, pasties and cakes, at an undisclosed number of shops in the Tyneside area. The gradual reopening process has followed a series of trials with staff testing working practices while remaining shut to customers. A Greggs spokesman said: We are initially operating shop trials behind closed doors in order to test the effectiveness of our new operational safety measures. We will continue to review this and will invite walk-in customers into our shops only when we can do so in the controlled manner we intended. The Greggs chief executive, Roger Whiteside, issued a statement on the firm\u2019s website, stressing the trials were in line with the government\u2019s Covid-19 guidelines. He said: These trials are being conducted across a number of channels, including delivery through Just Eat, Click + Collect and walk-in customers. Colleague and customer safety continue to be the primary focus of the decisions we take as we start to reopen our shops. Thank you for your patience while we work hard to play our part in getting the nation back up and running again and serving the communities in which we operate. More potential migrants have been spotted at Dover as the huge increase in crossings since lockdown was imposed continues. Pictures taken at the busy trade port show people wearing face masks being processed by officials, following reports of large numbers of people seeking to migrating to enter Britain on Friday. A humanitarian charity said it was little wonder that so many people were risking their lives to cross the dangerous Dover straits because of \u201cawful conditions\u201d in French refugee camps. The pandemic \u201chas made a bad situation life-threateningly worse\u201d, Care4Calais said. The Home Office has yet to confirm how many migrants have arrived in the past two days. The department has only confirmed that, \u201cBorder Force is currently dealing with a number of ongoing small boat incidents off the Kent coast\u201d, on Saturday. Earlier this week, the home secretary, Priti Patel, acknowledged that a recent increase in the number of migrant boats making the dangerous crossing of the channel ws linked to the lockdown. Since lockdown was announced in Britain on 23 March, at least 609 migrants have been intercepted by UK authorities and brought ashore, according to data gathered by the PA Media news agency. This is more than half of the entire total for 2020, which stands at at least 987. And these figures do not include crossings on Friday or Saturday, which the Home Office has so far refused to disclose. Clare Moseley, founder of Care4Calais, said: It\u2019s little wonder people living in France\u2019s refugee camps are desperate to make this dangerous crossing, given the awful conditions they face there. Coronavirus has made a bad situation life-threateningly worse. People are squeezed into tiny areas, they can\u2019t social distance, and the support they relied on for survival is drastically reduced. These people are fleeing terrifying situations in some of the most dangerous parts of the world. They aim for the UK because they want to be safe. Many have family or other connections, and others know our language and want to integrate and contribute. Now more than ever, we need to give them a safe and humane way to have their requests for asylum fairly heard, that\u2019s the way to end chaotic and dangerous channel crossings once and for all. Responding to Labour\u2019s proposal for an extension to the evictions ban, and for renters to be given two years to pay back rent arrears, Amina Gichinga from the London Renters Union said this did not go far enough and rents had to be suspended altogether to protect renters: Deferring rent just means renters will get into enormous debts - or be made homeless. Unemployment is going to rocket and we are not going to be able to afford a massive hike in our rent over two years. We need rents to be suspended during this crisis, and the evictions ban needs to be permanent, so no one else is made homeless because of the pandemic. The downturn is going to continue for a long time and many people are already in arrears. Without greater protection for renters, we\u2019re heading for a chaotic rent debt and eviction crisis. Research suggests millions in the UK are having to choose between paying rent and eating, after a survey found that six in 10 renters said they had suffered financially because of the pandemic. A separate poll found that up to 1.7 million private sector workers fear they will lose their jobs this summer and a growing number of people will need to rely on welfare benefits for the first time to cover basic costs. In its five-point plan due to be presented to the government, Labour proposes an extension to the temporary ban on evictions for six months or however long is needed to implement the legal changes. They also ask that renters should get at least two years to pay back any arrears accrued during this period; and that the government should bring forward its proposal to scrap section 21 \u201cno-fault\u201d evictions and outlaw evictions on the grounds of rent arrears if the arrears were accrued because of hardship caused by the coronavirus crisis. The Coastguard has said that on Friday it had the highest number of callouts since lockdown began as people \u201cignore\u201d the government\u2019s stay-at-home message. It said there were 97 incidents, 54% more than the average of 63 recorded for the previous month. Matt Leat, duty commander with HM Coastguard, urged people to stop \u201cignoring\u201d the government\u2019s measures for the sake of the NHS and all those on the frontline: I completely understand that the weather and the bank holiday coupled with the fact that we\u2019ve been in this lockdown situation for just over six weeks has tempted people out to our beautiful coasts. However, as the government said only yesterday, it\u2019s really vital that we all continue to observe the guidance. Every time we get a 999 or distress call, we will always respond but the minute we send in a rescue response, we\u2019re putting our frontline responders at risk as well as putting the NHS under avoidable pressure. Please, please continue to observe the StayHomeSaveLives message - it\u2019s still in place for a reason. Exercise locally and stretch your legs, not our resources. Campaigners have called for a fundamental redesign of the transport system to help prevent a bounce-back in air pollution levels once the lockdown ends. Nine organisations \u2013 Greenpeace UK, CPRE, Cycling UK, the Environmental Defence Fund, Global Action Plan, Living Streets, Possible, Transport Action Network and Transport &amp; Environment \u2013 have written an open letter to the secretaries of state for transport and the environment, as well as the chancellor, leaders of local and regional authorities, and city mayors. The group\u2019s demands include wider pavements, protected cycle tracks, restricted through-traffic in residential and shopping streets through the installation of bus gates, bollards and planters, networks of low-traffic neighbourhoods, and walking and cycling to be prioritised along main roads. Ministers are understood to be preparing to recommend that commuters use bicycles for journeys to work to reduce the number of people using public transport, according to PA Media. The letter calls for \u201cimmediate action\u201d to lock in some of the reduction in road traffic and the introduction of new measures to ensure that \u201cwhen the nation gets moving again, it does so in a cleaner, safer way\u201d. Milan and Brussels have already taken steps to prioritise walkers and cyclists in their city centres, according to Greenpeace UK\u2019s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom. She said: There are many things about the lockdown people will be glad to leave behind, but cleaner air is not one of them. Yet there\u2019s a real risk that congestion and toxic pollution will be back on our streets as soon as restrictions are lifted. Some of the world\u2019s major cities are already reshaping the urban space to allow people to go out and about safely while keeping the air clean, and we need our political leaders to follow suit. More than 650,000 people across the globe tuned in as the inimitable Andy Serkis completed a live theatrical reading of the entire Hobbit novel in just under 11 hours as part of a Covid-19 fundraiser. Starting his performance at 10am BST on Friday, Serkis, 56, inhabited each character as he told JRR Tolkien\u2019s classic 1937 story. The critically acclaimed actor is best known for playing Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit films, and was awarded by Bafta earlier this year for his pioneering work in motion-capture in cinema. He had raised more than \u00a3280,000 \u2013 with more than 20,000 donations from over 70 countries flooding in \u2013 by the time he finished just before 9pm. He paused only at 11am to observe a two-minute silence for VE Day, and for a spot of lunch and loo breaks throughout the day. All donations through the GoFundMe campaign are to be split equally between NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, the latter of which Serkis has been an ambassador for more than six years. Soon after completing the Hobbitathon, Serkis said: Thank you ALL so much for tuning in and for supporting NHS Charities Together and Best Beginnings, who between them support frontline workers, parents and babies. I am truly humbled by the response! Because of you, we raised more than \u00a3280,000 and counting! Thank you again to @harpercollins and the Tolkien Estate for making this all happen. We are going to investigate with them more opportunities to share today\u2019s \u201cone-time\u201d live event, so stay tuned. And with that, I bid you goodnight from London - and to you and your loved ones, stay well. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said he expected Wales\u2019s \u201cvery modest\u201d lockdown easing to be in line with what Boris Johnson will announce for England. On Friday, Drakeford stole a march on the UK government when he announced that Wales would remain in lockdown for another three weeks with modest adjustments, including plans to reopen libraries and allow outdoor exercise more than once a day. Amid signs of a rift between Wales and Westminster, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that \u201conly the very smallest and most modest steps ... are allowable at this time\u201d and he remained keen on the four nations working as one and expected Johnson to announce similar changes. He said: We\u2019ll hear from the prime minister on Sunday the details of what he proposes for England, my view is we\u2019ll be very much in line with one another. Our new regime won\u2019t come in until Monday, so we\u2019ll move in a timely way together across the UK and I still think that is very much a preferable route. On BBC Breakfast, Drakeford said it was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d his intention for his announcement on Friday to pressurise the prime minister to come into step with Wales; it was merely the essence of devolution. He said: It\u2019s inevitable that we have to fine-tune that approach to meet the different circumstances of different parts of the United Kingdom but I think that we will move forward in the same basic way. My responsibility is to tell people in Wales the regime that they will be facing over the next three weeks. Our three-week review ended on Friday and I was keen to make sure that people in Wales know the decisions that their government are making on their behalf. It\u2019s not intended to be a form of pressure or anything else on anybody else, it\u2019s simply in a devolved United Kingdom - 20 years of devolution - to discharge the responsibilities that we have in Wales in a way that demonstrates to people in Wales the decisions that we are making for them. Good morning and welcome to the UK coronavirus live blog. The next steps in Britain\u2019s lockdown plan are becoming clearer after the government indicated it would reopen garden centres, encourage commuters to use bikes, allow outdoor exercise more than once a day, and potentially quarantine foreign visitors. Ahead of Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d speech at 7pm tomorrow, the Times (paywall) reports that he is likely to announce a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travellers into Britain\u2019s ports and airports, including Britons returning from abroad, as part of measures aimed at avoiding a second peak. People arriving in the UK would have to self-isolate at a private residence, potentially having to provide an address at the border. The new restriction is expected to take effect at the end of this month. The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said: It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been asking ministers to clarify for weeks now. I raised it with the minister for the fifth time on Thursday because it\u2019s caused real confusion. [Britons who were abroad] have been brought back in relatively large numbers and many of them are telling us that they have no information or advice given out about what they should be doing when they get home. They travel back from the airport on public transport, they go back to their families and they\u2019re worried that they\u2019re putting their families and other members of the public at risk, and some of them are coming from parts of the country where we are seeing an increase in infection rates, and so they\u2019re really worried about it, the wider public are really worried about it, and for weeks we\u2019ve had mixed messages being briefed out of government. The trade body Airlines UK said the government needed \u201ca credible exit plan with weekly reviews to ensure the restrictions are working and still required\u201d. However, the Airport Operators Association\u2019s chief executive, Karen Dee, added the move would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the aviation industry and the wider economy: If quarantine is a necessary tool for fighting Covid-19, then the government should act decisively to protect the hundreds of thousands of airport-related and travel-related jobs across the UK. Throughout the day I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest developments on the pandemic. If you would like to get in touch with a story or suggestions, please feel free to do so \u2013 your comments are always welcome and apologies in advance if I can\u2019t reply to all of you.

      "bodyText": "As coronavirus infections approached 4 million worldwide, and Russia became a new hotspot for the outbreak, Belarus defied worries to hold a parade marking the 75th anniversary of victory over the Nazis, with thousands of people in attendance including elderly veterans. South Korea, which is trying to relax physical distancing regulations, on Saturday shut down more than 2,100 clubs and bars in the capital after a new cluster of cases emerged, apparently linked to a single individual who had gone out while infected. The cases are a reminder of how long and challenging the battle against coronavirus is likely to be even in countries that had initial success in containing it. In Italy, Milan\u2019s mayor has warned he might have to reimpose rules if people did not respect physical distancing. And although Spain\u2019s daily death toll continues to fall, its exit plans at present will only allow half of the population living in less badly affected areas to start moving back towards normal life. The growing global economic crisis is particularly acute in places where authorities have few resources to support those who have lost work. In Afghanistan at least seven people were killed and more than a dozen injured when police opened fire on a protest against corruption in food distribution projects. In the US, the worst-hit country in the world, President Donald Trump claimed on Friday that Covid-19 would \u201cgo away without a vaccine\u201d, but also said he was expecting 95,000 or more deaths. His remarks came after a week of trauma in the country, which saw deaths top 77,000, unemployment rise to nearly 15% and the disease breach the inner circles of the White House, raising questions about the protection of top officials. The latest confirmed case was the US vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary, who is married to a key Trump aide, anti-immigration hardliner Stephen Miller. That news came the day after Trump\u2019s personal valet tested positive. Globally, Covid-19 has killed more than 275,000 people, and over 3.96 million infections have been confirmed. That total is likely to pass 4 million over the weekend, and does not include many people who have not been able to access testing. Russia registered more than 10,000 new Covid-19 cases in the last day, the sixth in a row at that level. It is now the fifth-worst hit country, approaching nearly 200,000 confirmed infections. However, its death toll of 1,827 is far lower than in European countries with similar numbers of cases, including Italy, the UK, France and Spain. The crisis led the government in Moscow to cancel 9 May celebrations of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. The festivities would have crowned a historic political season in Russia, including a symbolic referendum to amend Russia\u2019s constitution and reset Putin\u2019s term limits, allowing him to remain in the Kremlin until 2036. Instead Putin is ruling from a bunker, as plummeting oil prices devastate the economy, and the crisis puts his political plans on hold. The day\u2019s festivities were moved mostly online, and a parade replaced by a flypast. VE Day celebrations went ahead in Belarus, where president Alexander Lukashenko appeared to relish upstaging Russia and defying Moscow\u2019s warnings that its lax approach could \u201cbring a sharp increase in the number of those infected\u201d. \u201cLet the parade in Minsk today be the only one in the post-Soviet space,\u201d Lukashenko said. \u201cIt will be held in honour of all Soviet fighters who liberated the world from Nazism.\u201d The coronavirus crisis has inflamed US-China relations, with public disputes over the origin and handling of the pandemic exacerbated by other showdowns, including escalating restrictions on and expulsions of foreign journalists. Washington on Friday unveiled new rules that will require Chinese nationals working as journalists for non-US publications to renew their visas every 90 days, after Beijing forced US journalists working for prominent publications to leave China. Tensions are likely to rise further after leaders of the US congressional foreign affairs committee wrote to nearly 60 countries asking them to support Taiwan\u2019s participation in the World Health Organization. Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations and is excluded from the WHO because of Chinese objections; Beijing considers the self-ruled island a renegade province. It has been seeking to join a ministerial meeting this month of the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, with backing from Washington and several US allies, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the pandemic. In South Korea, measures to close nightlife venues in Seoul were imposed by mayor Park Won-soon, after 18 new cases were reported in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday, the Associated Press reported. South Korea at one point had the highest number of infections outside mainland China but a comprehensive testing programme and rigorous contact tracing allowed it to bring the virus under control while it proliferated elsewhere. However the latest cases show how easily the virus could re-emerge. South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or KCDC, said all but one of the new cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who visited three clubs in Seoul\u2019s Itaewon district last Saturday before testing positive days later. In total, there have been 40 infections linked to club-goers, mostly in Seoul but also in three other cities. The national government has urged entertainment venues to close or step up anti-virus measures including distancing and temperature checks. Elsewhere: The Chinese president Xi Jinping has offered the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, support in tackling the coronavirus, state media said on Saturday. As debates rage in other countries about the return of professional football, games will be played in the Faroe Islands on Saturday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645. A French MP has failed in her bid to to get \u201clove\u201d added to the list of \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d that must be given for anyone to travel more than 100km (62 miles) in the country. Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, approved amendments to the country\u2019s state of emergency that granted him and security agencies additional powers, saying they were needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said on Friday that he aimed to present plans next week to reopen the economy, as key sectors like car-making look to begin business again after over a month of quarantine measures. Argentina will extend a quarantine covering its capital Buenos Aires but relax restrictions in the rest of the country.",

      "bodyText": "Improvements in communication, personal protective equipment training, initial infection responses and social distancing have emerged as key areas of improvement if Australia is to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections after lockdowns ease. While the government has linked the uptake of its Covidsafe tracing app to a return to normal, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, in April identified the bolstering of health authorities\u2019 ability to respond to and contain localised clusters as an essential step to reassessing measures. Despite Australia\u2019s relative success in containing the virus nationwide, and the government contracting a private medical operator to help respond to declared outbreaks, the root causes behind clusters including Newmarch House, Cedar Meats abattoir, and northwestern Tasmania, have exposed key lessons in how to react to future outbreaks. While the closure of international borders makes a repeat of the Ruby Princess debacle unlikely in the near future, leading epidemiologists are already promoting principles to stop outbreaks creating a second coronavirus wave in Australia. Newmarch House Just under a month after recording its first case \u2013 a part-time carer who had worked six shifts with mild symptoms \u2013 on 11 April, the aged-care facility in Sydney\u2019s west continues to be one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in the country. As of Friday, there were 69 confirmed coronavirus cases (37 residents) linked to the aged-care home, the 17th resident death was announced on Saturday. The aged-care sector was one of the first subjected to tightened social distancing restrictions, and while a limit of two adult visitors at one time \u2013 once a day in a resident\u2019s room was enforced nationally \u2013 many providers went further and banned physical visits to avoid the virus entering a facility. As the sector looks set to finalise a national code for visitation to ensure all families have access to residents, the deteriorating situation at Newmarch House should change the way providers respond to initial cases, according to Joseph Ibrahim, a professor of forensic medicine and head of the health law and ageing research unit at Monash University. While outbreaks have been seen at other aged-care facilities around the country, most notably at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge, also in Sydney, Ibrahim said residents at Newmarch should not have been allowed to remain at the home after being diagnosed. He says this is because personal protective equipment \u2013 gloves, face masks and gowns \u2013 are difficult to wear properly for experienced hospital staff, and even harder for aged-care staff who were not properly trained in its use before the pandemic hit. \u201cStaff aren\u2019t trained to do this, they shouldn\u2019t be criticised. They\u2019re now being asked to have a level of attention to detail regarding infection control that you would normally see in a highly specialised hospital unit, what you\u2019d normally see with oncology patients.\u201d Breaches of PPE protocol have been levelled against several Newmarch staff, including against one surge staff clinician contracted by the federal government. Ibrahim said breaches are to be expected given the level of infection control required and activities involved in aged care. \u201cIt\u2019s not as straightforward as everyone thinks. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s 30 staff, and they\u2019ve got to see a resident three times a day. That means they have to put on and take off PPE 90 times, which is 180 conditions of use. So if they follow it right 90% of the time, then there\u2019s still 18 breaches.\u201d Ibrahim says it\u2019s too late to evacuate remaining Covid-19 positive residents to stop the spread in Newmarch, but says governments should appoint aged-care facility controllers to be in charge of groups of homes, and for them to report infections and issues regarding PPE and management to the health authorities as soon as they arise. Cedar Meats Revelations this week that staff at the Melbourne meat processing plant now linked to 62 cases of Covid-19 were not informed they could stay away from work for several days after the company had been told two workers were infected, have highlighted shortcomings experts warn need to be addressed. While operator Cedar Meats was informed by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services on 27 April that a worker had tested positive the previous day, it has emerged an earlier employee case was diagnosed, but not reported to the operator at first instance, because they had been contracted by a labour hire company. Further reports of an earlier confirmed case at the facility was recorded as early as 2 April, and an account from a worker who told the Guardian on the condition of anonymity that they were \u201cvery scared\u201d but felt they couldn\u2019t stay home from work after a case was announced later in April. These cases show the importance of communication protocols and employer messaging, says Peter Collignon, a professor of infectious diseases at the Australian National University. \u201cThis is going to be a problem as businesses reopen, when you have contractors and subcontractors, and not just in abattoirs but also cleaners who work in hospitals via labour hire companies.\u201d Collignon thinks the \u201ccommunication chain needs to be better than what\u2019s occurred in the past\u201d, and wants to see a protocol for notification of a confirmed case introduced so state health authorities, employers, employees and labour hire companies are all looped in. \u201cThere just needs to be a much more transparent process once there\u2019s that first diagnosis.\u201d Collignon says future clusters are \u201cunavoidable\u201d, but thinks what poses a greater risk of them causing second waves of Covid-19 is an attitude that workers feel they need to go into work. He says employees need to feel comfortable they won\u2019t risk their job safety if they don\u2019t turn up for work and must assume any sickness or symptoms they notice could be Covid-19 and to get tested. \u201cOverwhelmingly you see clusters and outbreaks are occurring around working environments, because people are presenting to work when sick, often with mild symptoms. North-west Tasmania outbreak Collignon also says worker attitudes were the most important lesson authorities took from the outbreak of coronavirus cases at a hospital in north-west Tasmania in early April, which saw two hospitals in Burnie shut, non-essential business banned, and more than 1,000 healthcare workers and up to 4,000 family members forced into self isolation. While an interim report into the outbreak found the initial cluster was linked to cases from the Ruby Princess, it made key recommendations including the digitisation of staff rosters to aid communication and contact tracing, the limiting of staff and patient movement between facilities, and addressing the underlying reasons behind staff working when sick. Collignon says mildly sick workers must not feel they need to go into work to support colleagues, especially in a healthcare and aged-care setting. \u201cWhere we\u2019ve seen clusters, either people have gone to work when sick, in nursing homes, like at Newmarch, where they\u2019re going to have to be closer than a metre and a half to the residents when they work. But also in the hospital in Tasmania. \u201cOften it\u2019s staff who think they\u2019re different and don\u2019t have to stick to the rules. The reality is people went to work when they were sick and people didn\u2019t keep physical distancing. These outbreaks were avoidable.\u201d Collignon also says while a workplace-wide shutdown was the default reaction before lockdowns came in, future clusters wouldn\u2019t require an entire office or facility to close if employers enforced social distancing in their reopened offices. \u201cThe advantage for bosses making sure the 1.5 metre distancing rule is observed, means there\u2019s a markedly lower chance that one worker being diagnosed will require everyone to quarantine. Outbreaks can be avoided if they keep distancing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A special commission of inquiry has held five days of hearings into the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has so far has been linked to 21 deaths and almost 700 cases of Covid-19 across Australia. The inquiry, overseen by Bret Walker SC, had two days of hearings on 22 and 23 April, and then three days of hearings this week. Here\u2019s what the inquiry has so far been told during interviews with 14 different witnesses. 19 February NSW Health developed draft guidelines on how to deal with cruise ships during the Covid-19 outbreak. They stated that if \u201ca respiratory outbreak\u201d affected 1% of a ship\u2019s passengers, that could prompt the ship to be labelled medium or high risk. For medium and high-risk ships, a New South Wales Health assessment team must board the ship prior to passenger disembarkation. Under a high-risk scenario passengers were not to be allowed to leave until Covid-19 test results had come in. Under a medium-risk scenario, passengers \u201cassessed as well\u201d were allowed to leave before test results came in. Under a low-risk scenario, all passengers were free to disembark the ship \u201cregardless of any symptoms they might be suffering from\u201d. 22 February Dr Kerry Chant, the NSW chief health officer, published a letter to the cruise ship industry telling them NSW Health had adopted enhanced measures and now required them to provide \u201ca full acute diseases log\u201d 24 hours before a ship arrived in port. 24 February The Ruby Princess left Sydney Harbour on a 13-day cruise to New Zealand, returning on 8 March. 6 March NSW Health emailed the ship\u2019s doctor, Dr Ilse von Watzdorf, requesting the acute respiratory diseases log by 9am on 7 March. 7 March The NSW Health assessment team of four medical professionals conducted a risk assessment for the ship and \u201cassessed it as medium risk\u201d. Less than 1% of passengers had an \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d, but two passengers had been identified as having recently been in a foreign country of concern for Covid-19. 8 March At 8am, von Watzdorf sent the acute respiratory diseases log to NSW Health. She also told them that after the ship had made an announcement at 5pm on 7 March for people to report any respiratory symptoms or fever, the log number had increased from 30 to 170. The Ruby Princess docked in Sydney. The NSW Health assessment team boarded the Ruby Princess. Instead of 170 people with relevant symptoms, they discovered over 360 passengers and crew with \u201crespiratory disease symptoms of some kind\u201d. Passengers who had no symptoms, as well as those examined and cleared by the assessment team, were allowed to leave Nine swabs were taken for Covid-19 testing. All later returned negative results. Kelly-Anne Ressler, a NSW senior epidemiologist, met von Watzdorf in person for the first time. Ressler said von Watzdorf told her \u201cwe just have to stop all cruise ships\u201d. Ressler said: \u201cIt was a passing comment, she just said we have to stop all cruises.\u201d Ressler said von Watzdorf sent her a Whatsapp message saying \u201cthank you for your cooperation, hopefully they\u2019ll [the passengers] behave this cruise\u201d, which included an \u201cemoji looking like an exasperated doctor\u201d. Ressler said that meant \u201chopefully they won\u2019t become unwell\u201d. 2,700 passengers board the Ruby Princess and it leaves Sydney for another trip to New Zealand. 14 March The ship docked in Wellington and five Covid-19 swabs were taken from sick passengers. After they were tested, all were returned negative. 15 March The ship docked in Napier and passengers were allowed onshore. Counsel assisting the inquiry, Richard Bealsey SC, told the inquiry \u201cthere are reports [yet to be examined by the inquiry] of an outbreak of Covid-19 in that city said to be related to the ship.\u201d Von Watzdorf emailed Ressler at NSW Health and wrote: \u201cIt seems we are in the early phases of an influenza A outbreak on board\u201d. Between 15-18 March The ship\u2019s medical team on board took more influenza swabs than Covid-19 swabs, in an imbalance that Ressler said was \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d. Ressler told the inquiry that patients could be swabbed for both influenza and Covid-19 at the same time, though it was \u201cnot ideal\u201d. The ship only had 25 Covid-19 swabs on board. 17 March At 4pm, NSW Health emailed von Watzdorf and requested the acute respiratory disease log by 9am on 18 March. 18 March \u2013 9am-5pm At 9.30am, both von Watzdorf and a Sydney-based port agent for Carnival Australia, who operate the Ruby Princess, sent the acute respiratory disease log to NSW Health. It said 104 of 3,795 people on board presented to the ship\u2019s medical centre with acute respiratory disease (2.7%). Twenty-six people presented with influenza-like illness (0.94%). It also said 48 people had been tested for influenza A, but only 24 had tested positive. At 4.40pm, the NSW health assessment panel assessed the ship as low-risk. The inquiry heard that this log, upon which the assessment was based, \u201cwas not up to date\u201d. 18 March 5pm \u2013 19 March 3am At 7pm, a Carnival Australia port agent, Dobrila Tokovic, called NSW Ambulance to book ambulance transfers for two sick passengers to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred hospital at 3am the next morning. The ambulance operator was told that both passengers had \u201cfebrile acute respiratory disease, they had both tested negative to flu, they had been swabbed for Covid-19\u201d and that protective equipment should be worn by paramedics. Tokovic told the inquiry they usually \u201calways select St Vincent\u2019s\u201d, but on this occasion she told paramedics that \u201cNew South Wales [sic]\u201d had asked to take them to RPA. Beasley told the inquiry Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and asked if Tokovic if she recalled discussing that fact. Tokovic said she did not recall. Tokovic and von Watzdorf said that the ambulances were not called for Covid-19 reasons, but for the passengers\u2019 other health issues. An ambulance officer then called the NSW Port Authority\u2019s duty harbourmaster, Cameron Butchart, to raise concerns about the mention of Covid-19. Butchart told the inquiry he cancelled the booking for the Ruby Princess to dock due to the occupational health and safety risks to Port Authority staff. Emma Fensom, the acting CEO of the NSW Port Authority, said she emailed Butchart to tell him to \u201cdeny pilotage\u201d for the ship \u2013 meaning they would not send an employee on board to help it dock. At an unclear time, Butchard also received an email from his NSW Port Authority supervisor which told him that policy was that if there were Covid-19 tests on board a cruise ship, with results to come, it should be \u201ctreated as if it has a positive result\u201d. The email also said that NSW Health had assessed it as \u201clow risk\u201d. Butchart said he \u201cdid not understand\u201d this email, and that the \u201clow risk\u201d label introduced \u201can unfortunate element\u201d into his decision-making. At an unclear time, Butchart was also called by a person from the Department of Home Affairs, and an official from the Australian Border Force. He said the ABF representative \u201ccertainly had concerns with the situation\u201d and Butchart offered to \u201cturn it [the ship] around\u201d. The booking to berth and the pilot were later reinstated. In a call to an ambulance officer, Peter Dilonardo, Butchart said: \u201cCan you guys just treat it as corona \u2026 We will put our pilot on, we will tell our pilot to wear all the PPE.\u201d 19 March \u2013 3am onwards Tokovic told the inquiry that the Ruby Princess was scheduled to arrive at 6am, but \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because it had 13 Covid-19 swabs that needed urgent testing. At 3am, the Ruby Princess docked and ambulances arrived. Trainee paramedic Simeon Pridmore said the duty operations manager told him that both patients were \u201csuspected Covid-19\u201d positive. He wrote in his case description \u201cTx [transport] suspected Covid-19\u201d, and that \u201con board testing showed negative for influenza and [the patient was] suspected covid\u201d. Pridmore said this description was \u201can amalgamation\u201d of information from von Watzdorf and his patient. Another paramedic, Mathew Symonds, said he boarded the ship and went to its medical centre and one of the passengers was receiving oxygen treatment using an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d. Tokovic also told the inquiry that she heard the on-board doctor discuss one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d with paramedics. \u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said. Pridmore said the ambulance he was in was taken \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when it arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. Tokovic said she took swabs off the ship and gave them to a driver who was a subcontractor hired by Carnival Australia to take them to the laboratory. The inquiry heard that swabs delivered to a lab by 10am would return results by 4pm. At 6am, Tokovic said she met with three ABF officers and one from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment at the wharf. She said ABF officers were \u201caware\u201d that 11 passengers were in isolation on board with influenza-like illnesses. All 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark the Ruby Princess. At 4pm, Ressler called the laboratory and found the swabs had not been processed yet, because \u201cthe technician didn\u2019t realise they were cruise ship samples, and they were not tested as priority\u201d. The samples were then put on the next run. 20 March At 8am, the results from the tests were returned, 16 hours after they were expected to, and showed three people out of 13 had tested positive. NSW Health discovered that one person who tested positive was not listed on the ship\u2019s illness log. After that was discovered, they requested von Watzdorf send through an updated log that revealed more passengers had been sick. The inquiry continues.",

A similar payment is due in July.</p> <p>Now Acoss wants a thorough look at the social security system, including family payments, rental assistance, social housing and support for people with disabilities. It is working to model options but overall seeks broader reform, with the increased jobseeker payment retained until a system is in place that protects people from poverty.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s obviously a clear need to fix the social safety net,\u201d says Acoss\u2019s chief executive Dr Cassandra Goldie.

      "bodyText": "What does Australia owe Racheal Wellman, just 23? What are her chances in this country now, and as Australia begins to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic? Wellman worked as a barista 25 to 30 hours a week in a St Kilda cafe. It was a casual job, so no paid holidays, no sick pay, no job security. But it was \u201cfantastic\u201d, she says, especially after being unemployed for a time, couchsurfing at friends\u2019 houses and sometimes sleeping rough at Flinders Street station. Wellman lost her job when the cafe \u2013 Dear Liza \u2013 was forced to offer only takeaways at the end of March. Right now, there is a safety net for her and about a million people like her. Because she had not worked at the cafe for 12 months, she was ineligible for the higher wage subsidy, known as jobkeeper. She can claim unemployment benefits, or jobseeker, and with it comes the government\u2019s $550 a fortnight coronavirus supplement. She is eligible for a maximum of $1,115.70 a fortnight, roughly double the amount of the pre-corona benefit \u2013 but only until 24 September. She can live off that while she looks for work. She can pay her $225 a week rent, dropped temporarily to $185 by her landlord (she will have to pay that back later). She can eat and pay bills. But could she live on half of that \u2013 around $280 a week \u2013 if the government keeps its word and abolishes the \u201cemergency response measure\u201d, as prime minister Scott Morrison has called the supplement, in a few months? The government says its priority is to get a million Australians back to work, but what if Wellman struggles to find a job during what is expected to be a prolonged recession, with 10% unemployment or higher? If she does return to hospitality \u2013 an industry decimated by coronavirus restrictions \u2013 should it be on the same terms as before, or would that leave her vulnerable again to the next economic shock? \u201cIn my life, in everyone\u2019s life,\u201d Wellman says, \u201cI feel like now\u2019s a great time to almost click the reset button. We shouldn\u2019t go back to the way we were. We should be a better version of the way we were.\u201d So far, the federal government is resisting calls, even from within its own ranks, for the jobseeker payment to be kept at higher levels than previously, even if it is wound back somewhat from where it is today. Labor and the Greens also want a higher level of jobseeker when the crisis is over. The temporary doubling at a cost of $14bn was \u201cnot a change in the government\u2019s view about the broader role of the social safety net in Australia\u201d, Morrison has said. But he also wants \u201cfresh eyes\u201d on options for institutions and the economy, without the weight of ideology. On Tuesday, treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the National Press Club that the principles guiding the government had not changed: personal responsibility, choice, rewarding effort, \u201cwhilst ensuring a safety net which is underpinned by a sense of decency and fairness\u201d. If ideology was absent, say many economists, social welfare academics and organisations that work to alleviate poverty, Australia would rethink a social security system they say was far from decent and fair, but instead punitive, trapping people in poverty rather than assisting them to find work. Australia\u2019s peak body for community services, the Australian Council for Social Service (Acoss), has long argued that jobseeker \u2013 previously known as Newstart \u2013 was, at about $40 a day for an individual, impossible for people to live on and was bad for the economy. The sector was not alone, with major business groups such as the Business Council of Australia, economists and even former prime minister John Howard suggesting the low rate had become counterproductive. Acoss welcomed the doubling of the payment as the best way to both quickly alleviate the suffering of the newly unemployed and to stimulate the economy. The use of social security payments to boost demand seems to be working \u2013 a study found that the $5bn announcement to give six million pensioners and other social security recipients a one-off $750 payment from 31 March had offset a plunge in consumer spending. A similar payment is due in July. Now Acoss wants a thorough look at the social security system, including family payments, rental assistance, social housing and support for people with disabilities. It is working to model options but overall seeks broader reform, with the increased jobseeker payment retained until a system is in place that protects people from poverty. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a clear need to fix the social safety net,\u201d says Acoss\u2019s chief executive Dr Cassandra Goldie. It had become \u201ctoxic and brutal\u201d before the pandemic upended the economy. Goldie and others in the sector praise the government for its fast and smart use of the social security system to channel payments. The coronavirus supplement will also be available to those on youth allowance, Austudy and parenting payments. It is not available for the more than one million temporary visa holders in the workforce, a gap that has been criticised as inhumane. Prof Peter Whiteford, of the Austraian National University\u2019s Crawford School, analysed Australia\u2019s unemployment benefits before the crisis and found them to be well below the OECD average. The doubling of jobseeker was the most significant change to social security Australia had seen since the dole was introduced in the 1940s. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable really, even if it\u2019s only temporary,\u201d he says. For Goldie, it was a signal that the government \u201clistened to the experts\u201d. It needed to continue to do so rather than see the payments as a short-term, one-off, fix. Acoss had been arguing for a $95 a week increase to jobseeker, far less than the government\u2019s coronavirus supplement. It won\u2019t put a figure on the increase it now wants to be permanent, but its aim is to prevent people living in poverty, and the OECD poverty line for Australia is $500 a week for a single person with no dependants. That\u2019s not much less than the temporary jobseeker payment. Some of the increased spending could also potentially be retargeted to other areas. \u201cPeople have a variety of needs,\u201d Goldie says. \u201cIf you have children, we haven\u2019t had a real increase in family payments for a very long time. It\u2019s nowhere near adequate to what it needs to be now. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be withdrawing any of this income support. We need to be fixing the level of payments for families and individuals so they are protected from poverty. We need to move forwards not backwards.\u201d Goldie thinks the community is ready for the discussion. \u201cThe country came together, and I believe was proud to have your back. That\u2019s what we need to stick with \u2013 to leave behind the old politics, of lifters and leaners, divisive stuff. Whenever you lose your job, which is always awful, we need a social security system to protect people from poverty if it happens to you.\u201d Ideology has weaved its way through Australia\u2019s welfare system for at least a generation. Since the 1990s, the system has been tightened, particularly for the unemployed, with ever-more hoops to jump through, and rules and penalties for the smallest transgression. The idea of \u201cmutual obligation\u201d has been a mantra of all major parties. It has always been a requirement to look for work if you receive benefits, but the rules had become deliberately cruel, according to critics, dividing people into the \u201cdeserving\u201d and \u201cunderserving\u201d poor, with the unemployed undeserving. For 25 years, there was no real increase in Newstart beyond inflation, while aged pensions kept up with average living standards. Social security can\u2019t be isolated from the rest of the economy, including the workforce, housing, education and training. The rising cost of housing, for instance, meant that a person on unemployment benefits found it almost impossible to find an affordable place to live. Anglicare\u2019s annual rental affordability snapshot found that the supplement meant that of the houses it surveyed, 1,000 of the nearly 70,000 homes would be affordable for a single jobseeker. If the supplement was scrapped, only nine would be. If we returned to the previous approach to social security, says economist Nicki Hutley from Deloitte Access Economics, \u201cwe are once again condemning a large section of our society to living below the poverty line for no good reason. It\u2019s purely based on ideology, that some people are unemployed simply because they are lazy.\u201d The government\u2019s rhetoric hints that its philosophy has not changed. When announcing the supplement, Morrison stressed that thousands of Australians had become unemployed \u201cthrough no fault of their own\u201d, which is true, but is true for the vast majority of those unemployed before the crisis. In February, the unemployment rate was 5.1%, and in March, just before the social distancing restrictions, 713,000 were receiving unemployment benefits. The latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that job losses equated to 975,000 in the five weeks to 18 April, or an unemployment rate of around 12%. We are not all in this together, at least as far as unemployment is concerned. The biggest hit to jobs was in the accommodation and food services industry, down 33.4% in the five-week period. Arts and recreation services were down 27%. Nearly a fifth of jobs held by people aged under 20 have vanished. Official job figures for April will be released on 14 May. About a quarter of all Australian workers are casuals, but it\u2019s uneven. The jobs with highest prevalence of casual employees are hospitality workers (79%) and food preparation assistants (75%). Hutley says that while casual work suits some people such as students and gives flexibility to employers to scale their workforces up and down, employees had little real choice. These workers have been exposed as especially vulnerable to any shock in the economy. \u201cThere should be some way of protecting those workers and giving them greater power to be able to report people who are not doing the right thing without fear of losing their job,\u201d she says. Others are arguing that the crisis is an opportunity to open a broader and deeper debate, beyond what is an acceptable level of social security support. Tim Kennedy, the head of the 156,000-member United Workers Union, says despite Australia congratulating itself for 20 years of economic growth before the pandemic, \u201cthe last few weeks show that a large proportion of Australians are on the bones of their arse. It didn\u2019t take much to knock us down.\u201d The union, which represents workers in hospitality, hotels, casinos, warehouses and health, argues for a government \u201cjobs guarantee\u201d backed by a government subsidy, which would mean employers could not put off people during the crisis. It wants an \u201cemergency income guarantee\u201d for everyone else at the minimum wage of $740 a week. \u201cThe system is broken and it\u2019s not good enough to patch it up and sail on through,\u201d he told Jacobin recently. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these crises keep coming; after 2008\u20139, they said it was a once in 50-year thing.

The idea is that the economic system now is incapable of providing all workers with a reasonably paid job. The shocks to come with technology replacing jobs, as well as the upheaval of climate change, will exacerbate structural weaknesses in the workplace. In Spain, with devastating numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths, the governing coalition of the Socialist party and the left movement Podemos has signalled it will introduce some form of regular payments for its poorest citizens. A guaranteed payment would address poverty better, the argument goes, compared with \u201ctargeted transfer\u201d as we have in Australia, particularly if it has a punitive underpinning. Professor John Quiggin, an economist from the University of Queensland, advocates some form of income guarantee for those not in the workforce.

      "body": "<p>When they emerged from isolation, one felt like an escapee, another saw friends turn on their heels and some questioned if they had really recovered. Though their symptoms varied, all the accounts from these people who have recovered from coronavirus echo the same sentiment: recovery came at a price. Weeks after getting better, strangers and loved ones still scrabble to create distance, afraid of contagion.</p> <p>At the time of writing, 5,984 Australians had recovered from the 6,875 confirmed cases. While the emerging consensus is that recovery induces, at least, short-term immunity, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">urges caution</a>, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/can-you-get-the-covid-19-coronavirus-twice-137309\">researchers and health authorities are racing to determine</a> how long this defence lasts.</p> <p>Here, six Australians talk about life after recovery.</p> <h2><strong>Kieran Ryan, 32: \u2018I asked my friends if they\u2019d carry my coffin\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab3e5ab4d3a25f950e4d9e9c10bd0a350c54c5c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab3e5ab4d3a25f950e4d9e9c10bd0a350c54c5c6/358_621_1738_3455/503.jpg\" alt=\"Kieran Ryan running the LA marathon before contracting the coronavirus\" width=\"503\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kieran Ryan running the LA marathon before contracting the coronavirus</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keiran Ryan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Keiran Ryan had just run a 42km marathon in Los Angeles and felt amazing. But a week after his return to Halls Gap in regional Victoria, Ryan was in bed, shaking himself to sleep. His suspicions were confirmed in a phone call from the state\u2019s Department of Health, which informed him his swab had returned positive.</p> <p>Breaking the news to his parents, a notable pause from his mother made him realise it would be a stress they\u2019d share. \u201cIt was the first time I ever thought of my mortality,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely put a brave face on \u2013 and I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>At his worst mentally and physically, Ryan prepared end-of-life arrangements and organised a will to avoid burdening his parents. \u201cI called a group of friends and asked if they\u2019d carry my coffin,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This thing people are so frightened of, this thing has the ability to kill me.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Looking for relief, Ryan searched online for people recounting their experience of milder cases but what he found at the time was grim. \u201cIt would have felt amazing to turn on the TV and hear from someone I could associate with,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand it\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s important to give hope.\u201d</p> <p>For Ryan, the toughest time came at night. When supportive friends and family slept, he was plagued by questions that began with \u201cwhat if\u201d. He relentlessly searched for signs of improvement and was overwhelmed by what he saw online. Recognising the damaging effect it was having on his mental health, he found himself switching off his phone.</p> <p>Now, three weeks after his recovery, Ryan still zigzags between anxiety and graciousness when he leaves the house.</p> <p>\u201cI have an irrational fear that someone would refuse to serve me or there would be an embarrassing moment where you\u2019re made to feel unwelcome,\u201d he says, adding that he already feels isolated after recovering alone on his property. \u201cI was almost walking around feeling like, what if someone knows?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"958ee43f01a1321641654e7537114d993d99ba76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/958ee43f01a1321641654e7537114d993d99ba76/0_1333_2316_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kieran Ryan on his property in rural Victoria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kieran Ryan on his property in rural Victoria.

The phone calls, the texts, being tagged in things \u2013 they lift your mood up.\u201d</p> <p>As for what he will take from the experience, Ryan says: \u201cIt\u2019s given me clarity on the things that are important to me \u2026 I certainly say I love you a lot more.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sean Sweetser, 50: \u2018It felt biblical, I felt like a leper\u2019</strong></h2> <p>After contracting the virus following a holiday in Manila, Sean Sweetser felt a strange kind of irreverence when he went out into the world. Leaving his bedroom for the first time in weeks, he smiled and waved at a gardening neighbour as he walked by \u2013 a gesture he says is out of character. She stared back blankly.</p> <p>At the grocery store the other shoppers were, he says, \u201cin a different world to me \u2013 they were nervous, I was on a high\u201d. He felt \u201cuntouchable\u201d.</p> <p>For Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy.</p> <p>\u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're made to feel like you've done something wrong</p> <footer> <cite>David*</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Even after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d</p> <p>Sweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove.</p> <p>As a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation.</p> <p>Instead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Karen Clements, 55: \u2018My immunity is now my superpower\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On the first leg of her trip home from a holiday in the US, Karen Clements had just flown out of New York when the pilot announced that the city\u2019s airspace had gone into a rare shutdown.</p> <p>By the time she boarded her third flight, Clements was riddled with anxiety. Airports were empty and passengers were scarce. Sharing a plane with cruise patrons, she worried about contracting the virus \u2013 unaware she already had it herself.</p> <p>\u201cThe stress was worse than my symptoms,\u201d says Clements, who had discounted her migraines and nausea as side-effects from travelling. \u201cI got home, my legs buckled, and I had a massive anxiety attack.\u201d</p> <p>After calling for an ambulance, paramedics arrived in protective suits and, though she no longer showed signs of the virus, a cautionary swab returned positive.</p> <p>With the mild symptoms behind her, Clements grappled with disbelief. Even when her isolation time was up, she remained indoors for an extra two weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"100318caad318da602c68887f3b49b33eac55a61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100318caad318da602c68887f3b49b33eac55a61/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karen Clements\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karen Clements has been free of the virus for weeks but still feels the stigma when in public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI just wanted to hibernate purely from the shock of knowing I had it,\u201d the 55-year-old life coach says.</p> <p>Once her own shock settled, Clements was met with the shock \u2013 and fear \u2013 of others.</p> <p>\u201cI was not contagious but [my stepson] said he didn\u2019t even want me in his suburb,\u201d Clements says. \u201cThe fact I had it was like I\u2019d still got it.\u201d</p> <p>Now, five weeks after recovery, the Melbourne local does her grocery shopping without a mask or gloves, citing her likely immunity as her \u201csuperpower\u201d.</p> <p>On one occasion, when a shopper asked her to take a step back, Clements assured her that she was among the safe few, having recovered.</p> <p>\u201cIf she could have shot up into the air, she would have,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop telling them though \u2013 I like the shock value.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Camille Valvo, 64: \u2018You start acting normal\u2019</strong></h2> <p>When Camille Valvo left her house for the first time after recovering from coronavirus she was feeling like a fugitive. In a matter of days, she lapsed in social distancing, handing a fallen coin to a stranger on the street.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t realise but you start acting normal,\u201d Valvo says. Recognising what she had done, Valvo walked back and apologised, assuring him it was OK because she was likely to be immune.</p> <p>After catching the virus from her daughter, a flight attendant, Valvo isolated at home with her husband: \u201cHe was asymptomatic but he could have had the virus. It\u2019s one of those things you won\u2019t know unless he gets a test.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"809eaba481c60a959535837381e7b83a4e87319a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/809eaba481c60a959535837381e7b83a4e87319a/481_937_1750_1050/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camille Valvo on holiday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camille Valvo on holiday. She\u2019s is part of a Facebook group helping people deal with recovery from Covid-19</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Camille Valvo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hoping to connect with others experiencing moderate symptoms, Valvo joined \u201cSurvivor Corps\u201d, a private Facebook group where those recovering or recovered from Covid-19 could connect with each other and medical professionals.</p> <p>\u201cPeople aren\u2019t hearing about the mild cases enough,\u201d Valvo says. \u201cMaybe if they did they wouldn\u2019t be in freak-out mode.\u201d</p> <p>Still an active member of the Facebook group, and now recovered, Valvo is hoping to give this support back to others: \u201cWhen people post that they are on to \u2018day 44\u2019 [of recovering], I think, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m lucky.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sydney couple, 38 and 41: \u2018A blessing and a curse\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Anna* and David* \u2013 and more than 40 others \u2013 caught the virus after attending a wedding in early March. The pair were among the first 80 cases in Australia; Anna was the first wedding guest to test positive. Despite the ceremony taking place before the introduction of restrictions, the guests received backlash about their attendance in comment threads under articles covering the outbreak. And the Sydney couple felt judged or feared by friends and acquaintances who avoided interactions. For these reasons they wish to remain anonymous.</p> <p>On her first walk after being cleared Anna wore a mask \u201cjust in case\u201d and questioned whether she had really recovered, wanting a negative swab to ease her mind.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/australia-coronavirus-victims-tributes-friends-family-stories-age-names-covid-19-death-toll-australian\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus victims: remembering those lost to Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the news made its way around their neighbourhood, the pair saw acquaintances blatantly avoid them on the street. Those who didn\u2019t know took visible steps back when they explained why they had disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re made to feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong,\u201d says David, who describes it as a blessing and a curse to have had the virus so early.</p> <p>As small business owner, Anna also felt a pang of guilt when she realised she had infected a contractor who had helped her work overtime.</p> <p>Despite the flood of exhausting emotions, the couple<strong> </strong>feel strongly about doing what they can with their likely immunity.</p> <p>\u201cIf they want me on the frontline, I\u2019m happy to be there,\u201d Anna says. They have already taken part in few trials: one assessing at-home test kits, another looking at blood transfusion.</p> <p>David remains stumped by the response: \u201cThe fear of the unknown is understandable but science tell us we are probably the safest people.\u201d</p> <p><em>* Names have been changed</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When they emerged from isolation, one felt like an escapee, another saw friends turn on their heels and some questioned if they had really recovered. Though their symptoms varied, all the accounts from these people who have recovered from coronavirus echo the same sentiment: recovery came at a price. Weeks after getting better, strangers and loved ones still scrabble to create distance, afraid of contagion. At the time of writing, 5,984 Australians had recovered from the 6,875 confirmed cases. While the emerging consensus is that recovery induces, at least, short-term immunity, the World Health Organization urges caution, and researchers and health authorities are racing to determine how long this defence lasts. Here, six Australians talk about life after recovery. Kieran Ryan, 32: \u2018I asked my friends if they\u2019d carry my coffin\u2019 Keiran Ryan had just run a 42km marathon in Los Angeles and felt amazing. But a week after his return to Halls Gap in regional Victoria, Ryan was in bed, shaking himself to sleep. His suspicions were confirmed in a phone call from the state\u2019s Department of Health, which informed him his swab had returned positive. Breaking the news to his parents, a notable pause from his mother made him realise it would be a stress they\u2019d share. \u201cIt was the first time I ever thought of my mortality,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely put a brave face on \u2013 and I know it\u2019s not the right thing to do.\u201d At his worst mentally and physically, Ryan prepared end-of-life arrangements and organised a will to avoid burdening his parents. \u201cI called a group of friends and asked if they\u2019d carry my coffin,\u201d he says. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018This thing people are so frightened of, this thing has the ability to kill me.\u2019\u201d Looking for relief, Ryan searched online for people recounting their experience of milder cases but what he found at the time was grim. \u201cIt would have felt amazing to turn on the TV and hear from someone I could associate with,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand it\u2019s horrific but it\u2019s important to give hope.\u201d For Ryan, the toughest time came at night. When supportive friends and family slept, he was plagued by questions that began with \u201cwhat if\u201d. He relentlessly searched for signs of improvement and was overwhelmed by what he saw online. Recognising the damaging effect it was having on his mental health, he found himself switching off his phone. Now, three weeks after his recovery, Ryan still zigzags between anxiety and graciousness when he leaves the house. \u201cI have an irrational fear that someone would refuse to serve me or there would be an embarrassing moment where you\u2019re made to feel unwelcome,\u201d he says, adding that he already feels isolated after recovering alone on his property. \u201cI was almost walking around feeling like, what if someone knows?\u201d Despite the lingering dread, Ryan is most thankful for the check-ins from his friends and family: \u201cConnection is something you almost crave. The phone calls, the texts, being tagged in things \u2013 they lift your mood up.\u201d As for what he will take from the experience, Ryan says: \u201cIt\u2019s given me clarity on the things that are important to me \u2026 I certainly say I love you a lot more.\u201d Sean Sweetser, 50: \u2018It felt biblical, I felt like a leper\u2019 After contracting the virus following a holiday in Manila, Sean Sweetser felt a strange kind of irreverence when he went out into the world. Leaving his bedroom for the first time in weeks, he smiled and waved at a gardening neighbour as he walked by \u2013 a gesture he says is out of character. She stared back blankly. At the grocery store the other shoppers were, he says, \u201cin a different world to me \u2013 they were nervous, I was on a high\u201d. He felt \u201cuntouchable\u201d. For Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy. \u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus. Even after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d Sweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove. As a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation. Instead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d Karen Clements, 55: \u2018My immunity is now my superpower\u2019 On the first leg of her trip home from a holiday in the US, Karen Clements had just flown out of New York when the pilot announced that the city\u2019s airspace had gone into a rare shutdown. By the time she boarded her third flight, Clements was riddled with anxiety. Airports were empty and passengers were scarce. Sharing a plane with cruise patrons, she worried about contracting the virus \u2013 unaware she already had it herself. \u201cThe stress was worse than my symptoms,\u201d says Clements, who had discounted her migraines and nausea as side-effects from travelling. \u201cI got home, my legs buckled, and I had a massive anxiety attack.\u201d After calling for an ambulance, paramedics arrived in protective suits and, though she no longer showed signs of the virus, a cautionary swab returned positive. With the mild symptoms behind her, Clements grappled with disbelief. Even when her isolation time was up, she remained indoors for an extra two weeks. \u201cI just wanted to hibernate purely from the shock of knowing I had it,\u201d the 55-year-old life coach says. Once her own shock settled, Clements was met with the shock \u2013 and fear \u2013 of others. \u201cI was not contagious but [my stepson] said he didn\u2019t even want me in his suburb,\u201d Clements says. \u201cThe fact I had it was like I\u2019d still got it.\u201d Now, five weeks after recovery, the Melbourne local does her grocery shopping without a mask or gloves, citing her likely immunity as her \u201csuperpower\u201d. On one occasion, when a shopper asked her to take a step back, Clements assured her that she was among the safe few, having recovered. \u201cIf she could have shot up into the air, she would have,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll stop telling them though \u2013 I like the shock value.\u201d Camille Valvo, 64: \u2018You start acting normal\u2019 When Camille Valvo left her house for the first time after recovering from coronavirus she was feeling like a fugitive. In a matter of days, she lapsed in social distancing, handing a fallen coin to a stranger on the street. \u201cYou don\u2019t realise but you start acting normal,\u201d Valvo says. Recognising what she had done, Valvo walked back and apologised, assuring him it was OK because she was likely to be immune. After catching the virus from her daughter, a flight attendant, Valvo isolated at home with her husband: \u201cHe was asymptomatic but he could have had the virus. It\u2019s one of those things you won\u2019t know unless he gets a test.\u201d Hoping to connect with others experiencing moderate symptoms, Valvo joined \u201cSurvivor Corps\u201d, a private Facebook group where those recovering or recovered from Covid-19 could connect with each other and medical professionals. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t hearing about the mild cases enough,\u201d Valvo says. \u201cMaybe if they did they wouldn\u2019t be in freak-out mode.\u201d Still an active member of the Facebook group, and now recovered, Valvo is hoping to give this support back to others: \u201cWhen people post that they are on to \u2018day 44\u2019 [of recovering], I think, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m lucky.\u2019\u201d Sydney couple, 38 and 41: \u2018A blessing and a curse\u2019 Anna* and David* \u2013 and more than 40 others \u2013 caught the virus after attending a wedding in early March. The pair were among the first 80 cases in Australia; Anna was the first wedding guest to test positive. Despite the ceremony taking place before the introduction of restrictions, the guests received backlash about their attendance in comment threads under articles covering the outbreak. And the Sydney couple felt judged or feared by friends and acquaintances who avoided interactions. For these reasons they wish to remain anonymous. On her first walk after being cleared Anna wore a mask \u201cjust in case\u201d and questioned whether she had really recovered, wanting a negative swab to ease her mind. When the news made its way around their neighbourhood, the pair saw acquaintances blatantly avoid them on the street. Those who didn\u2019t know took visible steps back when they explained why they had disappeared. \u201cYou\u2019re made to feel like you\u2019ve done something wrong,\u201d says David, who describes it as a blessing and a curse to have had the virus so early. As small business owner, Anna also felt a pang of guilt when she realised she had infected a contractor who had helped her work overtime. Despite the flood of exhausting emotions, the couple feel strongly about doing what they can with their likely immunity. \u201cIf they want me on the frontline, I\u2019m happy to be there,\u201d Anna says. They have already taken part in few trials: one assessing at-home test kits, another looking at blood transfusion. David remains stumped by the response: \u201cThe fear of the unknown is understandable but science tell us we are probably the safest people.\u201d * Names have been changed",

And so our spending on food will fall \u2013 probably not by 24% to completely cancel out the March rise, but there will be a fall, and the fall will be greater in May as the need to stock-up recedes. And we will see a similar fall in the other areas. There\u2019s only so many bread-makers or freezers or webcams you need to buy, and purchases in pharmacies will also switch back to normal levels \u2013 or even lower as the usual flu season looks to be less bad because of our social distancing. But we won\u2019t be increasing our spending in cafes or restaurants \u2013 a sector that comprises around 14% of our monthly spending (more than on clothes and department stores combined) . The retail spending is a good example of the difficulties of the return to normal \u2013 even the \u201cgood\u201d news is a signal of abnormal and bad times, and the bad news is unlikely to recover in the near or medium term. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness. Why aren\u2019t federal, state, and local governments setting up food distribution networks, employing laid-off truckers, warehouse workers, and others?

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s major news items: New York warns of children\u2019s illness linked to Covid-19 after three deaths. The state reports 73 cases of children falling severely ill with toxic shock-like reaction that has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease. Obama calls Trump\u2019s virus response \u2018an absolute chaotic disaster\u2019. The former US president harshly criticized his successor\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during a conversation with ex-members of his administration, according to a recording obtained by Yahoo News. \u2018It happened all at once\u2019: Tara Reade details assault claim against Joe Biden in Megyn Kelly interview. The former staffer discusses her allegation against the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in an in-depth interview with the former Fox News and NBC host. CDC issues statement on Associated Press report. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, responded to the AP\u2019s report that the decision to shelve detailed advice from the nation\u2019s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the pandemic came from the highest levels of the White House. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, Robert Redfield, \u201cwill be teleworking\u201d for the next two weeks after he was exposed to a person at the White House who tested positive for Covid-19, the Washington Post has reported citing a CDC spokesperson. Late Friday, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said he will spend the next couple of weeks in self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive, though he took a diagnostic test that came back negative. Both Redfield and Hahn are members of the White House coronavirus task force, which last convened on Thursday. Previously on Friday, Katie Miller, the US vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary and wife of Trump senior advisor Stephen Miller, tested positive for Covid-19, raising alarm about the virus\u2019 potential spread within the White House\u2019s innermost circle. Donald Trump has announced the federal government will purchase $3bn of dairy, meat and produce from farmers as the coronavirus pandemic continues to disrupt the food supply chain. \u201cStarting early next week, at my order, the USA will be purchasing, from our Farmers, Ranchers &amp; Specialty Crop Growers, 3 Billion Dollars worth of Dairy, Meat &amp; Produce for Food Lines &amp; Kitchens,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday afternoon. Farmers across the United States have faced a massive surplus of perishable items in recent weeks as the shutdown of the food service industry has scrambled the supply chain. Christopher D Cook has written about the how Covid-19 has exposed pre-existing malfunctions in the system, suggesting that a focus on smaller farmers and breaking up monopolies could represent a long-term solution. While there\u2019s no single, magic-bullet solution, there are clear and urgently needed policy fixes that would make our food and farming system far more balanced, sustainable, and resilient to crises \u2013 whether it be the Covid-19 pandemic or intensifying climate havoc. For starters, policies must support smaller farmers and diversified sustainable production. This includes what\u2019s known as \u201cparity\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos. Subsidies that currently propel farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains. If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable. The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food. Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some farmers and caravans of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift. But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness. Why aren\u2019t federal, state, and local governments setting up food distribution networks, employing laid-off truckers, warehouse workers, and others? Why not create a Green New Deal for food that creates jobs and boosts communities\u2019 ability to feed themselves in these increasingly volatile times? The food supply breakdowns spurred by the coronavirus pandemic are a horrific wake-up call to revamp today\u2019s anarchic corporate food system and start replacing it with a publicly coordinated system that supports small and mid-sized farmers producing diverse organic crops for local and regional markets. Not only can we afford to create such a system, we cannot afford not to make this urgent shift. The mayor of Palo Alto said he \u201cwould be really sad and disappointed\u201d if the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, pulled his company\u2019s factory out of California and is \u201cready to help\u201d resolve the tech billionaire\u2019s escalating spat with local officials. \u201cTesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately,\u201d Musk tweeted on Saturday morning. \u201cThe unelected &amp; ignorant \u201cInterim Health Officer\u201d of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!\u201d Musk, who has been the subject of criticism for downplaying the coronavirus pandemic, has been up in arms over California\u2019s stay-at-home restrictions since a first-quarter earnings call at the end of April, calling the directives \u201cfascist\u201d. Tesla\u2019s Fremont plant has been shuttered since 23 March in an effort to stop the spread of Covid-19 with public health officials having since extended the order to the end of May. The Massachusetts department of health reported 138 coronavirus-related deaths in the past 24 hours, including 85 at long-term care facilities, bringing the state\u2019s overall toll to 4,840. Authorities said the number of confirmed cases rose by 1,410, lifting the total count to 76,743. As around most of the country, the virus is disproportionately affecting nursing homes and assisted living facilities. As the Boston Herald reports: More than half the state\u2019s deaths, 2,922, continue to come from long-term care facilities that have been major sources of infection across the country as the pandemic rages. At least 336 long-term care centers in the state had reported at least one Covid-19 case on Saturday, and some 15,965 residents and health care workers had been sickened. The death tolls at nursing homes and assisted living facilities at times have seemed staggering. As of Friday, 73 veterans who tested positive for coronavirus had died in a large outbreak at the Holyoke Soldiers\u2019 Home that has sickened another 78 residents and 83 employees. At the Chelsea Soldiers\u2019 Home, 28 veterans who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, with another 30 residents and 57 staff infected. Earlier this week, the parent company of Courtyard Nursing Care Center in Medford reported 54 residents had died. In all, 75% of coronavirus cases in the city of Holyoke have come from long-term care facilities, Mayor Alex Morse told the Herald Friday, a situation that\u2019s playing out in communities large and small across the commonwealth. \u201cThat\u2019s a high percentage here in the city and reflective of elsewhere,\u201d Morse said. Four percent of all coronavirus patients were hospitalized as of Saturday, with 814 in intensive care units. Donald Trump has taken one of his regular shots at his critics in a tweet on Saturday afternoon. \u201cWhy is it that all of the political pundits &amp; consultants that I beat so easily &amp; badly, people that charged their clients far more than their services were worth, have become so totally \u2018unhinged\u2019 when it come to your favorite President, me. These people are stone cold crazy!\u201d wrote Trump. His current press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, was one of those pundits who criticized him until joining his team during the 2016 presidential election. In 2015, she called Trump\u2019s criticism of Mexicans \u201cracist\u201d. David Smith has more on McEnany here: The NCAA president, Mark Emmert, has acknowledged that college football \u2013 a multibillion dollar industry \u2013 may not start on time this year. \u201cIf a school doesn\u2019t reopen, then they\u2019re not going to be playing sports. It\u2019s really that simple,\u201d Emmert said in an interview on the NCAA\u2019s official Twitter account on Friday. Emmert said that he hoped fans would be allowed into stadiums at some point in the season but the NCAA would take a cautious approach. \u201cJust because there\u2019s some regulation that\u2019s been lifted doesn\u2019t mean that ... you should immediately put 105,000 fans in a football stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that the proper thing to do and the sensible thing to do is a phased approach. It\u2019s plausible to me that early in the season, let\u2019s just stick with football, you see a very limited fan access, but by later in the season, as things develop, hopefully in a very positive way, you all of sudden can see larger fan bases attending,\u201d he said. Edward Helmore has news from South Dakota on attempts to keep Covid-19 from the Cheyenne River Sioux\u2019s reservation. Leaders of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe in South Dakota have refused a request from Republican governor Kristi Noem to remove checkpoints leading to their reservation. The leaders say the checkpoints pay a valuable part in protecting the tribe from Covid-19. Harold Frazier, the tribal chairman, said in a statement that the Cheyenne River Sioux would \u201cregretfully decline\u201d to remove the checkpoints, and explained that the reservation is an \u201cisland of safety in a sea of uncertainty and death\u201d. Frazier said that Noem \u201ccontinuing to interfere in our efforts to do what science and facts dictate seriously undermine our ability to protect everyone on the reservation. Ignorant statements and fiery rhetoric encourage individuals already under stress from this situation to carry out irrational actions.\u201d In letters to the Cheyenne River Sioux and Oglala Sioux citing a Bureau of Indian Affairs memorandum, Noem said she would take legal action if the checkpoints weren\u2019t lifted. \u201cThe memo makes it clear that tribes must consult with the state of South Dakota and enter into an agreement with the state before closing or restricting travel on state or US Highways. Neither consultation nor agreement among the tribal and state government occurred. Regardless, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe established checkpoints on state and US Highways to control and restrict non-tribal member travel,\u201d Noem\u2019s letter said. According to guidelines issued by the Cheyenne River Sioux, residents and visitors can pass through the checkpoints only to complete \u201cessential activities\u201d, such as medical appointments or getting essential supplies. South Dakota reported three Covid-19-related deaths on Saturday, as well as another single-day record increase of confirmed cases. There were 249 new cases reported, bringing the statewide total to 3,393. There have been 253 people hospitalized by the virus, with 79 currently in hospital, according to the Argus Leader. There have been 34 recorded deaths from Covid-19 in South Dakota since the pandemic began. New Jersey\u2019s governor, Phil Murphy, called it \u201ca matter of time\u201d until the state defeats Covid-19 with the number of new cases in steady decline. Speaking at his daily press briefing from Trenton, the governor said there were 1,759 new coronavirus cases statewide in the last 24-hour period, raising the overall total to 137,085 but continuing the downward trend. Murphy also reported 166 coronavirus-reated deaths in the last day, lifting the overall toll to 9,116. \u201cThese lives should never be just a number,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were real people, who lived real lives, and who leave behind real families. They were each a treasured part of our New Jersey family.\u201d The Food and Drug Administration has announced emergency authorization for a new type of antigen tests that could help detect coronavirus quicker and hasten the reopening of the country. Regulators say the tests, developed by San Diego-based Quidel Corp, can \u201crapidly detect fragments of virus proteins in samples collected from swabs swiped inside the nasal cavity\u201d. The Associated Press reports: The test can rapidly detect fragments of virus proteins in samples collected from swabs swiped inside the nasal cavity, the FDA said in a statement. The antigen test is the third type of test to be authorized by the FDA. Currently, the only way to diagnose active Covid-19 is to test a patient\u2019s nasal swab for the genetic material of the virus. While considered highly accurate, the tests can take hours and require expensive, specialized equipment mainly found at commercial labs, hospitals or universities. A second type looks in the blood for antibodies, the proteins produced by the body days or weeks after fighting an infection. Such tests are helpful for researchers to understand how far a disease has spread within a community, but they aren\u2019t useful for diagnosing active infections. Antigen tests can diagnose active infections by detecting the earliest toxic traces of the virus rather than genetic code of the virus itself. The FDA said that it expects to authorize more antigen tests in the future. Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who has incurred criticism for downplaying the coronavirus pandemic, has threatened to move his business out of California in lashing out against a warning from Alameda county to not open his company\u2019s plant in Fremont, California. \u201cTesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda county immediately,\u201d Musk tweeted on Saturday morning. \u201cThe unelected &amp; ignorant \u201cInterim Health Officer\u201d of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms &amp; just plain common sense!\u201d On Friday, the county released a statement saying Tesla \u201cmust not reopen\u201d, adding: \u201cRestoring all daily activities too soon risks a rapid spike in cases and would jeopardize the relative stability we\u2019ve seen in our health and hospital system.\u201d Six counties in the San Francisco Bay area, including Alameda, barred nonessential manufacturing in a wide-ranging 16 March order. Cuomo announces a partnership with Northwell Health to establish 24 temporary Covid-19 testing sites at churches in predominately minority communities. He is joined remotely by Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat who represents New York\u2019s eighth congressional district, which encompasses large parts of Brooklyn and a section of Queens. \u201cCommunities of color have been hit hard,\u201d Jeffries says. \u201cThis is not over for any of us until it is over for all of us.\u201d Cuomo says 15,000 people have been given antibody tests in New York with an overall infection rate of 19.9%. Among the 1,300 transit workers who have been tested, the rate is 14.2%, well below the norm and, Cuomo says, proof positive that PPE works. The governor then explains how the data shows the pandemic is disproportionately impacting lower-income communities and communities of color, saying 20 of the 21 zip codes with the most hospitalizations have greater than average black and/or Latino populations. \u201cWhen you look at disasters [like] emergencies, hurricanes, floods,\u201d he says, \u201cthe cruel irony is the poorest people pay the highest price.\u201d The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, says total hospitalizations, intubations and new coronavirus cases are all down over the past 24-hour period in his daily briefing from Albany. The bad news: there were a total of 226 deaths statewide yesterday after 216 (Friday), 239 (Thursday), 232 (Wednesday), 231 (Tuesday) and 226 (Monday) over the previous five days. \u201cWe would like to see this number dropping at a far faster rate than it has been dropping,\u201d Cuomo says. Cuomo then says three children in the New York area have died from an inflammatory illness potentially related to Covid-19, saying: \u201cThis is the last thing we need at this time with all the anxiety we have, now for parents to have to worry if their youngster is infected. In New York City, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus, the subway system is now being shut down between 1am and 5am each night, to allow the disinfecting of trains. This affects the city\u2019s homeless, some of whom use the trains as a form of shelter. Ordinarily it\u2019s less of a problem as the weather warms up, but even though it\u2019s now mid-May this weekend temperatures have plunged and snow has even been reported in Central Park. The city has a solution \u2013 as the Associated Press reports: New York City transit officials said they were providing buses for homeless people to shelter from unseasonably frigid weather this weekend during newly instituted overnight subway closures. City outreach workers have been persuading homeless people to leave the system for shelters during the shutdowns. But with temperatures around the freezing mark and a traces of snow reported in Manhattan\u2019s Central Park, transit officials said they also would provide a limited number of buses at end-of-line stations on Saturday and Sunday. The buses are not for transportation, \u201cbut may serve as a place for individuals to escape the elements in the short term,\u201d according to a prepared statement from New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg and Transport Workers Union Local 100 President Tony Utano. \u201cWe are providing these buses only during this cold snap and expect the city to continue to step up and take responsibility for providing safe shelter for those individuals experiencing homelessness,\u201d the statement added. Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, will be giving his daily coronavirus briefing at 11.30am ET. This morning, he tweeted a quote attributed to Albert Einstein: On Friday, the governor tweeted some facts which make very worrying reading for parents in New York, of which I am one: There have been 73 reported cases in NY of children getting severely ill with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome. On Thursday, a 5-year-old boy passed away from these complications, believed to be caused by Covid-19. [The state department of health] is investigating. There is further reporting out there, and it is alarming. As CNN quoted Cuomo: \u201cThis would be really painful news and would open up an entirely different chapter, because I can\u2019t tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected. We thought children could be vehicles of transmission ... but we didn\u2019t think children would suffer from it.\u201d Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Robert Redfield has released a statement regarding a report this week which said the \u201cdecision to shelve detailed advice from the nation\u2019s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the coronavirus pandemic came from the highest levels of the White House, according to internal government emails obtained by the Associated Press\u201d. Here\u2019s the statement in full: The re-opening guidance shared prematurely was in draft form and had not been vetted through the interagency review process. This is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people. I had not seen a version of the guidance incorporating interagency and task force input and therefore was not yet comfortable releasing a final work product.\u201d So that doesn\u2019t touch the AP\u2019s contention that the White House quashed the guidance, whatever state it was in. Here again is our chief reporter Ed Pilkington\u2019s piece on the Trump administration\u2019s eagerness to reopen the US economy despite warnings from public health advisers such as Dr Redfield: As I am a Lincolnhead, and rather too fond of reminding people about it, here\u2019s a few highlights of Lincoln biographer and former Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal\u2019s new piece for the Washington Post. It\u2019s about Donald Trump\u2019s decision, last weekend, to conduct an interview at the Lincoln Memorial and to claim worse treatment than the 16th president, the one who won the civil war, ended slavery and was shot dead on a trip to the theatre\u2026 \u2026As \u201cgreat\u201d as Lincoln might have been, Trump, with his martyr envy, has felt a compulsion to diminish him whenever he raises his name. Even murdered, Lincoln was treated better than Trump. Again, Trump wins. \u2026Trump has claimed that his poll numbers are higher than Lincoln\u2019s. \u201cWow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThat includes Honest Abe Lincoln.\u201d There were no polls in the 1860s. \u2026Trump\u2019s self-celebration has had a persuasive effect on present-day Republicans, who, according to an Economist-YouGov poll that appeared after Trump\u2019s projection, favored Trump over Lincoln 53% to 47%. Blumenthal goes on to make a comparison between the 45th president and a predecessor many have suggested is a better match than the 16th: Lincoln\u2019s predecessor James Buchanan might provide the better analog for today. In manner and experience, Buchanan was Trump\u2019s opposite \u2013 dignified, polite, abhorring vulgarity. But his White House was a hive of treason, with his trusted Southern cabinet members plotting secession. Confronted with catastrophe, Buchanan blamed the crisis on antislavery \u201cagitation\u201d and declared that neither the president nor the Congress possessed the constitutional authority to oppose the dissolution of the Union. Trump, echoing Buchanan, similarly abdicates his responsibility in the face of the pandemic. Effectively cutting the states loose, he stated that the federal government is a mere \u201cbackup,\u201d infamously declaring, \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d While Buchanan\u2019s passivity was feckless, Trump\u2019s is both feckless and cynical. Anyway, so much for the history-loving centrist dads among the Guardian readers. Here\u2019s an interview with Blumenthal I did last year, on publication of volume three of his five-volume life of Lincoln: Here\u2019s our write-up of the Yahoo News report on what Barack Obama reportedly thinks (note couching, skepticism fans) of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to drop the case against Michael Flynn, and the White House\u2019s management of the coronavirus outbreak. It\u2019s not pretty for Trump, obviously. Still awaiting his response. A weekend editor\u2019s lot can be a lonely one and his load heavy \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to feel sorry for me, don\u2019t worry \u2013 but that load can be lightened by just 11 magic words: \u201cThere is no White House briefing on the press schedule today.\u201d I\u2019ve typed them and for now they hold true. We\u2019re not due to hear from Donald Trump or from Kayleigh McEnany, his combative but more-available-to-be-combative-than-her-predecessor-so-kudos-for-that new press secretary. Although: 5:00PM \u2013 THE PRESIDENT participates in a meeting with Senior Military Leadership and National Security Team. It\u2019s not closed press. So Twitter aside, we may hear from Trump yet. Anyway. Coffee. Yahoo News has a big fat scoop, having obtained what it says is tape of Barack Obama talking to his alumni association about the justice department\u2019s decision to drop the case against Michael Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Moscow. A report on the report is on its way. But further down the Yahoo story, which is by Michael Isikoff, a chap who knows his Russia onions, as it were, Obama reportedly addresses Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\u2019s the passage in full: This election that\u2019s coming up on every level is so important because what we\u2019re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party. What we\u2019re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy \u2014 that has become a stronger impulse in American life. And by the way, we\u2019re seeing that internationally as well. It\u2019s part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset \u2013 of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019 \u2013 when that mindset is operationalized in our government. It\u2019s not like Donald Trump to take such words lying down, of course, so one would expect a cannonade of tweets to blast from the White House portico at some point soon, aimed at the Obamas in Kalorama. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, and the politics of it, in the US. First, as ever, the salient figures from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland: US cases: 1,283,762 US deaths: 77,175 New York cases: 330,407 New York deaths: 26,243 Other states are hard hit: there have been nearly 9,000 deaths in New Jersey, nearly 5,000 in Massachusetts and more than 4,000 in Michigan. And yet, encouraged by the White House, much more than half the 50 states are looking at various forms of reopening their economies. Here\u2019s Ed Pilkington, our chief reporter, on why that is a terrible gamble: Speaking of the White House, the virus has circled closer to the president himself: this week a valet who served Donald Trump, the vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary (who is married to senior policy aide Stephen Miller) and Ivanka Trump\u2019s personal assistant have tested positive. The president, whose reluctance to wear a mask and socially distance is well known, was reportedly \u201clava level\u201d angry about it all. So, to quote Kurt Vonnegut as I have tended to throughout this dizzying time, it goes. It\u2019s hard of course to keep up with all the coronavirus news, but here\u2019s some of it in summary, with links to coverage: More than 33m Americans have filed for unemployment, the worst such crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Business editor Dominic Rushe asks if it could have been avoided. Trump thinks the virus will \u201cgo away\u201d before a vaccine is found. He also thinks 95,000 Americans will die. The president has been revising his predicted death toll upwards. Official federal estimates are higher. The president, who is being tested daily, doesn\u2019t think testing is all that important (this is from the Washington Post). More to come, obviously.",

The business was also nimble enough to secure its financing as the pandemic struck \u2013 not only by furloughing 750 employees but also raising \u00a322m from share sales in mid-April \u2013 which management predicts should tide them over even in the event of a lengthy lockdown or a very slow recovery in the London housing market. Hard times for estate agents look like a certainty, with rival Knight Frank predicting Greater London will experience a 35% drop in the number of sales, from 82,000 last year to 53,000 this year. Foxtons itself has said its commissions were 47% down during the first three weeks following lockdown, while it has modelled a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d of revenues falling by 78% between April and September this year. Still, while the general market is clearly in turmoil and Foxtons looks sure to be hit, it is still a large and relatively well-funded player in what remains a very fragmented market. Smaller chains of estate agents seem to be facing even more challenges, and many large rivals still need to devise escape routes. Foxtons\u2019 shares are, in effect, always a punt on the London housing market \u2013 which has been off-colour ever since the Brexit vote \u2013 and so holding them (even at these low levels) is an act of faith. But there will come a time when another sharp-suited salesperson, this time in the City, will sniff a commission and attempt to persuade investors that the firm is not about to fall off a cliff. \u201cHang on a minute, lads,\u201d he will inevitably say. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea.\u201d",
