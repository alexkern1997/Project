Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport.

Driving schools, hair salons, physiotherapists and libraries also return, with social distancing measures.</li> \n   <li><strong>Switzerland: </strong>Primary and middle schools will reopen Monday, with classes often reduced in size.

Most shops are already open and children are slowly returning to classrooms. Bundesliga football matches are also set to resume.

Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behaviour, harming us and dividing our society,\u201d Morimitsu said.</p> \n  <p>Random acts of hatred against those with virus connections have been reported countrywide, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials to speak out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d Abe told a recent parliamentary session. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T04:24:37.488Z\">at 5.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb765258f08c0a2409bae0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T02:29:58.317Z\">3.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam Neill, Jurassic Park actor, shares his advice for combating anxiety</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sam Neill, the New Zealand actor famous for roles in<em> Jurassic Park</em> and<em> Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em> has kept busy during lockdown filming short videos designed to cheer his followers up.

Here are some of the key points from over the last six hours. The global death toll has passed 280,000. The total number of coronavirus fatalities stands at 282,495, according to Johns Hopkins University. Globally, 4,091,297 cases have been confirmed. \u2018This is not the time to end the lockdown,\u2019 Boris Johnson has said. In a speech condemned by some as confusing, the UK prime minister said some schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot work from home. Johnson encouraged workers to avoid public transport, and said restaurants and cafes should not expect to open until at least July. South Africa has passed 10,000 confirmed cases. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa stands at 10,015, including 194 fatalities, health minister Zwelini Mkhize has announced. 84% of new cases are in Western Cape and Eastern Cape, and eight new deaths have been recorded. A leading Latin American airline has filed for bankruptcy. Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s No. 2 airline and one of the oldest in the world, has filed for bankruptcy, after failing to secure aid from Colombia\u2019s government and with a bond payment deadline looming. Avianca could be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic. Poland must declare new election date within 14 days, the head of Poland\u2019s electoral commission has said. The central European country had been due to hold a presidential election on Sunday and, while the vote was not officially cancelled or postponed, the electoral commission had said on Thursday it could not be held due to the coronavirus crisis. France will be exempt from UK\u2019s quarantine restrictions. The British and French governments have released a joint statement saying that the French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions, following a call between the countries\u2019 leaders. France has reported its lowest daily death toll since lockdown. France reported 70 more deaths from the coronavirus on Sunday, its lowest daily toll since the lockdown began on 17 March, as it prepared to ease restrictions. The new deaths brought the total toll in hospitals and nursing homes to 26,380. The WHO has suspended activity in Yemen\u2019s Houthi-held areas. The World Health Organization has suspended staff activity at its hubs in Houthi-held areas of Yemen in a move sources said aimed to pressure the group to be more transparent about suspected coronavirus cases. The Houthis have reported just two cases, compared to the government\u2019s 34. That\u2019s it from me for now, I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Helen Davidson in Sydney. Thanks for following along, particularly to those who wrote in. Take care. Boris Johnson has been warned by trade unions that ordering many people back to work from as early as Monday is a \u201crecipe for chaos\u201d in the absence of urgent action to safeguard workers\u2019 health, Richard Partington and Rob Davies write. The UK prime minister said on Sunday that anyone who cannot work from home should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to their jobs from Monday. Detailing plans to gradually reopen the British economy after more than a month of tough controls during the health emergency, he said those in manufacturing and construction jobs in particular should be encouraged to return. Read the full report here. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa has topped 10,000, including 194 fatalities, health minister Zwelini Mkhize has announced. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 10,015,\u201d the minister said in a statement. \u201cWe note with concern that the Western Cape and Eastern Cape combined comprises 84% of the total new cases.\u201d The death toll of 194 is an increase of eight on the previous figure. Since 1 May the government has gradually eased the confinement measures put in place in late March to stem the spread of the virus. South Africa is the country worst-hit in sub-Saharan Africa. Here\u2019s a handy overview of how European countries are emerging from lockdown, courtesy of AFP. France: Hair salons, clothes shops, florists and bookshops will open again on Monday. Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport. Everyone will be able to move outside without having to present a form on demand but people will only be able to go 100 kilometres from their place of residence. Belgium: Most businesses will open Monday, with social distancing. Masks are recommended. Cafes, restaurants and bars remain closed. In central Brussels there will be speed limits on cars and priority will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. Schools remain closed until 18 May. Britain: People will be actively encouraged to return to work from this week if they cannot work from home. Unlimited outdoor exercise will be allowed from Wednesday. From 1 June (at the earliest) nurseries and primary schools may reopen, and some non-essential shops. By July, at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places could be reopened. The Netherlands: Primary schools will partially reopen Monday. Driving schools, hair salons, physiotherapists and libraries also return, with social distancing measures. Switzerland: Primary and middle schools will reopen Monday, with classes often reduced in size. Restaurants, museums and bookshops will also open, with conditions. Meetings of more than five people remain banned. Spain: Half of Spain\u2019s 47 million people will be able to meet with family or friends in gatherings of up to 10 as of Monday. Outdoor spaces at bars and restaurants can reopen with limited capacity. Hardest-hit Madrid and Barcelona are excluded from the easing, though football clubs FC Barcelona resumed training on Friday and Real Madrid will follow Monday. Only movements within provinces are authorised and cinemas and theatres remain closed. Schools will not start up again until September. Italy: While schools remain closed until September, factories, building sites and offices reopened on 4 May. Social distancing rules are in place in parks. Wearing masks is mandatory on public transport. All retail businesses will reopen on 18 May, as will museums, cultural sites, churches and libraries. Bars and restaurants will reopen from 1 June, along with hair and beauty salons. Germany: Eating in restaurants is now possible in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the country\u2019s first cafes and restaurants reopened on Saturday. Under Germany\u2019s federal system, each of the 16 states makes its own decisions on how to emerge from lockdown and cafes and restaurants will reopen in a number of other states in the coming days and weeks. Most shops are already open and children are slowly returning to classrooms. Bundesliga football matches are also set to resume. Heeding signs of a second wave, German authorities have agreed to reimpose restrictions locally if an area has more than 50 new infections per 100,000 residents over a week. Austria: Hairdressers, tennis courts and golf courses reopened in the first weekend in May. Travel restrictions have been lifted and gatherings of up to 10 people are allowed, with social distancing. Masks are compulsory in public transport and shops. Final-year school students returned to class on 4 May ahead of a gradual return for others. Poland: Hotels can reopen on Monday but foreign tourists must quarantine for two weeks on arrival. Denmark: Shopping centres reopen in Denmark on Monday. Primary schools opened in mid-April and secondary schools will open on 18 May. Norway: Schools opened for pupils aged 6-10 at the end of April, and all classes will start again Monday. Bars and leisure centres remain closed until 1 June. Iceland: Universities, museums and hair salons reopened on 4 May. Finland: Schools will start up again on 14 May, with social distancing measures.

Serbia: Nursery schools will welcome children from Monday. Greece: Following bookshops and hairdressers reopening on 4 May, all other shops will resume trading on Monday. Shopping centres remain closed until 1 June. The Acropolis and all archeological sites will reopen 18 May. Museums reopen on 15 June. Overcrowding and outmoded design may have made Canada\u2019s care homes more vulnerable to Covid-19, experts have said. Jodi Hall, chair of the Canadian Association for Long Term Care, said the pandemic\u2019s toll has highlighted the chronic problem of government underfunding of long-term care homes, CBC reports. Many homes maintain four-bed, hospital-like wards, where residents are separated only by a curtain. Around 80% of all Covid-19-related deaths in Canada have been in long-term care facilities, according to CBC. In light of the devastating impact on homes, New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh has called for an end to privatised facilities, advocating a universal framework for senior care. In an interview aired on its network, CTV reports Singh as saying the government must work to bring long-term care under the Canada Health Act and make it federally regulated, while abolishing the private system. Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s No. 2 airline and one of the oldest in the world, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, as a bond payment deadline loomed and after pleas for aid from Colombia\u2019s government to weather the coronavirus crisis have so far been unsuccessful. If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic, which has resulted in a 90% decline in global air travel. Avianca has not flown a regularly scheduled passenger flight since late March and most of its 20,000 employees have gone without pay through the crisis. While Avianca was already weak before the coronavirus outbreak, its bankruptcy filing highlights the challenges for airlines that cannot count on state rescues to avoid bankruptcy restructuring. An Avianca representative told Reuters it is still trying to secure government loans. Meanwhile in Poland, the head of the electoral commission has said that the speaker of parliament has 14 days to declare the date of a new presidential election, according to Reuters. Poland had been due to hold a presidential election on Sunday and, while the vote was not officially cancelled or postponed, the electoral commission had said on Thursday it could not be held due to the coronavirus crisis. The municipality of Kos, the Greek island home to Hippocrates, regarded as the father of medicine and author of the Hippocratic oath, has made this video thanking medical staff worldwide. Following Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement that English primary schools could partially reopen in June, have a read through this piece about how home schooling is - or isn\u2019t - working around the world. Downing Street has just released a joint statement from the British and French governments, following a call between Boris Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron. It says the French will be exempt from the UK\u2019s proposed quarantine restrictions. [The leaders] stressed the need for close bilateral, European and international cooperation in the fight against Covid-19. The leaders spoke about the need to manage the risk of new transmissions arising from abroad, as the rate of coronavirus decreases domestically. In this regard, the prime minister and the president agreed to work together in taking forward appropriate border measures. This cooperation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border. No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner. A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks. For more on Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, be sure to read political correspondent Peter Walker\u2019s piece here. Here\u2019s Rowena Mason, the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor, on how the lockdown will be eased in England. Boris Johnson\u2019s new plans for a gradual easing of the lockdown could see primary schools in England, shops and nurseries partially reopening from June, some cafes or restaurants back from July, and more outdoor activity allowed in England from this Wednesday. In an address to the nation, the prime minister said there was \u201cno immediate end to the lockdown\u201d as people will still be required to stay at home most of the time and to keep within their own household groups. France reported 70 more deaths from the coronavirus on Sunday, its lowest daily toll in recent weeks just ahead of the first easing of an almost two-month lockdown. The new deaths brought the total toll in hospitals and nursing homes from the pandemic in France to 26,380, the health ministry said. It was the lowest daily toll announced since March 17, the day the lockdown in France began. Saturday had also seen a record low toll of 80 deaths. France will on Monday emerge from its lockdown, although many restrictions will remain in place nationwide. \u201cOur efforts during the lockdown worked and saved thousands of lives,\u201d said the health ministry. \u201cThey need to succeed so that this new phase succeeds,\u201d it added, warning that the epidemic is still \u201cactive and evolving\u201d. There has been a steady downward trend in France\u2019s key coronavirus figures in recent days, although officials warn that caution is still needed and the risk of a second wave remains. Continuing recent trends, there were 36 fewer coronavirus patients in total in intensive care for a total of 2,776 and 45 less in hospital for a total of 22,569 people. The government has divided France into green and red areas for Monday\u2019s easing of the lockdown, with Paris and three other regions classified as red seeing a more limited relaxation. A reminder that you can get in touch with me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti with any stories, questions or suggestions. I won\u2019t be able to reply to every message, but will do my best to read it all. Thanks to everyone who has already written in. Head over to the UK blog to follow Boris Johnson\u2019s speech about easing the lockdown. The PM has stressed that the lockdown cannot end this week, as the conditions have not been met. Meanwhile in Algeria, analysts are saying the regime is exploiting the coronavirus to defeat a protest movement that has shaken it to its core over the past year. Despite protesters deciding to suspend their weekly gatherings since the start of the public health crisis, repression of regime opponents has persisted, according to AFP. Security forces have targeted young bloggers, independent journalists, online media and activists from the \u201cHirak\u201d protest movement. Rapidly adopted laws ostensibly aimed at preventing the dissemination of false news and hate speech have further stoked fears of an orchestrated campaign to muzzle free expression. The new laws \u201caim to repress citizens\u2019 freedom of expression\u201d, said lawyer and activist Abdelouhab Chiter, a lecturer at the University of Bejaia. A law on \u201cspreading false information\u201d, he said, \u201cwas debated and passed by parliament in a single sitting, in the absence of almost half of its members\u201d. Akram Belkaid, a journalist for the Oran daily, warned of \u201ca return to the iron fist as in the 1970s\u201d. \u201cHirak won the first leg of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe regime is on course to win the second leg, and its true goal is to prevent any further rematches being held at all - or in other words, to prevent protests reoccurring once the pandemic has been overcome.\u201d Karima Direche, a historian specialising in contemporary Maghreb region affairs, said the pandemic was \u201cbread from heaven for the regime\u201d. \u201cThe confinement period lends itself to police and judicial harassment. This explains the dozens of arrests of known and unknown people in all Algeria\u2019s cities,\u201d she said. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suspended staff activity at its hubs in Houthi-held areas of Yemen, a directive seen by Reuters showed, in a move sources said aimed to pressure the group to be more transparent about suspected coronavirus cases. War-ravaged Yemen is divided between the internationally recognised government temporarily based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014. The Saudi-backed government has so far reported 34 cases of the coronavirus with seven deaths in the territory it controls, while the Houthis, who control most large urban centres, have recorded just two cases with one death. The WHO directive issued late on Saturday notified staff in Sanaa, in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, in the northern province of Saada and the central province of Ibb that \u201call movements, meetings or any other activity\u201d for all staff in those areas were paused until further notice. The WHO did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Three sources told Reuters that the WHO had taken the measure to press the Houthi authorities to report results of tests for Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus. The Saudi-backed government has accused Houthi authorities of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, a charge the group denies. The WHO has said it fears Covid-19 could rip through Yemen as the population has some of the lowest levels of immunity to disease compared with other countries. Minimal testing capacity has added to concerns. Here are some of the key points from over the last few hours: Global cases are at over 4 million. The total number of confirmed cases stands at 4,055,863, while the global death toll has reached 279,892, according to Johns Hopkins. The US has reported the most fatalities, at 78,862, followed by the UK (31,662) and Italy (30,395). Italy has recorded its lowest daily infection rise in two months, with 802 new infections registered on Sunday. The country recorded 165 new coronavirus fatalities, bringing the death toll to 30,560. Over 90 percent of Tokyo\u2019s coronavirus hospital beds are occupied, the Japanese health ministry has announced. Tokyo, which represents nearly a third of Japan\u2019s total infections, stands in contrast with the rest of the nation, where the bed occupancy rate is at 38 percent. Greece will extend to the lockdown on migrant camps, which had been expected to be lifted from Monday, to 21 May. The Greek government started easing measures for the wider public on Monday, after imposing a series of measures in late March. Lebanon\u2019s army has said 13 soldiers at a military court have contracted the coronavirus. The army said it had taken \u201call necessary preventive and medical measures\u201d, while some 40 lawyers have been tested and other soldiers and judges will be tested on Monday. Austria\u2019s finance ministry has said companies are abusing state subsidies for staff, after spot checks found hundreds of violations of the law. Austria has authorised 10 billion euros to support short hours, and 350 financial police officers have been doing spot checks on businesses for three weeks to measure companies\u2019 compliance. Italy has tightened up rules for the release of mafia mobsters, following public outcry. A decree adopted overnight now requires any release to be reviewed every fortnight to ensure that it was fully justified, following some 376 mafiosi and drug dealers, including notorious Cosa Nostra boss Francesco Bonura, being transferred to house arrest. Turkey has relaxed restrictions for senior citizens, allowing over-65s to venture outside for the first time in seven weeks on Sunday. As part of a rolling program of reduced controls, they are now allowed out for four hours, after being subjected to a stay-at-home curfew since 21 March. China has reported a possible new wave of cases in the northeast of the country, with one city in Jilin province being reclassified as high-risk. Jilin officials raised the risk level of the city of Shulan to high from medium, following eleven news cases being confirmed on Saturday. China has hit back against \u2018preposterous allegations\u2019, issuing a 30-page rebuttal of what it termed \u201cpreposterous allegations\u201d by some leading US politicians, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. India\u2019s train network - one of the world\u2019s largest - will \u201cgradually\u201d restart operations from Tuesday as India eases its coronavirus lockdown, as the number of cases passed 60,000 with more than 2,000 deaths. Some 30 train journeys - 15 pairs of return trips - will run from the capital New Delhi to other cities including Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, Indian Railways said late Sunday. \u201cIndian Railways plans to gradually restart passenger train operations from 12th May, 2020... Thereafter, Indian Railways shall start more special services on new routes,\u201d the railways ministry added in a statement. \u201cIt will be mandatory for the passengers to wear face cover and undergo screening at departure and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to board the train.\u201d The vast train network, which had carried more than 20 million passengers daily, was halted in late March as India imposed a strict lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. A limited number of services have been operating in recent days to help stranded poor, rural migrant workers who lost their jobs in the lockdown to return to their villages. India has started to ease its lockdown, which is due to lift on May 17, but interstate public transport and domestic and international flights had so far remain grounded. Authorities on Sunday reported 62,939 cases with 2,109 deaths, with recent days having seen record jumps. Italy recorded 165 new coronavirus fatalities on Sunday, bringing the death toll to 30,560, while the number of new infections rose by 802, the lowest daily rise since 6 March. 2,150 people were registered as recovered on Sunday, bringing the total number of survivors to 105,186. Italy, which started easing lockdown restrictions last Monday, has so far recorded 219,070 cases. More than 90 percent of hospital beds secured for Covid-19 patients in Tokyo have already been occupied, the Japanese health ministry has announced, underscoring the pressing need to curb the further spread of the coronavirus. The ministry said 1,832 Covid-19 patients were hospitalised in the capital as of April 28, or 91.6 percent of the 2,000 beds made available for such patients. The Tokyo metropolitan government aims to boost the number of beds for Covid-19 patients to 4,000 eventually. \u201cThere is a possibility that the virus will spread further. It is necessary to bring closer the number of beds from 2,000 to such target quickly,\u201d a health ministry official told Reuters. About 5,000 people in Tokyo were confirmed to have been infected with the virus, representing nearly one-third of Japan\u2019s total infections of around 16,000, according to public broadcaster NHK. Nationwide, the number of hospitalised Covid-19 patients came to 5,558 as of April 28, versus 14,486 beds set aside for those with the lung disease caused by the virus, bringing down the occupancy rate to 38 percent, data from the ministry showed. Greece will extend the coronavirus lockdown imposed in March on migrant camps, which had been expected to be lifted from Monday, the authorities said. \u201cThe coronavirus measures of confinement for those living in migrant camps and in reception centres in Greece are prolonged until 21 May,\u201d the migration and asylum ministry said in a statement on Sunday, six days after the first easing of the general lockdown in the country The ministry did not say why the camp lockdown was being extended, AFP reports. The Greek government adopted a whole series of anti-coronavirus measures in late March but began easing them from Monday last week given the apparent success made in keeping the outbreak in check. In Greece as a whole, some 2,710 cases of coronavirus have been recorded and 151 deaths. People can now leave their homes without authorisation and on Monday, some shops will open and final year school pupils will return to class. Until now, there have been no coronavirus cases in the Aegean island camps, according to authorities. On the mainland, however, two camps and a hotel accommodating asylum-seekers were locked down in April after positive coronavirus tests were returned. According to the UNHCR, the total number of asylum-seekers in Greece is around 120,000. In April, on the five Greek Aegean islands where many have been housed waiting to be processed, there were 38,291 migrants, down from 42,052 in February, the UN body said. On Sunday, 137 asylum-seekers are expected to be transferred from Lesbos to the mainland. The Greek government has promised to transfer 2,000 asylum- seekers from the islands to the mainland in order to ease the pressure on the camps there. Rights groups say this is not enough to produce a real improvement in conditions, especially given the dangers from the coronavirus pandemic. They also fear that asylum-seeker rights are being eroded by the measures taken to curb the virus\u2019s spread but officials insist that Athens will continue to respect its international obligations. Some Austrian companies are abusing state subsidies for staff on short-time working or using illegal workers during the coronavirus pandemic, the finance ministry has said after spot checks found hundreds of violations of the law. The short-hours regime, known in German as Kurzarbeit, is the main vehicle for preventing mass layoffs. The state helps top up pay for staff who remain on the payroll but work only a fraction of their normal hours given a sharp drop-off in demand. Austria has authorised 10 billion euros to support short hours, and 350 financial police officers have been doing spot checks on businesses for three weeks to measure companies\u2019 compliance. Inspections of 5,119 people at 1,946 companies uncovered 460 violations of laws. Authorities have filed complaints against 31 people suspected of abusing the short-time working scheme, and nine on short hours for tax evasion, a ministry statement said. Some companies were taking state subsidies while letting staff work more than allowed, the ministry added.\u201cThere is zero tolerance towards those who want to enrich themselves at taxpayer expense,\u201d finance minister Gernot Bluemel said. People convicted of abusing subsidies face imprisonment of up to five years in addition to tough penalties for forging documents and fraud. Lebanon\u2019s army has said 13 soldiers at a military court have contracted the coronavirus, as state media said judges would be tested for the illness, AFP reports. Lebanon has so far announced 845 cases of COVID-19, including 26 deaths. The country started to lift confinement measures this week, although the number of cases has increased in recent days, including among Lebanese repatriated from abroad. The army said it has recorded \u201c13 cases among members at the military court\u201d, and that it had taken \u201call necessary preventive and medical measures\u201d. Some 40 lawyers who had been to court in the past week were tested, with results expected on Monday, the state-run National News Agency said. Judges and other soldiers would be tested from Monday too, it said. The lawyers syndicate said all its buildings would be closed Monday to disinfect them. Lebanon started on Monday the gradual lifting of confinement measures in place since mid-March, re-opening restaurants and hairdressers. But with the number of virus cases rising, Interior Minister Mohammed Fahmi warned that failure to comply with social distancing measures would result in the re-imposition of stricter lockdown measures. Brazil\u2019s provocateur president has continued to brush off the coronavirus, taking a spin on a jet-ski to a floating barbecue and attacking Covid-19 \u201cneurosis\u201d as his country\u2019s death toll rose to more than 10,000, Tom Phillips reports. Jair Bolsonaro has faced domestic and international condemnation for his dismissive attitude toward the pandemic. The rightwing populist continues to play down the disease despite the growing evidence of its deadly impact on Brazil. Read the full story here. Hello, I\u2019ll be running the blog for the next few hours. Please feel free to get in touch with any news tips, suggestions or feedback. You can DM on Twitter @cleaskopeliti or drop me an email at clea.skopeliti.casual@guardian.co.uk. Thanks very much. While many people in Iran\u2019s capital are taking advantage of loosened Covid-19 controls, some worry about a new spike in infections in what remains the Middle East\u2019s deadliest virus epicentre. \u201cThe line of fools,\u201d muttered shopkeeper Manouchehr, peering disdainfully at a queue of customers outside a foreign currency dealer in the Sadeghieh district of western Tehran. Many in the long line stood close to one another and did not wear masks. A traffic policeman told AFP such queues have appeared regularly ever since the money changers reopened. People rarely observe basic anti-contagion protocols, he complained. The government began paring back coronavirus controls outside Tehran a month ago, arguing that the economy \u2013 already sagging under punitive US sanctions \u2013 needed to get back to bare bones operations. It allowed small businesses to reopen in the capital a week later, before permitting malls to welcome customers on 21 April and barbers on Wednesday. At 802, declared daily infections in Iran on 2 May had reached their lowest level since early March. But this critical daily number has since begun resurging, breaching 1,500 on Saturday and, the following day, taking the total number of confirmed infections beyond 107,000. \u201cThe situation should in no way be considered normal,\u201d said health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, who warned of \u201ca critical situation\u201d in parts of the country. In the capital, a member of the virus taskforce warned that current health protocols could not contain the spread of the illness in Tehran. \u201cWith businesses reopening, people have forgotten about the protocols,\u201d Ali Maher told ISNA news agency, adding that \u201cmaybe it was too soon\u201d to return to normal life. New clusters of coronavirus infections are igniting concerns about a second wave even as calls grow in some countries to relax restrictions even further. In Germany, where thousands have protested in recent days against the remaining restrictions, health officials say the number of people each confirmed coronavirus patient infects rose above one again, reflecting a renewed increase in cases. The number must be below one for outbreaks to decline. Worldwide, health officials are anxiously watching to see just how much infection rates rise in a second wave as nations and states emerge from varying degrees of lockdown. China reported 14 new cases on Sunday, its first double-digit rise in 10 days. Eleven of 12 domestic infections were in the northeastern province of Jilin, which prompted authorities to raise the threat level in one of its counties, Shulan, to high risk, just days after downgrading all regions to low risk. Authorities said the Shulan outbreak originated with a 45-year-old woman who had no recent travel or exposure history but spread it to her husband, her three sisters and other family members. Train services in the county were being suspended. South Korea reported 34 more cases as new infections linked to nightclub-goers threatens the countrys hard-won gains against the virus. It was the first time that South Koreas daily infections were above 30 in about a month. Across Europe, many nations were easing lockdowns even further even as they prepared to clamp down on any new infections. Turkey\u2019s senior citizens on Sunday got their first chance in seven weeks to venture outside in seven weeks. France, which has a similar number of infections as Germany but a far higher death toll at over 26,300, is letting some younger students return to school Monday after almost two months out. With tourism a major industry in Italy, hotel owners, tour guides, beach resorts and others who depend heavily on the summer holiday season are pressing to know when citizens can travel across the country. In an newspaper interview on Sunday, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, promised that the restriction on inter-regional movement would be lifted but only after authorities better determine how the virus outbreak evolves. Residents in some Spanish regions will be able to enjoy limited seating at bars, restaurants and other public places on Monday but Madrid and Barcelona, the country\u2019s largest cities, will remain shut down. As Donald Trump tries to move on from the coronavirus, Congress is rushing to fill the void and prepare the country for the long fight ahead. Jolted by the lack of comprehensive federal planning as states begin to reopen, lawmakers of both parties, from the senior-most senators to the newest house member, are jumping in to develop policies and unleash resources to prevent a second wave. In the House and Senate, lawmakers are pushing sweeping proposals for a national virus testing strategy. One seasoned Republican wants a war-like public health fund. A New Jersey freshman launched neighboring colleagues on a regional bipartisan task force to help guide Northeastern states back to work. \u201cThis is going to be on us,\u201d said Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a former Navy helicopter pilot in her first term in Congress. The legislative branch is stepping up in the absence of a consistent, convincing White House strategy, in much the way governors have been forced to go it alone during the nations pandemic response. Congress is preparing its fifth coronavirus aid package, a Rooseveltian effort, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York put it. It\u2019s a Democratic-heavy plan that wary Republicans are watching, despite support in the party for some provisions. Unlike the aftermath of the Sept 11 attacks, when President George W. Bush called on Congress to create a Department of Homeland Security, or during the Great Depression, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt led the nation to the New Deal, Trump is not seeking a legacy-defining accomplishment in the heat of national crisis. Turkey\u2019s senior citizens got their first chance to venture outside in seven weeks on Sunday under relaxed coronavirus restrictions. People aged 65 and over \u2014 the age group most at risk from the virus \u2014 were subjected to a stay-at-home curfew on 21 March. As part of a rolling program of reduced controls, they are now allowed out for four hours. People under 20, who are also subject to a curfew, will be allowed outside for a similar period later this week. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to be out of the house after such a long time,\u201d said Ethem Topaloglu, 68, who wore a medical mask as he strolled in a park in Ankara, the capital. \u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been able to sit on the balcony, it\u2019s not the same as walking around outside.\u201d The relaxed curfew for over-65s came during the fifth weekend of lockdowns in Turkey\u2019s largest cities. Health minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted his thanks to the elderly for their great support in fighting the outbreak by staying at home and reminded them to wear masks outside. Turkey has recorded 137,115 infections, including 3,739 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Italy has tightened up rules for the release of mafia mobsters from jail due to coronavirus fears after public outcry. A decree adopted overnight now requires that any release is to be reviewed every fotnight to ensure that it was fully justified. Some 376 mafiosi and drug dealers have been moved from jails to house arrest since March and judges were examining release requests from 456 others, the Repubblica daily reported on Thursday. Those freed include notorious Cosa Nostra boss Francesco Bonura, 78, and Franco Cataldo, 85, who was part of a gang which murdered the teenage son of a turncoat in 1996 and dissolved his body in acid. The releases followed widespread riots in prisons in March by inmates fearful of catching the virus, which has killed some 30,000 people in Italy, but there was much public unease given the seriousness of some of their crimes, prompting the government to backtrack. \u201cNo one can think they can take advantage of the health emergency caused by the coronavirus to get out of prison,\u201d Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede told the AGI news agency. \u201cThere is a new rule now which is going to put things straight,\u201d Bonafede said. Israel partly reopened nurseries and kindergartens today, increasing the number of children who have returned to daycare as part of efforts to revive the economy. The country shut down the educational system in mid-March as contagions spiked. With the new case rate levelling out, classes resumed last week for the first three and last two grades of school, freeing up parents to go back to work. As with school pupils, preschoolers were allowed back with enhanced hygience requirements and group sizes capped - 17 for nurseries, 18 for kindergartens - to allow for social distancing. Kindergartens are for now accommodating the overflow by admitting children on a rotating half-week basis. Nurseries, by contrast, have allowed only 70% of children back, on full-week schedules, the Labor and Welfare Ministry said. In selecting which nursery children return, staff give priority to those from broken families or with single or working mothers, a ministry spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are trying to find creative solutions for the other 30%,\u201d she said. Israel, with a population of about nine million, has reported 16,458 new coronavirus cases and 248 deaths. Under nationwide business closures, unemployment has hit 27%. Officials have said that if the partial reopening of schools and return of preschoolers does not unleash uncontrollable new contagions, the rest of Israel\u2019s educational system could be operating by the end of May. The Education Ministry is also looking at the possibility of extending studies into the summer holiday to make up for lost time. Chinese authorities have reported what could be the beginning of a new wave of coronavirus cases in the northeast of the country, with one city in Jilin province being reclassified as high-risk. Jilin officials raised the risk level of the city of Shulan to high from medium, having raised it to medium from low just the day before after one woman tested positive on Thursday. Eleven new cases in Shulan were confirmed on Saturday, all of them members of her family or people who came into contact with her or family members, Reuters reported. Shulan has increased virus-control measures, including a lockdown of residential compounds, a ban on non-essential transportation and school closures, the Jilin government said. The new cases pushed the overall number of new confirmed cases in mainland China on Saturday to 14, according to the National Health Commission on Sunday \u2013 the highest number since April 28. Among them was the first case for more than a month in the city of Wuhan in central Hubei province where the outbreak was first detected late last year. As the lockdown lifts in Greece, people in the county \u2013 like many others in Europe \u2013 have been left astonished and alarmed by the UK government\u2019s handling of the public health emergency. Britain\u2019s chaotic strategy, initial soft-touch approach and high death toll have been met with disbelief in a country that, despite the eviscerating effects of a near decade-long debt crisis, has kept the virus under control. \u201cJohnson\u2019s management of the pandemic has been almost Mediterranean in style, flippant and carefree,\u201d said the economic analyst Antonis Papagiannidis. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but think that people have been left to rot, that the interests of the economy were put before health.\u201d China has issued a lengthy rebuttal of what it said were 24 \u201cpreposterous allegations\u201d by some leading US politicians, including secretary of state Mike Pompeo, over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Chinese foreign ministry has dedicated most of its press briefings over the past week to rejecting accusations that China had withheld information about the coronavirus outbreak and that it had originated in a laboratory in the city of Wuhan, Reuters reported. A 30-page, 11,000-word article posted on the ministry website on Saturday night repeated and expanded on the refutations, and began by invoking Abraham Lincoln, the 19th-century US president. As Lincoln said, you can fool some of the people all the time and fool all the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time. Attempting to quash suggestions that the virus was deliberately created or somehow leaked from the Wuhan institute of virology, the article added that all the evidence shows the virus is not man-made and that the institute is not capable of synthesising a new coronavirus. Uki Go\u00f1i in Buenos Aires and Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro When Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez took office as Argentina\u2019s president in December, his inauguration was boycotted by Brazil\u2019s hard-right leader, who dismissed Fern\u00e1ndez and his vice-president, the two-time former president Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, as \u201cleftwing bandits\u201d. For Jair Bolsonaro, Argentina\u2019s new Peronist government represented a throwback to the \u201cpink tide\u201d of Latin American leaders which coincided with Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner\u2019s time in office from 2007 to 2015. \u201cArgentina is starting to head in the direction of Venezuela,\u201d Bolsonaro predicted. Five months on, it is Brazil that is heading in the direction of a humanitarian emergency, amid a devastating coronavirus outbreak propelled by Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissive attitude towards the pandemic. In contrast, Argentina swiftly imposed a national lockdown, and appears to have successfully flattened the curve of contagion. \u201cYou can recover from a drop in the GDP,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez has said about his decision to implement an early lockdown. \u201cBut you can\u2019t recover from death.\u201d It\u2019s been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life. From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a \u201ccorona bubble\u201d, who can visit each other\u2019s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, also being discussed by the British government, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown. Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people\u2019s wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother\u2019s Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident. Flamingos are continuing to flourish in an Albanian coastal lagoon as the drop in air and marine traffic offers wildlife respite. Similarly to in Mumbai, where thousands of flamingos have flocked, local officials and residents have said the flamingo population is up to about 3,000 at Narta Lagoon, an important waterfowl habitat south-west of Tirana that flamingos returned to in recent years after a long absence. Bird watchers also have noticed more pelicans, herons and other species this spring at the 28 square mile lagoon amidst the lockdown measures. Dhimiter Konomi, who is part of a local group that manages commercial fishing in Narta Lagoon, said: Isn\u2019t that beautiful to see fearless flamingos all around? Global cases at over 4 million Global coronavirus cases stand at 4,024,973, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 279,321. The US has the most fatalities, at 78,794, followed by the UK (31,662) and Italy (30,395). UK death toll \u2018could hit 100,000 if lockdown eased too fast\u2019 The Sunday Times is reporting that the UK death toll could climb to 100,000 if lockdown restrictions ease too quickly. At 7pm BST on Sunday, British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, but some scientists are worried about a second wave of the virus. According to the report the PM has been warned of having \u201cvery little room to manoeuvre\u201d by his top scientific advisors and told Britain could suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if ministers relax the lockdown too far and too fast, the paper reports a scientific adviser telling the government last night. New infections on rise in Germany New coronavirus infections are accelerating again in Germany just days after its leaders loosened social restrictions, raising concerns that the pandemic could once again slip out of control. The Robert Koch Institute for disease control said in a daily bulletin the number of people each sick person now infects \u2013 known as the reproduction rate, or R \u2013 had risen to 1.1. France reports new cluster hours before lockdown ends Hours before France ends its strict seven-week coronavirus lockdown on Monday, a worrying new Covid-19 cluster has been reported in the Dordogne. The outbreak has been traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L\u2019Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt \u2013 population 500 \u2013 south of P\u00e9rigueux. The man did not die of Covid-19. Bars closed in South Korean capital Seoul, the South Korean capital, has closed bars and clubs over fears of a second virus wave, after more than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend. Three White House taskforce members self-quarantine Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. Sweden apologises for failing to protect older people \u201cWe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious, and a failure for society as a whole.\u201d Sweden\u2019s government has apologised for not protecting older people, with 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 deaths occurring in the over-70s. Japan sees rise in bullying of sick people There has been an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers in Japan, with the PM labelling such behaviour \u201cshameful\u201d. Musk says he may quit California Tesla CEO Elon Musk has threatened to pull his factory and headquarters out of California, saying health authorities have gone overboard in their corona protection measures, which do not allow Tesla to open. Djibouti, the tiny Horn of Africa nation with the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent per capita, reversed plans to begin lifting lockdown measures this week, saying it was premature. \u201cThe government, through the voice of the prime minister, has decided to extend the confinement for another week until 17 May,\u201d Foreign Minister Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said in a Twitter post. \u201cNoting that the prerequisite conditions are not yet in place, the government made this decision just now,\u201d he said. The tiny but strategically important country that hosts major US and French military bases has recorded 1,189 positive cases - few on a global scale, but the highest number in East Africa. Three people have died. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention says Djibouti has the highest number of cases in Africa relative to its population, though its testing has also outpaced many of its neighbours. On March 23 the government announced a nationwide lockdown, closing borders and places of worship, banning public transport and allowing only workers in essential industries to go outside. Yet the measures have been largely ignored, with large crowds still common in the capital city. President Ismail Omar Guelleh, in power since 1999, warned last month of \u201ceven tougher measures\u201d if the population did not respect confinement rules. Kyrgyzstan will end the toughest restrictions it introduced to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, such as curfews, and allow certain businesses to reopen from Monday, the Central Asian nation\u2019s government said today. The former Soviet republic will in the meantime keep in place lockdown regulations barring travel between provinces, the cabinet said. Among the businesses allowed to reopen from 11 May are providers of maintenance, cleaning and financial services, lawyers, property and tourist agents, as well as some non-food retailers. Kyrgyzstan, which borders China, has confirmed 1,002 Covid-19 cases, of which 12 have died and 675 people have recovered. Spain has logged its lowest single-day death toll in almost two months as around half the country prepares to move into the next phase of the lockdown de-escalation plan on Monday. According to the latest figures from the health ministry, there were 143 deaths over the past 24 hours, and new 621 new cases. To date, Spain has confirmed 224,390 cases and 26,621 deaths. From Monday, 51% of the country will see a loosening of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns that will allow groups of up to 10 people to meet while observing social distancing rules. Small businesses will be allowed to open, while cafes and restaurants will be able to open their outdoor terraces, which can operate at 50% capacity. Places of worship will also reopen, but will need to to operate at 30% capacity. The easing of restictions has been decided on a region-by-region basis. The Madrid and Barcelona regions - two of the hardest-hit parts of Spain - will not be able to move into the next phase for the time being as they do not currently meet the health ministry\u2019s de-escalation criteria. The health minister has warned that the transition to what the government calls \u201cthe new normality\u201d cannot be rushed. \u201cI want to insist that this is not a race, decisions must be based on cooperation and caution,\u201d Salvador Illa said on Friday. Antibody testing at a hospital in Lodi, the province in Lombardy where the first domestic transmission of coronavirus was detected in Italy, has shown that 20% of health workers had contracted the illness without knowing. The hospital, where Italy\u2019s \u2018Patient 1\u2019 was treated, is the first to complete serological tests on all of its 2,243 staff as part of a region-wide programme. In addition to the 296 staff who had tested positive for the virus up until 8 May, 77 had been infected but showed no symptoms. The antibody testing programme got underway across Lombardy on 23 April, with 33,306 people so far tested, of which 25,331 are healthcare workers. Lombardy is the region of Italy most severely affected by the virus, accounting for almost half of the country\u2019s 30,395 fatalities. Italy registered 194 new deaths on Saturday as the number of active infections fell to 84,842 and the number of people who have recovered rose to over 103,000. The country began easing lockdown restrictions last Monday, allowing people to visit relatives and partners within their regions and go for a walk or exercise in the park. People must still maintain social distancing, but images of busy parks in Milan and Turin over the weekend, as well as of people gathering for drinks in the Navigli canal district in Milan, have sparked criticism. Milan\u2019s mayor, Beppe Sala, said he was \u201cpissed off\u201d at the scenes of socialising in Navigli, and warned he would close the area completely if citizens didn\u2019t respect the rules. Bars and restaurants across Italy can provide takeout services, but people aren\u2019t allowed to gather outside. With travel between regions still banned, the majority of Italians are respecting the lockdown rules and staying home, venturing out only for essential reasons. Hours before France ends its strict seven-week coronavirus lockdown on Monday, a worrying new Covid-19 cluster has been reported in the Dordogne. The outbreak has been traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L\u2019Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt \u2013 population 500 \u2013 south of P\u00e9rigueux. The man did not die of Covid-19. Local newspapers Midi Libre and Sud Ouest reported that about 20 people had gathered to pay their respects to the man, while allegedly following the distancing rules. However, afterwards many more turned up to the cemetery, some from Switzerland and Portugal from where the dead man originated. Afterwards, a member of the family went to his local GP with Covid-19 symptoms and tested positive. The following day, five others were found to have been infected. The regional health agency identified, traced and tested those who had been in contact with those infected individuals, a total of 127 people. According to partial results, nine tested positive. The results of 63 tests are still not known. \u201cThe situation has been brought under control,\u201d a health official said. During a press conference, local prefect Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Perissat said the cluster was \u201can illustration of what we are hoping not to live through in the next few weeks\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a slackening off, people gather in a group of 20 or 30 and one person contaminates others,\u201d Perissat said. The Dordogne department is \u201cgreen\u201d in the government\u2019s coronavirus map, suggesting the virus is not circulating widely and the hospital intensive care departments are not \u201csaturated\u201d with cases. Spain\u2019s daily death toll from the coronavirus fell to 143 on Sunday, down from 179 the previous day, the health ministry reported. It marks the lowest daily death toll since mid-March. Overall deaths rose to 26,621 from 26,478 on Saturday and the number of diagnosed cases rose to 224,390 from 223,578 the day before, the ministry said. New coronavirus infections are accelerating again in Germany just days after its leaders loosened social restrictions, raising concerns that the pandemic could once again slip out of control. The Robert Koch Institute for disease control said in a daily bulletin the number of people each sick person now infects \u2013 known as the reproduction rate, or R \u2013 had risen to 1.1. Chancellor Angela Merkel bowed to pressure from leaders of Germany\u2019s 16 federal states to restart social life and revive the economy, announced on Wednesday measures that included more shop openings and a gradual return to school. At the same time, she launched an \u201cemergency brake\u201d to allow for the reimposition of restrictions if infections pick up again. Karl Lauterbach, a Social Democrat lawmaker and professor of epidemiology, warned that the new coronavirus could start spreading again quickly after seeing large crowds out and about on Saturday in his home city of Cologne. \u201cIt has to be expected that the R rate will go over 1 and we will return to exponential growth,\u201d Lauterbach said in a tweet. \u201cThe loosening measures were far too poorly prepared.\u201d The Robert Koch Institute said on Sunday the confirmed number of new coronavirus cases had increased by a daily 667 to 169,218, while the daily death toll had risen by 26 to 7,395. \u201cIt is too early to infer whether the number of new infections will continue to decrease as in the past weeks or increase again,\u201d the institute said in a separate daily bulletin issued on Saturday evening. It cautioned that the R figure was subject to statistical uncertainty, adding: \u201cThe increase of the reproduction number R necessitates a close monitoring of the situation.\u201d Germany has the sixth-largest Covid-19 caseload in Europe but has managed to contain fatalities from the highly infectious respiratory disease thanks to widespread and early testing and a healthcare system that is well-run and well-funded. Afghanistan has announced its highest one-day rise of new infections as the government issued a decree to distribute bread to those affected by coronavirus. This comes as at least six people were killed in a protest against unfair distribution of aid. 361 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 reported in the war-torn country, marking the biggest one-day rise of infections, five patients also died overnight, taking the total number of infections to 4,402 and death toll to 120. The capital Kabul, which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area recorded its worst day with 117 new cases confirmed in last 24 hours. Total number of infections in the capital passed 1,000 and now stands at 1,096. The country\u2019s health minister, Ferozuddin Feroz, has been isolating at home after being infected with the virus, meanwhile local officials in Kandahar announced its governor also tested positive as 26 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in the southern province. Toward the east, six out of the eight new coronavirus cases in Nangarhar were from province\u2019s prison, said Shah Mahmoud Meyakhil, provincial governor, adding there are 12 other suspected cases are in the prison. The government announced yesterday that it was planning to distribute bread amongst the poor across the country with around two million Afghans losing their jobs due to the pandemic. However, the heath ministry raised concerns that the distribution of bread through bakeries will even worsen the situation. \u201cSome bread is being distributed in the bakeries, but more people gathering. It has more disadvantages than advantages because the virus is spreading rapidly,\u201d said Wahidullah Mayar, a spokesman for the health ministry. At least six people were killed and more than a dozen wounded yesterday in a protest went violent against the unfair distribution of aid to those affected by coronavirus in central Ghor province of Afghanistan. Interior ministry spokesman said two police officers and four civilians were killed, including a journalist. The country\u2019s vice president apologised for the incident and said will investigate that. \u201cI want the countrymen of Ghor to keep calm, we will investigate the case seriously. I apologies for the incompetence of the management. Forgive us\u201d, Amrullah Saleh said in a Facebook post. As France prepares to start letting public life resume after eight weeks under lockdown, many parents are debating whether to send their children back to school. The French government is easing some of the closure and home-confinement orders it imposed on 17 March to curb infections, with businesses permitted to reopen, residents cleared to return to workplaces and schools welcoming some students. Only preschools and elementary schools are set to start up at first, and classes will be capped at 10 students at preschools and 15 elsewhere. Administrators were told to prioritise instruction for children ages five, six and 10. Due to the slow startup, as well as ongoing fears about Covid-19, school attendance will not be compulsory right away. Parents and guardians may keep children at home and teachers will provide lessons like they have during the nationwide lockdown. Students with parents who want or need to send them to school are not guaranteed places in the smaller classes and will be allowed to attend only if their school can accommodate them. Education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer estimated 80% to 85% of France\u2019s 50,500 preschools and elementary schools will open this week. Junior high schools in regions with fewer virus cases are expected to reopen on 18 May. A target date has not been scheduled yet for for high schools. Cecile Bardin, whose two sons are aged six and two, said she thinks it is too soon to send them back. \u201cI am not reassured at the moment, because it will be very difficult to keep safe distance at school, especially for the little ones, who will want to play together,\u201d Bardin said. Mathilde Manaud and her partner, who have a three-year-old and seven-year-old, have agreed to send the children kids back to school if there are spaces. \u201cTruth is, we don\u2019t know whether we are right to do so or no, we don\u2019t know if its a mistake. We ask ourselves this question every day, and we change our mind every day,\u201d Manaud said. \u201cWe are trying to convince ourselves that if they are reopening, they assume they can handle the situation.\u201d A navy ship carrying evacuees from the Maldives arrived in India today as part of an effort to bring home hundreds of thousands of nationals stranded overseas due to the coronavirus lockdown. Workers and students were unable to return home after India banned all incoming international flights in late March as part of the world\u2019s biggest lockdown to combat the spread of the deadly infectious disease. The warship INS Jalashwa carrying 698 Indians from the Maldives capital of Male arrived at Cochin port on the southwestern coast of India on Sunday morning. It followed the arrival of 326 Indians from London early Sunday at Mumbai\u2019s international airport. Another warship, INS Magar, is expected to arrive at Male on Sunday to repatriate more stranded Indians. Around 4,000 of the 27,000 Indians living in the Maldives have registered to be taken home. The naval efforts are part of an initial operation to repatriate almost 15,000 Indians from 12 countries. The repatriation process is expected to be expanded in the next few weeks to include more stranded citizens in other European and Southeast Asian nations, local media reported. Malaysia\u2019s government extended the time frame for movement and business curbs by another four weeks to 9 June, amid a gradual reopening of economic activity stunted by the coronavirus pandemic. Earlier this week, businesses were allowed to resume business as usual, albeit under strict health guidelines, after having to close shop for two months as health authorities worked to contain the pandemic. Malaysia has so far reported 6,589 cases with 108 deaths. Existing rules under a conditional movement control order remain in place until the new expiry date in June, which include practicing strict hygiene and social distancing, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said in a televised address on Sunday. Hello, I will be updating the blog. Please send any tips and stories to nazia.parveen@theguardian.com or follow me on Twitter @NParveenG to send me a message. Thank you. Here are the most important recent developments, including that global cases have passed 4 million. Seoul, the South Korean capital, has closed bars and clubs over fears of a second virus wave, after more than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend. Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cWe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious, and a failure for society as a whole.\u201d Sweden\u2019s government has apologised for not protecting older people, with 90% of the country\u2019s Covid-19 deaths occurring in the over-70s. Social-distancing rules are being ignored in Tehran, with people saying they need to get back to work to earn a living. Since 2 May, the number of cases has begun to rise, and many in the capital are not wearing masks or keeping their distance. There has been an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers in Japan, with the PM labelling such behaviour \u201cshameful\u201d. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has threatened to pull his factory and headquarters out of California, saying health authorities have gone overboard in their corona protection measures, which do not allow Tesla to open. UK prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he outlines his plans to gradually ease the lockdown. They prepared for icy cold and trained to be on the watch for polar bears, but a pandemic just wasn\u2019t part of the program. Now dozens of scientists are waiting in quarantine for the all-clear to join a year-long Arctic research mission aimed at improving the models used for forecasting climate change, just as the expedition reaches a crucial phase. For a while, the international mission looked like it might have to be called off, as country after country went into lockdown because of the virus, scuppering plans to bring fresh supplies and crew to the German research vessel Polarstern that\u2019s been moored in the high Arctic since last year. News of the pandemic caused jitters among those already on board, said Matthew Shupe, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Colorado and co-leader of the MOSAiC expedition. Some people just wanted to be home with their families, he told The Associated Press in a video interview from the German port of Bremerhaven, where he and about 90 other scientists and crew have been kept in isolation to ensure they\u2019re virus-free. Organizers at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Ocean Research managed to fly out a handful of people via Canada last month. The rest of the crew will be exchanged with the help of two other German research ships that will meet the Polarstern on the sea ice edge. That upcoming rendezvous will force the Polarstern to abandon its current position for three weeks at a critical time in the Arctic cycle. \u201cWe are on the cusp right now of the onset of the sea ice melt season and that\u2019s a really important transition,\u201d said Shupe. \u201cThat could happen when the ship is gone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a distinct risk we face.\u201d To avoid missing out on key data, researchers will leave some instruments behind, including an 11-meter (36-foot) tower used for atmospheric measurements, and hope that it\u2019s still there when they return. The ice could just come together and destroy everything,\u201d said Shupe. \u201cHopefully that doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d Scientists on the 140-million-euro ($158 million) expedition have already gathered valuable data since setting out last September with 100 researchers and crew from 17 nations including the United States, France, China and Britain. The intense interest into research about the coronavirus could have a positive knock-on effect for fields such as climate science, said Shupe. \u201cEverybody is now looking at the new for models of how this (virus) spreads,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps this actually opens the door to more people to understand the climate problem.\u201d Still, the researchers on MOSAiC are hoping to deal with one problem at a time, hence the strict quarantine to avoid any chance of carrying the coronavirus into the Arctic. \u201cWe definitely don\u2019t want anybody getting sick and we don\u2019t want to take that out to the ship, said Shupe. Realistically, it\u2019s actually one of the safest places on Earth right now.\u201d The Associated Press The Sunday Times is reporting that the UK death toll could climb to 100,000 if lockdown restrictions ease too quickly. At 7pm on Sunday British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, but some scientists are worried about a second wave of the virus. According to the report the PM has been warned of having \u201cvery little room to manoeuvre\u201d by his top scientific advisors and told Britain could suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if ministers relax the lockdown too far and too fast, the paper reports a scientific adviser telling the government last night. Following on from the below post, an extract from a just-published Observer feature, you may wonder what antibody testing is, and why it\u2019s so important. The aim of using antibody tests is to conduct what is known as serosurveillance or a serosurvey. This means testing a sample of a population to get an indication of how prevalent Covid-19 infections have been, including those who have been asymptomatic or only suffered mild symptoms Antibody tests search for the Y-shaped proteins produced by the body in response to an infection that linger (in some cases permanently) in the blood for some time after recovery. The hope is that policymakers will be able to obtain accurate models of how far the epidemic has spread, and what the real infection tallies are, a topic that has become increasingly heated in recent weeks. Acquiring accurate antibody data will also be vital for vaccine developers to verify that their products are working as intended during clinical trials. Results from serosurveys will eventually help tell us whether exposure to Covid-19 provides immunity, or if we will face seasonal waves of infections. And intriguingly, they may assist in determining the importance of pre-existing immunity. Scientists have already wondered whether the differences in fatalities between various countries is due to certain populations having had greater exposure to similar viruses in the past. But to gather truly reliable information, the antibody tests used must be shown to have a high degree of accuracy, something that has so far proven to be easier said than done. Read more here: At the Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, Marion Koopmans and a team of scientists are going throught the laborious process of verifying antibody tests for Covid-19. Over the last two months, dozens of prospective tests have hit the market, and with many governments wanting to feed the results of large-scale testing into their decisions whether to end lockdowns, biological tests have rarely carried such weight. Most of the tests are enthusiastically marketed, boasting of their ability to accurately detect whether someone has previously been infected with the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The painstaking job of proving whether the tests do what they say has fallen to a worldwide network of 12 independent centres, of which Koopmans\u2019s team is one. \u201cThere are now more than 200 tests being offered and that number is increasing by the day,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause people want to have testing up and running fast, there\u2019s this massive, almost aggressive marketing of test kits that promise a lot, but haven\u2019t gone through proper scrutiny.\u201d Read more from this Observer feature here: After facing the existential threat of testing positive for Covid-19, these Australians describe the reactions of their communities, and the loneliness, isolation and pain many of them felt. For Sean Sweetser, 50, the disease felt biblical: \u201cI felt like a leper\u201d For Sweetser, who lives in a share house with his 18-year-old son and a roommate, isolating in his bedroom was easy enough. He plugged a throwaway kettle into his en suite, had an assortment of disinfectants on hand and kept himself entertained with streaming services. He worked sporadically as an engineer. At the height of his symptoms, he stayed in bed. After some concern about how he and his son would be fed, the problem was solved by Sikh Volunteers Australia who dropped off hot meals. Logistically, most things were there: except empathy. \u201cThere was no compassion for me or the fact I might die, just themselves,\u201d he says of his son and roommate, who entertained conspiracy theories about the virus. Even after an honest conversation about their hostility, little changed, Sweetser recounts. \u201cIt felt biblical, I felt like a leper,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was the hardest part \u2013 being ostracised in your own home.\u201d Sweetser was cautious and managed to recover without infecting either housemate. But when his son left the air conditioning running for too long \u2013 a pet peeve of Sweetser \u2013 he jokingly threatened to touch the remote without a glove. As a regular blood donor in the past, Sweetser has been hoping researchers will ask him to be a part of a trial or make a blood donation. Instead, the question he does get often is if he will write a science fiction book on a deadly virus, having already published a few e-books in the genre. His answer is firm no: \u201cIt\u2019s boring. I like an enemy you can see \u2026 I prefer something like robots.\u201d Read more accounts from Covid-19 survivors down under here: In Mexico, coronavirus patients were being turned away from hospitals on Saturday, as both public and private medical facilities quickly filled up and the number of new infections continued to rise. Of the 64 public hospitals in the capital\u2019s sprawling metro area designated to receive Covid-19 patients, 26 were completely full, according to city government data. Mexico announced 1,938 new cases of the virus on Saturday, bringing the total to 33,460, along with 193 additional deaths, bringing fatalities to 3,353. Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce have placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. Anthony Fauci, a high-profile member of the White House coronavirus response team, is considered to be at relatively low risk based on the degree of his exposure, according to a representative for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Fauci, the 79-year-old NIAID director, has tested negative for COVID-19 and he will continue to be tested regularly. Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be \u201cteleworking for the next two weeks\u201d after it was determined he had a \u201clow-risk exposure\u201d to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He has tested negative for the virus. Vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive this week. A member of the military serving as one of Trump\u2019s valets tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was not worried about the virus spreading in the White House. New Zealand police have been busy over the weekend as Kiwis break lockdown in record numbers on the eve of an announcement from the PM on restrictions easing. On Monday Prime minister Jacinda Ardern will announce whether lockdown will effectively end, after 7 weeks of some of the strictest lockdown measures in the world confining Kiwis to their homes. On Sunday police reported that 50 people breached Level 3 lockdown rules in 24 hours, including a family hosting a children\u2019s birthday party, and a backyard church gathering. Wellington City Council spokesman Richard MacLean told local media that capital city Wellington was \u201clike rush hour\u201d over the weekend, while the beach and walking tracks \u201chave taken a hammering\u201d. The World Health Organisation has issued guidance on whether you can catch coronavirus from food packaging or food touched by an infected person. \u201cWhile there\u2019s no evidence to date that anyone has been infected this way, it is always good to practice food safety.\u201d WHO tweeted. Like many couples in the era of social distancing, Ma Jialun and Zhang Yitong held their wedding ceremony online \u2013 but they added a twist by livestreaming the event to more than 100,000 strangers. Wedding preparations are now restarting since all provinces in China have lifted their top-level state of emergency and life is beginning to show some return to normality. However, banquets and big gatherings are still not allowed, leaving an online celebration as a preferred option. In China - where livestreaming is extremely popular - some young couples are allowing anyone to watch their big day - and even send them gifts. Groom Ma and his bride Zhang got married in the eastern city of Hangzhou on May 1, more than 100,000 impromptu guests watched it live on video-streaming site Bilibili, leaving likes, comments and virtual coins and gifts. Just a dozen people were able to join in person. Ma joined Zhang just one day before their wedding as Beijing lifted quarantine measures. They had been seperated by lockdowns for three months. \u201cThis epidemic has made us feel that we could become each other\u2019s strength,\u201d said Ma. The pair said they wanted to share their big day online to do something meaningful during the epidemic. \u201cIt\u2019s good to share our happiness with more people, even unknown netizens,\u201d said Ma. Endless possibilities While many couples are content with a simple ceremony, livestreaming platform Huajiao has used special effects to give one of its employees their dream wedding. \u201cWhen we were designing the wedding, the bride told us that her dream wedding would be held in a hot-air balloon in front of a castle, so we used the special effects to make her dream come true,\u201d said Huajiao\u2019s online wedding event organiser Liu Qi. He thinks these special effects and the chance to share the fun on social media will appeal to young Chinese people. \u201cIt may be difficult to realise in the real world, but there are endless possibilities online,\u201d Liu said. \u201cYoung couples have more and more diverse demands,\u201d said Liu. \u201cBut this kind of online wedding may become a new option for couples in the future even when the epidemic ends.\u201d Agence France Presse Here are the most important recent developments, including that global cases have passed four million. Seoul, the South Korean capital has closed bars and clubs over fears of a second virus wave, after more than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend.

UK prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he outlines his plans to gradually ease the lockdown. As many ignore social distancing practices in Tehran, residents worry about a new wave of infections, AFP reports. \u201cThe line of fools,\u201d muttered shopkeeper Manouchehr, peering disdainfully at a queue of customers outside a foreign currency dealer in Tehran. Many in the long line stood close to one another and did not wear masks. A traffic policeman told AFP such queues have appeared regularly ever since the money changers re-opened. People rarely observe basic anti-contagion protocols, he said. The government began paring back coronavirus controls outside Tehran on 11 April, arguing that the economy \u2013 already sagging under punitive US sanctions \u2013 needed to get back to bare bones operations. At 802, declared daily infections on 2 May reached their lowest level since early March. But this critical daily number has since begun rising, breaching 1,500 on Saturday to take the country\u2019s total number of confirmed infections beyond 106,000. The capital\u2019s streets, bazaars and malls are now bustling after being nearly deserted for weeks after the bulk of control measures were imposed in March. Milad, a shopkeeper in a mall, was conflicted about the easing of movement restrictions. \u201cAll these customers coming in will endanger our lives - us who are forced to come\u201d to work, he said. Covid-19 has killed nearly 6,600 people in Iran since the first two fatalities were reported in the city of Qom on 19 February. Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi has called Tehran the country\u2019s \u201cAchilles heel\u201d in the fight against the virus. The city\u2019s eight million residents are densely packed together and it is a magnet for hundreds of thousands of workers from other provinces. Health officials have vowed to reimpose stringent measures if the number of cases continues to climb. But many Iranians remain adamant that they have to work to avoid financial ruin. \u201cLife costs money,\u201d said Hamed. \u201cPeople have to go to work since this virus has been with us for about three months now.\u201d The 22-year-old was among those out on the streets without a mask, deeming such protection \u201clargely ineffective\u201d. Agence France Presse Unlike many European countries, Sweden has kept its primary schools open as well as bars and restaurants, while urging people to respect social distancing and hygiene recommendations. Sweden kept its primary schools, bars and restaurants open - unlike many of its European neighbours - but it did ban visits to care homes on March 31. Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours also introduced bans around the same time, but have recorded far fewer care home deaths. But unlike in those countries, Swedish nursing homes are often large complexes with hundreds of residents. They are only available to those in very poor health and unable to care for themselves, and residents are, therefore \u201ca very vulnerable group\u201d, according to Henrik Lysell of the Board of Health and Welfare. Bjorn Branngard told AFP the personnel at his mother\u2019s home did not have proper protective gear. \u201cThere was no protection. The personnel were going between different sections and spreading the virus.\u201d In greater Stockholm, the epicentre of Sweden\u2019s virus spread, 55 percent of nursing homes have so far confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to Region Stockholm health authorities. Kommunal, Sweden\u2019s largest union for municipal employees which includes many care workers, has meanwhile blamed precarious working conditions for the unfolding tragedy. It said that in March, 40 percent of staff at Stockholm nursing homes were unskilled workers employed on short-term contracts, with hourly wages and no job security, while 23 percent were temps. In other words: people who often can\u2019t afford not to go to work even if they\u2019re sick. \u201cThere are a lot of different people who work at several nursing homes, and that also leads to a greater spread,\u201d the head of Kommunal\u2019s nursing home division, Ulf Bjerregaard, said. Abdullah, a pseudonym for a 21-year-old refugee who didn\u2019t want to disclose his real name, has worked as an assistant in a care home outside Stockholm for two years. He told AFP about a resident treated in hospital for a broken leg. \u201cShe tested negative for the virus when she was with us. When she returned from the hospital three days later, she was positive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had protective aprons but no masks when we were working with her,\u201d he said, adding that he has since refused to go to work. Sweden\u2019s soft response to the coronavirus has been controversial, and now authorities have admitted they failed to adequately protect the elderly, with around half of COVID-19 deaths occurring among nursing home residents. 3,220 have died from the virus in Sweden, and although the country said early on that shielding those 70 and older was its top priority, 90 percent of those who had died as of April 28 were over the age of 70. Half were nursing home residents, and another quarter were receiving care at home, statistics from the Swedish Board of Health and Welfare show. \u201cWe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious, and a failure for society as a whole. We have to learn from this, we\u2019re not done with this pandemic yet,\u201d Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren told Swedish Television recently. The nation has been held up as a global model in how to curb the virus, but the order from the Seoul mayor on Saturday followed the new infection cluster in Itaewon, one of the city\u2019s busiest nightlife districts. More than two dozen cases were linked to a 29-year-old man who tested positive after spending time at five clubs and bars in Itaewon last weekend. Health authorities have warned of a further spike in infections, with around 7,200 people estimated to have visited the five establishments identified. \u201cCarelessness can lead to an explosion in infections,\u201d Seoul mayor Park Won-soon said, adding the order will remain in effect indefinitely. Of the 18 new South Korean cases reported on Saturday, 17 were tied to the Itaewon cluster, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The jump in new infections comes as everyday life in South Korea has slowly started returning to normal, with the government relaxing social distancing rules last Wednesday. The nation endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the disease outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing had been widely observed since March. Th country\u2019s extensive \u201ctrace, test and treat\u201d programme has drawn widespread praise, and the latest outbreak appears to be under control. 34 new cases were reported on Sunday, taking the total to 10,874 - the largest daily increase in a month. Agence France Presse An Agence France Presse photojournalist has been granted rare access to a psychiatric ward under lockdown in France, which has one of the highest death tolls in Europe. The patients of the Centre psychiatrique du Bois de Bondy have been under strict lockdown since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in France in mid-March, and they haven\u2019t received any visits from their relatives since. According to a tribune published by a group French psychiatrists early April 2020, a person affected by a psychiatric disease can suffer 1.5 or 2 times more often, compared to the rest of the population, from associated conditions, such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes or hypertension, and are therefore more vulnerable to Covid-19. Images by @LoicVenance The Associated Press reports that the coronavirus in Japan has brought not just an epidemic of infections, but also an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers trying to save lives. A government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers. But it\u2019s made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic. Apart from fear of infection, experts say the prejudice against those even indirectly associated with the illness also stems from deeply rooted ideas about purity and cleanliness in a culture that rejects anything deemed to be alien, unclean or troublesome. Medical workers risking their lives to care for patients are a main target, but people working at grocery stores, delivering parcels and carrying out other essential jobs also are facing harassment, as are their family members. \u201cI can imagine people fear the virus, but we are working hard at the front lines under enormous pressure,\u201d a nurse in her 30s told the AP, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she might be targeted if identified. \u201cWe also have our own families we care about. Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\u201d The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThe virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behaviour, harming us and dividing our society,\u201d Morimitsu said. Random acts of hatred against those with virus connections have been reported countrywide, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials to speak out. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d Abe told a recent parliamentary session. Sam Neill, the New Zealand actor famous for roles in Jurassic Park and Hunt for the Wilderpeople has kept busy during lockdown filming short videos designed to cheer his followers up. Today, he shared his tips for combating anxiety and sleeplessness. \u201cSmile stupidly in the dark\u201d Sam Neill UK prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to unveil a coronavirus warning system for England when he outlines his plans to gradually ease the lockdown. The prime minister will drop the \u201cstay home\u201d slogan and instead tell the country to \u201cstay alert, control the virus and save lives\u201d when he outlines his \u201croadmap\u201d to a new normality during an address to the nation on Sunday. Johnson is planning to tell workers who cannot do their jobs from home to begin returning to their workplaces while following social distancing rules. It is understood that a warning system administered by a new \u201cjoint biosecurity centre\u201d will detect local increases in infection rates, with the aim of altering restrictions locally in England. The alerts will range from green at level one to red at level five. Johnson is expected to say that the nation as a whole is close to moving down from four to three. The prime minister will chair a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee with cabinet ministers, leaders of the devolved nations and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, before his 7pm pre-recorded address. On Monday, the government will publish a 50-page document outlining the full plan to cautiously restart the economy to MPs. China\u2019s National Health Commission reported 14 new confirmed coronavirus cases on May 9, the highest number since April 28 and up from only one case a day earlier. Of the new cases, two were imported infections. The remaining 12 confirmed cases were locally transmitted, including 11 cases in the northeastern province of Jilin. Newly discovered asymptomatic cases were at 20, the highest since May 1 and up from 15 a day earlier, according to the health commission. No new deaths were reported, it said. The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country reached 82,901 as of May 9, while the total death toll from the virus stood at 4,633, it said. On Sunday, Jilin province raised the coronavirus risk level of Shulan city from medium to high after a cluster of 11 cases were confirmed in Shulan. The move came after all areas in China were considered low-risk on Thursday. Reuters Associated Press is reporting that three members of the White House coronavirus task force have placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19. Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be \u201cteleworking for the next two weeks\u201d after it was determined he had a \u201clow-risk exposure\u201d to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms. The Food and Drug Administration confirmed that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He has tested negative for the virus. Anthony Fauci, a high-profile member of the White House coronavirus response team, is considered to be at relatively low risk based on the degree of his exposure, according to a representative for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Fauci, the 79-year-old NIAID director, has tested negative for COVID-19 and he will continue to be tested regularly. Vice president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive this week. A member of the military serving as one of Trump\u2019s valets tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. President Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was not worried about the virus spreading in the White House. On Monday New Zealand\u2019s cabinet will decide whether to downgrade the country\u2019s alert system from Level 3 to Level 2. With less than a dozen cases of the virus recorded this past week, it is widely assumed the country will lower its alert level, allowing domestic travel, the opening of bars and restaurants and the widening of \u201cbubbles\u201d - meaning people can leave the home to meet friends, family or even online dates. Schools and workplaces will also reopen. The country\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has described New Zealand as \u201chalf-way down Everest\u201d in its battle against the virus, which has claimed 21 lives. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed that the state\u2019s lockdown will begin to ease on Friday, after only two new cases of the virus were recorded on Sunday. Loosened rules will permit outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, meaning it\u2019s the first time since the new rules were introduced that people will be able to leave the home for recreational activities. Berejiklian says a gathering of 10 people might be physical training, sitting down in a park, or \u201chaving some type of gathering outdoors\u201d. NSW is the most populous Australian state. Queensland\u2019s new restrictions will begin next Saturday, Victoria won\u2019t announce theirs until Monday and the ACT has already modified its restrictions. In other changes for NSW: Cafes and restaurants can have 10 patrons at a time Visitors in the home will also rise from two to five. That includes adults and children. Religious gatherings or places of worship will now be able to include up to 10 people. Weddings will increase from five people to 10, and funerals will increase to 20 mourners or 30 for an outside service Restrictions on regional travel will not change \u201cTo have a population the size of New South Wales, to see our cases go from a maximum of 200 or so a day down to just a small handful is a wonderful achievement. We don\u2019t want to see any of this lost. We need to fire up our economy. We need to get people back into jobs. We need to see some semblance of normality come back. But we can\u2019t breach any of the restrictions in place. No matter what you are doing, when you leave your home, you need to maintain social distancing.\u201d \u2013 NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian France and Spain, two of the countries worst hit by the coronavirus, are preparing to ease out of lockdown, as the number of cases worldwide passes 4 million. Amid the barrage of deaths, some European countries cited signs of progress they said justified taking slow steps back toward some version of normality, French news agency AFP reports. French officials on Saturday said the day\u2019s death toll of 80 was the lowest since early April. Nursing home fatalities also fell sharply as France prepared to relax curbs on public movement imposed eight weeks ago. \u201cI\u2019ve been scared to death\u201d about the reopening, said Maya Flandin, a bookshop manager from Lyon. \u201cIt\u2019s a big responsibility to have to protect my staff and my customers.\u201d French health officials warned that \u201cthe epidemic remains active and is evolving\u201d, and a state of emergency remains in place to July 10. In Spain, about half the population will be allowed out on Monday for limited socialization, and restaurants will be able to offer some outdoor service as the country begins a phased transition set to last through June. Fears lingered, however, of a viral resurgence if restrictions are lifted too quickly: \u201cThe virus has not gone away,\u201d Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned. Belgium is also easing some restrictions on Monday, and in some parts of Germany bars and restaurants reopened on Saturday with further easing set for Monday. Overall, however, the situation in Europe is still far from normal. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is threatening to pull his company\u2019s factory and headquarters out of California after local officials stopped him reopening the electric car factory due to the Covid-19 risk, Associated Press reports. In a lawsuit filed in federal court, Tesla accused the Alameda County Health Department of overstepping federal and state coronavirus restrictions when it stopped Tesla from restarting production at its factory in Fremont. The lawsuit contends Tesla factory workers are allowed to work during California\u2019s stay-at-home order because the facility is considered \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d Musk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company\u2019s 29 April first-quarter earnings were released, calling the restrictions fascist and urging governments to stop taking people\u2019s freedom. The reopening of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee-North Carolina border in the US has drawn crowds of hundreds, many not wearing masks, knocking over barricades and standing pressed together in lines a mile long to view the sights. Park spokeswoman Dana Soehn told the Associated Press that many people were not wearing masks or social distancing, with visitors over the weekend from 24 different states. President Donald Trump has prioritized reopening national parks as a sign of significant progress against the invisible enemy of the pandemic, even as cases rise in an outbreak that has devastated the U.S. economy. In another grim milestone of this pandemic, global cases have passed 4 million, with deaths at over 278,750. The US has the most infections on 1,307,676, followed by Spain on 222,857. Russia is fast approaching 200,000. The US also tops deaths, with 78,746, followed by the UK (31,662) and Italy (30,395). An explosive tape has emerged of former US president Barack Obama describing President Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis as \u201can absolutely chaotic disaster\u201d. In the recording, obtained by Yahoo News, Obama discusses Joe Biden\u2019s chances in the upcoming presidential elections with his alumni association. \u201cThis election that\u2019s coming up on every level is so important because what we\u2019re going to be battling is not just a particular individual or a political party. What we\u2019re fighting against is these long-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy \u2014 that has become a stronger impulse in American life. And by the way, we\u2019re seeing that internationally as well. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason why the response to this global crisis has been so anaemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset \u2013 of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019 \u2013 when that mindset is operationalised in our government.\u201d Obama goes on to discuss the justice department\u2019s decision to drop the case against Michael Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Moscow. Read the full report here: Hi and welcome to the our global coronavirus blog, Eleanor Ainge Roy at the helm today. Here are the most important recent developments, including that global cases have passed four million: The coronavirus has killed at least 278,756 according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. Infections globally stand a 4,020,878. The death toll is highest is the US, at 78,693. Former US president Barack Obama has called Trump\u2019s virus response \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d. The former US president harshly criticised his successor\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic during a conversation with ex-members of his administration, according to a recording obtained by Yahoo News. Germany\u2019s plans to restart competitive football next Saturday suffered an early setback after the entire Dynamo Dresden team were placed in a two-week quarantine following two positive coronavirus tests among the players. Nigeria\u2019s largest city Lagos could return to lockdown to halt the coronavirus if residents continue to ignore social distancing rules, the governor warned on Saturday. Since the easing of five-week restrictions, people have been seen thronging markets and banks despite orders remaining in place to avoid mass gatherings. Indonesia has reported its biggest daily increase in infections, with 533 new confirmed cases, taking the total to 13,645. But with Indonesia\u2019s low testing rate criticised by medical experts, the number of infections in the country \u2013 which has the fourth biggest population in the world \u2013 is feared to be far higher than official figures show. The number of people who have died from coronavirus infections in France rose by 80 to 26,310 on Saturday, the health ministry said. This is a much smaller daily increase than the previous day when it was 243. Let\u2019s get started.",

Chinese state media, CGTN, said authorities have ordered the temporary closure of all public places in Shulan, including sports facilities, cinemas and libraries, and for all residents to stay home except under \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d. Students in their final year of middle or senior high school will return to online learning, it said. No taxis can leave the city, and all public transport has been suspended. Local media said the source of Shulan\u2019s chain of infection remained a mystery. Jilin provincial health commission said it originated with a 45-year-old woman who has no residential or travel history outside the province, and no known contact history with people returning from overseas or key provinces. In recent weeks China has enacted border closures and social restrictions on areas bordering Russia, including Suifenhe, in the east of Heilongjiang province, after some people returning to China via land borders were diagnosed with Covid-19. According to a local government WeChat account, on 2 May Shulan health authorities said that in the last three weeks of April, 308 Shulan residents had returned from Russia via Suifenhe and Manzhouli ports. Eight were quarantined in a Jilin infectious disease hospital, and the remaining 300 were isolated in Shulan city, the People\u2019s Daily reported. In the city of Wuhan, where the virus originated at the end of last year, Chinese authorities also reported five new cases on Sunday, the city\u2019s highest number of new infections since 11 March. The new cases, all local transmissions, were among 17 new cases nationwide, the highest in almost two weeks. Authorities in Wuhan imposed draconian restrictions on travel and movement in what appeared to have been a successful bid to quash the outbreak. That lockdown began to ease in recent weeks, as authorities said the disease was under control, most recently with children returning to school, and travel to and from the city allowed. On Chinese social media the quick rise in cases sparked concern. \u201cWe still need to take protective measures, five cases is really terrible,\u201d wrote one user on Weibo. \u201cBefore [now] there were almost no transfers from asymptomatic to confirmed diagnosis in Hubei province,\u201d wrote another. \u201cGovernment should respond to social concerns in a timely manner.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to slow down,\u201d wrote a third. \u201cI felt a little relaxed and now it starts again, and I\u2019m starting to panic again. Come on, Wuhan.\u201d China\u2019s has reported a total of 82,918 cases and a death toll of 4,633. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas will, however, remain closed. In Spain, urban hotspots such as Madrid and Barcelona remain under lockdown \u2013 but elsewhere people made plans to meet friends and family in bars and restaurants that have outdoor spaces. In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was criticised for being divisive, confusing and vague as he explained his blueprint for a gradual easing of the lockdown in England. Almost seven weeks after a nationwide stay-at-home order was put in place in Britain, nearly 32,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker \u2013 the worst toll in Europe and second only to the United States. Johnson, who himself spent a week in hospital with Covid-19, said on Sunday the measures had come \u201cat a colossal cost to our way of life\u201d but added it would be \u201cmadness\u201d to squander the progress by moving too soon. Johnson said schools in England and some shops might be able to open next month, and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work if they cannot do so from home. Opposition leader Keir Starmer said the prime minister \u201cappears to be effectively telling millions of people to go back to work tomorrow\u201d without the necessary guidance. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t got the guidelines, and we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work with public transport so there\u2019s a huge number of questions arising out of this,\u201d the Labour leader added. In Europe, some officials have been emboldened by declining death rates: France\u2019s toll of 70 on Sunday was its lowest since early April, and Spain\u2019s daily fatalities have dropped below 200. But the risk of a second wave was underscored by a resurgence in South Korea. Although widely praised for its handling of its initial outbreak, the country has been forced to shut all bars and clubs in the capital Seoul after a cluster of infections. China on Sunday reported its first infection in over a month in Wuhan, where the outbreak started late last year. On Monday, Wuhan reported five new locally transmitted Covid-19 cases, the highest since 11 March. All were in the same residential compound in the city. The Chinese city of Shulan, near the Russian and North Korean borders, has been reclassified as high risk after three new cases emerged.

Of the new cases, seven were so-called imported cases in Inner Mongolia involving travellers from overseas. There was uncertainty in Germany, too, with at least one district forced to reimpose restrictions after an outbreak at a meat processing plant. And even as the country loosened its lockdown restrictions, the latest German data also indicated the infection rate was rising again. In Spain, however, some communities were getting ready to celebrate. \u201cWe have already set a date for dinner on Wednesday, just 10 of us. I can\u2019t wait to touch someone, to kiss and be kissed,\u201d said 66-year-old Beatriz Gonzalez in the city of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands. Belgium and Greece are among other European nations set to ease lockdowns on Monday. Turkey had already eased some restrictions and allowed out those over 65 for the first time on Sunday. Iran, the Middle East\u2019s worst-hit country, has also relaxed its lockdown measures, and bazaars and shopping centres in the capital, Tehran, were bustling again after being nearly deserted for weeks. But health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour warned the situation \u201cshould in no way be considered normal\u201d, as one region recorded a swift rise in its death rate and reimposed a lockdown. Meanwhile, Russia and Brazil both passed grim milestones at the weekend. Russia\u2019s cases surpassed 200,000 and its figure is expected to become the highest in Europe within days, even as the number of deaths remains relatively low at fewer than 2,000. While officials say the figures reveal the effectiveness of Russia\u2019s testing regime, an opposition-allied doctors union said the authorities were under-reporting deaths of medics. For Brazil, the signs are more ominous. Officials confirmed more than 10,000 had now died in the hardest-hit Latin American country. Scientists warned that the real figures could be many times higher, given a lack of widespread testing. In a sign that officials were not yet facing up to the crisis, President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the coronavirus to a \u201clittle flu\u201d and criticised regional lockdowns, was seen jet skiing to a floating barbecue. The disease has also moved in the US into the White House inner circle, with a valet to President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s spokeswoman testing positive. Pence\u2019s office said he was not in quarantine and would be working at the White House on Monday. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top infectious diseases official, and two other senior leaders in the fight against Covid-19 began self-quarantining on Sunday. In other coronavirus developments: New Zealand\u2019s frontline domestic violence services will received a record NZ$200m (\u00a399m) of funding in this week\u2019s budget to help authorities struggling after weeks of stringent lockdown. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of sexual and domestic violence in the developed world. In the Australian state of Victoria, rapid response teams have been set up to tackle clusters and monitor high-risk facilities. Funding will be provided for sewage testing to track the virus in the community. Restrictions will be eased from Tuesday night, with people allowed to visit friends and family, with a maximum gathering of 10 outdoors and up to five visitors at home. In India, one of the world\u2019s largest train networks will \u201cgradually\u201d restart operations from Tuesday. Thirty train journeys \u2013 or 15 return trips \u2013 will run from Delhi to other cities including Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, Indian Railways said late on Sunday. \u2022 The graphic in this article was amended on 11 May 2020 to correct the information about the Netherlands, where cinemas, cafes and restaurants remain closed for now; and to clarify that all shops selling essential items in Belgium are open.",

Citizens enraged about the ten-storey establishment blocking their own views of the citadel took the case to the highest court in the land. </p> <p>\u201cIt was a very brave decision,\u201d said Athens mayor Kostas Bakoyannis of the ruling by Greece\u2019s central archaeological council (KAS), the country\u2019s top advisory body on the preservation of ancient antiquities. \u201cThe Acropolis is our heart and our soul, an essential part of our cultural heritage. It\u2019s very important that everyone can enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are on a roll. The decision follows <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/mar/08/not-everythings-for-sale-greeks-mobilise-as-new-hotels-obscure-acropolis-views-athens\">more than a year of protests</a> against \u201cmammoth\u201d high rises being erected in neighbourhoods at the sharp end of tourism beneath the<sup> </sup>fifth century BC site.</p> <p>In April residents in Makriyianni, the district due south of the Acropolis, stepped up the fight launching an online petition, with members of the Avaaz activist network demanding the centre-right Greek government safeguard the declared archaeological zone. Within days 23,000 people had signed the appeal.</p> <p>\u201cWe know of permits being considered for at least seven huge hotels,\u201d said Irini Frezadou, the Swiss-trained architect spearheading the grassroots drive. \u201cWe are overjoyed that under pressure the immovable Greek state has finally acted but it\u2019s urgent we have new building and planning laws if the urban and cultural environment of the Acropolis is to be protected.\u201d</p> <p>Spurred by the protests Greece\u2019s archaeological council unexpectedly convened. After six hours of debate conducted via teleconference, the expert committee came to the unanimous conclusion that the multimillion-euro edifice would have to be lowered, in the name of protecting the symbol of western democracy.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Acropolis is harmed, in essence our civilisation is harmed too,\u201d said Lina Mendoni, the Greek culture minister. \u201cThe Acropolis is a symbol. It is not simply a monument.\u201d Compensation might, she suggested, be in the offing, but KAS had ruled, irrevocably, that the gargantuan building could be no more than 24 metres in height and would have to be partially torn down. At 31.5 metres, the hotel is by far the biggest construction in Makriyianni, outstripping the new Acropolis Museum in size.</p> <p>Last week Greece\u2019s highest court, the Council of State, also weighed in, adjudicating that in future, structures in the area must be 21 metres or less. The judgment came after the court revoked building permission for an even larger hotel due to go up in Makriyianni, with three underground parking lots and a pool garden on top.</p> <p>\u201cBoth decisions are a huge victory, testimony to the strength of civil society and what people can do when they unite,\u201d said Andreas Papapetropoulos, the lawyer representing the campaigners. \u201cWe are lucky that the tribunal convened under Katerina Sakellaropoulou,\u201d he added, referring to the environmentally sensitive high court justice who has since become Greece\u2019s first female head of state.</p> <p>Construction of multistorey hotels at the base of the site will, critics argue, create the effect of \u201ca wall of high rises\u201d encircling the Acropolis.</p> <p>\u201cMakriyianni is a residential neighbourhood. It was never meant for buildings of such dimensions,\u201d said Frezadou. \u201cThe mass tourism we have witnessed may have disappeared with coronavirus, but it will be back. And if it goes unchecked it will destroy the very monument visitors have come for, the Acropolis itself.\u201d</p> <p>But Greece\u2019s culture minister also acknowledged the ruling had been a \u201cvery difficult decision\u201d, saying the hotel\u2019s proprietors \u201cvery likely\u201d had justice on their side \u2013 even if KAS had not formally endorsed construction after the discovery of antiquities on the site.</p> <p>In 2012, in the midst of Greece\u2019s economic crisis, a new construction code was passed permitting bigger and taller buildings if they met \u201cgreen\u201d standards.

      "bodyText": "An adapted version of Super Rugby will recommence with an Australian-only competition comprising five or six teams, including the Western Force, being planned to start in early July. RA has released a return-to-play strategy with the aim of starting a 12-week competition, with the Force and possibly Japan\u2019s Sunwolves joining the four Australian Super Rugby teams. The original five-nation competition was suspended in mid-March because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic . \u201cThe draw we are looking at is a 12-week competition, 10 weeks of regular round matches and depending on the number of teams, work out how many games per week there,\u201d RA general manager of professional rugby services Ben Whitaker said. \u201cThe Sunwolves, at the moment would be located in either New South Wales or Queensland.\u201d The Perth-based Force were considered surplus to requirements in 2017 when they were axed from the competition. They have since been playing in Global Rapid Rugby and the National Rugby Championship. Global travel restrictions have put paid to the inclusion of the South African cohort of teams, along with Argentina\u2019s Jaguares, while New Zealand Rugby has already announced its plans for its own local-only competition. The four-nation Rugby Championship which is due to commence in August, wlll be pushed back, though Sanzaar officials are still hoping it will be staged. \u201cThe international travel restrictions in South Africa and Argentina have been strengthened in the last couple of weeks and you will see that both of those nations at least won\u2019t have any restrictions lifted until September,\u201d Whitaker said. Rugby Australia\u2019s Return To Play committee has been meeting regularly to lay down plans for a new-look competition, while they have been absorbing knowledge from the NRL, which will resume later this month. RA is giving Super Rugby clubs a Covid-19 education briefing this week, with players set to resume training on 18 May, giving them seven weeks ahead of a Friday 3 July start. While the NRL will have less than three weeks of contact training, rugby believes its players \u2013 particularly tight forwards \u2013 need more lead-in time with the proposed dateline giving them a month. The 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak in mid-March, after just seven rounds of play had been completed. New Zealand\u2019s teams \u2013 the Blues, Chiefs, Hurricanes, Crusaders and Highlanders \u2013 will resume play on Saturday 13 June, following Monday\u2019s announcement by the government that the country will move to alert level two on Thursday. A set of protocols has been developed and will be endorsed by the government to allow play to restart at that level. The measures include daily symptom and temperature checks for players, team management and other officials involved in the competition, as well as stringent hygiene and cleaning, contact tracing practices, and asking anyone who feels unwell to stay away, self-isolate and get tested. NZR CEO Mark Robinson said: \u201cThe thought of five world-class Kiwi teams battling it out in 20 matches over 10 weeks should put a smile back on the faces of many people. I know our players are excited and I\u2019m sure rugby fans will be as well.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>A healthcare firm which employs the prominent Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a paid consultant has been awarded a \u00a3133m contract without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.</p> <p>The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has given Randox the contract to produce testing kits to help respond to the coronavirus pandemic. It was awarded \u201cwithout prior publication of a call for competition\u201d, according to details of the contract seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>The founder of Randox Laboratories is Peter FitzGerald, a polo-playing multimillionaire Northern Irish doctor who is the UK\u2019s 475th richest person with a \u00a3255m personal fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list.</p> <p>Matt Hancock\u2019s department awarded the contract <a href=\"https://www.randox.com/government-covid-testing-nhs-staff/\">last month</a> under fast-track arrangements that enable public bodies dealing with the pandemic to give contracts to commercial companies quickly without the need to ask other firms to bid for them.</p> <p> The firm has <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmregmem/200427/200427.pdf\">employed Owen Paterson</a>, a former Conservative cabinet <a href=\"https://www.owenpaterson.org/about-owen\">minister and leading Brexit supporter</a>, as a consultant since 2015. He is currently paid \u00a3100,000 a year at the rate of \u00a3500 an hour.</p> <p>Under its contract, Randox has been paid to carry out tests, both posted to individuals at home and administered at testing centres, as part of Hancock\u2019s pledge to reach the target of 100,000 tests a day.</p> <p>According to the official notice of the contract, the department said there was no other way of obtaining the testing kits and the associated services that were needed urgently.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.randox.com/engineers-recruitment-covid-19-testing/\">Randox said last month that it was recruiting</a> 160 mechanical, electrical and manufacturing engineers to start work on developing ways of detecting whether people have been infected.</p> <p>A government source said the DHSC was \u201cunable to comment on the personnel matters of other organisations\u201d when asked if Paterson had lobbied on Randox\u2019s behalf.</p> <p>Randox did not respond to questions about whether Paterson was involved in securing the deal. The Guardian did not receive a response when it asked Paterson to comment.</p> <p>In a statement Randox, which offers <a href=\"https://www.randoxhealth.com/product/coronavirus-covid-19-home-testing-kit/\">Covid-19 tests privately to the public for \u00a3120</a> each, said: \u201cIt should be noted that Randox is only one partner within a multi-partner, national testing programme. The programme is being run and coordinated by the Department of Health and Social Care and they would be best placed to comment on the overall programme.\u201d</p> <p>Paterson\u2019s work for Randox has been criticised in the past. Documents <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/sep/30/revealed-owen-paterson-lobbied-for-firms-he-was-paid-to-advise\">obtained by the Guardian</a> showed last year that he had helped to lobby for Randox and another firm he was being paid to advise.</p> <p>He had meetings with a government minister and <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/politics/2019/apr/07/mp-owen-paterson-lobbied-government-for-firm-he-worked-for\">officials to promote the products of</a> the two firms.</p> <p>The documents raised questions over whether the North Shropshire MP had breached parliamentary rules of conduct. These allow MPs to lobby on behalf of a paying client, but with restrictions. The lobbying must not help to give an exclusive financial benefit to the client and the client must not have initiated the lobbying.</p> <p>Labour said at the time that it was not right for an elected representative to be paid to lobby for a client, and that the rules were too weak. When asked to comment at the time, Paterson said: \u201cMy financial interests have been correctly declared according to the rules of the House of Commons.\u201d</p> <p>Hancock <a href=\"https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/uk-news/2019/03/21/health-secretary-hails-new-tool-for-quickly-diagnosing-deadly-infections/\">toured Randox\u2019s</a> laboratories in Antrim, Northern Ireland last year to <a href=\"https://www.randox.com/tag/matt-hancock/\">inspect a tool for diagnosing </a><a href=\"https://www.randox.com/tag/matt-hancock/\">sepsis</a>. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act suggest Paterson also took part in the visit.</p> <p>A DHSC spokesperson said:<strong> \u201c</strong>The speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the government and key partners.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "A healthcare firm which employs the prominent Conservative politician Owen Paterson as a paid consultant has been awarded a \u00a3133m contract without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has given Randox the contract to produce testing kits to help respond to the coronavirus pandemic. It was awarded \u201cwithout prior publication of a call for competition\u201d, according to details of the contract seen by the Guardian. The founder of Randox Laboratories is Peter FitzGerald, a polo-playing multimillionaire Northern Irish doctor who is the UK\u2019s 475th richest person with a \u00a3255m personal fortune, according to the Sunday Times rich list. Matt Hancock\u2019s department awarded the contract last month under fast-track arrangements that enable public bodies dealing with the pandemic to give contracts to commercial companies quickly without the need to ask other firms to bid for them. The firm has employed Owen Paterson, a former Conservative cabinet minister and leading Brexit supporter, as a consultant since 2015. He is currently paid \u00a3100,000 a year at the rate of \u00a3500 an hour. Under its contract, Randox has been paid to carry out tests, both posted to individuals at home and administered at testing centres, as part of Hancock\u2019s pledge to reach the target of 100,000 tests a day. According to the official notice of the contract, the department said there was no other way of obtaining the testing kits and the associated services that were needed urgently. Randox said last month that it was recruiting 160 mechanical, electrical and manufacturing engineers to start work on developing ways of detecting whether people have been infected. A government source said the DHSC was \u201cunable to comment on the personnel matters of other organisations\u201d when asked if Paterson had lobbied on Randox\u2019s behalf. Randox did not respond to questions about whether Paterson was involved in securing the deal. The Guardian did not receive a response when it asked Paterson to comment. In a statement Randox, which offers Covid-19 tests privately to the public for \u00a3120 each, said: \u201cIt should be noted that Randox is only one partner within a multi-partner, national testing programme. The programme is being run and coordinated by the Department of Health and Social Care and they would be best placed to comment on the overall programme.\u201d Paterson\u2019s work for Randox has been criticised in the past. Documents obtained by the Guardian showed last year that he had helped to lobby for Randox and another firm he was being paid to advise. He had meetings with a government minister and officials to promote the products of the two firms. The documents raised questions over whether the North Shropshire MP had breached parliamentary rules of conduct. These allow MPs to lobby on behalf of a paying client, but with restrictions. The lobbying must not help to give an exclusive financial benefit to the client and the client must not have initiated the lobbying. Labour said at the time that it was not right for an elected representative to be paid to lobby for a client, and that the rules were too weak. When asked to comment at the time, Paterson said: \u201cMy financial interests have been correctly declared according to the rules of the House of Commons.\u201d Hancock toured Randox\u2019s laboratories in Antrim, Northern Ireland last year to inspect a tool for diagnosing sepsis. Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act suggest Paterson also took part in the visit. A DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cThe speed at which we have increased our testing capacity is unprecedented and a real success made possible by teamwork between the government and key partners.\u201d",

But the central question of Wonderland is sane and sober, echoing that of Lewis Carroll\u2019s original: \u201cWho in the world am I?

Like her Alice, Dawson is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/transgender\">transgender</a>. But while Alice has transitioned by the time she starts secondary school, it wasn\u2019t until Dawson was a well-known author in her 30s (crowned Queen of Teen in a reader-led <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/young-adult\">YA</a> prize) that she felt ready to take the plunge, changing from James to Juno. She came out publicly in 2015 and, three years later, created her first transgender character: Kendall, a gentle anorexic, in what was to become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/01/juno-dawson-clean-interview-transgender-anorexia-drugs\">her most successful novel, Clean</a>.</p> <p>Kendall was a minor character, but Alice commands her own story. It was during an Australian book tour for Clean that the idea of appropriating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/20/lewis-carroll-alice-in-wonderland-adventures-150-years\">Alice in Wonderland</a> popped up. \u201cThere was this exhibition in Melbourne about visual representations of Alice,\u201d says Dawson, speaking via Google Hangouts. \u201cI realised we have a globally agreed idea of what this character looked like. I began to wonder what I could bring to the table. There\u2019ve been Japanese Alices and black Alices. Would people accept her if she was trans? I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it just be superfun to do it my way?\u201d</p> <p>Though the novel is freestanding, it\u2019s part of \u201ca loose trilogy\u201d with Clean and 2019\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/18/top-10-novels-about-burning-issues-for-young-adults\">Meat Market</a>, both of which are set in rarefied circles defined by glamour and wealth. Meat Market tackles the fashion trade, while Clean is set in an elite rehab centre, where a group of moneyed misfits grapple with the fallout from privileged lives, all very different from Dawson\u2019s own childhood.</p> <p>\u201cI grew up in a council house near Bradford watching TV serials like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jun/06/six-reasons-why-beverly-hills-90210-was-the-ultimate-teenage-tv\">Beverly Hills 90210</a> and, later on, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2009/dec/11/gossip-girl-box-set\">Gossip Girl</a>,\u201d say s the 38-year-old. \u201cIt seemed as if drama was a thing rich people had. Our dramas were much more mundane \u2013 my mum walking out on my dad \u2013 whereas these people were having poisoning-your-spouse dramas.\u201d</p> <p>Wonderland is hinged around a weekend-long, invitation-only house party that is reached by secret invitation through the cellar of a club.

      "bodyText": "Alice dyes her hair blue and has an \u201cactive, app-based sex life with married men from outlying commuter towns\u201d. This is not how heroines in young adult novels usually describe themselves, but then Alice is no ordinary heroine. She\u2019s a 17-year-old pupil at an elite girls\u2019 school, \u201can angry child\u2019s crayon sketch of a human girl\u201d whose self-harming is a cry of rage against what she perceives as a cosmic injustice: \u201cSome lazy angel, desperate for a fag break, scribbled the wrong gender on my destiny forms.\u201d Before long, author Juno Dawson has whisked her heroine down a rabbit hole for an adventure that is both a retelling of Alice in Wonderland and an investigation of what might constitute reality in a society where money, power and celebrity are swept up in an ever crazier whirl of gossip, cocaine and cosmetics. But the central question of Wonderland is sane and sober, echoing that of Lewis Carroll\u2019s original: \u201cWho in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle.\u201d Nestling on a sofa in her living room with Prince, her sleepy chihuahua, Dawson looks like she knows exactly who she is, but the author is all too aware of what it\u2019s like to be a victim of that lazy angel. Like her Alice, Dawson is transgender. But while Alice has transitioned by the time she starts secondary school, it wasn\u2019t until Dawson was a well-known author in her 30s (crowned Queen of Teen in a reader-led YA prize) that she felt ready to take the plunge, changing from James to Juno. She came out publicly in 2015 and, three years later, created her first transgender character: Kendall, a gentle anorexic, in what was to become her most successful novel, Clean. Kendall was a minor character, but Alice commands her own story. It was during an Australian book tour for Clean that the idea of appropriating Alice in Wonderland popped up. \u201cThere was this exhibition in Melbourne about visual representations of Alice,\u201d says Dawson, speaking via Google Hangouts. \u201cI realised we have a globally agreed idea of what this character looked like. I began to wonder what I could bring to the table. There\u2019ve been Japanese Alices and black Alices. Would people accept her if she was trans? I thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it just be superfun to do it my way?\u201d Though the novel is freestanding, it\u2019s part of \u201ca loose trilogy\u201d with Clean and 2019\u2019s Meat Market, both of which are set in rarefied circles defined by glamour and wealth. Meat Market tackles the fashion trade, while Clean is set in an elite rehab centre, where a group of moneyed misfits grapple with the fallout from privileged lives, all very different from Dawson\u2019s own childhood. \u201cI grew up in a council house near Bradford watching TV serials like Beverly Hills 90210 and, later on, Gossip Girl,\u201d say s the 38-year-old. \u201cIt seemed as if drama was a thing rich people had. Our dramas were much more mundane \u2013 my mum walking out on my dad \u2013 whereas these people were having poisoning-your-spouse dramas.\u201d Wonderland is hinged around a weekend-long, invitation-only house party that is reached by secret invitation through the cellar of a club. At this club, a murderous Queen of Hearts (AKA Paisley Hart, poisonous ringleader of St Agnes girls\u2019 school) rules over a trippy \u201ccourt\u201d of half-recognisable Carrollian archetypes. Alice is shadowed by a mysterious character in a cat hoodie, while the Tweedle twins are social media influencers with an abusive sexual interest in transgender girls. For those who think a YA label is akin to a PG film rating, the novel\u2019s explicitness might seem startling. The story feels its way around the differences between the male and female orgasm, and is unflinching in its approach to date rape \u2013 the bewildering moment when consent is breached. \u201cThe twins press against me,\u201d Dawson writes, \u201ctheir bodies hard and wet. Firm hands grab at my breasts, pull on my nipples. If it was right, would there be so many questions, so many wasps at the picnic?\u201d Asked if she gets any pushback, Dawson breaks into an ironic chuckle.

It must be talked about because it permanently affects girls.\u201d In her autobiographical book The Gender Games, published in 2017, Dawson described a lifestyle in which sexual risk-taking became a damaging form of self abuse. \u201cSome people take scissors to their skin and some choose terrible men,\u201d she tells me. \u201cI was on top of my drinking and I never cut myself, but throughout my 20s I engaged in these awful relationships.

When you are six, seven months on board, thinking about your family, you can lose your concentration.\u201d This week the International Maritime Organization warned its 174 member states that trade and global supply chains would \u201ccome to a halt\u201d unless crews on ships can be replaced. If the 150,000 seafarers estimated to be working beyond their contracts are not relieved of their duties in two weeks, they will be in breach of maritime regulations. Several groups \u2013 including the ITF, International Chamber of Shipping and the International Air Transport Association \u2013 have proposed a 12-step protocol to allow seafarers to join or leave ships at a series of \u201crepatriation hubs\u201d, from where they could fly home. Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF, said: \u201cOur message for governments is clear: you cannot continue with a mentality of out of sight, out of mind, and we strongly urge governments to act now before we suffer more serious human or environmental consequences.\u201d Guy Platten, general secretary of the International Chamber of Shipping, described the plight of seafarers as a \u201cticking timebomb\u201d. \u201cWe could start to see disruption to trade, and more importantly we risk accidents and mental health issues. Putting this off is no longer an option.\u201d",

Boris Johnson is expected to unveil more details today of how he intends to lead the country out of lockdown after an address to the nation last night that critics said was vague and confusing. Hinting that primary schools could reopen by next month, along with some shops, the prime minister said people could exercise outside as much as they wanted and that he was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to get back to work. But he insisted that he was not ending the country\u2019s weeks-long lockdown and members of the public should still avoid public transport because otherwise a second deadly wave of the \u201cdevilish\u201d virus could take hold.

There was also some irritation from leaders in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where stricter rules will stay in place. The government will publish a document today setting out the roadmap out of lockdown and Johnson will present more details of his plans to parliament. There was also a good deal of confused messaging from the White House after it was reported that vice-president Mike Pence was in self-isolation. Officials told Associated Press that Pence was \u201ckeeping his distance\u201d from people but had tested negative, was not in \u201cquarantine\u201d and would work from the White House on Monday despite three key taskforce officials already placing themselves in self-isolation.

Speaking to the Guardian, the radical intellectual says the US president had cut back on health provision to benefit big business and was now \u201cflailing about to try and find scapegoats\u201d. An outbreak of the virus in a Chinese city near the Russian border and a spate of new cases in Wuhan have given rise to concerns of a new wave of infections in China. Just days after all regions were designated low-risk, the untraced infections appeared in Shulan and there were locally transmitted cases in other border areas. Parts of Europe are easing lockdowns this week. You can follow all the day\u2019s developments in the pandemic at our live blog here , catch up with overnight news at a glance and see how the UK papers covered it all. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Lab lobbyist \u2013 A company which pays the Conservative politician Owen Paterson to be a consultant has been awarded a \u00a3133m contract for coronavirus testing without any other firms being given the opportunity to bid for the work.

The founder of Randox is Peter FitzGerald, a polo-playing multimillionaire doctor who is one of the richest people in the country. Paterson, a former cabinet minister, is paid \u00a3100,000 a year by the firm to lobby the government on its behalf. * * * Arbery investigation \u2013 Georgia\u2019s attorney general has asked the US justice department to investigate the handling of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a black man who was killed by two white men as he ran through their neighbourhood. Arbery was shot dead on 23 February but the suspects, Gregory McMichael and his son Travis, were not arrested until a video surfaced that appeared to show the shooting. The Democratic mayor of Atlanta has called the death of Ahmaud Arbery, who was shot and killed by the two white men in February, a \u201clynching\u201d. * * * Cool change \u2013 Boris Johnson\u2019s attempts to control Britain\u2019s exit out of lockdown might be helped by the cooler, windier weather arriving for the coming week. Some parts of Scotland saw snow after a holiday weekend which saw thousands of lockdown-weary Britons headed into public spaces as temperatures headed into the mid-20Cs. * * * Positive spin \u2013 An 11-year-old skateboarder in Brazil has made history by completing the first ever 1080-degree turn. Gui Khury shattered a long-standing record by flying off the top of a ramp and completing three full spins in the air before landing cleanly and skating off. Coronavirus Extra Scientists are concerned that mutations in some strains of the coronavirus suggest the pathogen may be adapting to humans after spilling over from bats. The analysis shows that while the virus is fairly stable, some have gained mutations, including two genetic changes that alter the critical \u201cspike protein\u201d the virus uses to infect human cells. There is also alarm at the number of outbreaks of the virus at slaughterhouses and meat-processing plants around the world. Our correspondents across Europe report how farmers desperate for migrant labourers to be allowed to return are being thwarted by populist politicians who are using the crisis to stoke fears of foreigners taking people\u2019s jobs. Also on the continent, the sudden lack of visitors to tourist hotspots such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice means locals are reclaiming their cities. Today in Focus podcast Our south Asia correspondent, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, reports on the implications of millions of Indians downloading an app designed to help control the spread of Covid-19 in a country where civil liberties were already being eroded. Lunchtime read: Tony Slattery: what happened next? A year ago, the actor and comedian Tony Slattery gave an interview to the Guardian in which he revealed that the source of his struggles with anger and mental health issues was being abused by a priest when he was eight. Since then, Slattery has been inundated with support from the public and has made a documentary about his life, What\u2019s the Matter With Tony Slattery?, which starts on BBC Two later this month. Hadley Freeman explains how it all came about. Sport The Premier League faces a week of chaos after hopes of government direction on the divisive Project Restart were dashed by the prime minister. The Bundesliga is keen to press ahead with plans to restart the season for the top two tiers next weekend, despite Dynamo Dresden\u2019s squad being quarantined for two weeks. The Afghanistan wicketkeeper-batsman Shafiqullah Shafaq has been given a six-year ban after he accepted four charges of breaching their anti-corruption code. And an 11-year-old Brazilian has landed the first ever 1080-degree turn on a vertical ramp \u2013 regarded as the holy grail of skateboarding \u2013 to surpass the record first set by Tony Hawk. Business Pubs have warned they face \u201cdevastation\u201d after the prime minister ruled out any chance of them reopening with parts of the hospitality industry in July. The tourist industry believes it could experience one of its best summers ever if it is allowed to fire back up, although some holiday resorts fear it could fall flat. The pound is buying $1.243 and \u20ac1.142, while gains on Asian stock markets overnight point to the FTSE100 opening up 0.5% later today.

Not a soul except the Deliveroo and Glovo riders and the occasional shopper, masked and gloved, making a foray to the nearest supermarket before scurrying back home. In a city with one of the highest population densities in Europe, there was no one to be seen.</p> <p>Throughout this time, people here have shown an extraordinary and perhaps unexpected degree of discipline, stoicism and collective spirit in sticking to the rules of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns.</p> <p>It\u2019s easing now, bit by bit. As of today, in most of Spain, bars with outdoor tables can open and people are allowed to visit each other\u2019s homes. Some parks and beaches will open, too, but only for exercise. Sunbathing is not encouraged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/aug/30/why-tourism-is-killing-barcelona-overtourism-photo-essay\">How tourism is killing Barcelona \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not, alas, in Madrid, or Barcelona, where the authorities say we\u2019ll have to wait another week. It\u2019s disappointing, of course, but at least we\u2019re allowed out for a few hours a day, and nothing will ever erase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/04/spain-comes-out-to-play-after-europes-strictest-lockdown\">the memory of that first taste of freedom, just over a week ago, when we were allowed out for exercise for the first time</a>.</p> <p>After the wettest April in a century, it was a clear, sunny morning. There was birdsong. You really hear the birds now there are so few cars. You hear so much, and there\u2019s no need to shout above the traffic. A city looks different when cars no longer dominate the landscape; you see the line of the street, details in the architecture. And we probably haven\u2019t breathed air as clean as this since before the industrial revolution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63e707d405a9ebe7eab9d4567b949c868962f081\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63e707d405a9ebe7eab9d4567b949c868962f081/0_201_4328_2684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Locals exercising along La Rambla in Barcelona,\" width=\"1000\" height=\"620\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Locals exercising along La Rambla: \u2018long ago abandoned to the lurid forces of occupation, it was ours once more.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pau Barrena/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People were out in numbers, in ones and twos, walking, jogging and speaking softly. Spain has a reputation as the noisiest country in Europe, but that morning everyone spoke sotto voce, as though afraid to break the spell.</p> <p>There was something else too, something different that you couldn\u2019t put your finger on at first. And then we realised: it was just us out there. People speaking Catalan and Spanish, as well as French and German and Urdu and all the many languages of this multicultural city, but they were all people who live here.</p> <p>There were no tourists. None. No cycle tours, no Segways, no rickshaws, no one selling selfie sticks, no one trying to lure you in to eat a paella at an hour when no one here eats paella \u2013 indeed, at an hour when no one eats, <em>punto</em>.</p> <p>It was just us. After decades in which tourism has grown exponentially, inexorably, to the point where the city\u2019s 1.6 million inhabitants received 30 million visitors last year, they\u2019d gone. All of them. We\u2019d got our city back. Even La Rambla, long ago abandoned to the lurid forces of occupation, was ours once more.</p> <p>Yes, it feels like liberation, but it doesn\u2019t feel right. The bars and restaurants are shut, and many will never reopen. Nor will many other businesses for which tourism is their raison d\u2019\u00eatre.</p> <p>\u201cI passed by the Sagrada Familia and there were only four people there, all police, no passersby and, of course, no tourists,\u201d said Pere Marin\u00e9, a native of the city\u2019s Poblenou neighbourhood. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the clean air, the calm, the silence, the peacefulness, above all because we\u2019re not used to it. But we also miss the life of the city, the good and the bad, people in the street, the discussions in the Rambla del Poblenou. The city is better, cleaner, safer, quieter and more diverse, but with so much left to do.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all those things, but it\u2019s dead. Mediterranean life is lived outdoors, in cafes and bars and in the squares where people old and young sit and talk and argue. We can go out, but there\u2019s nowhere to go. Cicero said of war, they leave you a wilderness and call it peace. We\u2019ve inherited a ghost town.</p> <p>This is happening all over, of course. In Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, New York and many other cities that suddenly find themselves without visitors.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5230c49ae12c45856bca97d7cf10194d0b0bb895\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5230c49ae12c45856bca97d7cf10194d0b0bb895/0_0_6595_4397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amsterdam in lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amsterdam in lockdown: \u2018Suddenly you could see the real beauty of the city centre, places we have avoided for years.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cVenice was becoming like Disneyland without inhabitants,\u201d says Alberta de Grenet who moved to the city when she was 11 and has lived there for 20 years. \u201cNow you can see the city for what it really is, a place full of light, more a village than a city. I\u2019m hoping we can learn something from this strange and totally unexpected situation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn March, all of a sudden, all we heard was Dutch around us,\u201d says Fulco Blokhuis, a native of Amsterdam. \u201cSuddenly you could see the real beauty of the city centre, places we have avoided for years.</p> <p>\u201cWe took our kids to the Wallen, the red light district. There were no stag parties, no tourists, no sex workers, no drug dealers. A memory of a lifetime.\u201d</p> <p>Already Barcelona city council is talking about reclaiming the city for its residents, even La Rambla and the beach \u2013 a city with tourists but not for them. The city authorities hope that many of the thousands of empty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/09/airbnb-slump-europe-cities-residents-barcelona-dublin\">Airbnb</a> holiday rentals can now be reclaimed and rented to residents.</p> <p>In the meantime, the financial pain is going to be intense and tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. Right now we\u2019re enjoying the peace and quiet, but soon we\u2019ll look back to all the times we wanted the tourists to go away and leave us alone and think, be careful what you wish for.</p>",

Not a soul except the Deliveroo and Glovo riders and the occasional shopper, masked and gloved, making a foray to the nearest supermarket before scurrying back home. In a city with one of the highest population densities in Europe, there was no one to be seen. Throughout this time, people here have shown an extraordinary and perhaps unexpected degree of discipline, stoicism and collective spirit in sticking to the rules of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. It\u2019s easing now, bit by bit. As of today, in most of Spain, bars with outdoor tables can open and people are allowed to visit each other\u2019s homes. Some parks and beaches will open, too, but only for exercise. Sunbathing is not encouraged. Not, alas, in Madrid, or Barcelona, where the authorities say we\u2019ll have to wait another week. It\u2019s disappointing, of course, but at least we\u2019re allowed out for a few hours a day, and nothing will ever erase the memory of that first taste of freedom, just over a week ago, when we were allowed out for exercise for the first time. After the wettest April in a century, it was a clear, sunny morning. There was birdsong. You really hear the birds now there are so few cars. You hear so much, and there\u2019s no need to shout above the traffic. A city looks different when cars no longer dominate the landscape; you see the line of the street, details in the architecture. And we probably haven\u2019t breathed air as clean as this since before the industrial revolution. People were out in numbers, in ones and twos, walking, jogging and speaking softly. Spain has a reputation as the noisiest country in Europe, but that morning everyone spoke sotto voce, as though afraid to break the spell. There was something else too, something different that you couldn\u2019t put your finger on at first. And then we realised: it was just us out there. People speaking Catalan and Spanish, as well as French and German and Urdu and all the many languages of this multicultural city, but they were all people who live here. There were no tourists. None. No cycle tours, no Segways, no rickshaws, no one selling selfie sticks, no one trying to lure you in to eat a paella at an hour when no one here eats paella \u2013 indeed, at an hour when no one eats, punto. It was just us. After decades in which tourism has grown exponentially, inexorably, to the point where the city\u2019s 1.6 million inhabitants received 30 million visitors last year, they\u2019d gone. All of them. We\u2019d got our city back. Even La Rambla, long ago abandoned to the lurid forces of occupation, was ours once more. Yes, it feels like liberation, but it doesn\u2019t feel right. The bars and restaurants are shut, and many will never reopen. Nor will many other businesses for which tourism is their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. \u201cI passed by the Sagrada Familia and there were only four people there, all police, no passersby and, of course, no tourists,\u201d said Pere Marin\u00e9, a native of the city\u2019s Poblenou neighbourhood. \u201cWe\u2019re enjoying the clean air, the calm, the silence, the peacefulness, above all because we\u2019re not used to it. But we also miss the life of the city, the good and the bad, people in the street, the discussions in the Rambla del Poblenou. The city is better, cleaner, safer, quieter and more diverse, but with so much left to do.\u201d It\u2019s all those things, but it\u2019s dead. Mediterranean life is lived outdoors, in cafes and bars and in the squares where people old and young sit and talk and argue. We can go out, but there\u2019s nowhere to go. Cicero said of war, they leave you a wilderness and call it peace. We\u2019ve inherited a ghost town. This is happening all over, of course. In Paris, Amsterdam, Venice, New York and many other cities that suddenly find themselves without visitors. \u201cVenice was becoming like Disneyland without inhabitants,\u201d says Alberta de Grenet who moved to the city when she was 11 and has lived there for 20 years. \u201cNow you can see the city for what it really is, a place full of light, more a village than a city. I\u2019m hoping we can learn something from this strange and totally unexpected situation.\u201d \u201cIn March, all of a sudden, all we heard was Dutch around us,\u201d says Fulco Blokhuis, a native of Amsterdam. \u201cSuddenly you could see the real beauty of the city centre, places we have avoided for years. \u201cWe took our kids to the Wallen, the red light district. There were no stag parties, no tourists, no sex workers, no drug dealers. A memory of a lifetime.\u201d Already Barcelona city council is talking about reclaiming the city for its residents, even La Rambla and the beach \u2013 a city with tourists but not for them. The city authorities hope that many of the thousands of empty Airbnb holiday rentals can now be reclaimed and rented to residents. In the meantime, the financial pain is going to be intense and tens of thousands of jobs are at stake. Right now we\u2019re enjoying the peace and quiet, but soon we\u2019ll look back to all the times we wanted the tourists to go away and leave us alone and think, be careful what you wish for.",

Covid-19 reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early 1980s when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it\u2019s really vulnerable,\u201d said Lilliston. \u201cPeople asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,\u201d said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside $120m to give its workers \u201cthank you bonuses\u201d. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks.</p> <p>Cargill pointed out: \u201cWe are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry \u2026 We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving \u2013 for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.\u201d</p> <p>Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that \u201cgood sense, caution, collaboration and understanding\u201d are the principles guiding the response. Liffey Meats said that the health and safety of workers was its priority.</p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Outbreaks of Covid-19 at slaughterhouses are occurring in a number of countries around the world, in a development that may have long-term implications for food supply systems, say experts. The US has been hardest hit, with outbreaks at more than 180 meat and processed food plants. But other countries with highly consolidated meat supply chains \u2013 Ireland, Spain, Australia, Germany, Brazil, Canada and the UK \u2013 are also struggling. \u201cWorkers are having to go back to work, and farmers are having to euthanise their animals,\u201d said Ben Lilliston of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a very chaotic, crazy situation.\u201d The reasons for the outbreaks are said to be a combination of crowded working conditions, workforces that are often made up predominantly of migrant workers living in communal housing, and the fact that plants have remained open during the crisis. The problem is particularly acute where large companies dominate the industry, as has increasingly been the case. Many small slaughterhouses have been shut down over recent years in favour of fewer but larger plants that may have thousands of workers, leading to what one observer called \u201cthe most narrow bottleneck in US agribusiness\u201d. In the short term, the issue is causing instability in the supply chain, with panic buying of meat in the US and the euthanisation of millions of farm animals. Questions are being asked about the risks to workers of infection and even death. In the long term, the problems will raise questions about stability and lack of resilience in the current system, which is dominated by a handful of vast international companies including Cargill, JBS, Smithfield and Tyson. In the US there have been almost 5,000 cases and at least 20 deaths among meat plant workers as of the end of April. The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting says there have now been more than 10,000 cases linked to meat plants. Difficulties with physical distancing and hygiene, and crowded living and transportation conditions, are listed as potential risk factors by US health officials. More than 20 meat plants have been closed in recent weeks, and one outbreak alone \u2013 at the Smithfield pork plant in South Dakota \u2013 saw more than 850 confirmed cases. Workers may have continued to work while feeling ill due to economic insecurity, health officials said. Tyson poultry workers were being offered a $500 bonus to continue working. In Germany there have been more than 300 confirmed cases at the M\u00fcller Fleisch plant in Birkenfeld. The owners called it the \u201cmost serious crisis\u201d in the plant\u2019s history. The communal living spaces for the largely migrant workforce have been partially blamed. In Canada, 949 cases have been confirmed at an Alberta meat packing house owned by Cargill, in the largest outbreak linked to a single facility in the country. In Australia, approximately 70 cases have so far been confirmed at Cedar Meats in Melbourne, which has been shut down for deep cleaning. Prosecutors in Brazil are currently trying to close down plants \u2013 including some run by JBS and BRF \u2013 where cases have been detected. Cases have been confirmed at nine plants, according to a government report seen by Reuters, which stated that more than 16,000 people may have been exposed. In Spain, there has been a row at Litera Meat in Bin\u00e9far, Aragon, about the number of workers who have the virus. Initial serological tests were positive for about 200 workers. The management have carried out subsequent tests on 284 workers to see if they are currently carrying the virus and had 11 positive results. Plants in Ireland have also been hit hard. Official figures show outbreaks at ten plants with more than 560 workers affected. Outbreaks were reported at Liffey Meats in Cavan and Kepak plants in Roscommon and Longford. More than a third of the workforce \u2013 120 workers in all \u2013 at the Rosderra pigmeat plant in Co Tipperary reportedly tested positive for the virus, while last Friday Dawn Meats closed its plant in Westmeath following positive cases. \u201cWe are seeing the results of years of meat industry consolidation and vertical integration aimed at increasing profits through efficiency and low wages,\u201d Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and global health at New York University told the Guardian, \u201cregardless of effects on animals, workers, and the environment. Covid-19 reveals the costs to workers crowded together under already dangerous working conditions in jobs that often lacked sick leave and healthcare benefits. These are all problems dating from the early 1980s when the shareholder value movement forced corporations to have profit as their sole goal.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s woken up a lot of people about how consolidated this system is, and how it is not very resilient, it\u2019s really vulnerable,\u201d said Lilliston. \u201cPeople asking about food security in the US is kind of new. There is also a greater awareness of worker rights - the lack of power, working tightly packed together, the lack of government enforcement and inspection. I think there is going to be some fallout but whether action will be taken remains to be seen.\u201d \u201cIt is clear that centralisation of processes into fewer and fewer centres, coupled with just-in-time supply chains, leads to a lack of resilience,\u201d said Prof Tim Benton, research director for emerging risks at Chatham House, a London thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s not so easy to draft in a slaughterman off the street than to pull in casual labour into supermarkets or even farming.\u201d The Guardian contacted all the companies named above. Cargill, JBS, Tyson and BRF detailed the significant work they are doing to deal with these issues including, in the case of JBS, working with physicians specialising in infectious diseases to develop a protocol, and, in the case of BRF, working with a global consultancy that specialises in risk management. Tyson has put aside $120m to give its workers \u201cthank you bonuses\u201d. All four said that they are carrying out special measures in their plants to protect workers, including distancing, staggered breaks, keeping vulnerable workers home and distributing face masks. Cargill pointed out: \u201cWe are also sensitive that farmers and ranchers need a place to move their cattle. This is a difficult balancing act facing our entire industry \u2026 We recognise farmers and ranchers rely on the global food system to earn their livelihoods, so it is critical we keep the market moving \u2013 for the farm economy and for the people and animals who rely on us for their food and nourishment.\u201d Litera Meats told the Guardian it is focused on keeping workers safe, and that \u201cgood sense, caution, collaboration and understanding\u201d are the principles guiding the response. Liffey Meats said that the health and safety of workers was its priority.",

It\u2019s not one issue, it\u2019s just across the board.\u201d</p> <p>The administration is under a tight deadline to secure changes before the election. A US law, the Congressional Review Act, allows lawmakers to more easily rescind regulations or rollbacks issued later in an election year.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re hitting a now or never timeline,\u201d said Christine Tezak, the managing director at the analysis firm ClearView Energy Partners. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot they want to get done before the election, just in case.\u201d</p> <p>Some trends are working against Trump \u2013 including states advancing environmental goals, and low-cost renewable power and natural gas helping reduce the climate footprint of the electricity sector. Even Houston, an energy hub, has issued a <a href=\"http://www.greenhoustontx.gov/climateactionplan/index.html\">climate action plan</a>. Yet such contributions are not expected to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/climate-emergency-global-action-way-off-track-says-un-head-coronavirus\">enough</a> to fulfill America\u2019s role in stalling the global crisis.</p> <p>Environmental advocates have challenged many of the Trump changes in court \u2013 and won. The Natural Resources Defense Council has sued 110 times and says it has prevailed in about 90% of lawsuits resolved.</p> <p>Recently, judges tossed out a permit for the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and decided the EPA cannot bar scientists who receive federal grants from serving as agency advisers.</p> <p>Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who represents regulated industries and was a deputy EPA administrator under George W Bush, argued that many of the changes characterized as \u201crollbacks\u201d are actually \u201csensible, reasonable regulatory reforms\u201d or fixes to problems.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand the Trump administration\u2019s EPA unless you go back and look at the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many groups there was a sense that there really had been a great deal of regulatory overreach. And even if you disagree with that, the regulatory programs created problems that they didn\u2019t come back and fix.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018This is about who we\u2019re protecting\u2019</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda has addressed some issues industry would rather were left alone. The agency is changing the way it calculates the benefits of mercury controls for power plants. Companies had already complied with the rule and most didn\u2019t want it changed. But the revision is meant to set a precedent for the government to ignore some positive health outcomes of regulation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s weakened standards often go against science too, critics say.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the EPA decided not to tighten rules for soot pollution, refuting rebutting guidance from experts that more stringent standards would save lives.

      "bodyText": "The Trump administration is diligently weakening US environment protections even amid a global pandemic, continuing its rollback as the November election approaches. During the Covid-19 lockdown, US federal agencies have eased fuel-efficiency standards for new cars; frozen rules for soot air pollution; proposed to drop review requirements for liquefied natural gas terminals; continued to lease public property to oil and gas companies; sought to speed up permitting for offshore fish farms; and advanced a proposal on mercury pollution from power plants that could make it easier for the government to conclude regulations are too costly to justify their benefits. The government has also relaxed reporting rules for polluters during the pandemic. Trump\u2019s ambitions reach even to the moon, which he has announced he wants the US to mine. Gina McCarthy, formerly Barack Obama\u2019s environment chief, now runs the Natural Resources Defense Council. She said the Trump administration was acting to cut public health protections while the American public is distracted by a public health crisis. \u201cPeople right now are hunkered down trying to put food on the table, take care of people who are sick, worry about educating their children at home,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHow many people are going to really be able to sit down and scrutinize these things in any way?\u201d McCarthy said the government was \u201cliterally not interested in the law or science\u201d, and that \u201cis going to become strikingly clear as people look at how the administration is handling Covid-19\u201d. The Trump administration is playing both offense and defense, rescinding and rewriting some rules and crafting others that would be time-consuming for a Democratic president to reverse. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has written what critics say will be a weak proposal for climate pollution from airplanes, a placeholder that will hinder stricter regulation. Trump officials have been attempting to create a coronavirus relief program for oil and gas corporations, a new move in his campaign to back the industry and stymie global climate action. The president has sown distrust of climate science and vowed to exit the Paris climate agreement, which the US can do after the election. Historians say Trump\u2019s presidency has forced a pendulum swing back from the environmental awakening of the 1960s and 70s, when there was bipartisan support for conservation. Protecting the environment \u2013 and particularly the climate \u2013 is an issue that has become embroiled in political ideology. \u201cWhat Trump\u2019s done is create a blitzkrieg against the environment \u2026 trying to dismantle not just Obama\u2019s environmental achievements but turn back the clock to a pre-Richard Nixon day,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University who is writing a book on the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s just death by a thousand cuts. It\u2019s not one issue, it\u2019s just across the board.\u201d The administration is under a tight deadline to secure changes before the election. A US law, the Congressional Review Act, allows lawmakers to more easily rescind regulations or rollbacks issued later in an election year. \u201cThey\u2019re hitting a now or never timeline,\u201d said Christine Tezak, the managing director at the analysis firm ClearView Energy Partners. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot they want to get done before the election, just in case.\u201d Some trends are working against Trump \u2013 including states advancing environmental goals, and low-cost renewable power and natural gas helping reduce the climate footprint of the electricity sector. Even Houston, an energy hub, has issued a climate action plan. Yet such contributions are not expected to be enough to fulfill America\u2019s role in stalling the global crisis. Environmental advocates have challenged many of the Trump changes in court \u2013 and won. The Natural Resources Defense Council has sued 110 times and says it has prevailed in about 90% of lawsuits resolved. Recently, judges tossed out a permit for the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and decided the EPA cannot bar scientists who receive federal grants from serving as agency advisers. Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who represents regulated industries and was a deputy EPA administrator under George W Bush, argued that many of the changes characterized as \u201crollbacks\u201d are actually \u201csensible, reasonable regulatory reforms\u201d or fixes to problems. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand the Trump administration\u2019s EPA unless you go back and look at the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many groups there was a sense that there really had been a great deal of regulatory overreach. And even if you disagree with that, the regulatory programs created problems that they didn\u2019t come back and fix.\u201d \u2018This is about who we\u2019re protecting\u2019 Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda has addressed some issues industry would rather were left alone. The agency is changing the way it calculates the benefits of mercury controls for power plants. Companies had already complied with the rule and most didn\u2019t want it changed. But the revision is meant to set a precedent for the government to ignore some positive health outcomes of regulation. Trump\u2019s weakened standards often go against science too, critics say. Last month, for example, the EPA decided not to tighten rules for soot pollution, refuting rebutting guidance from experts that more stringent standards would save lives. The EPA has also repopulated advisory boards with representatives from industry and conservative states and is trying to change what science it can consider when developing health protections. If a Democrat takes the White House, it will take years to reverse some changes. Moving faster would require Democrats holding both chambers of Congress. Even then, industry would fight hard. Christopher Cook, the environment chief for Boston, said Trump\u2019s efforts had been \u201cincongruous with all the actions that major cities are taking\u201d. \u201cThe thing I would ask most Americans to consider when they\u2019re supporting stronger regulation is that this isn\u2019t about what we\u2019re protecting against, this is about who we\u2019re protecting,\u201d Cook said, noting that places with more pollution are faring worse under the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cCovid has been a dry run for the climate crisis. We\u2019ve seen the populations that Covid affects because it attacks the respiratory system. We can\u2019t continue with bad air in America.\u201d",

So the only type of income that\u2019s available is from streaming. And I just thought, \u2018If this isn\u2019t a moment to do something about this, when is?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>One of the big names on the running order for Broken Record\u2019s Twitter listening party is the Scottish artist KT Tunstall. Around five weeks ago, she says she had an angry epiphany. \u201cOnline, everyone was clamouring to be entertained, and just expecting to get that for free,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThere was general feeling I was getting on social media: \u2018You\u2019re not gigging any more, you\u2019re just sitting at home. So why not get on Facebook or Instagram and play for us?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I tell you why I don\u2019t want to do that \u2013 it\u2019s because that\u2019s how I make a living, and I\u2019ve just lost 200 shows this year, and it\u2019s completely decimated my income.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>This year, she says, was set to be one of her busiest yet. How much money does she think she has lost? \u201cOver a million quid.\u201d</p> <p>She means revenue, not profit \u2013 and because the margins of touring are so tight, any money she would have made would hardly equate to riches.</p> <p>She then turns her attention to the streaming issue. \u201cLabels and streaming platforms are mistakenly thinking they\u2019re the product. And they\u2019re not. The providers of the product are just getting completely screwed. \u201d</p> <p>Spotify is reckoned to pay out an average of only \u00a30.0028 (or 0.28p) per stream to so-called \u201crights holders\u201d, a term that encompasses both massive record companies and artists who put out their own music. On YouTube, the per-stream rate is put at a mere \u00a30.0012.</p> <p>The lion\u2019s share of streaming payouts goes to the three big major music corporations, Universal, Sony and Warner Music, who still largely base the way they reward artists on a system created when companies had to cover the costs of manufacturing records and CDs. Even in the age of streaming, these firms tend to keep most of the money generated by sales and streaming sites, making many artists\u2019 livelihoods all the more fragile.</p> <p>Songwriters are even in a more precarious position. One of the prime movers in both campaigns is Crispin Hunt, once the singer with the Britpop-era band the Longpigs and now a professional songwriter who has worked withEllie Goulding and Florence and the Machine, and the current chair of the Ivors Academy.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been successful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the wolves are at the door, constantly.\u201d</p> <p>As an illustration, Hunt mentions his co-writing of Broken, a 2013 single by the British singer Jake Bugg that has amassed tens of millions of plays on YouTube. In the first two years after its release, he says, YouTube paid him \u00a3158. His last money from Spotify, he says, was centred on a Longpigs song titled On and On, a top 20 hit from 1996, which down the years has amassed nearly 3m plays. In the last three months, it notched up 25,000 UK plays, which netted him only \u00a35.</p> <p>The Musicians\u2019 Union and Ivors Academy campaign is so far steering clear of any specific demands, aiming instead at raising awareness of a system they say is \u201cbroken\u201d.</p> <p>Hunt suggests one solution could be an equal four-way split of the streaming services\u2019 revenues between the platforms themselves, record labels, songwriters and performers. Gray thinks part of the answer might lie in ensuring that some of people\u2019s online music subscriptions \u2013 \u00a39.99 a month for individuals, on both Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 is distributed to the artists they actually listen to.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/19/musicians-ask-spotify-to-triple-payments-to-cover-lost-concert-revenue\">One of the most unfair aspects of streaming</a>, he says, is that everyone\u2019s subscriptions go into one big pot, large amounts of which are channelled to the major labels and a handful of their hugely successful artists. So, however niche your tastes, a lot of your money inevitably goes to the likes of Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift.</p> <p>In response,Spotifysaid: \u201cThe vast majority of revenue generated on Spotify is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors \u2026 Spotify is helping fuel the growth of the music industry overall, which just experienced its fifth straight year of growth.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/23/spotify-tip-jar-musicians-pay-fans-donate-artists\">Spotify's 'tip jar' is a slap in the face for musicians. It should pay them better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A spokesperson for YouTube said the company pays the music industry \u201crates that are on par with the rest of the industry across both the advertising and subscription businesses\u201d.</p> <p>A statement from the BPI, the organisation that represents UK record labels including the three big corporates, insisted that \u201crecord labels are the leading investors in music to help artists achieve success\u201d, but also sounded a note of sympathy with campaigning musicians: \u201cThe central issue remains the gulf between the value of music exploited by the large user-upload video platforms and the value they return to music creators \u2026 The platforms can do better; they just need to be held accountable.\u201d </p>",

On Sunday 24 May, Broken Record will host an evening of the hugely popular Twitter listening parties run by Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, which will feature such names as Boy George, the cult US band the Shins, and the critically acclaimed singer-songwriter John Grant. \u201cCovid-19 happened and I was sitting there just thinking, \u2018Live music has gone, and it\u2019s going to be gone for a long time,\u2019\u201d says Gray. \u201cA big chunk of musicians\u2019 money comes from hairdressers and bars and cafes that pay for music licences, but that\u2019s now going to take a big hit. So the only type of income that\u2019s available is from streaming. And I just thought, \u2018If this isn\u2019t a moment to do something about this, when is?\u2019\u201d One of the big names on the running order for Broken Record\u2019s Twitter listening party is the Scottish artist KT Tunstall. Around five weeks ago, she says she had an angry epiphany. \u201cOnline, everyone was clamouring to be entertained, and just expecting to get that for free,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was general feeling I was getting on social media: \u2018You\u2019re not gigging any more, you\u2019re just sitting at home. So why not get on Facebook or Instagram and play for us?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018I tell you why I don\u2019t want to do that \u2013 it\u2019s because that\u2019s how I make a living, and I\u2019ve just lost 200 shows this year, and it\u2019s completely decimated my income.\u2019\u201d This year, she says, was set to be one of her busiest yet. How much money does she think she has lost? \u201cOver a million quid.\u201d She means revenue, not profit \u2013 and because the margins of touring are so tight, any money she would have made would hardly equate to riches. She then turns her attention to the streaming issue. \u201cLabels and streaming platforms are mistakenly thinking they\u2019re the product. And they\u2019re not. The providers of the product are just getting completely screwed. \u201d Spotify is reckoned to pay out an average of only \u00a30.0028 (or 0.28p) per stream to so-called \u201crights holders\u201d, a term that encompasses both massive record companies and artists who put out their own music. On YouTube, the per-stream rate is put at a mere \u00a30.0012. The lion\u2019s share of streaming payouts goes to the three big major music corporations, Universal, Sony and Warner Music, who still largely base the way they reward artists on a system created when companies had to cover the costs of manufacturing records and CDs. Even in the age of streaming, these firms tend to keep most of the money generated by sales and streaming sites, making many artists\u2019 livelihoods all the more fragile. Songwriters are even in a more precarious position. One of the prime movers in both campaigns is Crispin Hunt, once the singer with the Britpop-era band the Longpigs and now a professional songwriter who has worked withEllie Goulding and Florence and the Machine, and the current chair of the Ivors Academy. \u201cI\u2019ve been successful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the wolves are at the door, constantly.\u201d As an illustration, Hunt mentions his co-writing of Broken, a 2013 single by the British singer Jake Bugg that has amassed tens of millions of plays on YouTube. In the first two years after its release, he says, YouTube paid him \u00a3158. His last money from Spotify, he says, was centred on a Longpigs song titled On and On, a top 20 hit from 1996, which down the years has amassed nearly 3m plays. In the last three months, it notched up 25,000 UK plays, which netted him only \u00a35. The Musicians\u2019 Union and Ivors Academy campaign is so far steering clear of any specific demands, aiming instead at raising awareness of a system they say is \u201cbroken\u201d. Hunt suggests one solution could be an equal four-way split of the streaming services\u2019 revenues between the platforms themselves, record labels, songwriters and performers. Gray thinks part of the answer might lie in ensuring that some of people\u2019s online music subscriptions \u2013 \u00a39.99 a month for individuals, on both Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 is distributed to the artists they actually listen to. One of the most unfair aspects of streaming, he says, is that everyone\u2019s subscriptions go into one big pot, large amounts of which are channelled to the major labels and a handful of their hugely successful artists. So, however niche your tastes, a lot of your money inevitably goes to the likes of Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift. In response,Spotifysaid: \u201cThe vast majority of revenue generated on Spotify is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors \u2026 Spotify is helping fuel the growth of the music industry overall, which just experienced its fifth straight year of growth.\u201d A spokesperson for YouTube said the company pays the music industry \u201crates that are on par with the rest of the industry across both the advertising and subscription businesses\u201d. A statement from the BPI, the organisation that represents UK record labels including the three big corporates, insisted that \u201crecord labels are the leading investors in music to help artists achieve success\u201d, but also sounded a note of sympathy with campaigning musicians: \u201cThe central issue remains the gulf between the value of music exploited by the large user-upload video platforms and the value they return to music creators \u2026 The platforms can do better; they just need to be held accountable.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was Boris Johnson who used the term \u201c<a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2020-05-06/debates/4D4A836F-EBB7-4255-B84C-1537BDE1DCC4/Engagements\">unlockdown</a>\u201d at the last prime minister\u2019s questions; it was presumably sources in government who encouraged newspapers to think that giddy headlines about \u201cfreedom\u201d reflected what he was about to announce. God knows, plenty of us are in the market for anything remotely hopeful. But in the wake of the mixed messages and bungling that blurred into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">the prime minister\u2019s statement</a> on Sunday, millions are likely to be feeling yet more anxiety.</p> <p>Notwithstanding its rather forced delivery and the surfeit of diagrams and scales, what he said could perhaps have been worse. But Johnson had already undermined his words by his own actions, or lack of them. Promises of a \u201cworld-beating system\u201d for testing and tracking, and plans for quarantining new arrivals at airports, only underlined the fact that these things have yet to materialise. And at the dread moment that the screen was filled with green and yellow and the baffling words \u2018Stay alert\u2019, his context overwhelmed him. Here, inevitably, was yet another reminder of dire incompetence at the top.</p> <p>We all know the litany of failure so far, from the tilt into \u201cherd immunity\u201d and the delayed lockdown, through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/new-data-new-policy-why-uks-coronavirus-strategy-has-changed\">early abandonment</a> of testing efforts and all those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/revealed-private-firm-running-uk-ppe-stockpile-was-sold-in-middle-of-pandemic\">failures on PPE</a>, to the belated realisation about what was happening in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">care homes</a>. But other symbols of wrong turns, oversights and misplaced priorities are still arriving on a regular basis.</p> <p>The last 10 days have brought even more: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/boris-johnson-boasted-of-shaking-hands-on-day-sage-warned-not-to\">revelation</a> that Downing Street\u2019s scientific advisers had warned the government to tell people not to shake hands on the same day that Boris Johnson bragged about doing so \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/boris-johnson-boasted-of-shaking-hands-on-day-sage-warned-not-to\">with everybody</a>\u201d at a hospital full of coronavirus patients, followed by news that 400,000 medical gowns flown in from Turkey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/all-400000-gowns-flown-from-turkey-for-nhs-fail-uk-standards\">did not meet UK standards</a>.</p> <p>Last week was the first time I felt my anxiety about the crisis being superseded by anger. Johnson\u2019s latest bursts of triteness \u2013 suggesting that Covid-19 is like a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/muggers-and-invisible-enemies-how-boris-johnsons-metaphors-reveals-his-thinking\">mugger</a>\u201d, and then comparing the crisis to an \u201c<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/boris-johnson-weve-come-peak-like-alpine-tunnel-2162828/\">alpine tunnel</a>\u201d \u2013 were still rippling through social media. Then, on Wednesday, the front page of the Times carried <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-to-cut-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-cq2bfxl5p\">a story</a> about a \u201csenior government source\u201d suggesting that workers who had been furloughed were in danger of becoming \u201caddicted\u201d to the scheme, and Matt Hancock\u2019s striking use of the verb \u201cwean\u201d as an expression of how people might be removed from it. Not long before, the senior Tory backbencher Graham Brady <a href=\"https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/graham-brady-on-coronavirus-in-house-of-commons-1-6637728\">had claimed</a> that \u201cin some instances it may be that the public have been a little bit too willing to stay at home\u201d.</p> <p>Here was a familiar Tory voice of impatience and condescension, once again breaking through the patina of solidarity with the public. There were echoes of an infamous passage of the free-market manifesto <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/07/boris-johnson-government-britannia-unchained\">Britannia Unchained</a>, written by five Tory MPs, four of whom are now ministers: \u201cOnce they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world.\u201d Whatever its recent feints towards communitarianism and economic activism, the Conservative party seems unable to shake off its attachment to a vision of go-getting utopia, and its resultant contempt for a public that looks to the state for help and fails to match up to its ideal.</p> <p>This credo, of course, took hold in the Conservative party during the leadership of that era-defining grocer\u2019s daughter, Margaret Thatcher. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the same basic beliefs endured, while the party once again chose its leaders from the ranks of the wealthy and entitled. The result was Thatcherism taken away from its petit bourgeois roots and revived by public schoolboys whose determination to hack back the state was made all the more zealous by both arrogance and ignorance of how most people live.</p> <p>The results are now plain to see: after a decade of austerity we went into this crisis in a state of disastrous social fragility; and the innate Tory distrust of collectivism and state intervention \u2013 which Johnson shares, whatever his rhetoric \u2013 has surely been a big part of the reason it has been so badly handled. So too has been the classic officer-class trait of inattention to detail. As George Orwell <a href=\"https://orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye\">put it</a> back in 1941: \u201cProbably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.\u201d</p> <p>To that, the Conservatives would doubtless retort that they have just resoundingly won yet another election and are way ahead in the polls, something reflected by conversations I have recently had with many people who still give the government the benefit of the doubt. Part of the explanation lies in the way that crises usually favour incumbents, in their opening stages at least. Self-evidently, the Labour party is a long way from any political recovery.</p> <p>But there are also bigger, deeper factors at work. In England in particular, there is a strand of the national culture expressed by the mixture of hectoring optimism and insularity of the rightwing press, and reducible to the idea that the supposed British way of doing anything is necessarily the best. Even now, 21st-century politics is still less about hardened matters of success and failure than these expressions of culture and history, and the sides they force people to take.</p> <p>Britain was led into the disaster of Brexit by people successfully sowing the ludicrous idea that subjecting ourselves to self-harm would somehow awaken the Blitz spirit and revive past glories. Amid Friday\u2019s juxtaposition of the 75th anniversary of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/ve-day-2020-75th-anniversary-two-minute-silence-red-arrows-flypast-live\">VE day</a> and a deepening sense of national crisis, as well as solemn remembrance, there was inevitably some of the same stuff. These things play into deep elements of the English psyche, shot through with the lingering traces of deference and always ready to be manipulated by Tory politicians.</p> <p>For the last week or so, I have been rereading <a href=\"https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571227204-englands-dreaming.html\">England\u2019s Dreaming</a>, Jon Savage\u2019s history of both punk rock and the social malaise of Britain in the mid-to-late 1970s. Some of its most vivid passages are about the Queen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/from-the-archive-the-silver-jubilee-1977-street-parties-bunting-sex-pistols\">Silver Jubilee</a> of 1977, which I can just about remember as a carnival of rictus grins. He writes about \u201can elaborate covering of the social cracks\u201d, and, in the celebrations, \u201ca concentrated dose of all the unappealing traits \u2013 snobbery, insularity, xenophobia \u2013 that rendered England\u2019s continued claim to be a world power meaningless\u201d.</p> <p>Back then, affected national exceptionalism and streets festooned with flags could not smooth over Britain\u2019s decline; now, though the Daily Mail has been offering souvenir VE Day pull-outs, and sales of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/boom-in-bunting-sales-as-britons-set-to-celebrate-ve-day-at-home\">union </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/06/boom-in-bunting-sales-as-britons-set-to-celebrate-ve-day-at-home\">jack bunting</a> last week reached record levels, we will sooner or later have to confront the fact that we have not just the highest death toll in Europe but a broken social settlement.</p> <p>The point is not to diminish the heroic aspects of our past, but to finally focus on the realities of the present. We cannot go on like this, with deep inequalities of race and class constantly exploding before our eyes, the need for food banks extending into the distance, and voices at the top willing us back towards the very social and political dead end that ensured the virus has had such a disastrous impact. In the great surge of spontaneous collective action that has greeted Covid-19, there are the seeds of something better, but we should not underestimate the obstacles in the way: nostalgia, mythology and the banalities of politicians desperate to manipulate such things in their own interests as their failures become inescapable.</p> <p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was Boris Johnson who used the term \u201cunlockdown\u201d at the last prime minister\u2019s questions; it was presumably sources in government who encouraged newspapers to think that giddy headlines about \u201cfreedom\u201d reflected what he was about to announce. God knows, plenty of us are in the market for anything remotely hopeful. But in the wake of the mixed messages and bungling that blurred into the prime minister\u2019s statement on Sunday, millions are likely to be feeling yet more anxiety. Notwithstanding its rather forced delivery and the surfeit of diagrams and scales, what he said could perhaps have been worse. But Johnson had already undermined his words by his own actions, or lack of them. Promises of a \u201cworld-beating system\u201d for testing and tracking, and plans for quarantining new arrivals at airports, only underlined the fact that these things have yet to materialise. And at the dread moment that the screen was filled with green and yellow and the baffling words \u2018Stay alert\u2019, his context overwhelmed him. Here, inevitably, was yet another reminder of dire incompetence at the top. We all know the litany of failure so far, from the tilt into \u201cherd immunity\u201d and the delayed lockdown, through the early abandonment of testing efforts and all those failures on PPE, to the belated realisation about what was happening in care homes. But other symbols of wrong turns, oversights and misplaced priorities are still arriving on a regular basis. The last 10 days have brought even more: the revelation that Downing Street\u2019s scientific advisers had warned the government to tell people not to shake hands on the same day that Boris Johnson bragged about doing so \u201cwith everybody\u201d at a hospital full of coronavirus patients, followed by news that 400,000 medical gowns flown in from Turkey did not meet UK standards. Last week was the first time I felt my anxiety about the crisis being superseded by anger. Johnson\u2019s latest bursts of triteness \u2013 suggesting that Covid-19 is like a \u201cmugger\u201d, and then comparing the crisis to an \u201calpine tunnel\u201d \u2013 were still rippling through social media. Then, on Wednesday, the front page of the Times carried a story about a \u201csenior government source\u201d suggesting that workers who had been furloughed were in danger of becoming \u201caddicted\u201d to the scheme, and Matt Hancock\u2019s striking use of the verb \u201cwean\u201d as an expression of how people might be removed from it. Not long before, the senior Tory backbencher Graham Brady had claimed that \u201cin some instances it may be that the public have been a little bit too willing to stay at home\u201d. Here was a familiar Tory voice of impatience and condescension, once again breaking through the patina of solidarity with the public. There were echoes of an infamous passage of the free-market manifesto Britannia Unchained, written by five Tory MPs, four of whom are now ministers: \u201cOnce they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world.\u201d Whatever its recent feints towards communitarianism and economic activism, the Conservative party seems unable to shake off its attachment to a vision of go-getting utopia, and its resultant contempt for a public that looks to the state for help and fails to match up to its ideal. This credo, of course, took hold in the Conservative party during the leadership of that era-defining grocer\u2019s daughter, Margaret Thatcher. Under David Cameron and George Osborne, the same basic beliefs endured, while the party once again chose its leaders from the ranks of the wealthy and entitled. The result was Thatcherism taken away from its petit bourgeois roots and revived by public schoolboys whose determination to hack back the state was made all the more zealous by both arrogance and ignorance of how most people live. The results are now plain to see: after a decade of austerity we went into this crisis in a state of disastrous social fragility; and the innate Tory distrust of collectivism and state intervention \u2013 which Johnson shares, whatever his rhetoric \u2013 has surely been a big part of the reason it has been so badly handled. So too has been the classic officer-class trait of inattention to detail. As George Orwell put it back in 1941: \u201cProbably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton, but the opening battles of all subsequent wars have been lost there.\u201d To that, the Conservatives would doubtless retort that they have just resoundingly won yet another election and are way ahead in the polls, something reflected by conversations I have recently had with many people who still give the government the benefit of the doubt. Part of the explanation lies in the way that crises usually favour incumbents, in their opening stages at least. Self-evidently, the Labour party is a long way from any political recovery. But there are also bigger, deeper factors at work. In England in particular, there is a strand of the national culture expressed by the mixture of hectoring optimism and insularity of the rightwing press, and reducible to the idea that the supposed British way of doing anything is necessarily the best. Even now, 21st-century politics is still less about hardened matters of success and failure than these expressions of culture and history, and the sides they force people to take. Britain was led into the disaster of Brexit by people successfully sowing the ludicrous idea that subjecting ourselves to self-harm would somehow awaken the Blitz spirit and revive past glories. Amid Friday\u2019s juxtaposition of the 75th anniversary of VE day and a deepening sense of national crisis, as well as solemn remembrance, there was inevitably some of the same stuff. These things play into deep elements of the English psyche, shot through with the lingering traces of deference and always ready to be manipulated by Tory politicians. For the last week or so, I have been rereading England\u2019s Dreaming, Jon Savage\u2019s history of both punk rock and the social malaise of Britain in the mid-to-late 1970s. Some of its most vivid passages are about the Queen\u2019s Silver Jubilee of 1977, which I can just about remember as a carnival of rictus grins. He writes about \u201can elaborate covering of the social cracks\u201d, and, in the celebrations, \u201ca concentrated dose of all the unappealing traits \u2013 snobbery, insularity, xenophobia \u2013 that rendered England\u2019s continued claim to be a world power meaningless\u201d. Back then, affected national exceptionalism and streets festooned with flags could not smooth over Britain\u2019s decline; now, though the Daily Mail has been offering souvenir VE Day pull-outs, and sales of union jack bunting last week reached record levels, we will sooner or later have to confront the fact that we have not just the highest death toll in Europe but a broken social settlement. The point is not to diminish the heroic aspects of our past, but to finally focus on the realities of the present. We cannot go on like this, with deep inequalities of race and class constantly exploding before our eyes, the need for food banks extending into the distance, and voices at the top willing us back towards the very social and political dead end that ensured the virus has had such a disastrous impact. In the great surge of spontaneous collective action that has greeted Covid-19, there are the seeds of something better, but we should not underestimate the obstacles in the way: nostalgia, mythology and the banalities of politicians desperate to manipulate such things in their own interests as their failures become inescapable. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison says he would be \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d if China\u2019s plan to impose tariffs on Australian barley imports were connected to the broader diplomatic dispute over an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic. The Australian government has signalled it would consider taking the dispute to the World Trade Organisation should China follow through with the planned duties of around 80%. China\u2019s commerce ministry is proposing to impose tariffs on barley imported from Australia after an 18-month investigation into claims the industry was \u201cdumping\u201d the product at a lower price that at home. The move is also based on claims the Australian industry gains an advantage from government subsidies. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said he did not accept \u201cthat there is a prima facie case, let alone a conclusive case, to find dumping by or subsidy of Australian producers\u201d. The two countries have been entangled in a messy dispute over Morrison\u2019s call for an independent international investigation into the origins and handling of the Covid-19 outbreak \u2013 a move Beijing had claimed was aimed against China. The dispute intensified late last month when the Chinese ambassador, Cheng Jingye, had suggested that Chinese tourists and students may rethink their plans to visit Australia in the future \u201cif the mood is going from bad to worse\u201d, while consumers may also decide against buying Australian wine and beef. When asked on Monday whether the draft decision may be retribution for Australia pushing for the Covid-19 inquiry, Morrison said he did not believe that was the case. \u201cThey certainly haven\u2019t raised it as connected to other issues. I would be extremely disappointed if it was,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Canberra. The value of Australian exports of barley to China had already fallen from $1.7bn in 2018 to $600m in 2019, Morrison noted. He said trade was \u201cincredibly important and beneficial for both countries\u201d. Australia respected anti-dumping regimes, he added, and had previously launched similar inquiries in relation to imports from China. \u201cNot all those decisions were well received,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been made on the merits and I would hope and expect China to do the same thing.\u201d Australian grain industry groups have sounded the alarm over the potentially steep new tariffs, with China\u2019s commerce ministry expected to make a final decision by early next week. The tariffs may include a dumping margin of up to 73.6% and a subsidy margin of up to 6.9% for barley imported from Australia, according to a statement issued by five groups including the Grains Industry Market Access Forum and the Australian Grain Exporters Council. Australian barley exporters and the government were given 10 days to respond. Birmingham said Australia would \u201creserve all rights\u201d to defend the interest of its barley producers \u2013 a sign that the WTO may be asked to rule on the dispute. \u201cWe will use the remaining time before China finalises its decision to continue our efforts to resolve this matter satisfactorily and will seek to uphold the integrity of our world-leading barley producers,\u201d he said. Taking action through the WTO is not a quick fix, because such disputes can drag on for years and the top appellate body\u2019s functioning has been under strain as the US has blocked appointments. The freeze had led Australia to work with China and the European Union in recent months to set up a temporary mechanism to rule on disputes, replicating the WTO\u2019s top umpire\u2019s functions. China has been the third most active member in the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, having been involved in 65 disputes between 2002 and 2019. In two-thirds of those disputes, China was the respondent, according to analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). China had a high-profile victory late last year when an WTO arbitrator ruled China could impose tariffs on up to $3.6bn of American goods over a US failure to abide by anti-dumping rules. But according to the CSIS ChinaPower Project, Beijing has a \u201cmixed record of compliance with WTO dispute rulings\u201d because in some cases it has found creative ways to demonstrate legal compliance \u201cwhile sidestepping the spirit of certain decisions\u201d. Labor called on the government \u201cto show leadership on managing this important relationship at this difficult time\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult time for the barley growers now \u2013 many of them have already sowed their crops and now they\u2019ve got this hanging over their heads, this ongoing dispute,\u201d the opposition\u2019s trade spokesperson, Madeleine King, told Sky News. Mindful that China remains Australia\u2019s largest trading partner, the government hopes to avoid diplomatic tensions spilling over into the important economic relationship. But some within Coalition ranks are pushing the government to take a harder line against China. The Queensland Coalition MP George Christensen issued a threat on Sunday to try to summons the Chinese ambassador to answer questions before a trade-related parliamentary committee \u2013 a move that may inflame tensions but would likely fail due to diplomatic immunity. Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, a NSW senator with a long record of taking a hard line on Beijing, told Guardian Australia last week the government should spell out a plan to \u201cdecouple from China\u201d economically and even to seek compensation for the impact of the coronavirus.",

      "body": "<p>Stay alert. Watch out. There\u2019s a Boris about. All his life Boris Johnson has fantasised about being the next Winston Churchill, the nation\u2019s saviour. But 75 years after Churchill declared the end of the second world war in Europe, all Boris could manage to do in his pre-recorded television statement \u2013 his minders don\u2019t trust him to do anything live \u2013 was divide the United Kingdom. The Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish had all managed to distance themselves from the prime minister\u2019s central message even before it had been broadcast. Forget the Churchill tribute act; these days Boris couldn\u2019t even get a job as a Boris Johnson tribute act.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It was never intended to be this way. Boris was meant to be the man who could put a smile on the country\u2019s face; the man who would get Brexit done with blind optimism and a few white lies. But the coronavirus has put paid to all that. It\u2019s a virus that stubbornly resists any smooth-talking about taking back control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"83ace1f4-80d3-455c-8c43-ac734c334dfb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PPhf8LfrS_c?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And deep down, Boris knows that he\u2019s well out of his depth \u2013 that he\u2019s simply not up to the job. You can see it in his eyes, which have shrivelled to puffy pinpricks. And he\u2019s lost the gift of language. At a time of crisis, a leader\u2019s speech is supposed to be a source of inspiration and reassurance. Somehow all that Boris can manage to impart now is a sense of panic.</p> \n<p>This time at least, Boris had made an effort. Smart suit, brushed hair. It was just the speech that was a mess. A more honest prime minister would have admitted that mistakes had been made in the handling of the crisis. But Boris is, deep down, a coward, a man who runs from the first hint of personal responsibility and has one eye already firmly on the public inquiry that will surely follow.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>So what we got was more waffle about following the science and being grateful that even more people had not yet died. Why couldn\u2019t the 65 million survivors be a bit more grateful? Not a word on why other countries were coping with the virus so much better than us. It must be a huge relief to the families of those who have died that the government didn\u2019t choose to follow the South Korean science.</p> \n<p>No one could have predicted the need for more personal protective equipment in care homes (unless they had actually read the Exercise Cygnus report that predicted just that). And we would soon be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day. Boris still clings to the belief that just by saying something, he can make it come true. Not only are we struggling to reach a target of just 100K a day without some creative accounting \u2013 we don\u2019t even have the resources to process the results in under 10 days.</p> \n<p>Having got his excuses and disclaimers out of the way, Boris got down to the substance of his speech. Or rather the lack of substance. Meet the new messaging: same as the old messaging. Only even vaguer and more confusing. Not so much 15 minutes of TV fame as uncomfortably like watching someone have a breakdown in front of you. Rather than just stay at home, Boris\u2019s new maxim was to \u201cStay alert\u201d. Less a slogan, more like a piece of advice to himself, given all the times he has taken his eye off the ball over the past few months. Even the writers of Dad\u2019s Army wouldn\u2019t have let Captain Mainwaring embarrass himself like that.</p> \n<p>It was as if what had been missing from the British war effort had been some blackout curtains and taking down road signs in a bid to confuse and slow the progress of the coronavirus. The one war slogan that might have been more apt was \u201cCareless talk costs lives\u201d. Because few people\u2019s talk has been more careless than the prime minister\u2019s. He\u2019s a Zen master whose only objective is to get to the end of any one sentence, with no thought for the consequences for those that follow. For Boris there is no past and no future. And, as things stand, not much of a present.</p> \n<p>What was most striking was how little Boris had to say. His roadmap \u2013 or shape of a roadmap as he called it, making it sound uncomfortably like a homeopathic memory of a map \u2013 to the future looked uncomfortably like one of the M25. There were five exciting colours of alertness and the the promise of a Captain Marvel bio-science centre, but the bottom line was that it was still circular, with any number of still to be determined exit points, keeping alive the very real possibility that we might find ourselves back at the start.</p> \n<p>Much of it was just the same \u2013 often contradictory \u2013 advice. Social distancing, staying at home wherever possible, going to work wherever possible. How people were meant to get to work on public transport while staying 2 metres apart was not explained. He also gnomically stated that the reproduction rate had now come down far enough for us to test arrivals at airports in a month\u2019s time. Clearly he\u2019s been spending too long talking to Priti Patel, who insists the UK has both too many and too few air passengers to make testing a viability.</p> \n<p>There would also be some easing of the lockdown by the end of June (apart from the bits that might come sooner). (Or later.) It was all just a bit of a ramble, with nothing on the one question many people wanted answered: at what stage might people be allowed to see their family and friends again?</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is our plan,\u201d Boris concluded, having forgotten he had just said he didn\u2019t really have a plan, other than to stay alert and keep buggering on \u2013 something the rest of the country is increasingly wishing Boris might personally reconsider. Remember those far-off days when you thought we had scraped the barrel with David Cameron and Theresa May?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Stay alert. Watch out. There\u2019s a Boris about. All his life Boris Johnson has fantasised about being the next Winston Churchill, the nation\u2019s saviour. But 75 years after Churchill declared the end of the second world war in Europe, all Boris could manage to do in his pre-recorded television statement \u2013 his minders don\u2019t trust him to do anything live \u2013 was divide the United Kingdom. The Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish had all managed to distance themselves from the prime minister\u2019s central message even before it had been broadcast. Forget the Churchill tribute act; these days Boris couldn\u2019t even get a job as a Boris Johnson tribute act. It was never intended to be this way. Boris was meant to be the man who could put a smile on the country\u2019s face; the man who would get Brexit done with blind optimism and a few white lies. But the coronavirus has put paid to all that. It\u2019s a virus that stubbornly resists any smooth-talking about taking back control. And deep down, Boris knows that he\u2019s well out of his depth \u2013 that he\u2019s simply not up to the job. You can see it in his eyes, which have shrivelled to puffy pinpricks. And he\u2019s lost the gift of language. At a time of crisis, a leader\u2019s speech is supposed to be a source of inspiration and reassurance. Somehow all that Boris can manage to impart now is a sense of panic. This time at least, Boris had made an effort. Smart suit, brushed hair. It was just the speech that was a mess. A more honest prime minister would have admitted that mistakes had been made in the handling of the crisis. But Boris is, deep down, a coward, a man who runs from the first hint of personal responsibility and has one eye already firmly on the public inquiry that will surely follow. So what we got was more waffle about following the science and being grateful that even more people had not yet died. Why couldn\u2019t the 65 million survivors be a bit more grateful? Not a word on why other countries were coping with the virus so much better than us. It must be a huge relief to the families of those who have died that the government didn\u2019t choose to follow the South Korean science. No one could have predicted the need for more personal protective equipment in care homes (unless they had actually read the Exercise Cygnus report that predicted just that). And we would soon be conducting hundreds of thousands of tests a day. Boris still clings to the belief that just by saying something, he can make it come true. Not only are we struggling to reach a target of just 100K a day without some creative accounting \u2013 we don\u2019t even have the resources to process the results in under 10 days. Having got his excuses and disclaimers out of the way, Boris got down to the substance of his speech. Or rather the lack of substance. Meet the new messaging: same as the old messaging. Only even vaguer and more confusing. Not so much 15 minutes of TV fame as uncomfortably like watching someone have a breakdown in front of you. Rather than just stay at home, Boris\u2019s new maxim was to \u201cStay alert\u201d. Less a slogan, more like a piece of advice to himself, given all the times he has taken his eye off the ball over the past few months. Even the writers of Dad\u2019s Army wouldn\u2019t have let Captain Mainwaring embarrass himself like that. It was as if what had been missing from the British war effort had been some blackout curtains and taking down road signs in a bid to confuse and slow the progress of the coronavirus. The one war slogan that might have been more apt was \u201cCareless talk costs lives\u201d. Because few people\u2019s talk has been more careless than the prime minister\u2019s. He\u2019s a Zen master whose only objective is to get to the end of any one sentence, with no thought for the consequences for those that follow. For Boris there is no past and no future. And, as things stand, not much of a present. What was most striking was how little Boris had to say. His roadmap \u2013 or shape of a roadmap as he called it, making it sound uncomfortably like a homeopathic memory of a map \u2013 to the future looked uncomfortably like one of the M25. There were five exciting colours of alertness and the the promise of a Captain Marvel bio-science centre, but the bottom line was that it was still circular, with any number of still to be determined exit points, keeping alive the very real possibility that we might find ourselves back at the start. Much of it was just the same \u2013 often contradictory \u2013 advice. Social distancing, staying at home wherever possible, going to work wherever possible. How people were meant to get to work on public transport while staying 2 metres apart was not explained. He also gnomically stated that the reproduction rate had now come down far enough for us to test arrivals at airports in a month\u2019s time. Clearly he\u2019s been spending too long talking to Priti Patel, who insists the UK has both too many and too few air passengers to make testing a viability. There would also be some easing of the lockdown by the end of June (apart from the bits that might come sooner). (Or later.) It was all just a bit of a ramble, with nothing on the one question many people wanted answered: at what stage might people be allowed to see their family and friends again? \u201cThis is our plan,\u201d Boris concluded, having forgotten he had just said he didn\u2019t really have a plan, other than to stay alert and keep buggering on \u2013 something the rest of the country is increasingly wishing Boris might personally reconsider. Remember those far-off days when you thought we had scraped the barrel with David Cameron and Theresa May?",

While there is still a relatively low number of coronavirus cases in Bangladesh \u2013 about 10,000, with only 187 deaths \u2013 the country has one of the lowest testing rates in the world. Meanwhile the garment industry is the country\u2019s single biggest revenue generator, worth about $34bn and employing more than 4 million people in 4,500 factories. But it has been hit brutally by coronavirus, already losing $3.5bn in cancelled or suspended clothing orders from brands including Topshop, Asda, Urban Outfitters, Sports Direct, New look and Peacocks in the past two months. The dozens of Bangladesh factories supplying Debenhams are in particularly dire straits after the coronavirus downturn sent the department store into administration and unable to pay for millions of pounds worth of ordered garments now sitting in factories and ports. According to suppliers in Dhaka, the chain has requested an \u201cunaffordable\u201d discount on some of the goods sitting in ports. In a statement, Debenhams said: \u201cLike all fashion retailers, we have had to make some very tough decisions in relation to our supply chain. We are trying to deal with all those affected as fairly and openly as possible. As we have said, suppliers who continue to work with us during our administration period will be paid to terms.\u201d The financial brunt of the cancellations and withheld payments has been borne by the workers, with more than 150,000 denied their wages in March. After the factories initially halted production in mid-March, thousands of workers took to the streets to protest that they were starving. It was this pressure to revive the garment industry, as well as to prevent orders going to factories in Vietnam or Cambodia instead, that led to the decision to reopen the factories at the end of April, with more than 1,000 now back in operation. But Sarwer Hossain, a workers\u2019 rights leader based in the Savar district of Dhaka, said the decision to reopen the factories without enforcing proper safety measures was putting the lives of hundreds of thousands of garment workers, their families and communities in grave danger. \u201cYou can see with your own eyes how crowded the place is,\u201d said Hossain, gesturing at the bustling roads and marketplace around the factories. \u201cIt\u2019s even more crammed inside. The majority of the reopened factories didn\u2019t take adequate social distancing or other preventive measures. Only a handful of factories I\u2019ve visited have disinfectant booths and proper temperature checks at gates and provided face shields, gloves and frequent hand washing.\u201d Ayesha, 24, a machine operator, spoke of her fear of being back at work but said she \u201chad no other option\u201d. \u201cWhen my line chief called and asked me to start working again, I asked him: \u2018Why are you doing this? Do you want to get us killed?\u2019\u201d said Ayesha. \u201cHe told me if we don\u2019t show the world the factory is ready and working, the orders will go to Vietnam, Cambodia or some other places and eventually we will all be kicked out of our jobs anyway. \u201cI am not scared of dying,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m worried if I become the carrier of the virus to my family. I won\u2019t be able to forgive myself.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Footage showing half a dozen dead bodies lying on beds next to Covid-19 patients in hospital has horrified India and exposed how the nation\u2019s health system is struggling, in some areas, to cope during the pandemic. The footage from Sion hospital in Mumbai showed the bodies, wrapped in black plastic, lying next to patients undergoing treatment. Families tending to the patients were also seen moving around the ward, with the bodies lying nearby. The vision provoked public outrage and echoed the fears expressed by many Indians that some states might be overwhelmed if there is an increase in cases. The country\u2019s official Covid-19 figures remain low compared with the scale of the pandemic in Europe and the US, and given its population. The hospital\u2019s dean, Pramod Ingale, blamed the families of the dead for failing to collect the bodies of their loved ones and said the bodies were left in the ward because the morgue was full. Ingale said the rules were not clear about what the hospital should do with unclaimed bodies. Regulations state the body of a Covid-19 patient has to be removed 30 minutes after being declared dead. Ingale was later demoted. The new dean, Dr Ramesh Bharmal, told the Guardian that \u201csuch things won\u2019t happen again\u201d. \u201cThe crux of the problem is educating the families of the patient. If a patient becomes serious, we will take the relatives aside and counsel them not to be scared. This is a social issue. People need to be educated about the disease and how it is safe to take the body and perform the last rites. We will have to educate them,\u201d he said. Bharmal said that if families refused to take their dead, hospital officials would go to their homes to explain how they could conduct a funeral safely and, if need be, offer them PPE suits to wear for the funeral. In an indication that Mumbai hospitals are being overwhelmed, just a few days after the Sion hospital footage surfaced, similar images emerged from KEM hospital in Mumbai showing Covid-19 patients lying in the same ward as the body of a patient who had died of the virus. A relative told the journalist secretly filming inside the hospital that the body had been lying there for a while. The video showed a crowded ward packed with patients and medical staff but also with patients\u2019 relatives, with no social distancing and no isolation of those suspected of being infected with Covid-19. Two patients were seen sharing a bed. In another incident, a man with symptoms of the virus was taken by his family to two hospitals on Friday and refused admission on the grounds that no bed was available. He was eventually admitted to KEM Hospital, where he died in the accident and emergency area. He tested positive for Covid-19. Mumbai is the capital of Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in India with more than 22,171 cases and 832 fatalities and an infection rate that shows no sign of slowing. Mumbai alone has more than 13,500 of the state\u2019s cases and has been recording a large number of new infections every day for the past month. On Friday, Maharashtra\u2019s chief minister, Uddhav Thackery, said the chain of infection had not been broken but dispelled rumours the army might be called in to help. \u201cThe army will not be deployed.

If we fall sick with the virus, God help us.\u201d India has 67,152 cases and 2,206 deaths as of 11 May.",

      "bodyText": "Thursday World Cup questions: what did Zidane\u2019s headbutt in Berlin mean? \u2018A World Cup that began a month ago in Munich is entering the final moments of overtime. Marco Materazzi puts his hand on Zinedine Zidane\u2019s back, seeming to guide him quite gently out of the way. Zidane turns, says something and walks away. He has two minutes and 10 seconds left of his career as a footballer.\u2019 Ahmaud Arbery killing: man called 911 to report \u2018black male running\u2019 prior to shooting \u2018The full recordings, obtained by the Guardian, come after new video footage showing Arbery\u2019s killing in February was released this week, prompting widespread outrage and raising questions over why no arrests have been made. Transcripts of the 911 calls have been previously reported by local media.\u2019 Twenty years on, what has having a mayor done for London? \u2018Twenty years ago this week, London began a journey into a political unknown. For the first time in history, its voters were asked to directly elect a mayor. Their answer was a twist of irony. They voted for the same man who, 15 years earlier, Margaret Thatcher had sacked as London\u2019s previous \u201cindirect\u201d leader, Ken Livingstone. They chose the devil they knew. Has the game been worth the candle?\u2019 Julie Andrews: \u2018I was certainly aware of tales about the casting couch\u2019 \u2018Andrews has always radiated a nourishing kind of goodness, although she makes an embarrassed laugh when I bring it up: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know how to respond to questions about [my image], Hadley. It\u2019s just how it\u2019s always been,\u201d she says, careful to use my name in response to almost all my questions. It\u2019s a gesture that feels entirely of a piece with Andrews, something born of careful good manners and precision.\u2019 The hidden findings on George Pell are now clear: he could have protected children from abuse. He didn\u2019t \u2018This is the portrait of a deceitful man. We have waited over two and a half years but now we can read the unflinching verdict reached by the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse on Cardinal George Pell.\u2019 Friday Experience: I found a stranger in my front room \u2018It was early on a Monday morning, about 5.30am, and I\u2019d got up to use the toilet. Afterwards, I nipped into the kitchen to get a drink. As I stood at the sink, I could hear snoring from the living room. At first I thought it was the dog. Then I realised it wasn\u2019t. I went into the room to find a stranger asleep on the sofa. He was wearing a grey Adidas tracksuit and, bizarrely, only one shoe. I stood there in my shorts and T-shirt, staring at him.\u2019 \u2018Why didn\u2019t he help those little boys?\u2019: how George Pell failed the children of Ballarat \u2018He did know, the commission\u2019s unredacted report found. It was \u201cimplausible\u201d other senior figures kept Pell in the dark about the offending of Ridsdale and others, the report said. Pell told the royal commission in 2016 that when he did eventually learn of Ridsdale\u2019s abuse of children, it was \u201ca sad story and it wasn\u2019t of much interest to me\u201d. Pell accompanied Ridsdale to court in his first appearance in 1993. Ridsdale remains in jail, and is believed to have offended against children hundreds of times.\u2019 #IRunWithMaud: thousands of runners pay tribute to Ahmaud Arbery \u2018The idea for a global run in Arbery\u2019s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running. Now, the hashtag #IRunWithMaud has travelled the world, with runners from London to New York completing the 2.23-mile trip \u2013 a tribute to the date of his death, which occurred on 23 February.\u2019 The Life and Times of Malcolm McLaren review \u2013 fallouts and fabulous disasters \u2018\u201cTo be bad is good, because to be good is simply boring,\u201d the formidable Rose Corr\u00e9 Isaacs would tell her grandson, Malcolm McLaren, a mantra that he would live by. As Paul Gorman\u2019s mammoth biography illustrates, McLaren was never boring, but he could be a dreadful pain in the arse.\u2019 David Sedaris: \u2018Alan Bennett\u2019s Talking Heads is pretty much the best thing ever\u2019 \u2018The book that changed my life? Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Breakfast of Champions. A friend read it out aloud to me when we were hitchhiking across America in 1976, and it made me think: \u201cThat\u2019s right \u2013 books!\u201d After high school I had forgotten about them. As soon as I got a stable address, I secured a library card, and started making up for lost time.\u2019 Saturday The real Lord of the Flies: what happened when six boys were shipwrecked for 15 months \u2018I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life Lord of the Flies.\u2019 Could Assad row with cousin tear down Syrian regime? \u2018A defiant tyrant and his ruthless wife square up against the family oligarch, with the spoils of a nation at stake. It could be standard Ramadan television fare, but not this year. Instead, all the intrigue of Syria\u2019s ruling family has been laid out in a spectacular real-life drama that has gripped the country and the region.\u2019 \u2018Every stone will be uncovered\u2019: how Georgia officials failed the Ahmaud Arbery case \u2018In the days and weeks after Ahmaud Arbery was shot and killed, multiple Glynn county law enforcement officials failed to thoroughly investigate his death and, in one case, refused to allow police officers to make arrests, the Guardian has learned.\u2019 Tim Dowling: can I turn myself into St Francis of Assisi? \u2018\u201cHow\u2019s your other project going?\u201d She is referring to my long-term goal to get the birds of the air to land on me, as if I were St Francis of Assisi. This involves sitting very still in the garden for long periods, with a crossword puzzle and a little pile of seed on each knee.\u2019 Blind date: \u2018I\u2019d had quite a lot to drink and broke into song\u2019 \u2018First impressions? Is this a person being held against their will? He was sitting in a dimly lit room that looked a bit like a scene in Homeland. Once he turned on the light, I could see he was handsome.\u2019 Sunday A century on, whatever happened to Labour\u2019s firebrand lost leader? \u2018What he discovered, and recorded in a recently updated biography, remains one of the most remarkable stories in the history of British politics and one of its biggest unsolved mysteries. For a brief period at the start of the last century, while still in his twenties, Victor Grayson became the most famous socialist in England and a potential Labour leader. Then, 100 years ago this September, he vanished without trace.\u2019 What does it take to get really great service in restaurants? \u2018Sometimes terrific service is a sleight of hand. It is the magnificent Silvano Giraldin, at Le Gavroche, taking my order with an encouraging grin on his face, his hands clasped behind his back. He is so compelling that I do not notice the commis waiter four feet away listening in and taking my order.\u2019 Hebridean island divided after memoir explores darker fringe of Highland life \u2018A constant theme is that the magnificent Hebridean landscape has a darker fringe. Calidas describes continuing intimidation and abuse at the hands of some islanders. They object to her presence on the croft as an outsider, as English, as of mixed heritage and, later, as a single woman daring to work the land like a man.\u2019 Apropos of Nothing review \u2013 Woody Allen\u2019s times and misdemeanours \u2018This is a horrible, painful and, above all, highly opaque story, and it always will be \u2013 up to, and including, the day it is inevitably mentioned in the first paragraph of a long newspaper obituary.\u2019 Oligarch\u2019s wife brings son into high-stakes divorce case \u2018Attempts to secure the assets awarded following Britain\u2019s biggest, bitterest marital breakup may hinge on how the high court views an arcane financial practice dating back to feudal times.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

      "body": "<p>Existing drugs may help us get through the coronavirus pandemic while we wait for a vaccine, but high pricing by pharmaceutical companies will probably mean that, even if these drugs are proven to be effective, many sick people will still be prevented from getting treatment.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://viruseradication.com/journal-details/Minimum_costs_to_manufacture_new_treatments_for_COVID-19/\">study</a> published this month in the Journal of Virus Eradication looked at nine of the drugs that have been identified as possible Covid-19 treatments and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. The team of researchers looked at how much each of the drugs is sold for in countries where data was available. Then they calculated what a generic version of these drugs might cost.</p> <p>For example, a course of sofosbuvir (a drug currently used to treat hepatitis C) costs around $5 to make but the current list price in the US is $18,610.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91bb97a549ceb6b376a8e97a93ade4227765da34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91bb97a549ceb6b376a8e97a93ade4227765da34/0_0_4724_4134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sofosbuvir prices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"875\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pirfenidone, a drug used for lung fibrosis, costs around $31 for a 28-day treatment course. In the US, a course is priced at $9,606, or $6,513 if patients are able to access it through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Though the US tops the list, the list price of this drug is still expensive elsewhere - a course costs $2,561 in the UK and $2,344 in France.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"941399d606bea4470ebf76307ad66cfa2ff5750e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/941399d606bea4470ebf76307ad66cfa2ff5750e/0_0_4724_4134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pirfenidone prices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"875\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Pharmaceutical companies often defend their pricing by claiming that their costs are incredibly high. However, when calculating the price of a generic version of the drug, the researchers factored in export costs, taxes and even a 10% profit margin.</p> <p>In some cases, pharmaceutical companies have minimized their costs by receiving government subsidies. Take <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/remdesivir-the-antiviral-drug-is-being-touted-as-a-possible-coronavirus-treatment-but-will-it-work\">remdesivir</a>, a drug which has been touted by the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, a claim later <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1798\">tempered</a> in the British Medical Journal, where researchers expressed the need for caution about the drug\u2019s efficacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df3fd1c40bf8ed50554d51fa26a4864b9592df14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df3fd1c40bf8ed50554d51fa26a4864b9592df14/0_0_4724_4134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chloroquine prices\" width=\"1000\" height=\"875\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Gilead Sciences, the company that makes remdesivir, benefited from at least <a href=\"https://www.keionline.org/wp-content/uploads/KEI-Briefing-Note-2020_1GS-5734-Remdesivir.pdf\">$79m</a> in US government funding.

      "bodyText": "Existing drugs may help us get through the coronavirus pandemic while we wait for a vaccine, but high pricing by pharmaceutical companies will probably mean that, even if these drugs are proven to be effective, many sick people will still be prevented from getting treatment. A study published this month in the Journal of Virus Eradication looked at nine of the drugs that have been identified as possible Covid-19 treatments and are in various stages of clinical trials globally. The team of researchers looked at how much each of the drugs is sold for in countries where data was available. Then they calculated what a generic version of these drugs might cost. For example, a course of sofosbuvir (a drug currently used to treat hepatitis C) costs around $5 to make but the current list price in the US is $18,610. Pirfenidone, a drug used for lung fibrosis, costs around $31 for a 28-day treatment course. In the US, a course is priced at $9,606, or $6,513 if patients are able to access it through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Though the US tops the list, the list price of this drug is still expensive elsewhere - a course costs $2,561 in the UK and $2,344 in France. Pharmaceutical companies often defend their pricing by claiming that their costs are incredibly high. However, when calculating the price of a generic version of the drug, the researchers factored in export costs, taxes and even a 10% profit margin. In some cases, pharmaceutical companies have minimized their costs by receiving government subsidies. Take remdesivir, a drug which has been touted by the US government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, a claim later tempered in the British Medical Journal, where researchers expressed the need for caution about the drug\u2019s efficacy. Gilead Sciences, the company that makes remdesivir, benefited from at least $79m in US government funding. Despite the fact that US taxpayers have helped to develop the drug, Gilead announced it would no longer provide emergency access to it. Then, after widespread criticism, the company announced this week it would donate its entire stockpile of the drug to government. In late March, the Food and Drug Administration gave Gilead \u201corphan\u201d drug status, meaning the company has the right to profit exclusively for seven years from the sale of remdesivir. Normally, this drug status is reserved for treating rare diseases, not ones such as as Covid-19, for which more than 1 million people in the US have tested positive (and many more have been infected but not tested). Gilead, which made $5bn in profit last year, has close ties to the US administration. Between 2011 and 2017, Joe Grogan lobbied for Gilead. He now serves on the White House coronavirus taskforce. Speaking on the phone after a shift at a London hospital, one of the study\u2019s authors, Dr Jacob Levi, explained: \u201cThere has been a long history of big pharmaceutical companies charging unnecessary and unwarranted high prices for medications, even if they actually spent very little on research and development for that medication.\u201d Levi added: \u201cThat\u2019s been extremely common with infectious disease medications in the past, like hepatitis and HIV, and we can\u2019t let it happen with medications for Covid-19.

Because when you\u2019re in lockdown with a small child it\u2019s the most intense. You can run through all your tricks and it\u2019s still only 9am.

You should do certain things at set times \u2013 it can give a lovely sense of rhythm and ritual to your day, otherwise you might feel you\u2019re living in a weird delirium. Routine creates a type of hammock you can rest in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another tip: give your fellow lockdowners, be they children or adults, space to grow and change. \u201cSome people at the outset maybe enjoyed cocooning together but three weeks later one wants to go for a walk on their own listening to music.

Children cycle through interests and moods so quickly \u2013 it can seem like months and it\u2019s not even lunchtime.\u201d One lesson from writing Room was that a family unable to leave home needed to find a daily rhythm, she said. \u201cThe rules are not set by social interaction any more. You should do certain things at set times \u2013 it can give a lovely sense of rhythm and ritual to your day, otherwise you might feel you\u2019re living in a weird delirium. Routine creates a type of hammock you can rest in.\u201d Another tip: give your fellow lockdowners, be they children or adults, space to grow and change. \u201cSome people at the outset maybe enjoyed cocooning together but three weeks later one wants to go for a walk on their own listening to music. Being flexible is important.\u201d Donoghue said she felt privileged being able to enjoy outdoor walks and order food online, unlike Ma or many real families mired in poverty. \u201cThere are lots of situations that keep people in a room counting the cans.\u201d The pandemic forced the cancellation of Room\u2019s North American theatrical debut \u2013 Donoghue has adapted it for the stage \u2013 but injected unexpected currency to her new novel. The Pull of the Stars, to be published by Picador in July, is about a nurse, a doctor and a volunteer helper who care for patients in a Dublin maternity hospital during the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed tens of millions. Donoghue started it in 2018 and finished last October, months before the Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cI\u2019d no idea what was coming. I didn\u2019t realise this would be a big deal until March. As soon as I realised that a pandemic was happening I was a bit sheepish that people might think I threw this novel together in a few weeks to capitalise.\u201d The sense of a modern urban plague drew her to the story. \u201cThis was people going to work on the tram trying to not cough on each other.\u201d Admirable healthcare workers doing their job was not a bland storyline when random death surrounded them, said Donoghue. \u201cMy characters can afford to joke and be good to each other because the next moment they could be choking on their own sputum.\u201d Fictional accounts of apocalypse tended to overdo the panic and people behaving badly, said Donoghue. \u201cOf course there is bad behaviour but in times of extreme danger people\u2019s natural goodness does show.\u201d Coronavirus was forcing people apart but social subtleties and good manners endured, she said. \u201cHere we may cross the road to avoid each other but we still do a nod and a bow.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Everything from the nightly news to emails from an online store we ordered an appliance from five years ago is desperate to tell us about the \u201cunprecedented times\u201d we are living in. There is little to calm the simmering sense of chaos we are faced with. But one of the best and perhaps most unexpected salves has been Gogglebox.</p> <p>In the absence of friends and family with whom to digest the news (or the latest Netflix drama), we can instead turn to the nation\u2019s televised viewers for a dose of common sense, and watch friends and families watching TV together. Favourites like caravanning best friends Jenny and Lee with their forever-shocked faces at whatever it is they are viewing, kindly father and sons the Siddiquis, caustically witty siblings Pete and Sophie, or the dog-loving Mancunian Malone family.</p> <p>Watching this bunch make sense of the week\u2019s events increasingly feels like the only way we can come to terms with them too. They are becoming the nation\u2019s irascible and comforting conscience \u2013 with their prescient takedown of Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/gogglebox-coronavirus-boris-johnson-speech-channel-4-9497696\">recently going viral</a> \u2013 and they owe much of their identity to the original Gogglebox duo: June and Leon Bernicoff. No wonder then that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/08/gogglebox-favourite-june-bernicoff-dies-aged-82\">the news of June\u2019s death</a> last week felt like a hammer blow to so many.</p> <p>The Bernicoffs were the first couple to be cast on the show before it began airing in 2013, after researchers found Leon at his local bridge club. When Leon died in 2017, June left the show. On Friday, 82-year-old June also passed away. The Liverpudlian couple quickly captured the nation\u2019s hearts with their matching armchairs and eminently loving 60-year relationship \u2013 expressed on multiple occasions by Leon\u2019s cheeky references to their active love life.</p> <p>In an era of scripted reality TV and manufactured drama, Leon and June\u2019s conversation was frank and free-flowing, ranging from Leon\u2019s scathing attacks on the nation\u2019s various politicians \u2013 calling David Cameron <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=15&amp;v=AzfbEymarns&amp;feature=emb_title\">a \u201cfat-faced Tory\u201d</a> and Nigel Farage a \u201cdickhead\u201d \u2013 to June\u2019s sweet misunderstandings of terminology, thinking \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TopTrevor/status/1258801431202738177\">friends with benefits</a>\u201d was about pals claiming unemployment support together, and their struggles with technology, especially on one occasion where Leon painstakingly spelled out his name while dialling in a donation to Sport Relief.</p> <p>The most endearing facet of their on-screen presence was their unvarnished authenticity. Watching Leon and June was like watching our own grandparents making sense of the world now, attempting to get to grips with its technology and providing a calmingly watchful eye over all its proceedings.

      "bodyText": "Everything from the nightly news to emails from an online store we ordered an appliance from five years ago is desperate to tell us about the \u201cunprecedented times\u201d we are living in. There is little to calm the simmering sense of chaos we are faced with. But one of the best and perhaps most unexpected salves has been Gogglebox. In the absence of friends and family with whom to digest the news (or the latest Netflix drama), we can instead turn to the nation\u2019s televised viewers for a dose of common sense, and watch friends and families watching TV together. Favourites like caravanning best friends Jenny and Lee with their forever-shocked faces at whatever it is they are viewing, kindly father and sons the Siddiquis, caustically witty siblings Pete and Sophie, or the dog-loving Mancunian Malone family. Watching this bunch make sense of the week\u2019s events increasingly feels like the only way we can come to terms with them too. They are becoming the nation\u2019s irascible and comforting conscience \u2013 with their prescient takedown of Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic recently going viral \u2013 and they owe much of their identity to the original Gogglebox duo: June and Leon Bernicoff. No wonder then that the news of June\u2019s death last week felt like a hammer blow to so many. The Bernicoffs were the first couple to be cast on the show before it began airing in 2013, after researchers found Leon at his local bridge club. When Leon died in 2017, June left the show. On Friday, 82-year-old June also passed away. The Liverpudlian couple quickly captured the nation\u2019s hearts with their matching armchairs and eminently loving 60-year relationship \u2013 expressed on multiple occasions by Leon\u2019s cheeky references to their active love life. In an era of scripted reality TV and manufactured drama, Leon and June\u2019s conversation was frank and free-flowing, ranging from Leon\u2019s scathing attacks on the nation\u2019s various politicians \u2013 calling David Cameron a \u201cfat-faced Tory\u201d and Nigel Farage a \u201cdickhead\u201d \u2013 to June\u2019s sweet misunderstandings of terminology, thinking \u201cfriends with benefits\u201d was about pals claiming unemployment support together, and their struggles with technology, especially on one occasion where Leon painstakingly spelled out his name while dialling in a donation to Sport Relief. The most endearing facet of their on-screen presence was their unvarnished authenticity. Watching Leon and June was like watching our own grandparents making sense of the world now, attempting to get to grips with its technology and providing a calmingly watchful eye over all its proceedings. Through their years of experience and resolute cheerfulness, they gave us a much-needed antidote to much of the drama and political turmoil they were watching. They were also an example of that rarest of things to see on TV today: a real-life couple who were still in love, decades after they had first met. Just by dint of their weekly appearances and effortlessly playful bickering, they provided a hopeful testament to the existence of a long-lasting relationship. Nowhere was this better expressed than in one poignant Gogglebox scene where the pair were watching the film Gladiator. As Russell Crowe\u2019s character envisions meeting his dead family in heaven, Leon turned to his wife and said \u201cI\u2019d like to think that\u2019s true \u2026 I\u2019d join you always June.\u201d As the nation wipes away our collective tears and the tributes continue to pour in, we are reminded of the real value of reality TV: to show us life reflected in all its joy, sadness and chaotic emotion.

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has suggested the jobkeeper wage subsidy could be \u201cadjusted\u201d to provide more targeted support, as Labor signals it could support trimming the payment for some workers in return for expanded eligibility. Discussions of amending the $130bn program comes as the government restarts early access to superannuation, paused over the weekend to make integrity improvements after an alleged fraud, and Labor\u2019s plan to reverse changes to consultation on workplace pay deals appears to have fallen flat due to opposition from One Nation. The jobkeeper program currently supports 5m workers, despite having capacity to help 6m, which has added to Labor and union calls to expand the payment to 1m casuals with 12 months or less service with the one employer and 1.1m temporary visa workers. After the prime minister refused to rule out changes to the payment on Friday, news.com.au has reported Treasury is considering options including retargeting the payment at specific industries or scrapping the flat rate, which has allowed some workers who usually earn less than $1,500 a fortnight to receive more from the subsidy than their wages. Asked about potential changes on Monday, Morrison warned against speculation, given \u201cwe\u2019re six weeks into a six-month program\u201d. \u201cHow that program can be adjusted to provide better support over that period, or if there are sectors that come under strain over a longer period of time, these are all things the government is fully aware of,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. Morrison said the government might also have to adjust the wage subsidy and jobseeker unemployment benefits \u201cbased on advice and the strength of the economy and how many people we are getting back to jobs\u201d. Employer groups have not yet been consulted on possible changes, but are wary that scrapping the flat rate of $1,500 per worker a fortnight may restore the incentive for employees to return to work but lose the simplicity of its design. The Australian Tax Office currently requires only the number of eligible employees claiming the payment at each business, but scaling back the payment for workers who usually earn less than $1,500 a fortnight would require employers reporting employees\u2019 hours and verification from the ATO. But Labor signalled it is open to discussing the option. Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, Tony Burke, told Guardian Australia: \u201cWe called for the government to subsidise wages, not multiply them. From day one we\u2019ve said the scheme should be better targeted, so that the people who really need it can get it but we don\u2019t waste taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that a single woman working to support three children misses out because she\u2019s only been in her casual job for 11 months, but a uni student who lives at home and works a few hours a week for pocket money gets a massive pay rise. \u201cLabor will consider any proposals to better target the scheme so that it reaches more people who need it.\u201d The debate over the program\u2019s design comes amid claims some employers have taken advantage of the program, while other eligible workers remain locked out of the subsidy. Victorian Trades Hall Council\u2019s JobScammer website has received more than 400 complaints from workers about potential rorting of the scheme, the union peak body said. Luke Hilakari, the VTHC secretary, said the complaints included serious claims such as bosses breaching the scheme\u2019s rules by refusing to pay the subsidy in full or demanding workers increase their usual hours to the value of $1,500 a fortnight. Other businesses had been accused \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d which employess to include in what is supposed to be a \u201cone-in, all-in\u201d scheme, Hilakari said. The complaints relayed to trades hall included a childcare company that told workers they would have to increase their hours to earn the $1,500 a fortnight worth of work, and a juice company franchise accused of refusing to backpay staff back to 30 March. Other examples included a major streetwear retailer who was said to have told their casual employees they were ineligible for the subsidy if they had taken any time off. Industrial relations will be top of mind when parliament resumes on Tuesday, as Labor and the Greens are seeking crossbench support to reverse changes allowing employers to ask their employees to vary pay deals with just 24 hours\u2019 notice. Labor appears to have won Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie\u2019s support, but Pauline Hanson told The Sydney Morning Herald on Monday \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with them,\u201d Hanson reportedly said. \u201cLabor is just grabbing at straws here.\u201d If One Nation opposes the disallowance, it will fail, allowing the shortened timeframe for consultation to stand. On Monday the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, announced that the early access to superannuation scheme, allowing $10,000 to workers in distress this financial year and next, had been resumed. \u201cThe ATO has identified a small number of third parties who could be susceptible to criminal activity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ATO is working with these third parties to help them make security enhancements. \u201cAdditional risk filters will also be applied by the ATO on all files before they are delivered to funds, and additional information will be provided to funds to assist them in discharging their own obligations to apply fraud prevention processes.\u201d So far more than 1.2m workers have applied to access more than $10bn of their retirement savings.",

Now city authorities are using coronavirus to kickstart plans to reduce the dominance of the car, by creating cycle lanes and \u201cslow streets\u201d that give pedestrians priority.</p> <p>After traffic plunged as a result of home working, Brussels is creating 25 miles (40km) of bike lanes, including on some of the busiest arteries that connect the <a href=\"https://www.introducingbrussels.com/european-district\">European district</a> to the heart of the city.</p> <p>From Monday the entire historic city centre has been turned into slow streets, where cars are limited to 20km an hour and must give priority to pedestrians and cyclists.</p> <p>The idea is to give more space to city dwellers at a time when everyone is meant to keep a distance of 1.5 metres. Planners hope to reduce pavement conflicts between joggers, walkers and shoppers queuing in streets to get into supermarkets, bakeries and newsagents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a539f38f8394aacc299daf0a5cb999834870766c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a539f38f8394aacc299daf0a5cb999834870766c/0_604_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A road sign is installed in the city centre to indicate pedestrians and cyclists are the priority road users\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A road sign is installed in the city centre to indicate pedestrians and cyclists are the priority road users.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThese are temporary measures to react to the crisis,\u201d said the Brussels mobility minister, Elke Van den Brandt.

      "bodyText": "Traffic jams, pretty squares used as car parks, bike lanes that vanish into congested roundabouts: Brussels\u2019s love affair with the car has been waning for several years. Now city authorities are using coronavirus to kickstart plans to reduce the dominance of the car, by creating cycle lanes and \u201cslow streets\u201d that give pedestrians priority. After traffic plunged as a result of home working, Brussels is creating 25 miles (40km) of bike lanes, including on some of the busiest arteries that connect the European district to the heart of the city. From Monday the entire historic city centre has been turned into slow streets, where cars are limited to 20km an hour and must give priority to pedestrians and cyclists. The idea is to give more space to city dwellers at a time when everyone is meant to keep a distance of 1.5 metres. Planners hope to reduce pavement conflicts between joggers, walkers and shoppers queuing in streets to get into supermarkets, bakeries and newsagents. \u201cThese are temporary measures to react to the crisis,\u201d said the Brussels mobility minister, Elke Van den Brandt. But the seeds were planted in a mobility plan drawn up after Green parties made big gains in last year\u2019s city-region elections. While details will change once the pandemic is under control, Van den Brandt, one of three Greens with a key role in the city government, wants the move to a more pedestrian and bike-friendly city to be permanent. \u201cIt is really important that we step into the 21st century.

It\u2019s been several hours since then and I haven\u2019t gotten the results. I don\u2019t know when they\u2019re supposed to come. Hopefully it will be soon, so I can stop wondering. I have to say, overall, I\u2019m feeling fairly positive about my cancer treatment. This week I had my last external radiation and chemotherapy appointment. And today, after I lay in the MRI for 40 minutes, my doctor let me know that he could no longer see the tumor. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone. Different doctors see different things and anyway, I have kind of a strange cervix that may make it more difficult to spot. But it is a good sign. When I first came to the doctor for my diagnosis in February, the tumor was so big that they could even spot it during the pelvic screening. So, it\u2019s certainly not time to start calling myself cancer-free or planning a post-pandemic celebration. But I am going to lean on this piece of positive news and hope it helps me get through tonight and tomorrow\u2019s procedure.",

The ball pool was dreamed up by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/12/chloe-lamford-stage-designs-in-pictures\">Chloe Lamford</a>, to represent the online world in Tim Price\u2019s hacktivist play, Teh Internet Is Serious Business, in 2014.

It is the focal point of the artist <a href=\"http://hesterchillingworth.com/\">Hester Chillingworth</a>\u2019s inspired installation, entitled Caretaker, which will be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hZI5XYdb5E&amp;feature=emb_title\">streamed on YouTube</a> for the duration of the shutdown. A static camera in the balcony is focused on the stage and the rest is silence, apart from a few surprise messages, delivered as tannoy-style announcements.

It\u2019s particularly strange to see one you\u2019ve visited so many times completely empty.

Around 80% of Europe\u2019s 10 million Roma live in densely populated neighbourhoods and overcrowded houses, and many do not have access to running water. This means the basic distancing and sanitary measures required to combat the spread of the virus are more difficult.

Only 33 states report nursing home-related deaths.</p> <p>\u201cI was on a phone call last week, where four or five patients came into our hospital just in one day from nursing homes,\u201d said infectious disease specialist Dr Sunil Parikh, of Yale School of Public Health in Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s just a staggering number day to day.\u201d</p> <p>Despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/were-living-in-fear-why-us-nursing-homes-became-incubators-for-the-coronavirus\">early warnings that nursing homes were vulnerable to Covid-19</a>, because of group living settings and the age of residents, the federal government is only beginning to gather national data.</p> <p>In Connecticut, 194 of 216 nursing homes have had at least one Covid-19 case. Nearly half the Covid-19 deaths in the state \u2013 more than 1,200 people \u2013 have been of nursing home residents. The proportion is higher elsewhere. In New Hampshire, 72% of deaths have been nursing home residents.</p> <p>Parikh said limited testing and a lack of personal protective equipment such as masks hampered efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 in care homes. Due to limited testing capacity, most state nursing homes are still only able to test residents with symptoms, even though the disease is known to spread asymptomatically.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I would like to see is the ability to test the entire nursing homes,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cThis symptomatic approach is just not cutting it. Many states, including Connecticut, are starting to move in that direction \u2026 but I hope it becomes a national effort.\u201d</p> <p>Nursing homes have been closed to the public for weeks but a bleak picture has nonetheless emerged. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy called in 120 members of the state national guard to help <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2020/05/07/murphy-deploys-120-national-guard-troops-to-new-jerseys-long-term-care-facilities-1283044\">long-term care facilities</a>, after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/nyregion/coronavirus-nj-nursing-home-andover.html\">17 bodies</a> piled up in one nursing home.</p> <p>In Maine, a 72-year-old woman who went into a home to recover from surgery died just a few months later, in the state\u2019s largest outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cI feel like I failed my mom because I put her in the wrong nursing home,\u201d the woman\u2019s daughter, Andrea Donovan, told the <a href=\"https://bangordailynews.com/2020/05/08/news/augusta/she-was-in-maines-largest-covid-19-outbreak-but-tested-negative-then-she-tested-positive-and-died/\">Bangor Daily News</a>. \u201cThis facility is responsible for so much sadness for this family for not protecting their residents.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen states have moved to shield nursing homes from lawsuits, according to <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/legal/faced-20000-dead-care-homes-seek-shield-lawsuits?utm_source=modern-healthcare-covid-19-coverage&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20200503&amp;utm_content=article2-headline\">Modern Healthcare</a>.</p> <p>Nursing home residents were among the first known cases of Covid-19 in the US. In mid-February in suburban Kirkland, Washington, 80 of 130 residents in one facility were sickened by an unknown respiratory illness, later identified as Covid-19.</p> <p>Statistics from Kirkland now appear to tell the national story. Of 129 staff members, visitors and residents who got sick, all but one of the 22 who died were older residents, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>By early March, most Covid-19 deaths in the US could still be traced to Kirkland.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing stands out as the virus spreads throughout the United States: nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are ground zero,\u201d wrote Dr Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC, for <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/08/health/coronavirus-nursing-homes-frieden-analysis/index.html\">CNN</a> on 8 March.</p> <p>That day, Frieden called on federal authorities to ban visitors from nursing homes. US authorities announced new measures to protect residents <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-measures-protect-nursing-home-residents-covid-19\">several days</a> later.</p> <p>The CDC investigation into Kirkland was released on 18 March.

      "bodyText": "Residents of nursing homes have accounted for a staggering proportion of Covid-19 deaths in the US, according to incomplete data gathered by healthcare researchers. Privately compiled data shows such deaths now account for more than half of all fatalities in 14 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Only 33 states report nursing home-related deaths. \u201cI was on a phone call last week, where four or five patients came into our hospital just in one day from nursing homes,\u201d said infectious disease specialist Dr Sunil Parikh, of Yale School of Public Health in Connecticut. \u201cIt\u2019s just a staggering number day to day.\u201d Despite early warnings that nursing homes were vulnerable to Covid-19, because of group living settings and the age of residents, the federal government is only beginning to gather national data. In Connecticut, 194 of 216 nursing homes have had at least one Covid-19 case. Nearly half the Covid-19 deaths in the state \u2013 more than 1,200 people \u2013 have been of nursing home residents. The proportion is higher elsewhere. In New Hampshire, 72% of deaths have been nursing home residents. Parikh said limited testing and a lack of personal protective equipment such as masks hampered efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 in care homes. Due to limited testing capacity, most state nursing homes are still only able to test residents with symptoms, even though the disease is known to spread asymptomatically. \u201cWhat I would like to see is the ability to test the entire nursing homes,\u201d Parikh said. \u201cThis symptomatic approach is just not cutting it. Many states, including Connecticut, are starting to move in that direction \u2026 but I hope it becomes a national effort.\u201d Nursing homes have been closed to the public for weeks but a bleak picture has nonetheless emerged. In New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy called in 120 members of the state national guard to help long-term care facilities, after 17 bodies piled up in one nursing home. In Maine, a 72-year-old woman who went into a home to recover from surgery died just a few months later, in the state\u2019s largest outbreak. \u201cI feel like I failed my mom because I put her in the wrong nursing home,\u201d the woman\u2019s daughter, Andrea Donovan, told the Bangor Daily News. \u201cThis facility is responsible for so much sadness for this family for not protecting their residents.\u201d Fifteen states have moved to shield nursing homes from lawsuits, according to Modern Healthcare. Nursing home residents were among the first known cases of Covid-19 in the US. In mid-February in suburban Kirkland, Washington, 80 of 130 residents in one facility were sickened by an unknown respiratory illness, later identified as Covid-19. Statistics from Kirkland now appear to tell the national story. Of 129 staff members, visitors and residents who got sick, all but one of the 22 who died were older residents, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). By early March, most Covid-19 deaths in the US could still be traced to Kirkland. \u201cOne thing stands out as the virus spreads throughout the United States: nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are ground zero,\u201d wrote Dr Tom Frieden, the former head of the CDC, for CNN on 8 March. That day, Frieden called on federal authorities to ban visitors from nursing homes. US authorities announced new measures to protect residents several days later. The CDC investigation into Kirkland was released on 18 March. It contained another warning: \u201cSubstantial morbidity and mortality might be averted if all long-term care facilities take steps now to prevent exposure of their residents to Covid-19.\u201d It was not until 19 April that the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promised to track all deaths in nursing homes. That requirement went into effect this Friday, but there is still a two-week grace period for compliance. During the period from 19 April to 8 May, 13,000 people died, according to an NBC News analysis. \u201cThis is really decimating state after state,\u201d said Parikh. \u201cWe have to have a very rapid shift [of focus] to the nursing homes, the veteran homes \u2026 Covid will be with us for many months.\u201d",

He says his mother encouraged him to leave Burco, the Somali city where he grew up, when he was 15. Getting to Greece took seven months, after he flew out of Somalia to Kenya and from there on to Turkey. For almost two years he has languished on Lesbos. Part of that time was spent in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/moria-refugee-camp-doctors-story-lesbos-greece\">appalling conditions of Moria</a>, Europe\u2019s biggest refugee camp, where lone children live in designated areas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve learned to live alone. I\u2019ve learned to be alone, but all the time I think about my family,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to leave because I was afraid for my life. I haven\u2019t seen my family for two years.</p> <p>\u201cI want to speak with my mother and brothers and sisters. I don\u2019t know where they are but I hope my uncle can help. He lives in London.

Of those, about 300 are kept in police cells and detention centres in what authorities call \u201cprotective custody\u201d but which Human Rights Watch has slammed as an \u201cabusive practice\u201d that exposes minors to brutal treatment in unsanitary and degrading conditions.</p> <p>Between 30-40% of the minors have family members in EU states, according to the UN refugee agency (UNHCR).

It remains unclear what will happen next. While it\u2019s no great surprise that soaps \u2013 just like every other mainstay of British culture \u2013 now exist in a state of uncertainty, their encroaching disappearance from our screens will be tough for those who settle down on the sofa most nights of the week to catch up with what\u2019s happening in soapland.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re like a crutch for people,\u201d says Riley. \u201cTuning-in is like visiting your own family.\u201d And when so many of us are separated from our loved ones, saying goodbye to another batch of familiar faces will be an even more painful loss.</p> <p>For Dan Brocklebank \u2013 better known as Billy Mayhew, the Coronation Street vicar \u2013 that sense of isolation has long been present. Living alone with his two dogs in his Manchester mid-terrace, the actor is already counting the days. He talks for 11-and-a-half minutes uninterrupted after I ask a simple \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p> <p>When he turned 40 in December, Brocklebank set himself a challenge: to renovate his house into a \u201clivable\u201d state. With the downstairs already mostly completed, he has turned his attention to the small yard out the back. It means he has plenty to get on with: painting garden walls and laying down slabs. \u201cThere\u2019s shrubbery arriving today I need to plant despite the fact I don\u2019t know which way the garden faces,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ll just stick it in and hope for the best ... which seems to be a good rule for life anyway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_Brocklebank/status/1257427787121647618\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In celebration of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sue_Cleaver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Sue_Cleaver</a> playing Eileen for a glorious 20 years, the theme in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DansBar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DansBar</a> tonight was Eileen. <a href=\"https://t.co/6xY4D8GCV4\">pic.twitter.com/6xY4D8GCV4</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Brocklebank (@Dan_Brocklebank) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dan_Brocklebank/status/1257427787121647618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 4, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>When he\u2019s not working on his home makeover, Brocklebank is filling his time baking cakes (from a packet), having conversations with his stomach in the shower and entertaining/irritating his neighbours by belting out piano tunes. And after posting a jokey tweet in late March about a night out in at a fictional <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DansBar?src=hashtag_click\">#DansBar</a> in his living room (\u201cThey\u2019re giving away a free glass of prosecco on entry \u2026 as you can see the place is packed\u201d), he and fellow cast and crew have been posting pictures to appreciative fans as they get drunk together on Zoom, dressing up as bunnies or in togas depending on the dress code imposed on the night.</p> <p>As episodes run thin, viewers may well turn to social media as a way of keeping in contact with soap stars and their characters, but Brocklebank hopes the show will find a way to carry on. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been off air for 60 years,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment, people want to cling on to things which feel familiar.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a testament to just how strange our current circumstances are that we\u2019re turning to soaps \u2013 exaggerated and necessarily overly dramatised versions of everyday life \u2013 to remind us of what used to be normal. But having been filmed months in advance, that\u2019s exactly what shows such as Corrie are able to do. Brocklebank sees no way that soaps won\u2019t have to adapt when filming starts again. \u201cWe will have to expect massive changes in the way the building is run if social-distancing rules still apply,\u201d he says. \u201cHow the hell are makeup artists going to do hair and makeup? How can I portray a loving relationship with someone on screen if I can\u2019t go within two metres of them?\u201d</p> <p>There will be more existential questions for the teams of producers, directors and writers. Soaps set out to mirror our here and now: Christmas shows on Christmas; newsworthy events of the day nodded to with clever editing and forward planning. Once lockdown is over, we will no longer be confined to our homes. How soaps acknowledge the long-term impact of coronavirus, without showing it in real time, presents a whole set of challenges. \u201cWe represent social issues reflective of wider society,\u201d says Brocklebank. \u201cWho knows what Weatherfield might look like post-Covid? None of us do. It will change, though, that\u2019s inevitable.\u201d</p> <p>While most soaps offer escapism during a global pandemic, Casualty is doing the opposite, offering a window into the workings of A&amp;E, now more than ever the last place you want to find yourself. But Amanda Mealing \u2013 who has played the consultant Connie Beauchamp in Holby City and Casualty since 2005 \u2013 reckons the world\u2019s attention turning to health and hospitals is bringing more viewers. \u201cThere\u2019s a curiosity from those who might not watch the programme regularly to see how emergency departments work,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are fascinated to see what life is like for doctors and nurses on the frontline.\u201d</p> <p>While for some it seems learning to value NHS workers has been a revelation, for Mealing it is nothing new. With a family full of medics, and plenty of time spent on research trips in hospitals, she hopes that, once this is over, her real-life counterparts will get the recognition and acknowledgment they have always deserved.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e14c1de0ebcbdfe45788fb20153fa0024d7cf68a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e14c1de0ebcbdfe45788fb20153fa0024d7cf68a/0_43_4300_2579/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amanda Mealing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amanda Mealing has been helping to bring vulnerable people their prescriptions. \u2018Quite a few have been taken aback that the doctor from Casualty is delivering their medicine,\u2019 she says.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Rogers/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although not a medical professional, she is doing what she can at home to help the national effort: dusting off her sewing machine to make masks; volunteering to deliver food and prescriptions in her community. \u201cQuite a few have been taken aback that Connie Beauchamp, the doctor from Casualty, is delivering their medicine,\u201d she says with a laugh.</p> <p>Life often feels a little simpler over in Ambridge and, without the need to film, The Archers has found it easier than its televised counterparts to adapt.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has announced the first, gradual steps towards loosening the coronavirus lockdown in England. Below is what has been unveiled, plus some other areas where we are still awaiting details. More information is expected to be put to parliament on Monday, and some areas remain opaque.</p> \n<h2>Return to the workplace if you cannot work from home</h2> \n<p>The most significant immediate change is Johnson formally urging people who cannot work at home - for example in construction - to return to their jobs from Monday. Johnson said such people \u201cshould be actively encouraged to go to work\u201d, while trying to avoid public transport and maintaining physical distancing. While the PM says every workplace should be \u201cCovid-secure\u201d, the plan for more people returning to work will bring fresh warnings from unions about the predicament of staff who feel they are not being kept safe. Unions were sent outline guidance by the government a week ago, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/04/uk-unions-criticise-guidance-on-returning-to-work-for-being-inadequate\">reacted angrily</a>, saying it lacked teeth and could let \u201cbad bosses\u201d force the vulnerable to return to work against their will. It will also be a matter for debate what jobs can and cannot be done from home.</p> \n<h2>Avoid public transport</h2> \n<p>For those going back to work, Johnson said they should avoid crowded public transport and either go by car, \u201cor even better by walking or bicycle\u201d. The latter advice follows on from the announcement on Saturday by Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, of new powers for councils to widen pavements and create new cycle lanes to boost active, socially-distanced travel. The hope is to avoid gridlock in towns and cities where many thousands of people choose to drive to work, but Shapps acknowledged that the capacity of Britain\u2019s transport network will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/back-to-work-capacity-of-transport-network-will-be-down-by-90\">reduced by 90%</a>.</p> \n<h2>Schools in England to reopen for some primary pupils as early as 1 June</h2> \n<p>Johnson confirmed the tentative plan to start opening schools in England, starting with reception and year one (aged four to six) and year six (aged 10-11) in primary school, after the half term at the start of June. This is, however, seen as \u201cthe earliest\u201d it could happen, and will rely on teachers and schools being assured about measures such as proper distancing, which is by no means guaranteed. Unions have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/plan-to-open-schools-on-1-june-in-doubt-as-unions-say-safety-in-doubt\">demanded the rollout</a> of a nationwide testing and contact-tracing scheme and the provision of funding for sufficient PPE before schools reopen. While the hope is for nurseries to open soon, secondary schools are set to return only in September, beyond the \u201cambition\u201d for secondary school students with exams next year to have some time with their teachers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>Restaurants and cafes to remain closed until at least July</h2> \n<p>While some shops could start to reopen with schools, at the start of June, the hospitality industry will need to wait for stage three of the lockdown, in July \u201cat the earliest\u201d, and only if there can be safe social distancing. This will be expected, but is still grim news for an entire sector of the economy struggling to stay afloat, with no real end to the bad news in sight. And it also does not apply to pubs, who have no indication when they can consider opening again. A mention of the hope of opening other \u201cpublic places\u201d \u2013 with no timeline \u2013 could refer to places of worship, or even cinemas that have enabled physical distancing.</p> \n<h2>Unlimited exercise, some sports and meeting one other person outdoors to be allowed from Wednesday</h2> \n<p>As widely expected, people will be formally allowed to go out for exercise more than once a day. In addition, people will be permitted to meet and sit down with one other person, outdoors, if they remain two metres apart. The new rules will start on Wednesday, when people can undertake \u201cunlimited amounts of outdoor exercise\u201d, and sunbathe or drive to destinations for exercise. Sports including angling, swimming in lakes and rivers, tennis and golf will also be allowed, but only within household groups.</p> \n<h2>Quarantine for all airport arrivals \u2018soon\u2019</h2> \n<p>Johnson said it would \u201csoon be the time\u201d to impose quarantine on people coming into the UK.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has announced the first, gradual steps towards loosening the coronavirus lockdown in England. Below is what has been unveiled, plus some other areas where we are still awaiting details. More information is expected to be put to parliament on Monday, and some areas remain opaque. Return to the workplace if you cannot work from home The most significant immediate change is Johnson formally urging people who cannot work at home - for example in construction - to return to their jobs from Monday. Johnson said such people \u201cshould be actively encouraged to go to work\u201d, while trying to avoid public transport and maintaining physical distancing. While the PM says every workplace should be \u201cCovid-secure\u201d, the plan for more people returning to work will bring fresh warnings from unions about the predicament of staff who feel they are not being kept safe. Unions were sent outline guidance by the government a week ago, and reacted angrily, saying it lacked teeth and could let \u201cbad bosses\u201d force the vulnerable to return to work against their will. It will also be a matter for debate what jobs can and cannot be done from home. Avoid public transport For those going back to work, Johnson said they should avoid crowded public transport and either go by car, \u201cor even better by walking or bicycle\u201d. The latter advice follows on from the announcement on Saturday by Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, of new powers for councils to widen pavements and create new cycle lanes to boost active, socially-distanced travel. The hope is to avoid gridlock in towns and cities where many thousands of people choose to drive to work, but Shapps acknowledged that the capacity of Britain\u2019s transport network will be reduced by 90%. Schools in England to reopen for some primary pupils as early as 1 June Johnson confirmed the tentative plan to start opening schools in England, starting with reception and year one (aged four to six) and year six (aged 10-11) in primary school, after the half term at the start of June. This is, however, seen as \u201cthe earliest\u201d it could happen, and will rely on teachers and schools being assured about measures such as proper distancing, which is by no means guaranteed. Unions have also demanded the rollout of a nationwide testing and contact-tracing scheme and the provision of funding for sufficient PPE before schools reopen. While the hope is for nurseries to open soon, secondary schools are set to return only in September, beyond the \u201cambition\u201d for secondary school students with exams next year to have some time with their teachers. Restaurants and cafes to remain closed until at least July While some shops could start to reopen with schools, at the start of June, the hospitality industry will need to wait for stage three of the lockdown, in July \u201cat the earliest\u201d, and only if there can be safe social distancing. This will be expected, but is still grim news for an entire sector of the economy struggling to stay afloat, with no real end to the bad news in sight. And it also does not apply to pubs, who have no indication when they can consider opening again. A mention of the hope of opening other \u201cpublic places\u201d \u2013 with no timeline \u2013 could refer to places of worship, or even cinemas that have enabled physical distancing. Unlimited exercise, some sports and meeting one other person outdoors to be allowed from Wednesday As widely expected, people will be formally allowed to go out for exercise more than once a day. In addition, people will be permitted to meet and sit down with one other person, outdoors, if they remain two metres apart. The new rules will start on Wednesday, when people can undertake \u201cunlimited amounts of outdoor exercise\u201d, and sunbathe or drive to destinations for exercise. Sports including angling, swimming in lakes and rivers, tennis and golf will also be allowed, but only within household groups. Quarantine for all airport arrivals \u2018soon\u2019 Johnson said it would \u201csoon be the time\u201d to impose quarantine on people coming into the UK. This had been widely briefed, with the expectation the quarantine will last for 14 days. However, Johnson did not specify a time limit, and said only it would be in place for people arriving by air. It had been expected that the quarantine would be invoked for everyone apart from freight drivers. Airports and the tourist industry have already voiced major concerns, saying the quarantine will dissuade people from flying. UK is moving from lockdown level four to three under new five-tier system Johnson said the UK (albeit only England for now) was moving from level four to three of a new five-tier lockdown ranking system, with level five being in place if the NHS had been overwhelmed, and level one meaning coronavirus is no longer present. Such a scale is intended to help the public see the long-term strategy behind the slow loosening of rules, and keep them better informed as to what is happening when \u2013 or, in the view of some earlier critics, to start treating them like adults. \u2018Stay Alert\u2019 replaces \u2018Stay Home\u2019 slogan In his address, Johnson gave a formal public debut to the much-briefed, and widely mocked, follow-up slogan to the previous \u201cStay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d. He said the public should \u201cStay alert to control the virus and save lives.\u201d At her earlier press conference, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that she would maintain the advice to stay at home, calling the new slogan \u201cvague and imprecise\u201d. Her warnings were echoed by members of the public. Bigger fines for those flouting the rules The PM announced an increase in the current regime of possible fines for people who break physical distancing rules. Currently, the fine is \u00a360 for a first-time offence, which doubles for each subsequent offence. They could now start at \u00a3100 and double for further offences, up to a maximum of \u00a33,200. Government advisers had previously warned that large fines could disproportionately hit the disadvantaged. What was missing from Johnson\u2019s speech: Expanding the social bubble There has been significant speculation that, with a loosening of restrictions, people might be allowed to combine households with friends or relatives, to expand their socially-limited circle. However, police had warned that enforcing such rules could be hugely difficult, and there was no sign of it in Johnson\u2019s speech. The only concession on this is the idea of meeting one other person outdoors and at a distance. People are still not allowed to visit relatives or friends, with the exception that they can meet one person at a time outdoors while maintaining a 2 metre distance. Advice on wearing face masks or coverings This has been an area of debate for weeks, and while Johnson did not mention face masks, more information is expected on Monday. There is good evidence that suitable quality masks can greatly help prevent people with Covid-19 from spreading it to others, making them useful on public transport or in shops. While many people do wear masks in public, the worry has been whether making them compulsory could restrict supplies for NHS and care staff, and if wearing them might make some people more lax about physical distancing, giving a false sense of assurance. Garden centres and council recycling sites There had been reports these would be singled out as among the earlier businesses or other sites allowed to reopen. However, there was no mention of either in Johnson\u2019s speech.",

      "bodyText": "The US Centers for Disease Control recommends that all Americans wear face masks in public to reduce transmission of Covid-19. Because there are widespread shortages of medical-grade face masks, and leaders and experts agree those should be reserved for healthcare providers, many people are making face masks at home. Jeremy Howard, a University of San Francisco researcher and the co-founder of Masks 4 All, explains how to create your own, with no sewing required. Version one \u2013 the T-shirt facemask: Start with an old T-shirt, preferably 100% cotton \u2013 anything will do, as long as it\u2019s not too thin \u2013 and outline the pattern of the mask. The bottom line should go just beneath the armpits of the shirt. Make sure the part that goes on your face is large enough to cover your nose and mouth. Cut along the lines through both sides of the shirt so that your mask has two layers. Place a safety pin along the bottom and insert a piece of paper towel or coffee filter in between the two layers of the T-shirt. This acts as an additional filter, and rests on top of the safety pin. Secure the mask around the front of your face, covering your nose and mouth. Tie the top straps under the back of your head and the bottom straps at the top of your head. That will ensure a nice fit underneath your chin. By covering your mouth, you have now protected those around you, and the better the fit, the more you\u2019re going to also protect yourself. Version two \u2013 the handkerchief face mask: Start with a handkerchief and two hair ties. Rubber bands are okay as well, although they will be less comfortable. Fold the handkerchief in half, along a horizontal axis, and make a nice crease. Place piece of paper towel or coffee filter at the center of the handkerchief. Fold the top down and the bottom up, so that the coffee filter or paper towel rests in the fold. Place your first elastic about one-third of the way in from the edge of the handkerchief. Place the second elastic one-third of the way in from the other side. The two elastics should be about one hand-width apart. Fold the left side in toward the center and then fold the right side in toward the center, tucking the right side into the left-side flap. Using and taking care of your mask: Don\u2019t wear it at home, and don\u2019t wear it in the car, unless you\u2019re with people outside your regular family group. Don\u2019t wear it more than necessary \u2013 just wear it when you\u2019re in a public place, like a supermarket, where you might be within 6ft of people. It may not be necessary in a park or on a quiet street with few pedestrians, when you\u2019re moving around. Don\u2019t remove the mask until you\u2019re at home or in a place where you can wash your hands and avoid coming within 6ft of other people. When you do remove the mask, avoid touching the front of it in case you breathed in infected droplets that could now be there. Remove and dispose of the paper towel insert. Place the rest of the mask in soapy water, soak it for two minutes, then wash and rinse. Any kind of soap \u2013 dish soap, laundry detergent, hand soap \u2013 will do. Then wash your hands, and disinfect with bleach or alcohol anything you touched after taking off the mask. Never reuse a mask without washing it first. Next time you wear the mask, remember to replace the paper-towel insert. If you have symptoms \u2013 a stuffy nose, a cough, a fever \u2013 stay inside.",

German leaders wonder if they are easing too fast, as the country\u2019s parks fill up and its infection rate appears to accelerate.</p> \n<p>Welcome to the next phase of the coronavirus pandemic. Curves are being flattened in many countries. The harsh lockdowns of the past few months, implemented to prevent healthcare systems from melting down, are gradually being rolled back. The economic and social toll of mass isolation is growing every day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>More lenient regimes, including in France, the UK and Spain, have been greeted with relief. But the basic problem is still with us. An infectious virus is loose in our communities. The more we mix, the more it will spread.</p> \n<p>Scientists are not surprised by the bumps in cases in China, Iran and other places that have relaxed their lockdowns in past weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying, but it is to be expected,\u201d said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading. \u201cIt\u2019s an inevitable consequence of re-allowing social mixing.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the trade off,\u201d said Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland. \u201cThere will be lots of people who are asymptomatic cases or mildly ill people that we don\u2019t detect. So if people come together again, we\u2019re going to see these things happen.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8126ea04-4688-401d-b957-ab95f344f908\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/srWMNUgKXDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Without a vaccine, epidemiologists predict the virus will smoulder for the next few months and possibly years, breaking out as spot-fires around gatherings \u2013 such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/global-report-covid-19-cases-rise-in-germany-as-wuhan-reports-first-infection-in-weeks\">a French funeral</a> being blamed for a new outbreak, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/11/chaotic-and-crazy-meat-plants-around-the-world-struggle-with-virus-outbreaks\">in meat-packing plants</a> in Germany and the US where cases surged last week. Restrictions on our lives are likely to be eased and tightened as new infections ebb and flow.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe new phase will be living with Covid,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI don\u2019t think the idea that you\u2019re going to get complete clearance [of the virus] is realistic. It\u2019s going to be there at a level, and the question is at what level. What community transfer rates are acceptable to society? And what mitigation strategies can you put in place to make these rates as low as possible?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Among those strategies, he says, will need to be widespread and regular testing, the adoption of equipment such as masks as a standard accessory for leaving the home, and \u201cas much social distancing as one can practically do\u201d.</p> \n<p>If the first phase was about protecting lives and healthcare systems, the next will present more thorny questions. \u201cWe want to get people back to work, but there will be a cost,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cAnd ultimately that cost is deaths, because we know as cases go up, so do deaths.\u201d</p> \n<p>These might be the first weeks of the world\u2019s largest ever public health trial. \u201cWe are all watching and learning from each other\u2019s progress,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cThere\u2019s really a playbook being written in every country that we\u2019re learning from. It\u2019s one giant experiment, made up of lots of little experiments in every country, in every jurisdiction.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over time, the list of safer activities is likely to grow. Ideally, societies will get better at managing the risk of things that are unsafe but deemed necessary.</p> \n<p>The past weekend has already given some clues: nightclubs, for example, where people are in close proximity and their inhibitions are lowered by alcohol, seem like an obvious site for mass transmission of disease. Time may prove otherwise.

      "bodyText": "A sudden rise in infections leads to the temporary closure of nightclubs in Seoul. Lebanon tightens the curfew it had earlier relaxed after cases rebound over the weekend. German leaders wonder if they are easing too fast, as the country\u2019s parks fill up and its infection rate appears to accelerate. Welcome to the next phase of the coronavirus pandemic. Curves are being flattened in many countries. The harsh lockdowns of the past few months, implemented to prevent healthcare systems from melting down, are gradually being rolled back. The economic and social toll of mass isolation is growing every day. More lenient regimes, including in France, the UK and Spain, have been greeted with relief. But the basic problem is still with us. An infectious virus is loose in our communities. The more we mix, the more it will spread. Scientists are not surprised by the bumps in cases in China, Iran and other places that have relaxed their lockdowns in past weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s worrying, but it is to be expected,\u201d said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at the University of Reading. \u201cIt\u2019s an inevitable consequence of re-allowing social mixing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s part of the trade off,\u201d said Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland. \u201cThere will be lots of people who are asymptomatic cases or mildly ill people that we don\u2019t detect. So if people come together again, we\u2019re going to see these things happen.\u201d Without a vaccine, epidemiologists predict the virus will smoulder for the next few months and possibly years, breaking out as spot-fires around gatherings \u2013 such as a French funeral being blamed for a new outbreak, or in meat-packing plants in Germany and the US where cases surged last week. Restrictions on our lives are likely to be eased and tightened as new infections ebb and flow. \u201cThe new phase will be living with Covid,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI don\u2019t think the idea that you\u2019re going to get complete clearance [of the virus] is realistic. It\u2019s going to be there at a level, and the question is at what level. What community transfer rates are acceptable to society? And what mitigation strategies can you put in place to make these rates as low as possible?\u201d Among those strategies, he says, will need to be widespread and regular testing, the adoption of equipment such as masks as a standard accessory for leaving the home, and \u201cas much social distancing as one can practically do\u201d. If the first phase was about protecting lives and healthcare systems, the next will present more thorny questions. \u201cWe want to get people back to work, but there will be a cost,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cAnd ultimately that cost is deaths, because we know as cases go up, so do deaths.\u201d These might be the first weeks of the world\u2019s largest ever public health trial. \u201cWe are all watching and learning from each other\u2019s progress,\u201d Mackay said. \u201cThere\u2019s really a playbook being written in every country that we\u2019re learning from. It\u2019s one giant experiment, made up of lots of little experiments in every country, in every jurisdiction.\u201d Over time, the list of safer activities is likely to grow. Ideally, societies will get better at managing the risk of things that are unsafe but deemed necessary. The past weekend has already given some clues: nightclubs, for example, where people are in close proximity and their inhibitions are lowered by alcohol, seem like an obvious site for mass transmission of disease. Time may prove otherwise. Some societies may decide the risk is worth it. Countries that have managed to squash their curve, such as Australia and New Zealand, will potentially provide the most controlled environments and therefore the richest testing grounds, Mackay said. \u201cIn Australia, for example, we are going to see if the people going to the shops this weekend will lead to a rise in cases, and that will inform the entire world.\u201d Some of the difficulties ahead are already coming into focus. In the UK, there is widespread confusion over what exactly has been allowed. Germany, which was spared the worst ravages of the virus, is struggling with how to convince its citizens to adhere to the ongoing restrictions. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d the president of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, reminded his country over the weekend, after announcing the new burst in cases. In countries without a social safety net, the imperative to restart economic life will only grow more intense, and may pressure governments to eventually ditch the experiment altogether. The beginning of the climb out of this pandemic has started in many places, but is likely to be long. \u201cIt continues indefinitely until the rate of transfer is so small that the virus will naturally extinguish, or until it can be pushed down by a vaccine,\u201d Jones said.",

You will emerge bloody and humiliated. You will rue the day you were born. Alison Roman, cookbook author and Slightly Less Famous Person, found this out the hard way over the weekend.</p> <p>For those of you who are spending your lockdown doing more fruitful things than scrolling through Twitter, a quick recap of the decline and fall of the Roman empire. It all started when the 34-year-old did an interview with <a href=\"https://newconsumer.com/2020/05/alison-roman-interview/\">The New Consumer</a> where she said she didn\u2019t aspire to capitalize on her fame by putting out a product line in the same way that Teigen and Marie Kondo, the organizing legend, have.</p> <p>\u201c[W]hat Chrissy Teigen has done is so crazy to me,\u201d Roman said. \u201cShe had a successful cookbook. And then it was like, boom, line at Target. Boom, now she has an Instagram page that has over a million followers where it\u2019s just people running a content farm for her. That horrifies me and it\u2019s not something that I ever want to do.\u201d</p> <p>Roman continued to lose friends and alienate people by calling Kondo a massive hypocrite for telling people to declutter and then selling a branded product line. \u201cI\u2019m like, damn, bitch, you \u2026 just sold out immediately! Someone\u2019s like \u2018you should make stuff\u2019, and she\u2019s like, \u2018OK, slap my name on it, I don\u2019t give a shit!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t know whether Kondo saw this criticism because she has kept a dignified silence about it. It didn\u2019t spark joy so she didn\u2019t engage. Teigen, on the other hand, read the interview and immediately declared that she was not angry, she was just very disappointed.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a huge bummer and hit me hard,\u201d Teigen tweeted on Friday. \u201cI have made [Roman\u2019s] recipes for years now, bought the cookbooks, supported her on social and praised her in interviews. I even signed on to executive produce the very show she talks about doing in this article.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, you read that right. Roman slagged off the woman who is executive producing (AKA helping ensure financial backing) for a TV show she is due to start filming once coronavirus restrictions ease. Not the smartest move. Another not-so-smart move? Throwing stones when you\u2019re quarantining in a glass house. As a million people immediately pointed out on Twitter, it\u2019s a bit rich for Roman to criticize Teigen and Kondo for putting their names on products when, in the very same interview, she breezily talks about the fact that she has a collaboration coming out with the cookware startup Material. Roman has also done <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnt3WSsBtoT/?hl=en\">paid partnerships</a> with brands like J Crew and Madewell so it\u2019s not exactly like she has turned her back on capitalism. But, to be fair, in Roman\u2019s mind, what she\u2019s doing is probably a different, more palatable, sort of capitalism. It\u2019s artisanal Brooklyn capitalism.</p> <p>Over the course of about 36 hours following Teigen\u2019s tweet the internet proceeded to eat Roman alive. She was a hypocrite. A white feminist. She was a racist for singling out two women of colour for criticism while ignoring white influencers like Gwyneth Paltrow. She was a cultural appropriator who whitewashed ethnic recipes. She was a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/coronavirus-karen-memes-reddit-twitter-carolyn-goodman/611104/\">Karen</a>: an entitled white woman who attacked women of colour and then cried \u201cwoe is me\u201d when people called her out for it. She was a woman who didn\u2019t support other women which means there is a special place in hell for her.</p> <p>Some of this criticism is valid and has sparked thoughtful analysis. Roxana Hadadi, for example, wrote a piece about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.pajiba.com/celebrities_are_better_than_you/alison-roman-and-the-exhausting-prevalence-of-ethnic-erasure-in-popular-food-culture.php?utm_source=features&amp;utm_medium=features&amp;utm_campaign=features\">the exhausting prevalence of ethnic erasure in popular food culture</a>\u201d and \u201ccolonialism as cuisine\u201d. One of Roman\u2019s most popular recipes is the Stew which, while extremely delicious, is actually a watered-down curry. It\u2019s infuriating to see your cultural heritage blithely repackaged and monetized by white influencers who don\u2019t want to give any credit to the long history behind their \u201cnew\u201d recipe. It\u2019s exasperating to see people like Roman position themselves as an authority on something like labne, when you grew up feeling embarrassed about eating the \u201cweird\u201d food of your heritage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She became a sacrificial lamb, seasoned with a huge amount of salt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But while some of the criticism lobbied at Roman was valid, a lot of it was also unnecessarily mean. We\u2019ve all been sitting at home stewing and Roman became the target of a lot of pent-up anger and frustration. She became a sacrificial lamb, seasoned with a huge amount of salt.</p> <p>The anger directed at Roman also detracts from the fact that, while it was clumsy and mean-spirited, her disparagement of Teigen speaks to a larger truth about the hollow corporatization of modern food culture. Gabrielle Hamilton, owner of much-loved New York restaurant Prune, recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html\">encapsulated this phenomenon beautifully</a> in a piece for the New York Times.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past 10 years I\u2019ve been staring wide-eyed and with alarm as \u2026 the food world got stranger and weirder to me,\u201d Hamilton wrote. \u201cThe \u2018waiter\u2019 became the \u2018server\u2019 \u2026 what used to be the \u2018customer\u2019 became the \u2018guest\u2019, what was once your \u2018personality\u2019 became your \u2018brand\u2019, the small acts of kindness and the way you always used to have of sharing your talents and looking out for others became things to \u2018monetize\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s the thing about the internet: it has an insatiable appetite. It\u2019ll pick a victim, chew them up, spit them out, and then move on the next target. It seems Teigen is now learning that lesson. After she mobilized Twitter to go after Roman, some of Teigen\u2019s online army (she has 12.7m followers) started to mutiny. It didn\u2019t take long for the discourse about Roman being problematic to pivot to how, actually, Teigen is problematic. Remember that time she called child actor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/josephineoceane/status/1258916260881895424?s=20\">Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis a brat</a>? The internet suddenly decided they couldn\u2019t forget or forgive that. Suddenly the anger directed at Teigen was so acerbic that she locked her Twitter account.</p> <p>There is a moral to all this drama, by the way. The moral is: get off Twitter. Seriously, get off Twitter.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Authorities in South Korea are struggling to contain a new coronavirus outbreak linked to the capital\u2019s nightclub district as a backlash against the country\u2019s gay community increases, prompting fears LGBT people will fail to get tested out of fear of being outed. South Korea had been praised for its innovative efforts to contain the pandemic, going from the second most infected region outside China to having just a handful of cases before the latest outbreak a week ago. But the increasing number of cases related to nightclubs in Seoul is raising concerns about a possible second wave as well as over the high level of deeply entrenched homophobic attitudes in the conservative society. Of 35 new cases, 29 were found to be linked to Itaewon, the capital\u2019s gay district, according to officials from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), bringing the total number of cases related to the clubs to 86. The emergence of the cluster prompted officials to push back the re-opening of schools by one week, with students initially set to return to classes in stages starting Wednesday. Vice-education minister Park Baeg-beom said the delay was \u201cinevitable\u201d in order to guarantee the safety of students. After Kookmin Ilbo, a local media outlet with links to an evangelical church, reported that businesses visited by an infected man over the long weekend were gay clubs, many other South Korean media followed suit, revealing not only the identity of clientele but also some of their ages and the names of their workplaces. The media frenzy reached a new level when another infected man was found to have been to an LGBT sauna in Gangnam, prompting a slew of homophobic content in newspapers and online. Lurid reporting, along with South Korea\u2019s use of the trace and test method, has led to members of the gay community reporting feeling scared to get tested and even suicidal. Officials said 3,112 people who were in the nightclubs were currently not contactable. \u201cI admit it was a huge mistake to visit the gay district when the corona situation was not fully over,\u201d Lee Youngwu , a gay man in his30s, told the Guardian \u201cBut visiting the area is the only time when I can be myself and hang out with others similar to me. During the week, I have to pretend to like women. \u201cMy credit card company told me that they passed on my payment information in the district to the authorities. I feel so trapped and hunted down. If I get tested, my company will most likely find out I\u2019m gay. I\u2019ll lose my job and face a public humiliation. I feel as if my whole life is about to collapse. I have never felt suicidal before and never thought I would, but I am feeling suicidal now.\u201d On Saturday the prime minister, Chung Sye-kyun, urged the public to \u201crefrain from criticising a certain community as it will not help efforts to contain the coronavirus spread\u201d. Lee Jong-geol, the general director of Korean gay men\u2019s human rights group Chingusai, told the Guardian that the group had begun counselling and legal aid services for those affected by the crisis, adding that Seoul city officials asked the group to encourage gay men who had visited the clubs to come forward to get tested. \u201cI understand that civil servants want to find a convenient way to do their jobs but they should realise that South Korea\u2019s gay people do not all belong to one, single group. Civil servants are handling the situation in the same way as the Shincheonji cult situation, but we\u2019re not a cult.\u201d Lee Jae-myung, governor of Gyeonggi province near Seoul, where many of the infected people live, said it would be possible for people to get tested free of charge by only saying they had been to the outbreak area and not having to mention the names of businesses they visited. \u201cIt took me a whole week to get up the courage to get tested,\u201d Min Jaeyoung, 27, told the Guardian, \u201cI had to practise saying \u2018oh, of course I\u2019m not gay\u2019 and even recorded myself several times to sound natural.

      "bodyText": "Alright, so what did we learn from that? Well, not much. Daniel Andrews would not say when students were likely to return to schools in Victoria except that it would be by the end of term two, which he has said previously. Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian said they will consider economic reforms like cutting payroll tax and stamp duty in order to support businesses through the recession caused by the coronavirus, but did not make any solid commitments. They said there was an opportunity for structural economic reform and what form that reform might take was under active consideration. Berejiklian said that \u201cthirteen out of 14 [cruise ship] disembarkments were successful in New South Wales,\u201d it\u2019s just that the 14th was the Ruby Princess. She said that a \u201cmistake-free pandemic is impossible, it would be miraculous\u201d. Annastacia Palaszczuk would not give an indication of when Queensland might lift its hard state border, but said Queenslanders may be able to travel within Queensland in June or July. She would not say when regional areas in Queensland might enjoy more freedom, because there are still people in those areas in quarantine. All three premiers said Australia\u2019s situation could have been much worse and while we were now facing difficult economic times, they were grateful to be grappling with how to reopen the economy rather than coping with tens of thousands of deaths per state. We did not, however, learn to what extend these larger states were able to strong-arm national cabinet and the federal government into following their lead on introducing the shutdown in the first place, and closing schools. That inside story, when told, will be well worth reading. On that note, I\u2019ll say goodnight. You can continue to follow our rolling global coverage here. Stay safe, work on your list of five to 10 visitors (depending on jurisdiction) and we will see you in the morning. Also, if you thought the person asking the first question tonight looked familiar you\u2019d be right. That was Kirsten Armstrong, who is the director of knowledge and innovation at the Fred Hollows Foundation. She is also one of the AFR\u2019s 100 women of influence. The final question was from a man named Corey from New Zealand, asking when he might visit family in Australia. Berejiklian jokes that she may be able to visit Auckland before she can visit Cairns, and says Australia needs to resolve its internal borders before it looks at creating a trans-Tasman bubble. Craig Rowley from Seahome, Victoria asks what Australia\u2019s economic drivers will be if immigration tapers off post-pandemic. Berejiklian says there will be some changes to the economy. She if focusing on manufacturing. What about cutting payroll tax and/or stamp duty to help businesses? She says she is \u201cabsolutely\u201d willing to look at reform in those areas, and also to cut red tape, which is something she was already inclined to do. The treasurer and our team are focused on the opportunities this brings to us to become more efficient. You find you let go of processes which are cumbersome during a pandemic. You forego red tape which is normally part of our lives. Andrews is also asked the payroll tax question, and dodges it. He says there \u201cwill have to be change\u201d. If we assume things go back to the way they were that would be very foolish. ...there\u2019s also a big obligation for us to do things differently. We need to have hopefully for the first time in a long time a mature debate where we argue things on their merits and we don\u2019t get led down these ideological paths, which are usually about cheap politics. He says that national cabinet could be a circuit breaker for the kind of IR reform that Australia has, of late, decided on ideological lines. Rather than the usual old favourites of jack up the GST or let\u2019s cut wages by IR reform, let\u2019s look at IR sensibly. The people of people that don\u2019t have secure working hours and conditions has been exposed through this pandemic. People who don\u2019t know if they have a shift tomorrow until they get the text message at 11pm tonight, they\u2019re some of the most vulnerable. It\u2019s wonderful to see he still has such hope. Next question is about football. Why is the NRL given the green light, when so many people are out of work and unable to work due to coronavirus restrictions? Palaszczuk says the NRL is a workplace. They\u2019ve got to abide by the conditions they\u2019ve put forward and it\u2019s up to the NRL or the respective codes to endorse their plan and make sure it\u2019s adhered to. Andrews says he\u2019ll leave it to the AFL to make its own decisions, but that if it can be done safely there is a net community benefit to the reutnr to sport It\u2019s a big part of the way our country operates and the feedback I get is almost universal, people want to see footy back. I\u2019m pretty confident it will be done safely. Hamish asks Berejiklian about the disruption in her own cabinet. She first answers Nick from Mandurah\u2019s question. I\u2019m we got that question today and \u2014 I\u2019m glad we got that question today and not why thousands had died in New South Wales. That\u2019s where we were heading.We knew by looking at places overseas if we did not take action when we did, we literally would have had thousands of people who would have perished by now already. I\u2019m grateful we\u2019re in this position. Given the other questions raised subsequently, I do feel now the pendulum has to shift. New South Wales is in a position where we do want to get our economy going and we\u2019re looking for the pathway, the safest way to do that. Yes, but what about the issues in cabinet? If it\u2019s not life and death, I don\u2019t worry about it. A man named Merwyn in Queensland (apologies, I missed his last name) asks about former treasurer Jackie Trad resigning over a corruption investigation, and whether management of the pandemic will be set aside as the government manages factional disputes. Palaszczuk says no. She had replacements in cabinet in 48 hours Next question is from Nick Valentine in Mandurah, WA. He says that by this time next year we will have a virus for Covid-19 (that\u2019s a strong maybe), and the road toll will be 10 times higher than the number of lives lost from Covid-19 in Australia. Do the premiers believe it was worth ruining our economy over COVID-19? Andrews is up first. He says it was a tough decision, and no one entered into the decisions lightly, but that if the virus got away from them it would have been \u201cdeadly\u201d. It does also very significant economic damage if it runs wild. There are very big health and economic challenges throughout Europe, the US, the UK. This is a health challenge first and foremost and the best economics is to fix the health problem and then move to repair the inevitable damage, damage that saves lives but it does cost jobs. He says the choice was between repairing economic damage and having tens of thousands of people die. Palaszczuk says that peoples lives have been turned upside down, but \u201cthe initial modelling we had was if we didn\u2019t flatten the curb, in Queensland there could have been 37,000 people who lost their lives\u201d. You only have to look at what\u2019s happening in the US. Thank God we live in Australia and all worked together at the National Cabinet level. If that hadn\u2019t happened, I don\u2019t know where we would be. We have worked collectively together and put people first. She says the focus is now on getting people back to work. Berejiklian says she would prefer to keep a one size fits all approach to restrictions in NSW to \u201cavoid confusion\u201d. The feedback wore getting from our regional communities is that whilst they do rely on tourism for economic uplift, they\u2019re very cautious about welcoming people into their communities because they\u2019re conscious there might be COVID-19-free but that might not always be the case. She says that Victoria and NSW decided not to close their borders because people living in those border communities, like Albury-Wodonga, do not see the distinction between the states so imposing a hard border wouldn\u2019t work. Neither NSW or Victoria are allowing regional travel at this stage. They said they will monitor and allow that travel when they are comfortable. Callan Oar from Ayr in northern Queensland has a question for Palaszczuk. How is it fair that other than a small cluster in Cairns there have a been no known locally acquired infections north of the Fraser Coast, yet we North Queenslanders are subject to the same draconian-type restrictions as the south-east? ...When can we get back to business? Palaszczuk says the lack of any known cases does not mean that there\u2019s no risk in northern Queensland. We have 2,000 people still in quarantine throughout Queensland. Which means they have the potential to have the virus and spread it. We need to be very vigilant and make sure we are getting to clamp down on it as much as possible. She says opening up those regions will depend on the number of people still in quarantine in those areas. Annastacia Palaszczuk is asked when the Queensland border will be reopened. She says that depends on rates of community transmission in NSW and Victoria. But I\u2019ve said very clearly we\u2019re going to review our borders at the end of each month and we\u2019ll take it from there and see how it goes. Hopefully by June and July we\u2019ll be able to have people travelling around Queensland. But it might be a little bit longer before we see our southerners comeback to Queensland. We love you dearly. We want you to come to Queensland but not at the moment. The next questions is from Catherine Kopec in Burwood, Victoria, about the outbreak at Cedar Meats. What will you do to ensure employees, including teachers, are safe to go to work? What will you do to guarantee that employers follow strict guidelines? Andrews says \u201cwe\u2019re going to see further outbreaks\u201d and the key to managing them was a lot of testing and rapid contact tracing. Asked why the government took so long to publicly identify Cedar Meats as the site of an outbreak, Andrews says deciding to identify a place of work as the site of an outbreak is a matter for the public health team. He said there would be \u201clearnings all the way along\u201d in terms of how to appropriately manage localised outbreaks. He praises both the public health team and the abattoir workers. The next question is about Newmarch House aged care home. By allowing sick residents to remain out of hospital and in the residential aged care home, the questioner says, it has increased the risk for healthy residents at the home. How does a sick person\u2019s desire to stay out of hospital override the rights of those who are well and at risk of contracting the virus and even dying? Berejiklian says it\u2019s a \u201cvexed moral and ethical questions\u201d. It would be wrong for politicians to make those decisions. The best health advice we have is it is up to the individual residents and their families on what their preference is for their treatment and about their future. She says that the aged care regulator stepped in to monitor the situation, and repeats that it would be inappropriate for politicians or the national cabinet to step in or override health advice. The health advice says assess the person\u2019s condition and also assess their choice on what their preference is given their condition. It\u2019s not a hard and fast rule for every single person.... We\u2019ve had a number of instances in New South Wales where there have been examples where things have been handled extremely well and others where things have not been handled well. She said the expectation is that everyone who manages an aged care home assumes they are going to have a Covid-19 outbreak and has a plan in place. To the Ruby Princess. Olympia Kwitowsi from Salisbury in Queensland asks Berejiklian why people should be listening to her, given her government let that cruise ship in. Berejiklian makes a quip that Olympia should ask her own premier, is reminded by McDonald that 10% of Australia\u2019s coronavirus cases come from the Ruby Princess. She acknowledges that, and says she does not want to cut across the commission of inquiry or the police investigation. This reply is a bit of a mess. Berejiklian keeps repeating that \u201cthirteen out of 14 disembarkments were successful in New South Wales\u201d. A pity the 14th was the Ruby Princess. I\u2019m not going to promise there won\u2019t be further mistakes. There might be in my state and maybe elsewhere, but we have to pick ourselves up and move forward. A mistake-free pandemic is impossible, it would be miraculous. We take learnings and move forward but I can\u2019t promise there won\u2019t be other mistakes into the future. We need to make sure we have the social distancing and contact tracing in place to protect our citizens as much as possible. Berejiklian is asked why she was confident that students could safely return to school in NSW from this week. She said the advice was the biggest risk was transmission between teachers, and NSW had spent weeks getting PPE and sanitary equipment in schools And just to demonstrate our capacity of preparedness, we extended all of our cleaning contracts. Every school has extra cleaning during the day. Extra provisions in place to mitigate the risk to anybody. Next question is from Tori Hill in Malvern, Victoria. Why can\u2019t kids in Victoria return to school? Andrews is not really able to say why the rules are different on returning to school in Victoria than in NSW or other states, but he says by the end of the term \u201cI think most states will finish up in about the same place.\u201d He says that \u201cevery state\u2019s in a different position\u201d. We took the position and the view that it simply wasn\u2019t a good thing to have a million students going to and from school hundreds of thousands of teachers and parents going to and from school every day. McDonald asks Andrews to tell parents when they might expect to have their kids back in schools in Victoria, so they can plan. Andrews says he won\u2019t announce that on Q&amp;A. We\u2019ll have an announcement soon. As important as this program is, we\u2019ll make announcements for all Victorians at the appropriate time. We\u2019re very close. There\u2019s details that have to be settled about the nature of that staggered return. We can confirm tonight that we will have our kids back to face to face learning before the end of term two. The next question is about the protests that were in Melbourne yesterday, at which 10 people (from a crowd of about 250) were arrested. Andrews says it was an \u201cugly scene\u201d and while he supports peaceful protest, this wasn\u2019t that. If it\u2019s not peaceful, it\u2019s not a proper legitimate protest. We saw police injured. That\u2019s something that we can never accept. This pandemic is very real. If you don\u2019t think theAustralian experience is something that you should trust, if you need to look further afield, turn your TV on and have a look at what\u2019s happening in Europe and America.This is very serious. If it gets away from you, thousands of people will die. Berejiklian: I think the bottomline is to Dan\u2019s point, if you\u2019re out protesting you have to exercise social distancing. I have no issue of what people do when they leave the home as long as they\u2019re within the rules. No matter what you\u2019re up to, even if you\u2019re have a picnic with your best friend, keep the 1.5m. Andrews responds by talking about Victoria\u2019s testing quota, which Hamish says was not the question. Andrews says he was unhappy to see images of a number of people in Victoria at shopping centres potentially buying things they don\u2019t need (how do you know, Dan?). He says we have just one chance to get this right and if he had to, he would tighten the restrictions again. Andrews: If I got advice from our chief health officer... that we no longer had control, things had got to a point where we were going to see a significant spike in cases and our hospital system fundamentally overrun, then of course we\u2019d have to reintroduce some of these sanctions. That\u2019s in our own hands in many ways. If people change their behaviour but keep pace with the rule changes that we are making, continue to follow the rules and continue to get tested, we will have many more options in June and we can gradually open up. The first question is from Kirsten Armstrong in Maroubra, NSW. It\u2019s basically a dixer. We\u2019ve seen images over the weekend of people at shopping centres seemingly unaware social distancing is still important. With significant outbreaks in New South Wales andVictoria, with most states experiencing a re-emergence of new cases this week, it seems almost inevitable we\u2019ll be having some sort of re-emergence of the disease in the next few months. What\u2019s your trigger, what\u2019s your threshold for reintroducing restrictions that you\u2019re lifting this week? Gladys Berejiklian responds first, because it\u2019s her state. I\u2019ll summarise her response, because it\u2019s long and none of it\u2019s new. She says you expect case numbers to rise as you lift some restrictions, cases have fallen significantly since March, it\u2019s all about finding a \u201chealthy balance\u201d, the situation will be monitored to figure out what is manageable over the next few weeks. Are you prepared to go back into lockdown if numbers increase, Hamish asks? Obviously if there are significant outbreaks but we\u2019re hoping that\u2019s not the case. So, we\u2019ve got NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian in the room with host Hamish McDonald and Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on a fancy ABC version of Zoom. I have moved the cat off my lap and am ready to go. Alright, here we go. I have a cup of tea, you might want to go ahead and indulge in something stronger. The bad show will begin shortly. We will be providing live coverage of state premiers Daniel Andrews, Gladys Berejiklian and Annastacia Palaszczuk on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program at 9.30pm. But before we get there, here\u2019s what\u2019s happened today: Victoria announced it would relax its restrictions from midnight tomorrow, allowing people to have up to five visitors in their home and outdoor gatherings of up to 10. Regional daytrips are allowed but not staying overnight. AFL training is resuming from Wednesday. Hugs are still not recommended. Another resident of Newmarch House has died, bringing the death toll at that facility to 17. This resident had tested positive to Covid-19, then tested negative twice before they died. The CovidSafe app now has 5.5 million registered users and is \u201coperational and working\u201d. Scott Morrison has indicated jobkeeper might be \u201cadjusted\u201d to provide more targeted (read: less broad) support. Labor says it may back it if the savings are redirected at workers who missed out. Morrison still doesn\u2019t want to talk about sports rorts. And he says he would be \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d if China\u2019s proposed barley tariffs were in response to Australia\u2019s push for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has laid out his vision for a post-Covid world, saying he doesn\u2019t want things to just snap back. Carnival Cruises\u2019s port operations manager has told the Ruby Princess inquiry that they didn\u2019t implement a 1.5 metre distancing policy between disembarking guests because he \u201cdoes not remember it being a requirement at the time\u201d. Across the ditch, New Zealand has moved to stage two restrictions, meaning schools have reopened, workers are back in offices, and restaurants and shops are reopening. You can follow our rolling global coverage here and read a more detailed summary of the day\u2019s news in Australia here. I\u2019ll see you in an hour or so. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy is currently on ABC\u2019s 7.30 program. It\u2019s a repetition of the lines he said yesterday, and his deputies were saying today. Asked what keeps him awake at night, Murphy says: A large second wave. That is the most worrying thing of all. We saw people behaving really badly and congregating ... If people aren\u2019t careful and we have lots of pockets of outbreaks and widespread community transmission, you know, thousands more cases \u2014 that is what worries me most of all. I don\u2019t think it will happen because I think we are as well prepared as we could be, but it will only work if every citizen does the right thing. The eased restrictions in NSW do not actually come into effect until Friday, but you have been allowed to surf \u2014 where beaches are open \u2014 for some time. \u201cExercise\u201d is not narrowly defined in the public health orders. But it certainly feels less locked down this week, which may or not be a good thing. The problem throughout the lockdown period has not been individuals going to the beach, but crowds, or apparent crowds, at beaches. So you can go to the beach for exercise purposes provided no one else has the same idea. Paul Karp and Luke Henriques-Gomes have been looking into reports the Morrison government is considering \u201cadjusting\u201d the $1,500 jobkeeper payment, just days after the money actually started flowing. And there are reports that some employers are exploiting the scheme. They write: Victorian Trades Hall Council\u2019s JobScammer website has received more than 400 complaints from workers about potential rorting of the scheme, the union peak body said. Luke Hilakari, the VTHC secretary, said the complaints included serious claims such as bosses breaching the scheme\u2019s rules by refusing to pay the subsidy in full or demanding workers increase their usual hours to the value of $1,500 a fortnight. Other businesses had been accused of \u201cpicking and choosing\u201d which employees to include in what is supposed to be a \u201cone-in, all-in\u201d scheme, Hilakari said. The complaints relayed to trades hall included a childcare company that told workers they would have to increase their hours to earn the $1,500 a fortnight worth of work, and a juice company franchise accused of refusing to backpay staff back to 30 March. Other examples included a major streetwear retailer who was said to have told their casual employees they were ineligible for the subsidy if they had taken any time off. In sad news: Forget golf \u2013 Melbourne\u2019s true favourite pastime, purchasing real estate, will be able to resume from Wednesday. And the Real Estate Institute of Victoria is excited. Auctions and open-for-inspections will be restricted to 10 people (significantly reducing rubbernecking) and the REIV is \u201cencouraging\u201d real estate agents and anyone attending an auction or open house to download the Covidsafe app. The app isn\u2019t compulsory, and real estate agents will also be taking people\u2019s contact details for contact tracing purposes. REIV president Leah Calnan said: Online auctions have worked well over the last few weeks and we encourage members to use this as an additional channel for wider engagement. Having public auctions will inspire increased confidence in our economy. Auctioneers across the state are looking forward to getting back to what they do best. Labor\u2019s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, says Australia\u2019s relationship with China is \u201cnot in a great place\u201d. Speaking to ABC TV this afternoon, Wong said the relationship would benefit from \u201cconsistency and discipline and leadership\u201d from the prime minister and foreign minister rather than backbencher-led commentary. Some Coalition backbenchers, including George Christensen and Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, have been pushing for Australia to take a hard line in its relations with China. Wong also called on the government to provide detailed briefings to parliamentarians on how Australia is handling the China relationship: I\u2019ve said previously we need to think about the China relationship in 30-year terms, not in three-year terms. Unfortunately, there\u2019s been a little too much from the Morrison government of a reflex to short-term domestic politics on this relationship and more broadly. And we would urge them to take a long-term position and a responsible position, and as much as possible a bipartisan position, when it comes to that relationship that\u2019s in the national interests. The call comes in the wake of a diplomatic dispute between the two countries over Australia\u2019s call for an international investigation into the origin and handling of Covid-19, which China took to be directed against it. Tensions intensified when China\u2019s ambassador to Australia gave an interview to a newspaper late last month saying Chinese tourists and students may rethink their plans to visit Australia in the future \u201cif the mood is going from bad to worse\u201d, while consumers may also decide against buying Australian wine and beef. The government is currently trying to persuade China not to proceed with plans to impose tariffs on Australian barley imports, with Scott Morrison saying the proposal stems from an 18-month-long process and he doesn\u2019t believe it is connected to the recent inquiry proposal. Cafes and restaurants in South Australia were open to sit-down customers today, for the first time in seven weeks. I say sit down, not sit-in, because customers have to dine alfresco. It\u2019s limited to a maximum of 10 customers. People will not be able to eat indoors at restaurants until June. The SA premier, Steven Marshall, says the change that came into effect today will mainly benefit restaurants that have already switched to take-away service. It won\u2019t be worth it for many organisations. Some states have told us 10 indoor dining and the industry told us 10 wouldn\u2019t be viable. Even 20 will make it very difficult, so we are trying to work through, with the industry, how we can get them back to being viable as quickly as possible. But we\u2019ve got to do it in a safe way. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, has commented on proposals to modify the $130bn jobkeeper program. He told Guardian Australia: Given the continued global uncertainty, as well as concerns about a second wave of the virus, we believe it is too early to be thinking about restricting the scope of the jobkeeper payment. Rather, we believe its eligibility should be extended, as the amount budgeted for it will unlikely be spent by September. Businesses such as those relying on international visitors, tourism, hospitality, business events and large entertainment venues will continue to be stymied by both health concerns and the three-stage plan to restart the economy. Providing these businesses with continued and targeted support will be necessary to give them the greatest chance of surviving, and ready to restart with as many as possible of the same employees on their books as before the pandemic began. A final very important question for those of us watching the snowfalls at the start of this month: will we be able to go skiing in Victoria? Sutton says yes \u2013 to the extent that you can socially distance while skiing, so daytrips and groups of less than 10. But no staying overnight, no dorms, possibly only cross-country skiing at this point. The full details are likely to be worked out later. The ski season doesn\u2019t open until the Queen\u2019s birthday weekend in June. Sutton says that by the end of the month, Australia should have a \u201cdecent antibodies test\u201d. He says a testing program using that test should be up and running in the next couple of months. That will give an indication of how many people in Australia have had Covid-19 and have antibodies. But he warns it\u2019s likely to be quite low. Even in New York, only about 20% of the population has had and recovered from Covid-19. Is it possible we could have a second wave bigger than the first? Epstein asks. Yes, Sutton says, mainly because our first wave was so small. We could have tens or hundreds or thousands of cases in Australia. And that\u2019s not scaremongering, that\u2019s just a fact. He says the limiting factor is how well people can maintain social distancing, even if the restrictions lift. I guess my nervousness in some respects is a second wave, if people are completely fed up in how they are restrained in their lives and just can\u2019t handle it any more. Epstein asks Sutton about the protest outside parliament in Melbourne yesterday. Sutton says it\u2019s \u201cnot ideal for people to be in close contact, and if there are significant gathering size, then the potential for transmission increases\u201d. I hope people understand that they can make protestations in whatever way they desire, but they should also follow the social distancing rules that are in place for a reason. Suttons says it\u2019s not a matter of people just risking their own health. If the disease spreads, the chance of vulnerable people getting it grows exponentially. With infectious diseases, you don\u2019t get to make decisions about other people\u2019s health. Sutton says his advice to the Victorian government on if and when schools can reopen is cabinet-in-confidence. He says he would not oppose a staggered approach to returning to school, which is what Queensland and Tasmania are doing, but won\u2019t be drawn on what he has actually told cabinet. Sutton is echoing a lot of the comments made by the national chief medial officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, about personal responsibility and making judgement calls about what is safe to do under these loosened restrictions. Just as hugs are a matter of personal judgement, when and what to shop for will be matter for a personal judgement, Sutton says. But we don\u2019t want all and sundry to go there every other day to get something that they think it would be nice to go and shop for. That applies to all of the retail sector ... If you go in and you can see that people aren\u2019t able to physically distance because of the people that are there, that is not a time to go. I am sure there will be a time that it\u2019s quieter and it will be safer for you to go. On gatherings, which are now allowed (groups of 10 outdoors and five indoors), he says \u201cdon\u2019t gather more than you have to\u201d. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Professor Brett Sutton, has been on ABC radio in Melbourne talking about the restrictions that will be lifted from 11.59pm tomorrow. He says lifting those restrictions is an \u201cexperiment\u201d so the changes will be incremental. Sutton says there is no number that will trigger the Victorian government to go back to stage three restrictions (which is what we have been in for several weeks). The key concern is community transmission, and Sutton says he would like the daily increase in cases with no known source of infection stay in single figures. Raf Epstein asks if hugs will be allowed, if he and his kids visit his parents this weekend. Sutton: It is about you, I am not about to step into your private life and tell you what you can and can\u2019t do, but that 1.5m distance is there for a reason. Sutton says he has not made a call on whether he should see his parents yet \u2013 it will be based on his health and that of his family, and also the health of his mother and her partner. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing my brother first,\u201d he says. If anyone is unwell, he says, they should not join the group \u2013 even if they are very mildly unwell. Good evening, it\u2019s Calla Wahlquist here taking over from the wonderful Naaman Zhou. I\u2019ll be taking you right through to Q&amp;A (9.35pm on ABC), which tonight will host the east coast premiers, Daniel Andrews, Gladys Berejiklian and Annastacia Palaszczuk. They run the biggest states and have been the strongest voices in the national cabinet, so it has the potential to be really quite interesting. Adelaide Crows players have escaped bans or fines for their part in breaching social distancing rules during a club training session but assistant coach Ben Hart has been stood down from coaching duties for six weeks. The AFL found the breach was \u201cinadvertent and not done to create a competitive advantage\u201d, and the 16 players each received a suspended one match sanction, in place for the remainder of the 2020 premiership season. Barring any further breaches, they will be available to play once the season resumes. But Hart, who took the session involving 16 players last Thursday when the club was supposed to be self isolating in the Barossa Valley after returning from interstate travel, was not so lucky. The Crows maintained they were not deliberately trying to break any rules, but after concluding its investigation on Monday, the AFL found the club to have been in breach of protocols. South Australia police opted to caution, not fine the club last week, leaving the AFL to mete out punishment, with Hart now largely shouldering responsibility for the aberration. He will not be able to access the club facilities or have contact with players until 22 June. An AFL statement read: The investigation found the players had been compliant with the protocols for the majority of a two-hour training session where they had worked in pairs before separating into two larger groups of eight \u2013 one group to complete an eight-minute kicking drill, one group to complete an eight-minute running drill in pairs, before swapping. The kicking drill was supervised by assistant coach Ben Hart which is where the breach occurred. The investigation found the club had provided written and verbal instructions to players and the assistant coach to comply with the protocols in place, however the assistant coach present had accepted that his instruction was not in line with either the rules or the club\u2019s instructions.\u201d NSW\u2019s public schools have seen in-person attendance up 21 percentage points since last Friday. Today, on the first school day since the federal government unveiled its three step plan to easing restrictions, 37% of students attended school in person, and 63% learned remotely. On Friday, there were only 16% of students on school grounds and 84% at home. 61% of primary students and 74% of secondary students were not on site today, the NSW education department said. Fast food chain Hungry Jacks is urging its customers to download the Covidsafe app (via push notification). This follows earlier reports that McDonalds was doing the same last week. And the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, has confirmed that processing of applications has resumed today. He says more than 1.2 million people have applied for early access for a total value of over $10bn. \u201cAs the ATO advised superannuation funds last week, it paused the processing of applications for one day to further enhance its systems in response to new techniques criminals are using to try to steal Australians\u2019 identities,\u201d Sukkar said. \u201cThe ATO has identified a small number of third parties who could be susceptible to criminal activity. The ATO is working with these third parties to help them make security enhancements.\u201d The Australian Tax Office has provided an update on the freeze over the weekend of early access to superannuation after an alleged fraud of $120,000 from 150 workers\u2019 retirement savings. An ATO spokesperson told Guardian Australia: The ATO has implemented enhancements to further increase the end-to-end security and integrity of the early release of super program. The files that were paused on Friday, will be delivered to funds today. The ATO will now run additional risk filters over all files before they are delivered to funds, and provide additional information to funds to assist them in their own fraud prevention processes. The files will still be delivered to funds within publicised service standards. Importantly, applications for the early release of super program remain open, and individuals should continue to receive their payments well within service standards. The ATO is using this as an opportunity to remind Australians to be vigilant with how you store, and who you provide your personal information to. Ensure that you only provide information to trusted advisors and never provide information if you are not certain who you are speaking with. You should never share your myGov login with anyone, including your tax agent. You should be particularly wary of clicking links and emails or text messages that seek your personal information. The ATO will never send you a link to log on to our online services.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer Prof Michael Kidd is now on the ABC being interviewed by Patricia Karvelas. Kidd says that the government is not aiming for \u201celimination\u201d, where new cases of Covid-19 are zero, but is aiming for \u201csuppression\u201d. He says the stages of reopening the country could see infection rates increase. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at cautious steps and each of those steps needs to be given time to see what the response will be, if we do see significant increases in the number of new infections,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment we have less than 20 infections being diagnosed right across the country each day, so Australia is in a very good position at the moment and we want to keep to it that way. \u201cBut we\u2019re not moving towards being able to eliminate the virus in Australia. We\u2019re suppressing the virus and recognising we may get a small number of infections each day.\u201d In non-coronavirus news, police have opposed the bail request of the Melbourne Porsche driver accused of speeding and verbally abusing a dying police officer. Richard Pusey was earlier today charged with three additional charges, and police told the court that Pusey was a serial speedster with \u201cviolent tendencies\u201d, AAP reports. A month before the incident, Pusey allegedly boasted to a friend about going 300 km/h along the same freeway. \u201cApparently it [the car] will do 350 [km/h] and it\u2019s coming,\u201d he said, the court was told. The driver was previously accused of threatening to set himself on fire at a debt collection agency and drive down Bourke Street, in an apparent reference to James Gargasoulas\u2019 rampage. He also allegedly sent threatening emails to a Westpac employee. Police informant Aaron Price said Pusey took \u201cdisturbing pleasure\u201d in causing discomfort to others. He displayed \u201cviolent tendencies\u201d towards the public and police, and \u201chas absolutely no regard for the safety of other road users\u201d. Pusey\u2019s lawyer, Vincent Peters, said his client had a pre-existing mental health condition and suggested he went into shock. The lawyer added his client could not receive the mental health treatment he needed in jail. The magistrate will decide on Pusey\u2019s bail application on Thursday. There are 49 people in hospital from Covid-19, 16 of whom are in intensive care, and 14 people on ventilators. 6,179 people have recovered from Covid-19, Kidd says. And Australia has conducted over 855,000 tests in total. Kidd is asked whether the start of cold weather in Australia could increase transmission rates. He says the limits on indoor gatherings are crucial during winter. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand exactly what the impact of the weather has on transmission rates for Covid-19,\u201d he says. \u201cClearly, as the weather gets colder, people tend to crowd more, we may get more crowding on public transport, or inside, in venues. \u201cThe mechanisms put in place to maintain physical distancing, to reduce the number of people to 4 sq metres in each venue, are incredibly important.\u201d There are now 5.5 million registered people on the Covidsafe app, Kidd says. He adds that it is now fully \u201coperational and working\u201d. However, the contact-tracing departments of the states and territories have only just completed their training with it, and they won\u2019t be able to use that data for a few days. \u201cIt is operational and working so if you have it on your phone, it will be recording the details of people you have been in close contact with, encrypting those details and storing them on your phone,\u201d he says. \u201cThe national cabinet on Friday agreed to national protocols for the use of the information being stored on the app, and training by disease detectives in each of the states and territories, has been completed today. \u201cAnd we hope it will therefore start to be used by disease detectives over the next day or two across the country.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd has issued a strong warning as states ease restrictions and people gradually start congregating more. \u201cWe have very serious risks if overcrowding starts to occur,\u201d he says. \u201cCovid-19 is still out there in our country. \u201cThis is not a time to become complacent,\u201d he says. \u201cEach of us needs to continue our strong commitment to maintaining physical distancing of 1.5m from other people whenever we are outside of our homes, and that means avoiding crowds whenever possible. \u201cIf you see a crowd, please go in the other direction.\u201d He adds: \u201cGoing into to a crowded workplace at this time would not be sensible\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Michael Kidd, is now providing the daily coronavirus update. There have been no new cases in the ACT, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia, or Tasmania. And you may have seen earlier today \u2013 and last week \u2013 my dispatches from the NSW special inquiry into the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The inquiry wrapped up its sixth day of public hearings today. There will be more hearings and witnesses at some point in the future, but commissioner Bret Walker SC did not specify when. The next hearing dates will be put up on the website when they are ready, he said. Over the past six hearings, spread over multiple weeks, we\u2019ve heard evidence from the ship\u2019s senior doctor on board, a NSW Health senior epidemiologist, the duty harbourmaster, the acting CEO of the NSW Port Authority, two paramedics, the Ruby Princess\u2019s port agent, and a senior manager of Carnival Australia, who are the operators of the virus-hit ship. The inquiry must complete its final report by 14 August. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here. Thanks to Amy Remeikis for her incredible work, as always. Queensland\u2019s new cabinet has just been sworn in, after the sudden resignation of deputy premier and treasurer Jackie Trad. The ministers assembled at government house today with an appropriate 1.5 metre gap for the official photo, AAP reports. Health minister Steven Miles is the new deputy premier while Cameron Dick has become treasurer, in addition to his other portfolios. Tourism minister Kate Jones will also be responsible for state development, while fire and emergency services minister Craig Crawford will pick up Trad\u2019s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander department. Member for Mackay Glenn Butcher has been promoted to cabinet as the minister for regional development and manufacturing. The reshuffle came less than 24 hours after the Crime and Corruption Commission confirmed it was investigating Ms Trad for the second time in 12 months. It\u2019s alleged she interfered with the selection process for the principal of a new high school located in her South Brisbane seat. Trad denied the claim and said she \u201cnever expressed a view to anyone on who should fill that role\u201d. One of the betting agencies is so desperate for punts, it is now taking bets on how often the prime minister will say \u201cAustralians\u201d in his press conference. Moving on. That\u2019s me done for the day \u2013 thank you so much for joining me. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning with Covid and parliament in the one blog, so make sure you have your coffee ready for that. I\u2019ll leave you with the wonderful Naaman Zhou for the next part of the day. Thanks again \u2013 and take care of you. The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Michael Kidd, will give today\u2019s national update. It won\u2019t include the death of the Newmarch House resident because that person (we don\u2019t know gender or age) had tested negative for Covid before they died, which would have put them in the \u201crecovered\u201d cases. Exhibit A: (And no, it is not lost on me that the network that made Evans a household name in a lot of households is now all whhhhaaaaaaaaaaaaa....????) That a health authority has to not only make this post, but have all the (zoom) meetings, sending up the chain requests, consult with departments and bother a scientist who is probably pretty busy doing things that actually matter, says everything about what has gone quite stupidly wrong in this country: Paul Karp has the latest on the sports rorts saga \u2013 new evidence has emerged about five representations from the PMO. Jacinda Ardern continued: The upshot is we will have opened most businesses in New Zealand in 10 days, and sooner than many other countries around the world, that fits with our plan and our plan was go hard, go early, so we can get our economy moving again soon. So we can get the economic benefit of getting our health response right. So far, we have. There does have to be a new normal. And that normal means that we will be breaking out our bubbles, we will be around more people, but we can do that and get my activity going, if we balance that with keeping our distant and keeping our social gatherings small for now. Jacinda Ardern says the NZ cabinet has met and agreed to relax restrictions even further: On Thursday this week, retail, malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other public spaces including playgrounds and gyms can reopen. All will be required to have physical distancing and strict hygiene measures in place. You can begin to move around New Zealand but space yourself out, especially if you\u2019re using public transport. And of course health services will restart. On Monday 18 May, children and young people will be able to return to school and early learning. The staging is to give education facilities and teachers time to plan. On Thursday 21 May, bars will be able to open, with requirements set out last week including seating must be provided, there must be space between tables and there must not be multiple waiters and waitresses serving a single table. We have left bars to last because they do prove the most risk, as we have seen from South Korea, who opened the bars to close them again after one person created an outbreak of 40 people causing 1500 tests. Jacinda Ardern says that as of today, New Zealand has just 90 active cases of Covid-19, with two people in hospital, and believes it is on track to eradicate the virus from its shores. But she still wants to step up testing. Wyd? (Via AAP): Locked down in his New York home, world famous artist Spencer Tunick battled depression while contemplating all the goals he set for an isolation period amid a global pandemic. The possibility of creating one of his large-scale, iconic nude shoots at a landmark like the Sydney Opera House was out of the question. But during a time when everyone is communicating via video chats, he decided to invite people around the world to help create a naked mosaic titled Stay Apart Together, to highlight \u201chuman connection in the virtual world\u201d. Up to 100 volunteers will be directed to pose online as the artist composes an image where different nude bodies in their own personal space will create an image \u201csimilar to a window in a church\u201d. Australians are among the first to be offered a spot in the artist\u2019s creation and anybody selected for the communal artwork will also feature in an Australian-only canvas. Tunick told AAP: I\u2019ve been getting so much love from Australia that I felt like connecting. Anyone above the age of 18, all body shapes, all races. Covid-19 impacts all of us and I want my artwork to be representative of this unique moment in time. Living in one of the worst-hit regions in the US, Tunick has experienced the struggle of coronavirus firsthand, tending to a family member who lives nearby as they recovered from coronavirus. The artistic endeavour has helped Tunick get through lockdown and he believes it can help those amateur models willing to participate. *Ian Malcolm Jurassic Park voice* Life will find a way. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has responded to reports of revamping jobkeeper. He said: The economic fallout from the coronavirus economic crisis is going to stick with us for a long time, and so too should the government\u2019s response. The idea that we\u2019re going to snap back to normal is a fanciful daydream concocted for Scott Morrison by his mates in big corporations who want restrictions lifted. Scott Morrison can\u2019t yank away a life preserver from people and small businesses struggling to keep their heads above water. Repealing the jobseeker and jobkeeper packages in the midst of a crisis would be the height of bastardry for a government that\u2019s already known for putting people last. If the government rewrote the rules of jobkeeper to make it more expansive, deliver more money to more people, and help short-term casuals and their employers, we\u2019d be open to looking at it. However, we\u2019d oppose anything that would strip away money from people who are already fighting the fallout of a global pandemic. The federal government has released its Covidsafe tool for businesses. You can find that here. Well, the cruise industry apparently thinks it is all steam ahead. Oceania Cruises has launched its \u201cultimate sale\u201d \u2013 \u201cfeaturing major price reductions with fares starting as low as $2,220 per guest for inside staterooms and $2,930 per guest for veranda staterooms\u201d. Discerning travellers can select from more than 400 voyages departing in 2020, 2021 or 2022 sailing throughout Australia-New Zealand, the South Pacific, Alaska, Europe, Asia, New England-Canada, Bermuda, the Caribbean and Panama Canal, South America, Africa and Arabia, and even Grand Voyages that traverse the continents. (This is not a parody.) The ABC is reporting a version of Super Rugby will recommence as an Australian-only competition comprising five teams, including the Western Force. The Perth-based Force were considered surplus to requirements in 2017 when they were axed from the competition. They have since been playing in Global Rapid Rugby and the National Rugby Championship. The Force will join the Queensland Reds, ACT Brumbies, NSW Waratahs and Melbourne Rebels in a new-look competition that will reportedly be back up and running by July at the earliest. Global travel restrictions have put paid to the inclusion of the South African cohort of teams, along with Argentina\u2019s Jaguares and Japan\u2019s Sunwolves. New Zealand has already announced its plans for a local-only competition, \u201cSuper Rugby Aotearoa\u201d. The 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended due to the Covid-19 outbreak in mid-March, after just seven rounds of play had been completed. The ACT has recorded no new cases, meaning it stays (active) Covid-case free. The aged care provider has released this statement: Sadly, another resident of Newmarch House passed away overnight. While the resident had previously tested positive for Covid-19, they had returned two negative tests before passing. The family and all relevant authorities have been contacted. We are devastated at the passing of this loved resident and extend our sympathies to the family as they grieve their loss. That is the 17th person to die in the facility, having been diagnosed with Covid-19, and the second to have passed after recovering from the virus to the point they tested negative in the days before their death. Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, Tony Burke, has left the door open to reforming the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy \u2013 if the proceeds were redirected to workers who missed out. At issue is the fact that some employees who normally earn less than $1,500 a fortnight actually earn more than their usual wages through the subsidy, while others such as shorter-term casuals with less than 12 months service miss out. Burke told Guardian Australia: We called for the government to subsidise wages, not multiply them. From day one we\u2019ve said the scheme should be better targeted, so that the people who really need it can get it but we don\u2019t waste taxpayers\u2019 money. It\u2019s not fair that a single woman working to support three children misses out because she\u2019s only been in her casual job for 11 months, but a uni student who lives at home and works a few hours a week for pocket money gets a massive pay rise. Labor will consider any proposals to better target the scheme so that it reaches more people who need it. I don\u2019t imagine Labor would support cutting short the six-month term, but there does appear to be some flexibility on ensuring it is better targeted. It was a busy few hours there, so what have we learned? Dan Andrews has laid out the first stage of easing Victoria\u2019s restrictions: outside gatherings of up to 10 will be allowed, and Victorians can have up to five visitors to their homes. Travel to beaches and walking paths are allowed, but no overnight camping, or Airbnb-ing/hotels. Training for professional sports will be allowed, as will golf. The jobkeeper wage subsidy could be changed, but its too early to say how, or even when, at this stage Scott Morrison really doesn\u2019t want to talk about sports rorts. Labor has laid out the bones of its post-Covid restriction priority list \u2013 more manufacturing, science industries and better social security are the headlines there. It\u2019s a \u201cfree country\u201d for dickheads who want to protest dickhead things (but climate protesters deserve cracking down on for \u201cdenying the liberties of Australians\u201d). Listening back to Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference, I realised I missed a question asking Morrison what he thought of the anti-lockdown (and 5G and Bill Gates and, I don\u2019t know, email chain letters) protests over the weekend. And his response to people who have walked around with 3G and 4G but are now convinced 5G is the G that will kill us all, as well as actually breaking physical distance restrictions while protesting enough nonsense to get \u201cdickhead\u201d and \u201cmoron\u201d trending on social media (a big ask in this country) was a lot different to his response to climate protesters: I understand people\u2019s frustration. I\u2019m pleased to see the Victorian premier made decisions today, or further today, and in terms of the road map back. I welcome that as I do. The announcement was made in Western Australia and New South Wales and other places. The states as we said last Friday are setting out their time-table. An important part of what we decided is that people needed to see that road ahead. We understand the frustrations of not knowing what happens next and after that, get ourselves to a position last Friday, a week ahead of where we thought we would, where we were in a position to do just that. So it is our hope that that will provide it. Well smash me down and call me avocado. I am SHOCKED dickheads protesting vaccinations and a telecommunication upgrade get more introspection and respect than people worried about the obviously bullshit issues like climate change and the future of the planet. SHOCKED. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has responded to reports the government could cut short the six-month jobkeeper payment He told Guardian Australia: Wage subsidies are a very good idea being very badly implemented by a government which leaves workers out and leaves people behind. Millions of Australians will find these reports really concerning. The prime minister is considering ending jobkeeper early without having a plan for jobs or the economy once that support\u2019s withdrawn. No word from Labor yet about whether they could support reform the payment so that people who ordinarily earn less than $1,500 a fortnight no longer get the full payment, and money could be redirected to those currently ineligible, such as shorter-term casuals. Richard Marles, his deputy, tells the caucus room that he believes the speech was wonderful, full of hope and one of the best things he has heard during the crisis. As you were. Anthony Albanese finishes with: The pandemic has left many feeling alone. But the recovery will bring us together to pursue the common good like never before. The present situation is unprecedented. But as we look ahead it is our instincts \u2013 shaped by our past experience and underpinned by our enduring values \u2013 that will give us our best chance of getting the future right. I firmly believe that Labor is best placed to learn the lessons of the recent past, and to build a better and fairer future \u2013 a future where the benefits of inclusive economic growth are shared, where opportunity is created, where we continue the spirit of looking after each other as we have during the bushfires and the pandemic. We are, after all, as Ben Lee sang, \u201call in this together\u201d. [cont from previous post] This crisis has exposed a complacency about the underlying health of our economy and society that has deepened over the last seven years of Liberal government. With 1 million unemployed it\u2019s no time for complacency. It\u2019s no time for a \u201csnapback\u201d to the Liberal agenda of cutting services, suppressing wages and undermining job security. This pandemic has shown that Labor\u2019s values of fairness and security and our belief in the power of government to shape change to the advantage of working people are the right ones. A constrained fiscal position does mean difficult choices. But a reform agenda that doesn\u2019t work for all Australians isn\u2019t one we should pursue. We need investment in people, in technology, in infrastructure and in the capacity of government to do good, if we are to be better prepared not just for the next crisis but for the challenges of the next decade. We need an economy that works for people, not the other way around. Anthony Albanese: Right now Australia is one of the worst countries in the OECD at commercialising scientific research. We must turn this around if we are to climb the technological ladder. We should promote the study of science and celebrate our achievements, like the Square Kilometre Array Telescope in Murchison, to inspire those looking at future career options. But instead the government has slashed funding to the CSIRO, the very organisation now testing vaccines for the coronavirus. They have slashed funding for the ABC, invaluable during the pandemic and absolutely pivotal to keeping people safe during the bushfires. At a time we need muscle, the government has left us only bone. Albanese continues: We must invest in nation-building infrastructure, including iconic projects like High Speed Rail, and we should be building trains here. Government procurement policy in rail manufacturing has produced superior outcomes to imports and created regional jobs in Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. The commonwealth can deliver coordinated procurement across states and territories and the private sector to smooth out production, lower costs and build skills and capability. An appropriate decentralisation strategy which boosts regional economic development and takes pressure off our capital cities should be at the heart of national economic development. We could start by restoring public sector jobs in areas such as Centrelink, Medicare and Veterans Affairs that deliver services to regional communities. The contracting out of essential public services is not in the national interest and must stop. It\u2019s time to put human beings and human dignity back into human services. The basics of life, such as early childhood education, should be nurtured and made affordable. Anthony Albanese lays out some of Labor\u2019s proposals for a post-Covid restriction Australia: We should relish the prospect of looking back with pride at how we saw off this crisis and then emerged stronger. That strength must be built on delivering more security for those who have work, and jobs and skills for those who don\u2019t. We must build more permanent jobs, an industrial relations system that promotes co-operation, productivity improvements and shared benefits. The experience of working from home in recent months has given a practical insight into how many businesses could improve their cost structures and productivity by moving to regional cities and towns. For many, the location and nature of their work will have changed forever, with the potential to increase productivity and decrease urban congestion. We must revitalise high value Australian manufacturing using our clean energy resources. With our abundant renewable resources, mining industry and industrial capability, we should be at the forefront of the global competition for jobs and industry. Lower energy costs will deliver investment in energy intensive manufacturing like steel and aluminium and boost regional jobs and economic activity. OK, now to Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech. The Labor leader says the pandemic response has shown the best of politics, but the economic response risks a split: By and large we have avoided the worst of the health consequences, as we have watched mass graves being dug in New York, or the convoys of coffins driven through Italian villages. Yet the damage to the economy has been severe, and the threat of a prolonged impact is very real. The pandemic has shown that Labor\u2019s values of fairness, security and the power of government to change lives were the right values in a crisis. They are also the right values for the recovery. The prime minister\u2019s talk of \u201csnapback\u201d to what came before foreshadows a return to the Liberals\u2019 traditional agenda. Marketing slogans won\u2019t ease the ongoing burden of this pandemic, or hasten recovery. Carnival Australia\u2019s port operations manager has told an inquiry that it did not implement 1.5m physical distancing between 2,700 disembarking passengers from the Ruby Princess because he \u201cdoes not remember it being a requirement at the time\u201d. Paul Mifsud from Carnival Australia, which is the operator of the Ruby Princess, also said he did not know who was in charge of workplace health and safety for Australian-based cruises. Under questioning from Kylie Nomchong SC, counsel for the International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation, Mifsud said that passengers were not kept 1.5m apart on 19 March. \u201cI do not remember it being a requirement at the time,\u201d he told the inquiry. Nomchong said this was put in place in Australia on 15 March. Mifsud said he did not recall any information being sent to Carnival Australia about this. Earlier, Mifsud was also asked who was in charge of workplace health and safety on Australian cruises, and said he did not know because it \u201cwould be somebody in the US office\u201d from the department of fleet operations. What can you take from that? Well, the signs are all there that the jobkeeper program could be tweaked with, if the economy opens up faster than anticipated. Nothing is concrete, because no one knows what the next six weeks holds, let alone the next few months. But the hints are there that if certain sectors bounce back, the wage subsidy could be redirected from them to others which will be slower to reopen, like tourism. Watch that space. And the other thing? Scott Morrison really, really, really doesn\u2019t want to talk about sports rorts. At least some things have remained constant in this weird world. And then the press conference ends with this \u2013 if the unemployment rates drops sooner than anticipated, the Covid supplements could be wound back. Scott Morrison: What people know is that there\u2019s six months of an economic lifeline to the value of $130bn. And that says to Australians that we will be there for you. And we will be there for you to get Australians back into work. The thing that matters is getting Australians back into work. The thing that matters is getting Australian businesses back open. Because when that happens, there will be no need for those levels of income support. Success for our economy is when we\u2019re able to get ourselves out of the situation which requires such enormous taxpayer support. And it\u2019s not just today\u2019s taxpayers. It\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s taxpayers as well. And our government will always be extremely prudent into not putting burdens on to future generations \u2013 let alone the current generation \u2013 in dealing with the challenges that we have today. So that income support was forthcoming. It was forthcoming quickly and delivered with record speed when it comes to programs of this scale and this size. It was carefully considered. It wasn\u2019t rushed into. It was worked through. It was well designed and it\u2019s been doing the job. And it will keep doing that job for as long as it\u2019s needed, and the test, ultimately, is ensuring that we get people back into jobs. If people are in jobs, they don\u2019t need income support. And that\u2019s my task. That\u2019s the state\u2019s task. That\u2019s all of our task \u2013 to support business. We then get this question from Paul Karp: The Audit Office revealed on 26 March 2019 your office asked Bridget McKenzie to seek your authority on projects to receive sports grants and she wrote seeking that on 10 April. So did you mislead the House of Representatives when you said that no authorisation was provided by you and why did your office do that if you had no role in authorising them? That is in relation to this story, from information very handily lodged late on a Friday afternoon: But Scott Morrison again says he has no questions to answer: Good to see the Canberra press gallery is back to politics as usual with parliament coming back. I answered your question. I said no. Question: Prime minister, would you consider scaling back jobkeeper or ending it before the end of September? Scott Morrison: All of this is very premature. We are six weeks in to a six-month program. The impact of the virus, how it will impact on Australia in the months ahead, with a reopening economy, is very much a work in progress. That\u2019s why we put this six-month lifeline in place. What we need to ensure that we do is that whatever supports we have they they are targeted. I said in early March we have to have programs that are targeted. We have to have programs that use existing distribution mechanisms, within the government. We have been doing all of these things. All of our programs will continue to be delivered in accordance with those principles. But let there be no doubt: Australians know our government has been there to back them through one of the toughest times in their lives, not just on Covid-19 \u2013 bushfires, on drought, on floods \u2013 we\u2019ve been there to support them and we will continue to be there to support them. Scott Morrison continued: I think Australians have to remain on their guard. I think the chief medical officer was stressing this point yesterday. The reason we\u2019re opening things up again is not because the virus is beaten. The virus is still out there \u2013 it hasn\u2019t gone anywhere, it is still out there. There may be 700 or so active cases in Australia now, but Australia is still very much at risk. The reason we\u2019re reopening is we put protections in place and it will take us some time to reopen our economy and get it back to a point where it can start supporting Australians again and so I wouldn\u2019t share your assessment of the scene several months ago. We have put in place and bought six months\u2019 worth of time. We\u2019re only six weeks into that six months. We have put the commitment in to support Australians over that period of time. As we need to adjust, based on advice and the strength of the economy and how many people we are getting back to jobs \u2013 these are the things we will watch carefully. I don\u2019t think Australians can be in any doubt that when they needed us most, we were there and we\u2019re there for them right here, right now and we will be there in the future Question: Prime minister, two months ago you insisted to us, if you shut down, it had to be for six months. That was the only way you could squash the virus. How did you get that wrong and can you confirm the tertiary review into jobkeeper will assess whether to truncate or alter the program before September, given restrictions are being lifted? Scott Morrison: I don\u2019t share your certainty about the future that you seem to profess about how the coronavirus operates. We still have a long way to go on this. I think it is dangerous, I think, to assert this is all over, as your question suggests. So I wouldn\u2019t agree with your assessment. We still have a long way to go. We are just now starting to reopen our economy. We are not fully certain about what the implications of all of that will be and that\u2019s why we have to remain on our guard and that\u2019s why the states are moving at their own pace to implement the road map I set out last week. Question: The draft decision by the Chinese to impose the tariffs on barley, do you see that as retribution for us pushing for the review into the outbreak of the virus? Scott Morrison: No, I don\u2019t. This is a program that\u2019s been going on for 18 months. This review has been a subject raised at various meetings with the Chinese leadership, including premier Xi Jinping last year. It\u2019s been an ongoing issue between our two countries. We saw the level of trade of barley to China fall from 1.7bn to 600m. So I think it\u2019s, it would be, I think we have to be careful not to draw lines. We would expect and hope that this issue will be determined on its merits. It\u2019s an anti-dumping issue from their perspective. They certainly haven\u2019t raised it as connected to other issues. I would be extremely disappointed if it was. There\u2019s no reason for me to think, based on the way that they\u2019re approaching it, that I could draw that conclusion. It\u2019s important we just deal with this on its merits, as we have been for some time now. We believe that trade is incredibly important and beneficial for both countries. Anti-dumping regimes, we respect. We have anti-dumping regimes here. We have had anti-dumping inquiries in relation to Chinese products to Australia. Not all those decisions were well received. They\u2019ve been made on the merits and I would hope and expect China to do the same thing. Scott Morrison is also holding his media conference \u2013 of course the issue of China\u2019s tariffs came up: The Victorian chief medical officer, Prof Brett Sutton, says handshakes and hugs are still not recommended: It is up to the individual. I wouldn\u2019t be doing it. It\u2019s clearly a very close contact. My recommendation to everyone would be not to do it. There must be circumstances, though, where it\u2019s really important for an individual. I won\u2019t step into their private life but I would say from a public health perspective: no handshakes, no hugs and kisses is the safest thing to do and does make a difference and has made a difference to this point in time. NSW police handed out three tickets for ignoring restrictions yesterday. Here is how they explained it: Officers from Sydney City police area command were patrolling Sydney\u2019s CBD when they stopped a vehicle on George Street about 1am yesterday (Sunday 10 May 2020). Police spoke with the 19-year-old female driver and three passengers. The Greenacre woman told police the group had just wanted to get out of the house but could not provide a reason for being in the city. When checks revealed she had previously been warned for being out in a group and without a reasonable excuse, she was issued a $1000 PIN. Her passengers each received warnings. About 6.30pm, officers from Blacktown police area command were patrolling Seven Hills when they observed two men sitting and drinking on Boomerang Place. Police spoke with the men about breaching ministerial directions, with neither able to provide a reason for being there and stating to just give them a fine because they weren\u2019t going to pay it. Checks revealed both men \u2013 aged 39 and 43 \u2013 had previously been warned for doing the same thing. They were each issued $1000 PINs. So again, that is up to five visitors in a household (or half a Sam Newman) and 10 people for outside activities (a whole Sam Newman) in Victoria from midnight tomorrow. Dust off those old MySpace lists, Victoria. And \u201c10 is 10\u201d: At this stage, it\u2019s for three weeks. There might be a different arrangement. This is mainly about training and social activity. It\u2019s not about a return to a full Auskick program, not amateur footy coming back at pace. It is cautious, the appropriate step. People want to go for a hike, want to go fishing, want to go in a tinny, you can\u2019t have 10 people in a boat that doesn\u2019t allow you to be 1.5m apart. You might be able to play golf, but there won\u2019t be rakes in the bunkers, people won\u2019t be milling around the clubhouse and it will be shut. The list goes on. This is all driven by common sense. Logic is the best guide. If you are doubting whether you ought to be doing it, don\u2019t. That\u2019s the simple message. This is not an invitation to be out every hour of every day or to be having friends over every lunch and every dinner. That\u2019s not what this is about. If we all did that, then we will have less options in June because our testing program \u2013 the biggest in the country \u2013 will find more positives because nothing will happen but it will spread the virus. We\u2019re in this together. If we all do the right thing, we will all benefit from more options, more easing, further steps in June and beyond June. Again, if you can work from home, Dan Andrews says you should: I would say to you there are many, many Victorians that are employers and workers who have, because of the work they do, they have been able to work from home. I don\u2019t want to see that change in the next three weeks. The fact that we\u2019re going to have literally hundreds of thousands of people visiting family and friends, that\u2019s a big step a lot of movement that wasn\u2019t happening. We have to be careful not to do too much too soon. The problem then is how quickly it can get away from you. We saw how infectious this is, how rapidly it spreads \u2013 not just in our state and nation. I\u2019m sure people have seen reports about a single individual attending a number of bars in South Korea \u2013 there\u2019s now 1,300 people in home quarantine and I think something like 2,100 bars closed. This thing is highly infectious, rapid, dynamic. It gets away from you quickly. That\u2019s why we\u2019re taking the significant steps, but cautious, safe and appropriate to the circumstances we face. They\u2019re different to what is happening in the Northern Territory, for instance, because they\u2019re in a different position. If you can work from home, you must for the rest of May. Beyond that, I hope to be able to have a different message and move to a different set of circumstances for June. Beyond the next three weeks? I\u2019m sure others would like us to go further. I\u2019d take you through the obvious example, if you think about cafes and restaurants: my thinking here is that if we wait these three weeks, when we move to open, go beyond just takeaway, for cafes, we might not have to stick with the number of 10. We might be able to go higher. I won\u2019t speculate on what that number is. I think the feedback from many businesses is that at just 10 patrons, it\u2019s hard to be viable. If we wait three weeks, if we do the testing, have that further assurance, that the significant steps we took today isn\u2019t causing us trouble, that we can\u2019t manage, then I think we can take a bigger step potentially in June for cafes and restaurants and ... get them to a point where they are viable. Their business model has changed. I think takeaway will be a feature for a long time. If we can supplement and complement that with table service at more than 10, there\u2019s every chance for a more viable model. That\u2019s our thinking. Assume the rules don\u2019t change any time in the next three weeks and we will have more to say in full detail once we get to the point where we make decisions for June. Dan Andrews is serious about the no overnight rule: I don\u2019t think you will find, Airbnb will not take bookings. There won\u2019t be bookings at hotels. We don\u2019t think that is appropriate. If you need to visit family and friends, then you are able to do that. We ask people to use commonsense and good judgment. Things like camping won\u2019t be allowed. We think that is appropriate, just for the three weeks. That may change in June. A number of different experiences that are not feasible now, we may find a way to be able to socially distance. There will be a gradual opening up of the economy, gradual relaxation of these rules, but each step \u2013 and particularly the first step \u2013 has to be cautious, safe and appropriate to the circumstances and they are different to other states. And if you can still work from home, you are encouraged to do so. But camping is still out \u2013 there will be no overnight stays allowed in the national or state parks. There are no limits to how far you can travel though, Dan Andrews says \u2013 you can drive to the beach, or your favourite hiking track, if you wish (and can still abide by physical distance rules). [continued from previous post] We\u2019re also able to make some changes to rules for some of the most significant gatherings in any of our lives: weddings will now be able to have 10 guests and up to 20 people will be able to attend funerals held indoors and up to 30 if they\u2019re outdoors. More of the outdoor recreational activities that so many Victorians have been missing will also be allowed: walking groups, fishing, hiking \u2013 and yes, even a game of golf. These activities will be subject to physical distancing to help keep people safe. These new restrictions and a renewed State of Emergency will be in place until 11:59pm on Sunday 31 May. As we go through this month, we\u2019ll keep reviewing the situation and our case numbers \u2013 and hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to make further announcements then. But with more freedom comes more responsibility. I\u2019m asking Victorians to use common sense \u2013 you should only spend time together if it\u2019s safe. And you should only be undertaking these activities if you really need to. If it\u2019s integral to your health and wellbeing. Use your judgment. And think about the health of your fellow Victorians. From Dan Andrews\u2019s statement: From 11:59pm this Tuesday night, there\u2019s now a fifth reason to leave home: visiting friends and family \u2013 with a maximum gathering of up to 10 outdoors and having up to five visitors in your home. I know this will come as a welcome relief, but I need to be clear. Although these are our first steps back towards normalcy \u2013 they are not an invitation to host a dinner party every night of the week. It\u2019s not about having a rotating roster of acquaintances and associates \u2013 or your third best friend from primary school \u2013 over for a visit. This is about seeing those you need to \u2013 if you need to. We\u2019re asking Victorians to limit their circle to just family and friends. That means that when we do have outbreaks and positive cases \u2013 and we will \u2013 we can test and trace and effectively contain the spread. I want to be clear: just because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should. For our family, that means I won\u2019t see my Mum for a little while. She\u2019s in her 70s \u2013 and she has a number of conditions that would put her at risk. So from Wednesday (basically) you can have five visitors in your home, if you live in Victoria. You can go outside for outdoor activities in groups of up to 10. Schools will start looking at a return to on-site learning. Professional sports may restart training. Counselling services and community groups can restart, but only with physical restriction rules and no more than 10 in a group. Dan Andrews: These are small steps, significant steps, though. You only get one chance to get this right. The last thing we want to do is follow the example that so many countries have given us \u2013 if you relax too many rules too quickly, then we will find ourselves back here and, indeed, worse. We will find ourselves in a lockdown even harder than the ones we\u2019re coming out of. Our numbers, performance is the envy of the world. We need to make sure we jealously guard that, we are cautious, we are safe, we are appropriate in any easing. Of course, June, following more testing, following the experience of these 3.5 weeks that will guide us and we will have more to say about cafes at that time, restaurants and a whole range of other issues. We\u2019ve been guided by the data. I\u2019m impressed to think so many Victorians did the right thing. So many Victorians got tested. We are in this together. We can all be proud of the results we have been able to produce and we all need to have that shared commitment to keep following the rules so we don\u2019t give back all the great progress that we have made. Dan Andrews: Overall, you only get one chance to take this first step and to do it properly. This is safe, this is cautious, this is appropriate. We\u2019re not other states. We face our own unique challenges and we need to be appropriate to those. We need to be cautious. Dan Andrews says schools will start to return to on-site learning, in a staggered approach, and professional sports will be allowed to restart training, paving the way for the return of the season: There have been a lot of work between the AFL and the public health team and we will be able to, we have agreed to a set of arrangements to allow training for AFL, for rugby league, other professional sports, to resume from just before midnight tomorrow night. The other (slight) changes include: Groups of 10 will be allowed to go outside to engage in activities such as hiking, jogging, kicking the footy, or if you are Sam Newman, golf with all of your ego. Funerals, church gatherings, weddings, auctions and the like will also be able to have more people than previously allowed (we\u2019ll outline those when we see the release). There are changes also to the way a number of community facilities work. For instance, some counselling services which we believe are really very important, some council facilities, community centres, that run Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, counselling and other integral and important community meetings, they will be allowed but again, no more than 10 and there will be physical distancing and all of the other usual arrangements. Nothing changes there. Dan Andrews has announced that Victoria will slightly ease its restrictions \u2013 but it is not going as far as the rest of the states, just yet. From midnight tomorrow, you can have five guests in your home, if you live in Victoria: They should be family and friends, after all, [those] are the people that mean the most to us and that\u2019s where it\u2019s hurt, people not being able to connect with the people that are most important to them. So, from just before midnight tomorrow night ... You can have five, family and friends coming to your home. The Victorian premier says there have been seven cases of Covid-19 diagnosed in the last 24 hours. I will start by saying how grateful and how impressed I am that 161,000 Victorians have come forward to get tested. It is a mighty effort and I\u2019m so grateful that we asked people to do that and they have absolutely come forward in record numbers. This is by far and away the biggest testing program that our state has ever seen and it\u2019s one that gives us options, options we will act on today and I will come to that in a moment. Those 161,000 Victorians \u2013 thank you so much to the lab technicians, the public health team, taking the tests, processing them \u2013 we now have 141,000 of the 161,000 tests processed and we can say that there are 30 cases that we simply didn\u2019t know about before those tests were conducted. They\u2019re not connected to an outbreak, not connected to overseas travel. What that tells us is the virus is still with us \u2013 it is in the Victorian community. Pendles is every AFL fan right now Given the tsunami of press conferences, we are going to concentrate on Dan Andrews\u2019s announcement first, as that should have the new information. So at 11am we have: Dan Andrews announcing Victoria\u2019s restriction easing \u201croadmap\u201d. Anthony Albanese announcing Labor\u2019s outline for economic recovery post the Great Lockdown. Scott Morrison talking bushfire recovery and the latest in the national response. I am going to go make another coffee. I suggest you do the same thing. Scott Morrison will also hold a press conference at 11am, where the bushfire funding announcement will officially be made Anthony Albanese will deliver his latest \u201cvision statement\u201d (what Labor is calling its policy overviews, given that policy needs the input of its national bodies) at 11am. The Australian Association of Social Workers want the government to increase the number of mental health sessions allowable under Medicare, given the increased pressure people are living under \u2013 and will have to live under for some time to come. At the moment, you can get up to 10. The AASW wants that doubled (at least). From national president Christine Craik: Accredited Mental Health Social Workers (AMHSWs) have reported instances of their clients rationing their sessions despite significant concerns about their mental health and a worsening of symptoms as this pandemic continues. Social workers have reported observing an increase in service users presenting with suicidal thoughts and concerning behaviours. This is not surprising given the current circumstances, however supporting someone through this is difficult with the limited number of sessions available at the present time. People are experiencing heightened anxiety with this pandemic, due to many stressors including loss of income, financial pressure, isolation, uncertainty about the future, and for some, dealing with this alongside existing mental health issues. We are seeing an increase in incidents of family violence and worsening drug and alcohol abuse. It is clear that if we are to work to support the mental health of Australians through this pandemic and into recovery, there needs to be adequate service provision. It\u2019s been a slow start to the sixth day of hearings in the Ruby Princess special inquiry. But commissioner Bret Walker SC has passed some interesting comment on the responsibility of the NSW Port Authority. The inquiry is deciding whether or not to ask more questions of Cameron Butchart, who was the duty harbourmaster on 18 and 19 March. The legal team for Carnival Australia, who are the operators of the Ruby Princess, want to question Butchart on some of his evidence. But Walker said he does not consider Butchart to be a \u201cdecision-maker\u201d and his actions were not a \u201cpivotal event\u201d in the saga. \u201cNeither the docking nor the decision to permit disembarkation as it occurred was affected by what Mr Butchart told anybody,\u201d Walker said. He adds that there is \u201cno Flying Dutchman\u201d scenario \u2013 by which he means a scenario where the ship would never have docked at all. He says he\u2019s more interested in why passengers were allowed off the ship before test results came back, which is not the responsibility of the NSW Port Authority. \u201cI am not interested in exploring some supposedly superior outcome where the ship was not permitted to dock [at all] in Sydney on the 19th,\u201d he says. David Littleproud has been doing the rounds this morning, spruiking the $650m bushfire recovery fund just announced by the government. He was also very, very careful to point out that the states are in charge of the recovery. Here he is on the Seven Network this morning: What we\u2019ve tried to do is make sure we get the relief right first, and this is about the long-term recovery. We\u2019ve put out $1.3bn through the state governments who run the programs. We\u2019re working with them and helping them to get the money out the door quicker, getting people back into their homes, get the clean-up done quicker. We\u2019re not passing blame, in fact, we\u2019re putting on an additional 24 staff in the bushfire agency to help them get these programs out there quicker, to sit at people\u2019s kitchen tables and help them fill out the paperwork. But this is about the long-term recovery of them determining what it looks like. We didn\u2019t want it to be a Canberra-led recovery, we wanted a local-led community, and to build back better. And the best people to make that determination are the community themselves. With politics resuming its normal Auspol-ness, and the Eden-Monaro byelection campaigns whirring up, expect to hear those lines a lot more. The MPs are starting to arrive ahead of tomorrow\u2019s sitting. We are about an hour away from Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, making his announcement on how that state will ease lockdowns. Victoria\u2019s state of emergency expires tonight. The Eden-Monaro byelection has put the bushfire recovery back on the agenda \u2013 and truly, it is beyond time. There are still many, many families with no accommodation. Insurance issues. Landlines down. Mobile towers down. Closed roads and collapsed bridges. Cobargo was one of the communities hardest hit. Andrew Haydon, president of the Cobargo Tourist and Business Association says there is a feeling in the town that people are in \u201ca worse situation now, than they were immediately after the bushfires\u201d and with the pandemic, phone calls to authorities are no longer being returned: They all seem to think we\u2019ve all got computers, that we\u2019re all living OK again. There are people still living out of tents. There are people who don\u2019t have electricity. They don\u2019t understand. They always say, \u201cget on to this website or link or whatever\u201d but it is not happening. We still have a lot of infrastructure that hasn\u2019t been reconstructed. It\u2019s just \u2013 people, it\u2019s making people depressed. It\u2019s making people angry. There are people who are quite strong, that as time goes on, they\u2019re having mental health issues, and now with the coronavirus, all of our support, local mental health support, has basically gone. The locals don\u2019t want to talk to somebody in a glass castle in Sydney. It doesn\u2019t work. Doesn\u2019t work. US Marines will be returning to the Top End. In case you missed it, Linda Reynolds gave the all-clear (with physical distance caveats) for the annual rotation of US defence troops to commence (it was meant to be in March but was delayed because of Covid). Just remember, when restrictions are eased, all the health authorities are expecting infection numbers to go up. The lockdown hasn\u2019t meant Australia has eradicated the virus, just suppressed the infection rate to a point where the health system can cope. No new cases in Queensland Not sure what the intention was then, or what John Barilaro thought would happen, but here is Murph\u2019s much more elegant take on the whole sorry saga: NSW Nationals leader John Barilaro has the \u201cfull support\u201d of Gladys Berejiklian and the NSW government, despite helping to turn the Coalition\u2019s preselection for Eden-Monaro into an absolute circus, while the rest of the nation was focused on an international pandemic. Helpfully, the Nationals continue to make it all about them, while their communities suffer with poverty, natural disaster, ongoing drought, climate change and shrinking economic and social bases. Barilaro has already announced he\u2019ll be leaving NSW state politics in 2023, so he seems safe until then, although he has plenty of state colleagues from his own party pretty pissed at him for embarrassing the party (every branch needs its own Barnaby Joyce apparently. Must be in the secret Coalition agreement.) His federal colleague, David Littleproud, who has the job of bushfire recovery, as well as trying to inject some calm into the Nationals crazy, was not on the \u201cfull support\u2019 train when asked about Barilaro on ABC radio this morning: I think I\u2019ll leave that to the general public, but I don\u2019t think self-indulgence in the middle of pandemics and bushfires is what the public were looking for. It got away from all of us, we have to accept that, we have to accept the responsibility, understand it, have a good hard look at ourselves and make sure it never happens again. ... Let\u2019s be honest, that is not the behaviour we expect, during these periods or at any time. We are all better than that, they are anomalies, they are outliers, and I know that probably on reflection, it wasn\u2019t what John wanted to see happen and I\u2019ve heard him say that, on other broadcasts, so it is important we learn from this, put it behind us and get on with the job.\u201d Over the weekend Guardian Australia\u2019s Anne Davies wrote about the men in Gladys Berejiklian\u2019s team who \u201care indulging in a kind of sabotage that should have been left behind when they graduated from the Young Liberals or Young Nationals\u201d. Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann will give an economic statement to the parliament tomorrow, laying out what they know so far. We saw some of that last week in Frydenberg\u2019s press club address. The Australian Council of Social Services, Dr Cassandra Goldie says people on social security payments cannot be made the scapegoat: People cannot afford these huge cuts to income support, proposed by the government, which would take us back to the old, brutal rate of Newstart at just $40 a day. Let\u2019s not forget that on the old Newstart rate, people living on such little money were showering once a week to cut their energy bill, and 90% regularly skipped meals, as shown by our survey last year. The government says it has our backs but going ahead with these severe cuts to income support would be the opposite. You can read more here about the experts who are calling for the federal government to put aside ideology and establish a permanent equitable safety net for Australians: And just excuse me a minute as I attempt to wrap my head around this quote. It\u2019s been about 10 minutes and I am still trying to make sense of it, but I have always been a bit slow: [Bob] Katter said he would spend next week banging on the doors of as many ministers as possible, as well as gaining national publicity for the cause. \u201cThe people that make decisions for Australia out of Canberra live in a bubble and really without slashing into that bubble we will remain under the boot heel of Brisbane,\u201d he said. Bob Katter says he is being \u201cforced\u201d to travel to Canberra because north Queensland has not been quarantined from the rest of Queensland. From his release: For two months these North Queenslanders pleaded for a ban on people coming from a high contagion area into a no-contagion area. We are getting nowhere abusing the women who dictate to Queensland and their public health Tsar, Janette Young* who presides over the Queensland Health Department that sent coronavirus into the Cairns Base Hospital \u2013 Northern Australia\u2019s great fortress of protection. Quite independently of my own efforts nearly 150 doctors, that\u2019s almost every single doctor in North Queensland not employed by the health department, have signed the document urging the quarantining off of regional areas such as North Queensland. So Janette Young and the two Tsars who run Queensland know more than the accumulated wisdom of over 100 doctors?\u201d *for the record, it is Dr Jeannette Young You\u2019ll also find more information on Anthony Albanese\u2019s coming announcement, here (thanks to Daniel Hurst). A reminder for those looking for international Covid-19 news, you\u2019ll find all you could want, and more, over at our other daily blog: South Australians will also get some sit-down dining establishment time \u2013 as long as it is outside. From today, that state will allow outdoor dining, as well as open community services such as libraries and pools and churches, and reopen university and Tafe facilities for tutorials \u2013 but physical distancing restrictions remain in place. Michael Gunner just had a chat to ABC News Breakfast. The Northern Territory will ease restrictions even further from Friday, with residents able to go to a pub, cafe or other dining establishment, and actually sit down for a drink and meal with other patrons (as long as physical distance restrictions are still met and no one stays longer than two hours). But it will be some time before the borders are opened: It will be the last thing that we do. I have to say, based on how rest of the country is going, Australia is a success story here compared to the world. They may come down sooner than we think. It is based on how rest of Australia travels and how we can get on top of coronavirus in the rest of the country. Speaking of jobkeeper, Samantha Maiden of news.com.au just published this story: Gladys Berejiklian: Our results have allowed us to move forward and ease some restrictions on Friday. We will be starting to roll out more community information to make sure everybody is aware of what they can and can\u2019t do from Friday. We look forward to people respecting the restrictions and the easing of restrictions as we move forward. Pleasingly, today our schools go back to face-to-face teaching. I know this is a huge relief for families. It is a huge relief for the state government. We know how important it is for students to receive that face-to- face teaching. Whilst we have said, on average, students will go back for one day a week this week and next week, I am pleased to say, as far as year 12 is concerned, on average in our public schools, year 12 will be going back between three and four days this week. Significantly for year 12, it is a higher proportion and some schools are going back full-time in the public system for year 12. On average, it is around three and a half days face-to-face for year 12. We look forward to that number increasing next week and the week after that. It is Gladys o\u2019clock (all time is told through daily press conference and device battery levels now). The NSW premier says there has been one new case of Covid diagnosed in the past 24 hours, from 5,200 tests. Now that the federal government has moved into \u201cback to work time\u201d you will be hearing A LOT about the future of both the jobkeeper wage subsidy program and the jobseeker Covid allowance, which effectively doubled the unemployment benefit. Both are set to expire in September. But the economy both are designed to keep afloat will not be in any shape to support the millions of Australians who will still be out of work. The unemployment rate is predicted to double by Christmas. Still, there have been whispers both programs could be wound up BEFORE September. That seems ridiculous but every month seems like a year at the moment, so who knows. The calls to extend the programs are even louder but, so far, Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have stuck to the September expiry line. Dave Sharma, one of the few Coalition backbenchers trusted to speak on behalf of the government (you may have noticed Craig Kelly, Eric Abetz and other notable absences from your screens during this crisis) told Sky News this morning he saw the situation as a \u201cwait and see\u201d scenario, depending on what was happening in September. Labor\u2019s finance team of Jim Chalmers and Katy Gallagher said the latest Deloitte budget monitor pointed to a nation that couldn\u2019t afford to wait to learn what support would or would not be available in the last quarters of the year: The report warns against the rapid withdrawal of support programs including jobseeker and jobkeeper: \u201cJobkeeper should be phased out rather than cut out. And ditto the increase in the unemployment benefit seen in Jobseeker\u201d; \u201cIt will be critical to ensure the economy is at the right point in managing the public health crisis and the easing of restrictions so as to not create too large a shift from Jobkeeper to Jobseeker because businesses can\u2019t sustain reopening or afford to keep their employees\u201d; and \u201cThere is an obvious case to keep Jobseeker at a higher rate than NewStart\u201d The AFL Commission will meet later today to see work out when a return is possible. 11 June is the date it has circled but, as with everything at the moment, it really depends on the individual states. The Greens also plan on announcing an economic plan for the arts today. From Sarah Hanson-Young\u2019s release: The plan comprises three main elements including \u2018Creating Australia\u2019s Future\u2019 which would see artists in residence in every school and library across the country, the \u2018Billion Stories Fund\u2019 to kick start our local screen industry prioritising Australian stories and children\u2019s content, and \u2018Australia Live\u2019 which would inject funding into Australia\u2019s festival, music and live performance sector. Thousands of Australia\u2019s arts workers have been ineligible for the government\u2019s jobkeeper scheme because of the contract nature of their work. With subscriptions to arts organisations falling, the sector is in real crisis, with not a lot of ways out. The federal government has released its \u201cspectrum objectives\u201d for 850/900MHz bands. You\u2019ll find what they are looking for, here. Watch this space. The 5G battle is only just heating up. In Victoria, increased testing remains one of the linchpins to its plan to ease lockdown restrictions. Some 154,000 Victorians have been tested for Covid in the last two weeks alone. Today the government will announce new \u201crapid response\u201d teams which will be deployed in the event of a new outbreak of the virus, or at the first signs of a community cluster. Anyone with a sniffle is encouraged to get tested in Victoria, with the state hoping to have 50,000 more tests done over the next week. The new \u201coutbreak unit\u201d within the health department will head to areas suspected to be at risk. As the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said: The unit will include new rapid response outbreak squads, staffed by public health specialists and clinicians to ensure appropriate testing, contact tracing and deep cleaning is carried out as soon as a cluster is identified. The squads will also make proactive visits to high-risk facilities, businesses and industries, and work with local services on infection control and prevention, while also stepping in to quickly manage any high-risk cases should they occur. Mobile testing units will also be sent out to areas suspected at being at risk of a cluster. National income next financial year could fall nearly $200bn short of predictions in the previous budget update, according to a new report by Deloitte Access Economics. The budget monitor, released today, also estimates the underlying cash deficit could be $143bn this financial year and $132bn in the next. But the report argues that any push for rapid budget repair would be \u201cmisguided\u201d and there is a need to accept a further period of higher deficits, in part to fund more infrastructure spending. It also says the key problem Australia will face on the other side of the crisis is unemployment, so the budget\u2019s fight against the virus will have to morph into a fight against joblessness. That task may require scaled-down wage subsidies to continue in the hardest-hit small businesses even after the scheduled end of the jobkeeper scheme in September, while there is also an \u201cobvious case\u201d to ensure the jobseeker allowance remains higher than its previously low levels. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is due to provide an economic update this week but the full budget has been pushed back until October. Deloitte Access Economics has attempted to crunch the numbers based on the current state of play, although it heavily cautions that forecasts are subject to wide bands of uncertainty. Here are some of the highlights from the report: National income may fall $35bn below the previous Myefo projection in 2019-20, followed by \u201ca jaw-dropping shortfall\u201d of just under $200bn in 2020-21. Most of this gap is due to a shortfall in economic output, or production levels, while a small portion is due to ongoing weakness in wage and price gains. Unemployment is not expected to return to 5% until late 2024. Because of fewer workers and lower incomes, the government\u2019s takings from personal taxes are down $14bn compared with the previous forecast for 2019-20 and $37bn the following year. Welcome to another week of Covid-19 coverage \u2013 this week, with added parliament. It may be some time before Australia returns to anything even approaching what we knew as normal, but Australian politics is doing its best to return to a pre-Covid state. The Coalition continues to make a mess of its Eden-Monaro pre-selection, and sports rorts and issues involving Angus Taylor are slowly making their way back to headlines. Meanwhile, Labor is starting to firm up its policy standpoints, as the dust settles and the state of the economy becomes even clearer. At this stage, the one thing everyone can agree on is that, in terms of the economy, what is coming towards Australia is not great. Not great at all. Amid all that, helped along by the coming Eden-Monaro byelection, the government will also announce $650m in recovery funding for the communities hardest hit by the summer bushfires. The special commission established to investigate the Ruby Princess debacle will hold another hearing today, with questions to be asked about what the cruise company told the NSW Port Authority. And Daniel Andrews is expected to set out Victoria\u2019s mud map towards loosening restrictions, with that state expected to take a more conservative approach to stage one than has been laid out in the rest of the states and territories. We will have all of that as it happens, as more, as we navigate the latest day of announcements and politics. You have Amy Remeikis with you for the majority of the day. Ready?",

People will be back.\u201d</p> <p>Some were less reassured. Restaurants, cafes and bars, so much a part of the fabric of Paris, must wait until the end of the month to hear when they will be able to reopen \u2013 with presumably strict, but as yet unannounced, physical distancing rules.</p> <p>On the Rue de Navarin, La Belle Maison is one of four popular 9th arrondissement restaurants to have grouped together to offer a pre-ordered takeaway and delivery service, La Pantruchoise, that opened for the first time on Monday morning.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve taken lots of orders. We\u2019re actually pretty happy, and it\u2019s certainly great to be back,\u201d said the manager, Nicolas Chatellain, busy sealing take-out boxes. \u201cBut then we\u2019re very lucky: we\u2019re a local bistro, with loyal, local customers. For many, this lockdown has been a massive blow.\u201d</p> <p>As for the future, Chatellain said: \u201cWe have to wait. Could we be profitable with half the tables? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps if we start at 6pm and close at 1am. Will we be allowed, exceptionally, to open a terrace this summer? That would help. Right now, we just don\u2019t know. Nothing\u2019s normal any more.\u201d</p>",

At the locksmiths, St\u00e9phane Peyronnet \u2013 sticking strips of orange tape on the floor to ensure returning customers stayed a metre apart \u2013 had worked steadily through the lockdown but only on call-outs. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s the big day,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re an essential service. People will be back.\u201d Some were less reassured. Restaurants, cafes and bars, so much a part of the fabric of Paris, must wait until the end of the month to hear when they will be able to reopen \u2013 with presumably strict, but as yet unannounced, physical distancing rules. On the Rue de Navarin, La Belle Maison is one of four popular 9th arrondissement restaurants to have grouped together to offer a pre-ordered takeaway and delivery service, La Pantruchoise, that opened for the first time on Monday morning. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken lots of orders. We\u2019re actually pretty happy, and it\u2019s certainly great to be back,\u201d said the manager, Nicolas Chatellain, busy sealing take-out boxes. \u201cBut then we\u2019re very lucky: we\u2019re a local bistro, with loyal, local customers. For many, this lockdown has been a massive blow.\u201d As for the future, Chatellain said: \u201cWe have to wait. Could we be profitable with half the tables? I don\u2019t know. Perhaps if we start at 6pm and close at 1am. Will we be allowed, exceptionally, to open a terrace this summer? That would help. Right now, we just don\u2019t know. Nothing\u2019s normal any more.\u201d",

On a daily basis, I\u2019ve been sent some vile comments. But I have to say, so many people have thanked me &amp; appreciated the coverage.\u201d Rashid said he had spoken out after receiving regular abuse while reporting on the disproportionate number of Covid-19 deaths in the BAME community. \u201cI am used to receiving racist abuse, unfortunately, but I\u2019ve been getting it in such volumes recently that it has really shocked me,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of threats and the abuse and the nastiness is directed at this one story about BME disproportionality.\u201d Rashid said he had reported the abuse to Instagram and Twitter but did not hold out much hope that anything would change. \u201cI do think social media companies could do more to stop this stuff,\u201d he said. Support from his employers at Sky had been brilliant, he said. \u201cThey checked in with me and said, \u2018we can escalate this\u2019. But I don\u2019t want to take it further. A lot of BME journalists across the board get this sort of abuse and they don\u2019t tend to talk about it. But I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge that this is happening.\u201d",

It urged employers to help their staff avoid travelling at the busiest times of day. Passengers should cover their faces, carry a hand sanitiser and wash their hands before and after travelling. </p> <p>Hand sanitiser points will be installed over the coming weeks at every tube, bus and rail station. TfL has already introduced more frequent deep cleaning of its transport network using hospital-grade cleaning substances that kill viruses.<br></p> <p>Passengers should maintain a 2m distance \u201cwherever possible\u201d. This means that TfL will only be able to carry 13% to 15% of the normal number of passengers on the tube and buses. It will put up new social-distancing posters at bus stops, stations and in shelters, and create two-metre floor markings on platforms at stations.<br></p> <p>The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said all TfL frontline staff will be offered basic face masks from today. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I urge all Londoners to rethink the way they travel.

Golf or tennis, for example, can take place, but football tournaments cannot. The spa offer will be adapted and childcare will be organised according to new standards.</p> <p><strong>7) Expansion of disinfectant dispensers</strong>: The number of dispensers will be significantly increased so that guests and employees can disinfect their hands at all important contact points. For example, all locations where food and drink is offered, sports facilities and in the lobby area.</p> <p><strong>8) Room cleaning</strong>: Extensive new cleaning practices will be put in place. All rooms will be thoroughly deep cleaned before the arrival of guests. The most frequently used areas, such as bathrooms, and most used devices and appliances like TV remote controls will receive particular attention.</p> <p><strong>9) Restriction of self-service</strong>: Self-service offers such as buffets will be reduced to a minimum.

      "bodyText": "After initial gains, European stock markets headed lower today amid fears over a second wave of coronavirus infections in some countries that have relaxed their lockdowns, such as South Korea, China, Germany and Lebanon. In London, airline and energy stocks have been worst hit, with easyJet the biggest faller, after the UK government announced a new measure to quarantine passengers arriving from abroad by air. Meanwhile, Halfords shares and sales have surged during the lockdown, with Boris Johnson urging people to walk or cycle instead of using public transport. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down 0.16% at 5,924 Germany\u2019s Dax down 0.92% at 10,803 France\u2019s CAC down 1.35% at 4,488 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.2% at 17,404 Wall Street is also down. Dow Jones down 0.82% at 24,131 Nasdq down 0.05% at 9,116 S&amp;P 500 down 0.63% at 2,911 Oil prices have tumbled, with Brent crude now down 0.77% at $30.73 a barrel. Good-bye and thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane said there is a risk that the coronavirus pandemic will cause a long-term hit to spending by businesses struggling with higher debts, and households worried about their job security. He said on a Royal Economic Society webcast: All crises leave scars and this crisis assuredly will be no exception. Last week, the central bank said Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by 14% this year, which would be the worst slump since the early 1700s, due to the government\u2019s coronavirus shutdown, before bouncing back with 15% growth in 2021. The Bank warned that it could be even worse. On a brighter note, Haldane said he had seen signs of stabilisation in some spending measures recently, although they remained at very low levels. He added: Apparently Spotify downloads of the REM song \u201cIt\u2019s the end of the world as we know it\u201d peaked two weeks after the lockdown began and have been declining since. So perhaps, perhaps, we are seeing some stabilisation. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell more than 200 points at the open, or 0.87%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost more than 20 points, or 0.8% and the Nasdaq opened 60 points lower, or 0.65%. In other news, a home coronavirus antibody test developed by the UK biotech Mologic is expected to be mass produced from June. It will allow people to test themselves at home using a drop of blood, within just 10 minutes. The home testing kit will be manufactured by BioSure (which created the first self-test for HIV). Mologic is seeking fast-track approval from UK regulators, including the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Approval by the MHRA would mean that the test can be procured for the NHS. The test checks for antibodies in the blood to determine whether that person has previously had Covid-19, rather than whether they have it at the moment. It is still unclear whether someone who has had the virus in the past can be reinfected. Mologic, based in Bedford, received a \u00a31m grant from the UK government to develop the test. Unite, Britain\u2019s largest union, is calling for a full public inquiry into why low-paid workers appear to be most at risk of dying from Covid-19, after new figures were released by the Office for National Statistics. The highest number of deaths (131) were recorded in the social care sector with a total of 131 deaths recorded, followed by taxi drivers (77). The ONS also found that 30 bus drivers died of Covid-19, 29 lorry drivers and 33 van drivers. Male workers had a notably increased mortality rates in a number of professions such as security guards, of whom 64 workers had died. Chefs also had a very high rate of death, with 37 having died of coronavirus. Unite assistant general secretary Diana Holland said: These figures are alarming and it is imperative that we learn all the lessons possible now and when this pandemic is over that there is a full public inquiry into these deaths. We must never forget this is not about statistics, but each and every death is an individual tragedy where a loved one has died. While lessons need to be learned for the future, it is immediately imperative that all workplaces examine these figures and urgently revisit how more effective measures can be taken to protect workers who have remained in work or who are returning to the workplace. Thorough risk assessments are vital and government needs to make sure they happen. This is only an early snapshot of this dreadful disease but it is clear that lower paid workers often from a BAME background have been at the greatest risk of dying during the pandemic. After gains in early trading, European shares are heading lower again as optimism on the latest easing of coronavirus lockdowns in several countries faded, and gave way to fears over a second wave of infections. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index down some 33 points, or 0.55%, at 5,903 Germany\u2019s Dax down 1.2% at 10,770 France\u2019s CAC down 1.78% at 4,468 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 0.54% at 17,344 Travel and energy stocks are among the biggest fallers. Wall Street is expected to open lower after Friday\u2019s rally, with the S&amp;P 500 futures falling nearly 1%. Guy Miller, chief market strategist at Zurich Insurance Company, told Thomson Reuters: If we do have a second wave and lockdowns, that\u2019s almost the worst outcome from an economic perspective. He said that would \u201cpostpone business investment indefinitely\u201d and keep consumer spending weak. Burger King UK will reopen more than two thirds of its restaurants by the end of June, reports my colleague Rebecca Smithers. The fast food chain intends to reopen a further 35 restaurants from today, and 72 restaurants from 18 May, across England, Wales and Scotland, as part of its continued phased reopening plan. It started reopening outlets in mid-April. In just over a month, the fast food chain will have reopened 350 locations for delivery and drive thru -- 68% of the restaurants it has in the UK. Oil prices are heading lower amid fears of a fresh wave of coronavirus infections in some countries -- China, South Korea and German. Traders worry that this could lead to restrictions being introduced, which would translate into lower demand for oil. Brent crude, the global benchmark, has lost 89 cents to $30.08 a barrel, a fall of 2.87%, while US crude fell 65 cents, or 2.6%, to $24.09. UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo says: Concern over a second wave, the nearly 50% year-on-year drop in Indian oil demand in April and likely further oil inventory builds this week are likely weighing on oil prices at the start of the week. Only 374 oil rigs are now operating in America, the lowest number since 1940, Thomson Reuters reported, citing data from energy services company Baker Hughes. By another count, the number fell below 300. The commute in London is going to be very different in coming weeks as people return to work, according to Transport for London. It said the number of pepole travelling on its network will cut by at least 85%, as it unveiled a series of new measures. On Sunday night, Boris Johnson urged construction and manufacturing workers to return to work, along with people who cannot work from home. TfL stressed that Londoners must continue working from home wherever possible to limit numbers on public transport; people should walk or cycle and shop local. It urged employers to help their staff avoid travelling at the busiest times of day. Passengers should cover their faces, carry a hand sanitiser and wash their hands before and after travelling. Hand sanitiser points will be installed over the coming weeks at every tube, bus and rail station. TfL has already introduced more frequent deep cleaning of its transport network using hospital-grade cleaning substances that kill viruses. Passengers should maintain a 2m distance \u201cwherever possible\u201d. This means that TfL will only be able to carry 13% to 15% of the normal number of passengers on the tube and buses. It will put up new social-distancing posters at bus stops, stations and in shelters, and create two-metre floor markings on platforms at stations. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said all TfL frontline staff will be offered basic face masks from today. I urge all Londoners to rethink the way they travel. Please avoid peak times, wear a non-medical covering over your nose and mouth and carry a hand sanitiser. By rapidly rolling out more space for walking and cycling through our London Streetspace plan we are enabling many more journeys to be made through these sustainable means which is crucial to our city\u2019s recovery. TheCityUK, a lobby group for the financial services sector, has written to the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, to warn that UK businesses are racking up an \u201cunsustainable\u201d debt mountain of \u00a390bn to \u00a3105bn because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Loans issued under the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) could contribute \u00a310bn to \u00a320bn. To address the debt pile, firms will need to issue new equity and/or restructure their borrowings, TheCityUK says. The group says: If left unresolved, these levels of unsustainable debt could inhibit employment, research and development, investment and ultimately a smooth economic recovery back to growth. Here is some reaction to the 28% slump in Italian industrial production, reported earlier. It was worse than expected and means that the fall in first-quarter GDP could be bigger than initially estimated. Nicola Nobile, economist at Oxford Economics, says: The Italian industry recorded a historically weak March, with output dropping by 28% over the month. The decline was common across all sectors, but the 50% drop in transport equipment was just astonishing. In April, we expect a similar collapse in industrial activity, with the level at half of that of 2019. Moreover, after today\u2019s number we do not rule out a downward revision to Q1 GDP, which was reported at -4.7% q/q in the flash estimate two weeks ago. Walsh said the airline group will have to review its plans to restart a significant number of flights in July if travellers are quarantined upon arrival in the UK, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. Last week, IAG said British Airways and its other airlines, Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, planned to run about 1,000 flights a day between July and September, a significant increase from April and May. Walsh told the transport committee: There\u2019s nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say yesterday. We had been planning to resume on a pretty significant basis of flying in July. I think we\u2019ll have to review that based on what the prime minister said yesterday. Walsh has questioned why the UK plans to impose a lengthy quarantine period for travellers arriving by air. The introduction of a 14-day quarantine period for air travel is a surprise because it appears that the government is not going to apply a quarantine period for people who come into the UK by other means of transport. I don\u2019t understand that but maybe the prime minister will be able to clarify the science behind that. It seems strange to me. But we will have to review the impact of that and make an assessment in terms of the capacity that we\u2019re likely to operate if a quarantine period applies. At this stage, I would imagine that our capacity into and out of the UK would be pretty minimal in that event. Walsh added that the UK\u2019s job retention scheme will buy it just 10 extra days of liquidity (rather than months), and said the company needs a big restructuring in the long run. We are embarking on a restructuring and I\u2019ve made it clear that this is group-wide restructuring. It\u2019s not specific to British Airways. It\u2019s group-wide restructuring in the face of the greatest crisis that the airline industry and the airlines within IAG have faced. The FTSE 100 is now trading some 20 points lower at 5,915, a drop of 0.35%, after rising earlier in early trading to close to 6,000. Optimism over the UK government\u2019s lockdown easing has dissipated, especially as the latest measures were somewhat vague. We are still awaiting clarity on the quarantine period for travellers arriving in Britain from abroad, for example. The boss of IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, said this morning that the company is burning through cash quickly and is struggling to raise more funds, as its planes remain grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic. Willie Walsh told MPs on the transport committee: We\u2019ve probably exhausted every avenue that I can think of at this stage to shore up our liquidity. The cash has been reducing significantly and that will be the case as we go through May, June and July. We\u2019re not taking in any revenue. Tui, the world\u2019s biggest travel firm, has laid out a 10-point plan for reopening its hotels - which could mean the end of the self-service buffet and football tournaments at holiday destinations. 1) Online check-in: Holidaymakers check in in online via the hotel\u2019s website or via their smartphone. 2) Distance rule: In public areas such as in the restaurants, corridors or gyms, all employees are required to keep a distance of 1.5 to 2m between them and the guests. For example, tables in restaurants will only be cleaned when guests have vacated them. 3) Personnel planning: Staff will work together in fixed teams in order to reconstruct possible infection chains. 4) Restaurant: To limit the number of guests in restaurants, capacities will be significantly reduced. Tables will be set up at a minimum distance of 1.5m apart. 5) Extension of opening hours: In order to provide sufficient space for all guests, the opening hours of restaurants and other hotel facilities will be extended. 6) Entertainment and activities: Only events, sports and entertainments involving a small number of participants and without close contact will be made available. Golf or tennis, for example, can take place, but football tournaments cannot. The spa offer will be adapted and childcare will be organised according to new standards. 7) Expansion of disinfectant dispensers: The number of dispensers will be significantly increased so that guests and employees can disinfect their hands at all important contact points. For example, all locations where food and drink is offered, sports facilities and in the lobby area. 8) Room cleaning: Extensive new cleaning practices will be put in place. All rooms will be thoroughly deep cleaned before the arrival of guests. The most frequently used areas, such as bathrooms, and most used devices and appliances like TV remote controls will receive particular attention. 9) Restriction of self-service: Self-service offers such as buffets will be reduced to a minimum. Wherever possible, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks. 10) Training by independent auditors: Tui will train all employees in its own hotels. The first training documents will be made available this week. Sebastian Ebel, the member of the Tui\u2019s executive board responsible for Holiday Experiences, says: Customer surveys clearly indicate that safety and hygiene will be of paramount importance for holidaymakers after the lockdown. With our group-wide, integrated health and safety management system, we can ensure that our hotels meet guests\u2019 high expectations and offer the best possible protection against infections during these unusual times. We are laying the foundations for an agile and safe return to business so we can be ready to offer our unique holiday experiences again as soon as possible. Time for a mid-morning summary. Many Asian stock markets pushed higher, as investors were cheered by more countries starting to re-open their economies. Chinese car sales rose for the first time in almost two years in April, up 4.4% from a year ago to 2.07m vehicles, although car sales are still expected to be down 15% this year. Markets were also lifted by comments from the People\u2019s Bank of China over the weekend that it would take \u201cmore powerful policies\u201d to support the economy, and the US and China restarting trade talks. Also, Disneyland Shanghai has reopened. European markets also got off to a positive start, but are now down again, as optimism over the easing of lockdown restrictions in France, Belgium, Greece and the UK faded. In London, airline stocks easyJet and British Airways owner IAG have fallen, after Boris Johnson confirmed that travellers arriving in Britain by air will have to self-isolate. EasyJet has tumbled more than 8% while IAG is down 3.3%. Shares in Halfords, Britain\u2019s biggest bike and e-scooter retailer, on the other hand, have surged because the government is encouraging people to cycle to work. French stocks took a hit as Airbus dropped 3.6%, after Australia\u2019s Qantas Airways said it dit not expect to take delivery of any new planes in the near term. Even so, European shares have recovered by more than a quarter since their mid-March lows. Some European stock markets are also trading lower now. Germany\u2019s Dax is down 0.1% and France\u2019s CAC has lost 0.56% while Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is still up 0.39%. The FTSE 100 index has just dipped into negative territory, as optimism over a cautious easing of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown starts to fade. It is trading 5.5 points lower at 5930, a drop of 0.09%. Here is our full story on Heathrow calling for the government to urgently lay out a road map for airports to restart more flights. EasyJet is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index, with the shares tumbling about 7%. Analysts at Citi reckon the budget airline may have to raise between \u00a3700m and \u00a31bn, after Boris Johnson said the UK government would impose a quarantine on travellers arriving in Britain. The quarantine period is expected to be 14 days and could be imposed as soon as the end of May. British Airways owner IAG may also have to raise funds, the analysts said. IAG shares initially fell more than 4% and were later down 2.5%. The analysts said: Last night\u2019s initiative by the government will have two significant consequences for the UK airline industry: The sizeable monthly cash burn rates will persist through summer [and] a number of customers and industry bodies will increase the volume on their demands for immediate cash refunds to consumers. Back in the UK, shares in Halfords have been boosted by the government\u2019s announcement that people should cycle to work, if possible, to avoid close contact on public transport. Shares in Halfords jumped as much as 24%, and were later up 18% at 178.7p. It is Britain\u2019s biggest cycling retailer and runs 450 repair centres, and is also the market leader in electric scooters. On Saturday, the transport secretary Grant Shapps said roads would be changed to accommodate more cyclists. He also said e-scooter trials would be brought forward, and rental e-scooters could hit UK roads as early as June. Electric scooters \u2013 which can travel at up to 15.5mph \u2013 are currently banned on roads and pavements in the UK. In Italy, industrial production plummeted by 28.4% in March from the previous month, worse than expected, as factories shut because of the coronavirus pandemic. Connor Campbell, analyst at trading platform Spreadex, says: Given the market\u2019s utter lack of interest in the recent job losses in the US, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that a purely positive view was taken of what was announced by Johnson in his faux-Churchillian manner on Sunday, allowing the FTSE to bound out of the gates. An element of catch-up is also involved, the UK index making up for missing last Friday, a session that saw the Dow Jones surge higher on a marginally better than forecast nonfarm jobs report. Better than forecast in this case meaning only 20.5 million jobs were lost in April, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7%, not the 16.0% expected. Still feeling the effects of this, the Dow is looking for another 150 points when trading starts stateside this afternoon. Let\u2019s take another look at the stock markets. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 index up 0.7% at 5,980 Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.66% at 10,976 France\u2019s CAC up 0.26% at 4,562 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1% at 17,626 Spain\u2019s Ibex up 0.79% at 6,837 More people are choosing simpler funerals in coronavirus times, according to the funeral services firm Dignity. It says: In April \u2026 the proportion of clients choosing a simple funeral compared to a full service funeral has increased dramatically to approximately 60% compared to the 20% seen in the first quarter. The company says the number of deaths rose 1% to 161,000 from 159,000 in the first three months of the year. Since then, the UK recorded more than 20,000 deaths in a single week, the highest since the beginning of 2000. But Dignity\u2019s profits have fallen, as it conducted more simple funerals and stopped providing church services and limousines because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its underlying profits fell to \u00a319.4m in the first quarter from \u00a321.7m a year earlier. The firm adds that the number of deaths could fall back in the next couple of years: Should 2020 witness a large number of incremental deaths, beyond the 600,000 originally anticipated by the Office for National Statistics, then it is possible that 2021 and 2022 could experience a lower number of deaths than in 2019. The group will not speculate on the most likely outcome. Heathrow has called for the government to set out a plan to re-open borders, so airports and airlines can restart more flights, after Boris Johnson confirmed travellers will have to self-isolate upon arrival in the UK. It is not clear how long the quarantine will last or when it will be brought in, but airlines have been told that it will be a 14-day quarantine period. The London airport, the busiest in Europe in normal times, said in a statement that the quarantine plan would effectively close the UK\u2019s borders, resulting in even lower passenger numbers than the 200,000 seen in April. The budget carrier easyJet urged the government to keep the quarantine only for a short period. A spokesperson says: Quarantine requirements for passengers should only be in place for a short period, while the UK remains in lockdown. Aviation and tourism bosses have already warned that the 14-day quarantine plan would be a \u201cnightmare\u201d for the travel industry. European shares are also pushing higher: Germany\u2019s Dax has gained 0.4%, France\u2019s CAC is up 0.2% and Spain\u2019s Ibex has opened 0.77% higher. And we\u2019re off. The FTSE 100 index in London has opened higher, rising some 45 points, or 077%, to 5982. We are still waiting for more details on the lockdown easing in the UK. Boris Johnson\u2019s television address was quickly condemned as divisive and confusing from across the political spectrum. Meanwhile, there is a new cluster of coronavirus cases in Wuhan, prompting fears of a fresh wave of infections in China. And South Korea is battling to contain a fresh outbreak at night clubs and bars. You can read more on our coronavirus live news blog. Cafes and restaurants in the UK will start to reopen from July \u2013 but pubs were notably excluded from the plans to reopen some of the hospitality industry, fuelling worries that nearly half could be driven out of business. The UK\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan has changed to \u201cstay alert\u201d. In the UK, people will be allowed to spend unlimited time outdoors from Wednesday, and can drive to beauty spots across the country. Holiday resorts across the country are now cautiously preparing to open at the end of May. However, the wider travel industry will be hit by Johnson\u2019s announcement of a quarantine period for (nearly) all people arriving in the UK by air (French passengers will be exempt, Downing Street later clarified). The Institute of Travel and Tourism warned that a lengthy quarantine would be a \u201cnightmare\u201d that would badly hurt a sector already in meltdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors have been cheered by news of more countries reopening their economies, shrugging off fears of a second wave of Covid-19 after a pickup in new infections in South Korea and Germany. Asian stocks pushed higher, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei rising 1.4% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng up 1.7%. Wall Street rallied on Friday as the latest jobless data were not quite as bad as feared. In France, millions of people will emerge from the country\u2019s lockdown today, when shops, hair salons, primary schools and nurseries reopen. New Zealand announced further relaxation measures: it will open malls, cafes, cinemas and gyms from Thursday, and schools from next Monday. Belgium and Greece will also ease their lockdowns today. In the UK, Boris Johnson presented the government\u2019s plans for a gradual easing of the Covid-19 lockdown last night, which means primary schools in England will partially reopen from 1 June, along with some shops. Manufacturers and construction workers have been urged to return to work, and all others who cannot work from home (but they shouldn\u2019t use public transport). We could see a bounce in the FTSE 100 index today, after UK markets were closed for VE Day last Friday. It is tipped to open 55 points higher. European markets are also expected to rise at the open, with Germany\u2019s Dax being called more than 100 points higher. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: The shocking moves that were seen in global equity markets in February and March reflected the views that economies were to be severely hit by the Covid-19 crisis, but in recent weeks a number of countries have taken steps to reopen aspects of their economies and that progress has fuelled the bullish sentiment in equities. Yesterday, prime minister Johnson mapped out plans to loosen the UK\u2019s lockdown restrictions. Workers in construction and manufacturing could potentially recommence work in the near term, so that is likely to boost investment confidence in London-listed stocks. Equity markets in Asia gained ground overnight on the back of optimism in relation to countries loosening their lockdown restrictions, and in turn European indices are tipped to open higher. South Korea and Germany reported an increase in new infections in the wake of their restrictions being eased. This is something that traders should be mindful of as it might curtail the reopening of other economies for fear of a second wave of cases.

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has stepped in to try to find a way out of a damaging clash between Germany and Brussels after the EU threatened to bring infringement proceedings over a ruling by the country\u2019s constitutional court. The German chancellor stressed that the dispute was solvable, after the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, issued an unusual statement on Sunday warning of possible legal action against Berlin. Von der Leyen, a former German defence minister, made her announcement after Germany\u2019s federal constitutional court set aside a 2018 European court of justice (ECJ) ruling and questioned the legality of a European monetary policy designed to maintain stability in the eurozone. Unless it is proved proportionate, the judges said the Deutsche Bundesbank, the country\u2019s central bank, must stop cooperating with a European Central Bank (ECB) scheme that has been bulk-buying government bonds within three months. The constitutional court\u2019s ruling amounted to the first time a national court has declared an ECJ judgment invalid, posing a direct threat to the uniform application of EU law. The ECJ\u2019s ruling in 2018 that the bond buying was legal was described by the German constitutional court last week as \u201cnot comprehensible\u201d. An EU official said: \u201cThis raises a couple of fundamental issues \u2026 first is the authority of a judgment of the European court of justice which has definitely ruled on the validity of the decisions of the ECB. This goes to the very basis of the European Union. The European Union is based on law, on agreement, on the common rules we have.\u201d The German finance ministry said on Monday that the bank would comply with the constitutional court\u2019s ruling and denied claims that the ECJ\u2019s authority had been challenged. \u201cWe will meet these requirements,\u201d a spokesman told a regular government news conference. Experts have said the ruling risks undermining the ECB\u2019s authority and its ability to protect the eurozone\u2019s financial system during a crisis such as the one triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. The ECB has injected billions of euros into the reserves of high street banks across the eurozone\u2019s 19 member states since 2014 to encourage them to lend to small businesses. The bank\u2019s president, Christine Lagarde, said last month that the pandemic meant a fresh round of stimulus was necessary. Merkel told her party members on Monday that the issue had been complicated by comments from Poland\u2019s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, welcoming the German ruling as \u201cone of the most important rulings in the history of the European Union\u201d. The ECJ recently ruled that changes by the Polish government to the retirement age of the country\u2019s judges and the granting of power to the government to choose which members of the judiciary could continue in post were contrary to EU law. Merkel told her party members that a clash with Brussels could be avoided if the ECB illustrated the necessity of its bond-buying scheme. An infringement proceeding, if launched, could take years to come to fruition and could ultimately lead to huge fines for contravening EU law. A commission spokesman said dialogue had been opened but declined to offer a time by when the launching of such a measure would be agreed upon by the commission\u2019s college of 27 commissioners. He said: \u201cThe whole aim of the commission is to find a solution to this kind of situation.

      "body": "<p>Well, it\u2019s clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">what we have to do</a> then: go outside, but don\u2019t go outside, start to socialise again but not with more than one person and not at a distance of less than two metres, and go to work but don\u2019t go to work, and don\u2019t go on the bus if you have to go to work, but if you do go to work don\u2019t get the bus, please, and if you have to work (and you can! And should! But don\u2019t) then drive yourself there. Fines will be increased for rule-breaking. Nobody on Earth has any idea what the rules actually are. Just know that fines are looming, somehow, for something. So to clarify: work is bad, buses are bad, rules are bad, work is good, rules don\u2019t exist, fines are everywhere, fines are nowhere, disorder reigns. </p> <p>The overwhelming response to Boris Johnson\u2019s Sunday night address was \u201csorry, what?\u201d. Thankfully, on Monday the government issued more clarified guidance about wearing face coverings in public and doing your laundry more regularly. But it must be said, a lot of it still lives in a netherzone of \u201cpotentially\u201d and \u201cnot always possibles\u201d.</p> <p>The significant question is whether all this has finally pushed the pandemic strategy over into the container marked \u201cshitshow\u201d or not? Because I have this recurring fear that, somehow, history is going to remember Johnson heroically, as a brave patriot dragging this country out of the pandemic by the scruff of its ruddy neck, and that anyone who survives the next year in Britain will speak of him as such, glad enough to do it simply in exchange for not being dead. This is more a plea to the historians reading back about this moment among the strewn remains of Britain in 80 or 90 years\u2019 time: no, genuinely, please believe me. He messed this up. From start to finish, he messed this all up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/anglo-american-coronavirus-crisis\">It's no accident Britain and America are the world's biggest coronavirus losers | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So to Sunday, and The Great Obfuscation. The thing is, we had a clear public health message that, beyond the odd VE Day conga, broadly worked to keep us indoors: \u201cStay home, protect the NHS, save lives.\u201d But you\u2019ve noticed it over the past couple of weeks, a rustle on the wind, a groundswell of cabin fever: people demanding lockdown be eased because they are bored of looking after their own children and want to buy compost again.</p> <p>Changing the message to the chewed-up meaninglessness of \u201cStay alert, control the virus, save lives\u201d just takes the onus off \u201cstaying home\u201d, and the \u201cstaying home\u201d bit felt quite vital. Remember when coronavirus loomed and Italy was being held up as the anti-example of how bad a pandemic could get, and we were told: \u201cIt\u2019s fine to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/cheltenham-cited-boris-johnson-twickenham-trip-to-support-festival-go-ahead-horse-racing\">go to Cheltenham</a> so long as you sing God Save the Queen while you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWfZGdLeDl4\">wash your hands </a>there\u201d? Impossibly, it seems like our messaging has gone backwards from that.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s Sunday night address started fairly well, to be fair to him, before he introduced the threat-level graphic stolen from the Nando\u2019s peri-peri sauce-meter and started sketching a rough idea, with a logo of a ticket and a takeaway frappuccino cup, that we might be able to go to the cinema again in July. (Angela Merkel, whose country is the leading light of European public health management right now, would have probably considered a July-time cinema trip when she was cautiously relaxing lockdown measures to be \u201cein bit much\u201d.) In among the meaningless graphics and the complete obliteration of clarity, he did manage to pay lip service to the most significant agitators of lockdown: people who say \u201cfreedom!\u201d a lot, people who say \u201cthe economy!\u201d a lot, and builders, who as best I can tell, have been working throughout the lockdown anyway.</p> <p>Stay alert, then. Are you alert right now? I\u2019m coiled like a spring that doesn\u2019t know which way to bounce. Because Sunday night\u2019s address gave us two concepts entirely at odds with each other: the first, that we have slowly wrested control of the virus and turned down the infamous R, but need to be constantly wary of a dreadful second wave; and, also, a deliberate opening of a void-sized grey area in government guidance, giving the public a far looser idea of what they are and are allowed to do, which means that the infamous R<em> </em>will obviously increase in a few weeks. All this means that \u2013 when we do suffer a second wave \u2013 the government can just pull out a photograph of me legally sunbathing in a park and say, \u201cit\u2019s his fault\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/public-advised-wear-face-masks-coronavirus-lockdown-easing-plan-for-england\">Public advised to wear face coverings under lockdown easing plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It does seem odd that Britain has now cleaved into two half-Britains. In one corner are those fearful that a new and unclear loosening of the regulatory structure means employers can rush service-facing workers back into employment despite it being dangerous for them to do so, the same people who have been worried for weeks about the nation\u2019s supply of PPE. In the other corner: people who really want to go the garden centre again.</p> <p>And the garden centre lot are winning. In a fascinating article over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/health/coronavirus-plague-pandemic-history.html\">the New York Times theorised</a> that pandemics end one of two ways: medically, with a vaccine or plummeting death rate, or socially, when the wave of panic and fear over the disease starts to wane. We\u2019ve been in lockdown for a measly little seven weeks, we\u2019ve got the highest death toll in Europe, and already we\u2019re unafraid enough of the pandemic to demand our legal right to go to Homebase again. I hope history doesn\u2019t laugh at us for this.</p> <p>\u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant</p>",

      "bodyText": "Well, it\u2019s clear what we have to do then: go outside, but don\u2019t go outside, start to socialise again but not with more than one person and not at a distance of less than two metres, and go to work but don\u2019t go to work, and don\u2019t go on the bus if you have to go to work, but if you do go to work don\u2019t get the bus, please, and if you have to work (and you can! And should! But don\u2019t) then drive yourself there. Fines will be increased for rule-breaking. Nobody on Earth has any idea what the rules actually are. Just know that fines are looming, somehow, for something. So to clarify: work is bad, buses are bad, rules are bad, work is good, rules don\u2019t exist, fines are everywhere, fines are nowhere, disorder reigns. The overwhelming response to Boris Johnson\u2019s Sunday night address was \u201csorry, what?\u201d. Thankfully, on Monday the government issued more clarified guidance about wearing face coverings in public and doing your laundry more regularly. But it must be said, a lot of it still lives in a netherzone of \u201cpotentially\u201d and \u201cnot always possibles\u201d. The significant question is whether all this has finally pushed the pandemic strategy over into the container marked \u201cshitshow\u201d or not? Because I have this recurring fear that, somehow, history is going to remember Johnson heroically, as a brave patriot dragging this country out of the pandemic by the scruff of its ruddy neck, and that anyone who survives the next year in Britain will speak of him as such, glad enough to do it simply in exchange for not being dead. This is more a plea to the historians reading back about this moment among the strewn remains of Britain in 80 or 90 years\u2019 time: no, genuinely, please believe me. He messed this up. From start to finish, he messed this all up. So to Sunday, and The Great Obfuscation. The thing is, we had a clear public health message that, beyond the odd VE Day conga, broadly worked to keep us indoors: \u201cStay home, protect the NHS, save lives.\u201d But you\u2019ve noticed it over the past couple of weeks, a rustle on the wind, a groundswell of cabin fever: people demanding lockdown be eased because they are bored of looking after their own children and want to buy compost again. Changing the message to the chewed-up meaninglessness of \u201cStay alert, control the virus, save lives\u201d just takes the onus off \u201cstaying home\u201d, and the \u201cstaying home\u201d bit felt quite vital. Remember when coronavirus loomed and Italy was being held up as the anti-example of how bad a pandemic could get, and we were told: \u201cIt\u2019s fine to go to Cheltenham so long as you sing God Save the Queen while you wash your hands there\u201d? Impossibly, it seems like our messaging has gone backwards from that. Johnson\u2019s Sunday night address started fairly well, to be fair to him, before he introduced the threat-level graphic stolen from the Nando\u2019s peri-peri sauce-meter and started sketching a rough idea, with a logo of a ticket and a takeaway frappuccino cup, that we might be able to go to the cinema again in July. (Angela Merkel, whose country is the leading light of European public health management right now, would have probably considered a July-time cinema trip when she was cautiously relaxing lockdown measures to be \u201cein bit much\u201d.) In among the meaningless graphics and the complete obliteration of clarity, he did manage to pay lip service to the most significant agitators of lockdown: people who say \u201cfreedom!\u201d a lot, people who say \u201cthe economy!\u201d a lot, and builders, who as best I can tell, have been working throughout the lockdown anyway. Stay alert, then. Are you alert right now? I\u2019m coiled like a spring that doesn\u2019t know which way to bounce. Because Sunday night\u2019s address gave us two concepts entirely at odds with each other: the first, that we have slowly wrested control of the virus and turned down the infamous R, but need to be constantly wary of a dreadful second wave; and, also, a deliberate opening of a void-sized grey area in government guidance, giving the public a far looser idea of what they are and are allowed to do, which means that the infamous R will obviously increase in a few weeks. All this means that \u2013 when we do suffer a second wave \u2013 the government can just pull out a photograph of me legally sunbathing in a park and say, \u201cit\u2019s his fault\u201d. It does seem odd that Britain has now cleaved into two half-Britains. In one corner are those fearful that a new and unclear loosening of the regulatory structure means employers can rush service-facing workers back into employment despite it being dangerous for them to do so, the same people who have been worried for weeks about the nation\u2019s supply of PPE. In the other corner: people who really want to go the garden centre again. And the garden centre lot are winning. In a fascinating article over the weekend, the New York Times theorised that pandemics end one of two ways: medically, with a vaccine or plummeting death rate, or socially, when the wave of panic and fear over the disease starts to wane. We\u2019ve been in lockdown for a measly little seven weeks, we\u2019ve got the highest death toll in Europe, and already we\u2019re unafraid enough of the pandemic to demand our legal right to go to Homebase again. I hope history doesn\u2019t laugh at us for this. \u2022 Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant",

      "body": "<p>On Sunday evening, Boris Johnson set out the roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. It was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">complex and at times meandering speech</a>.

S\u00e1nchez said the country\u2019s four-phase de-escalation initiative would be \u201cgradual and asymmetric\u201d, adding that the first stage \u2013 dubbed phase 0 \u2013 would come into effect on 4 May.</p> <p>The prime minister stressed that decisions on moving from one phase to the next would be made on a province-by-province basis, and that some of the worst-affected areas of the country would have to wait longer to move back towards normality.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson is to sell $500m (\u00a3405m) in Virgin Galactic shares in order to prop up his airline and leisure interests, which have been ravaged by the coronavirus crisis. In a statement to the New York Stock Exchange, Branson\u2019s Virgin Group said it intended to sell 25m shares via a series of transactions, prompting a 5% fall in the share price of Virgin Galactic during pre-market trading. The shares, which account for just over a fifth of the billionaire\u2019s stake in the space tourism business, were worth $500m at their pre-announcement price of $20. Virgin owns 81% of Vieco 10, the vehicle selling the shareholding, and will raise around $400m from the sale with the rest going to Aabar, an Abu Dhabi investment fund. \u201cVirgin intends to use any proceeds to support its portfolio of global leisure, holiday and travel businesses that have been affected by the unprecedented impact of Covid-19,\u201d said the company. The leisure and tourism sectors have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, after governments around the world imposed strict curbs on travel to curb the spread of the virus. The freeze in global travel is affecting a host of Virgin Group companies, including Virgin Atlantic, as well as its holidays, cruises and hotels businesses. The collapse in air travel forced Virgin Australia into administration and left Virgin Atlantic in severe financial difficulty. The extent of Virgin Atlantic\u2019s woes were underlined this month when the carrier announced plans to pull out of Gatwick airport and cut a third of jobs. The airline, in which Branson still holds a majority 51% stake, has been seeking emergency investment but is also seeking some form of state bailout to tide it over while planes remain grounded. The plea for UK taxpayer help has prompted a backlash, with people pointing to Branson\u2019s vast personal wealth as a potential source of rescue funding. While the airline has not been profitable in recent years, it has at least recorded positive earnings in the past, registering three consecutive years in the black until 2017. Virgin Galactic, by contrast, has never made a profit and has been plagued by successive delays to its plans to carry tourists into space for \u00a3202,000 per trip. Branson said last year he hoped to make the first trip \u201cin months, not years\u201d after securing \u00a360m of deposits \u2013 \u00a3100,000 each from 600 customers. Virgin Galactic is vying for space tourism supremacy with the SpaceX project launched by the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, and the Blue Origin venture headed by Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person. Branson floated the business on the stock market in October, securing $450m of funding through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, an investment vehicle run by the former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya. Investors were offered the chance to buy shares under the stock market ticker symbol \u201cSPCE\u201d for $12.34 each, with the stock rising above $20 as of close on Friday. As well as selling shares in Virgin Galactic, Branson has said he will mortgage his private Caribbean island to raise money to help his business empire. Branson, who is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune, and has lived tax-free on Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands for the last 14 years, promised in a blogpost he would \u201craise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible\u201d.",

There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

      "bodyText": "Far from the moment of clarity and reassurance many were hoping for, Boris Johnson\u2019s Sunday evening address to the nation seemed to raise more questions than it answered. What day were people supposed to return to work? How many individuals were allowed to meet outdoors? Metro\u2019s front page on Monday invoked the prime minister\u2019s passion for classics with the headline \u201cIt\u2019s all Greek to us Boris\u201d, and the Mirror described lockdown Britain as \u201cchaos\u201d. From a public communications perspective, it was not \u2013 it is fair to say \u2013 a success. \u201cI am normally a Boris fan and I backed him for the Conservative leadership, but I thought his address yesterday was a dog\u2019s dinner in terms of communication,\u201d said Chris Whitehouse, the managing director of the Whitehouse Consultancy communications agency. \u201cIt sowed doubt, confusion and uncertainty.\u201d Ahead of the prime minister\u2019s speech on Sunday evening \u2013 an embargoed copy of which was shared with the media \u2013 government sources briefed political journalists with details of some additional measures that were included in the 50-page guidance to be published 24 hours later. \u201cI would have published the document first, embargoed to the media so they had time to read it and see precisely what it said, and then I would have kept the messaging very simple and very clear,\u201d said Whitehouse. Newspapers ran numerous stories throughout last week based on briefings from government about the restrictions that were set to be lifted. \u201cI think they got themselves into a fix by hyping the event before they perhaps knew they had something that was worth hyping,\u201d said Jill Rutter, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, who worked as Treasury communications director among other senior civil service jobs. One former Conservative Number 10 adviser said that when it came to matters of public health, communications needed to be transparent and on the record. \u201cThere should be no briefing here and briefing there. Nothing should be done through anonymous sources,\u201d he said, acknowledging the irony in the fact he was speaking off the record. \u201cFrom a messaging point of view, this stage of the crisis is more difficult, because it has to be more nuanced,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so clear cut, which is another reason why the documents should go out with any announcement.\u201d It emerged on Saturday that the official government message to \u201cstay at home\u201d would be replaced with \u201cstay alert\u201d, which provoked instant ridicule. \u201cIs Coronavirus sneaking around in a fake moustache and glasses? If we drop our guard, will it slip us a Micky Finn? What the hell is \u2018stay alert\u2019 supposed to mean?\u201d tweeted the author JK Rowling. YouGov polling for ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain on Monday showed that less than a third of people felt they knew what the new message was asking them to do. The overwhelming majority of people, 91%, said the previous \u201cstay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d slogan was clear, while just 30% said they understood what \u201cstay alert, control the virus, save lives\u201d meant. \u201cWhoever came up with the previous slogan deserves a mention in the next birthday honours list,\u201d said Whitehouse. \u201cWhoever ever came up with this new slogan deserves to be fired \u2026 To be ambiguous about your messaging at this time will cost lives.\u201d The border on the logo displaying the slogan has also been changed, from red to green. \u201cGreen is an unfortunate choice of colour to put it mildly,\u201d said Whitehouse. \u201cWe do not want to send the message that it\u2019s a green light to go out and carry on as normal.\u201d Rutter sees many blunders in recent government messaging, but she does not think the choice of green for the logo is one of them. \u201cUnlike the Scottish and the Welsh governments, they actually don\u2019t want to keep ramming home the stay at home message,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a very deliberate decision that \u2018stay home\u2019 is not the message they want from this phase.

These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/at-least-100-uk-health-workers-have-died-from-coronavirus-figures-show\">Care workers and home carers</a> had higher death rates than the general population, with 23.4 deaths for every 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths for every 100,000 women. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate than the wider population.</p> \n<p>The figures indicate death rates are significantly higher in occupations where physical distancing is difficult, including construction, manufacturing and primary education.</p> \n<p>Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cWe already know that risk factors for dying from Covid-19 include, for example, being male, having underlying conditions, and ethnicity. The ONS data suggests certain occupations may be more at risk than others. So, taking the points above, a \u2018male diabetic Asian bus driver\u2019 is at higher risk than a \u2018female healthy Caucasian company director\u2019 of similar age.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is much still to disentangle around Covid-19 risk factors and how best to use that information to manage aspects such as population return to work.

Men in low-skilled jobs are four times more likely to die from the virus than men in professional occupations, while women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles.

Security guards, care workers, construction workers, plant operatives, cleaners, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail workers are all at a greater risk of dying, according to the analysis of Covid-19 fatalities in England and Wales up to 20 April from the Office for National Statistics.

Among people of working age, men (9.9 deaths per 100,000) are at a greater risk of dying from the virus than women (4.2 per 100,000). The figures show men working in the lowest-skilled jobs face the greatest risk of dying from the virus when compared to the wider working population. Men working as security guards had one of the highest death rates, at 45.7 fatalities for every 100,000, followed by taxi drivers and chauffeurs (36.4), bus and coach drivers (26.4), chefs (35.9), and sales and retail assistants (19.8). Men working as process, plant and machine operatives had a rate of 37.7 and low-skilled construction workers \u2013 who have been permitted to work throughout the lockdown \u2013 a rate of 25.9. Neil Pearce, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: \u201cIn the working-age population, Covid-19 is largely an occupational disease. This is not just for healthcare and social care workers, but for many other occupations that involve contact with people ... These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.\u201d Care workers and home carers had higher death rates than the general population, with 23.4 deaths for every 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths for every 100,000 women. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate than the wider population. The figures indicate death rates are significantly higher in occupations where physical distancing is difficult, including construction, manufacturing and primary education. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: \u201cWe already know that risk factors for dying from Covid-19 include, for example, being male, having underlying conditions, and ethnicity. The ONS data suggests certain occupations may be more at risk than others. So, taking the points above, a \u2018male diabetic Asian bus driver\u2019 is at higher risk than a \u2018female healthy Caucasian company director\u2019 of similar age. \u201cThere is much still to disentangle around Covid-19 risk factors and how best to use that information to manage aspects such as population return to work. However, right now the forthcoming guidance for safe working simply has to provide extensive detail on how each sector is expected to manage their staff and working environments. Employers and employees need that reassurance.\u201d The Guardian has previously reported that black and ethic minority (BAME) people in England and Wales are dying at a higher rate than white people. BAME workers are over-represented in high-risk occupations, including transport, health and social care sectors. Covid-19 death rates are also higher in the most deprived parts of England and Wales. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies said the ONS figures highlighted the plight of BAME workers, who were more likely to work in frontline services than white workers. Neil Carbery, the chief executive of the Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation, said employers must carry out a health and safety risk assessment before they could claim to have a Covid-19-safe operation that could welcome back workers. The ONS findings were adjusted for age but do not take ethnicity, place of residence and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes and obesity into consideration. No comparable figures have been released for Scotland and Northern Ireland to date.",

As the Trump administration urges Americans to return to workplaces and Donald Trump touts a \u201ctransition to greatness\u201d ahead, the White House faces a delicate balancing act in projecting business as usual even as coronavirus cases spread through the halls of power. Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce \u2013 Dr Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Dr Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration; and Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 have entered two weeks of isolation, after having contact with someone who later tested positive. Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee who chairs the health committee, is isolating himself after a member of staff tested positive. A senior admiral on Trump\u2019s top military advisory committee, chief of naval operations Michael Gilday, is also isolating himself following contact with an infected relative, Bloomberg News reported. Gen Joseph Lengyel tested positive at the White House on Saturday in a spot check, before he was to meet Trump. A valet for Trump, who had served the president food without wearing a mask, also recently tested positive. The White House is considering new rules under which aides must maintain a distance of two metres (6ft) from the president, ABC News reported. Pence\u2019s spokeswoman, Katie Miller, the wife of Stephen Miller, one of the president\u2019s closest aides, who is in frequent close contact with the Trump family, tested positive last week. It was unclear if Stephen Miller had entered self-isolation. \u201cThere is extreme sensitivity inside the White House right now at the current state of affairs \u2013 officials recognise the contradiction in telling states to reopen while the White House enhances protocols to prevent spread of the virus,\u201d CNN quoted an anonymous Trump administration official as saying. On Monday morning the number of recorded Covid-19 deaths in the US was close to 80,000, and while the rate of new cases appears to be slowing in the New York City area and other sites of major outbreaks, elsewhere new infections are rising. Nowhere is testing and contact-tracing for the virus as thoroughly as the White House, where aides and senior officials including Trump and Pence receive both spot checks and repeated testing in various forms, some on a daily basis. Without such testing, cases could go undetected, leading to a potentially wide outbreak. Yet that is the risk Trump is urging Americans to take in the coming weeks and months as they return to work without the protection of regular testing. On Sunday, Trump retweeted an announcement by his golf club in Los Angeles of its reopening. \u201cSo great to see our country starting to open up again!\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we do this carefully, working with the governors, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a considerable risk,\u201d the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told Fox News Sunday. \u201cMatter of fact, I think there\u2019s a considerable risk of not reopening. You\u2019re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the American public.\u201d But such downplaying of the risks the public faces could be undercut as the Senate holds public hearings with social distancing measures in place. The key committee on health will convene its first public hearing on Tuesday. Alexander will chair the hearing remotely, senators attending will wear masks and be seated two metres apart, and experts including Fauci are scheduled to testify by video link. Fauci has repeatedly contradicted, gently, Trump\u2019s most reckless claims about the coronavirus. On Monday morning the president claimed: \u201cGreat credit being given for our Coronavirus response, except in the Fake News.\u201d He also addressed one Democratic-run state seeking to reopen when he wrote: \u201cThe great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes \u2026 Don\u2019t play politics. Be safe, move quickly! On Sunday, however, the White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation it was \u201cscary to go work\u201d. \u201cI think that I\u2019d be a lot safer if I was sitting at home than I would be going to the West Wing,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>Someone won Sunday night\u2019s Numberwang, but it wasn\u2019t any of us. What we can do, and who we can do it with, has been turned into some sort of fake algebra with a red-and-blue PowerPoint hump. Boris Johnson, all clenched fists and lockdown hairdo, was resolute about, er, stuff. Ours is not to reason why, his is not to understand how the other half lives.</p> <p>He talked of a world of golf, tennis, garden centres and people who can go to work in their own cars or on their Bromptons. England in repose. Where, apparently, no one has to think about childcare. The reality is that it is the construction workers, bus drivers and security guards (mostly middle-aged men) <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/men-in-low-skilled-jobs-at-higher-risk-of-dying-from-virus-hkptdffzc\">who are dying of Covid-19 at an alarming rate</a>, as well as NHS staff and carers. These people are called low-skilled. Many of them are his voters. He risks losing them, so must frame the back-to-work instruction as a matter of personal choice. For now.</p> <p>Never in the field of human conflict have so many talked about exercise to so few; the right to chunter along the pavements is now dressed up as a key freedom. This exhortation to keep yourself fit in the middle of a pandemic is a peculiar form of denial, but again it is clearly about moving the narrative from collective to personal responsibility. And personal failure. We are told to \u201cstay alert\u201d, but if alertness could conquer this virus, we would all be fine. The anxiety many of us are experiencing is actually hypervigilance. Alertness implies we can create an antiviral force-field around us. Well, it\u2019s cheaper than personal protective equipment, testing and all that faff.</p> <p>Apparently the fault is not the government\u2019s. It is just difficult to dial down a threat such as \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die\u201d to \u201cgo back to work with no protection and sort of try not to get on a bus\u201d. Instead, we have to use the dread words \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Whenever common sense is invoked, I shudder: all kinds of ideological posturing follows.</p> <p>Common sense may say \u201cI\u2019m all right, Jack\u201d or \u201cyou get it from 5G\u201d and \u201cyou only live once\u201d. Common sense may say keep calm and carry on. Dominic Raab spoke of common sense: you can meet your parents in a park. Then a government source had to announce that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/uk-lockdown-boris-johnson-dominic-raab-downing-street-latest-a9507981.html\">they can see both parents, but not at the same time \u2013 they would have to see them individually</a>\u201d. Common sense turns out to be remarkably like unpoliceable chaos. And a lost father.</p> <p>This is not surprising because what common sense never does well is risk assessment. We are all spectacularly bad at this, and common sense or risk assessment tends to shift over time. When I was young, my mum thought her menthol cigarettes kept her healthy, and we all got into cars with drivers who had been drinking. No one wore seatbelts. Sure, boys died on motorbikes, and there were drug overdoses \u2013 we thought that when your number was up, there wasn\u2019t a lot you could do about it.</p> <p>It is only later in life when you examine so-called \u201crisky behaviour\u201d that you see the interweaving of trauma, peer pressure and the basic tenets of your personality. Once you have kids, you undertake an exercise in risk management which at some point you fail. We want to protect our kids and make them able to survive in the world when we are no longer there.

      "bodyText": "Someone won Sunday night\u2019s Numberwang, but it wasn\u2019t any of us. What we can do, and who we can do it with, has been turned into some sort of fake algebra with a red-and-blue PowerPoint hump. Boris Johnson, all clenched fists and lockdown hairdo, was resolute about, er, stuff. Ours is not to reason why, his is not to understand how the other half lives. He talked of a world of golf, tennis, garden centres and people who can go to work in their own cars or on their Bromptons. England in repose. Where, apparently, no one has to think about childcare. The reality is that it is the construction workers, bus drivers and security guards (mostly middle-aged men) who are dying of Covid-19 at an alarming rate, as well as NHS staff and carers. These people are called low-skilled. Many of them are his voters. He risks losing them, so must frame the back-to-work instruction as a matter of personal choice. For now. Never in the field of human conflict have so many talked about exercise to so few; the right to chunter along the pavements is now dressed up as a key freedom. This exhortation to keep yourself fit in the middle of a pandemic is a peculiar form of denial, but again it is clearly about moving the narrative from collective to personal responsibility. And personal failure. We are told to \u201cstay alert\u201d, but if alertness could conquer this virus, we would all be fine. The anxiety many of us are experiencing is actually hypervigilance. Alertness implies we can create an antiviral force-field around us. Well, it\u2019s cheaper than personal protective equipment, testing and all that faff. Apparently the fault is not the government\u2019s. It is just difficult to dial down a threat such as \u201cwe\u2019re all going to die\u201d to \u201cgo back to work with no protection and sort of try not to get on a bus\u201d. Instead, we have to use the dread words \u201ccommon sense\u201d. Whenever common sense is invoked, I shudder: all kinds of ideological posturing follows. Common sense may say \u201cI\u2019m all right, Jack\u201d or \u201cyou get it from 5G\u201d and \u201cyou only live once\u201d. Common sense may say keep calm and carry on. Dominic Raab spoke of common sense: you can meet your parents in a park. Then a government source had to announce that \u201cthey can see both parents, but not at the same time \u2013 they would have to see them individually\u201d. Common sense turns out to be remarkably like unpoliceable chaos. And a lost father. This is not surprising because what common sense never does well is risk assessment. We are all spectacularly bad at this, and common sense or risk assessment tends to shift over time. When I was young, my mum thought her menthol cigarettes kept her healthy, and we all got into cars with drivers who had been drinking. No one wore seatbelts. Sure, boys died on motorbikes, and there were drug overdoses \u2013 we thought that when your number was up, there wasn\u2019t a lot you could do about it. It is only later in life when you examine so-called \u201crisky behaviour\u201d that you see the interweaving of trauma, peer pressure and the basic tenets of your personality. Once you have kids, you undertake an exercise in risk management which at some point you fail. We want to protect our kids and make them able to survive in the world when we are no longer there. I nearly lost mine (meningitis, serious bike accident) so I learned the hard way that my anticipation of risk was all wrong. Now, in the midst of this virus, I feel far from fatalistic about it. The risk for young people is minimal and very high for old people. Every seven or eight years, your risk of dying if infected doubles. I am not complacent at all. The statistician David Spiegelhalter explained all this clearly on The Andrew Marr Show, saying that we need to be proportionate about the risk we face.

      "body": "<p>Time and again care workers protest they are \u201cthrown under a bus\u201d in this crisis. What an irony that bus drivers are victims too, as Monday\u2019s official statistics show the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2020/may/11/global-stocks-lifted-by-covid-19-lockdown-relaxation-measures-business-live?page=with:block-5eb951a98f0846f9cd556301#block-5eb951a98f0846f9cd556301\">low paid are at more risk</a> of death than better-off work-at-homes. Care workers will not be surprised at their \u201csignificantly raised rates of death\u201d: they are far more likely to die of coronavirus than NHS doctors and nurses, who die <a href=\"https://blog.ons.gov.uk/2020/05/11/understanding-the-impact-of-coronavirus-on-the-workforce/\">no more frequently than the general population</a>, partly due to better protection.</p> <p>Boris Johnson praised \u201cthe incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS and care workers\u201d in Sunday\u2019s address; last week he admitted to an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/06/over-170-carers-call-uk-whistleblower-helpline-during-coronavirus-crisis\">epidemic going on in care homes</a>, which is something I bitterly regret\u201d. Care workers will expect that regret expressed in hard cash once the crisis ebbs. To save the NHS, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-elderly-sp/special-report-in-shielding-its-hospitals-from-covid-19-britain-left-many-of-the-weakest-exposed-idUKKBN22H2EI\">15,000 patients were tipped out of hospitals</a> on 17 March into \u201cthe community\u201d, mainly care homes, with no testing, or, in some cases, having already tested positive. Care homes and community care workers were left defenceless. As one NHS leader told me: \u201cIf they\u2019re lucky, homes will have one nurse who had a course in infection control 30 years ago.\u201d</p> <p>The government knew about, but chose not to be \u201calert\u201d to, deaths in Spanish care homes. In later inquests and inquiries, families\u2019 anger at lonely care home deaths will not evaporate, with a strong suspicion that many died gasping for breath without enough morphine or tranquilisers. Some complain about GPs staying well away \u2013 though others tell of GPs heroically taking on neglected care home patients. Within just the first month of lockdown, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86d9807e-2a47-47b2-8dff-8ab50b16e036\">additional 11,000 </a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86d9807e-2a47-47b2-8dff-8ab50b16e036\">care homes deaths</a> were reported, according to a Financial Times survey. </p> <p>Will the care home body bags \u2013 of staff as well as patients \u2013 finally prompt the political crash trolley to resuscitate social care? The promised green paper has been kicked into the Westminster long grass. Hope rose when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, appeared with a Care badge at one press conference, but it was never seen again.</p> <p>The call for \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between NHS and social care rings out louder than ever in this crisis, with NHS promises never again to call care workers \u201cunskilled\u201d. Having worked in a care home, I can testify to good care workers\u2019 remarkable qualities. Yet a fully trained nurse in a care home is paid massively less than an NHS nurse: no wonder they are hard to hire. A plan from Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/29/national-care-service-labour\">National Care Service</a> would blend the two careers together under the same NHS Agenda for Change training and pay. But equalising them into a single force with people moving seamlessly each way needs money \u2013 and a change in professional attitudes. </p> <p>Local integrated care systems can happen, where councils are treated as equal partners. It happens in places \u2013 such as Salford or Oldham \u2013 where both services are commissioned together, wards interchangeable with care beds. But the obstacle, as ever, is austerity forcing both sides to tussle over puny funding. Besides, for as long as most care homes and services are profit-making, bonding them with the NHS will always be a viper\u2019s nest of contradictions. Add to that the brutal truth that caring for those with dementia in their last years always lacks the status and glamour of heroic life-saving in university hospitals.</p> <p>Optimists look at the great leap forward in this crisis as the two sectors are thrown together as never before, breaking through professional iron curtains showing them to be utterly interdependent. But that was oiled by \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d cash. Those 15,000 put into the community and care homes arrived as NHS-paid patients. Ian Hudspeth, an Oxfordshire council leader and LGA lead on community wellbeing, points to the \u00a34,000 they cost in an acute bed, \u00a31,200 in a care bed or \u00a3400 cared for in their own homes: if they always arrived with an NHS endowment, those \u201cbed-blockers\u201d would be easily discharged. As it is, he says councils are \u00a310bn out of pocket in this crisis, only compensated with \u00a33.2bn by government.</p> <p>Here\u2019s yet another wicked care issue: families didn\u2019t protest when those thousands were transferred to care homes as they were still registered as NHS patients, not needing to not pay care home fees. But families might have kicked up a fuss if the usual means-testing had landed them with a steep bill.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/how-did-we-end-up-turning-our-care-homes-into-jails-of-enforced-loneliness\">How did we end up turning our care homes into jails of enforced loneliness?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the wicked issues in care come back to money \u2013 and until that\u2019s resolved there\u2019s no easy path for this \u201cintegration\u201d. Unlike the NHS, care was never free: with so much wealth accumulated in old people\u2019s property, few think younger generations with less property should pay via their taxes. But whatever system of payment \u2013 Burnham suggested a lump sum paid on retirement \u2013 care absolutely must be free at the point of use by the time old people need help, or the two systems will never meld.</p> <p>Here\u2019s that other wickedness, the Tory privatisation of care: in 1979, <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/files/2019-05/social-care-free-at-the-point-of-need-may-19.pdf\">64% of care homes were NHS or council owned</a>, most others charitable, but by 2012, 94% were private or for-profit. Many are now teetering on the edge, costs rising as they are forced to isolate patients better \u2013 and each death means lost income.

      "bodyText": "Time and again care workers protest they are \u201cthrown under a bus\u201d in this crisis. What an irony that bus drivers are victims too, as Monday\u2019s official statistics show the low paid are at more risk of death than better-off work-at-homes. Care workers will not be surprised at their \u201csignificantly raised rates of death\u201d: they are far more likely to die of coronavirus than NHS doctors and nurses, who die no more frequently than the general population, partly due to better protection. Boris Johnson praised \u201cthe incredible bravery and hard work of our NHS and care workers\u201d in Sunday\u2019s address; last week he admitted to an \u201cepidemic going on in care homes, which is something I bitterly regret\u201d. Care workers will expect that regret expressed in hard cash once the crisis ebbs. To save the NHS, 15,000 patients were tipped out of hospitals on 17 March into \u201cthe community\u201d, mainly care homes, with no testing, or, in some cases, having already tested positive. Care homes and community care workers were left defenceless. As one NHS leader told me: \u201cIf they\u2019re lucky, homes will have one nurse who had a course in infection control 30 years ago.\u201d The government knew about, but chose not to be \u201calert\u201d to, deaths in Spanish care homes. In later inquests and inquiries, families\u2019 anger at lonely care home deaths will not evaporate, with a strong suspicion that many died gasping for breath without enough morphine or tranquilisers. Some complain about GPs staying well away \u2013 though others tell of GPs heroically taking on neglected care home patients. Within just the first month of lockdown, an additional 11,000 care homes deaths were reported, according to a Financial Times survey. Will the care home body bags \u2013 of staff as well as patients \u2013 finally prompt the political crash trolley to resuscitate social care? The promised green paper has been kicked into the Westminster long grass. Hope rose when the health secretary, Matt Hancock, appeared with a Care badge at one press conference, but it was never seen again. The call for \u201cparity of esteem\u201d between NHS and social care rings out louder than ever in this crisis, with NHS promises never again to call care workers \u201cunskilled\u201d. Having worked in a care home, I can testify to good care workers\u2019 remarkable qualities. Yet a fully trained nurse in a care home is paid massively less than an NHS nurse: no wonder they are hard to hire. A plan from Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, for a National Care Service would blend the two careers together under the same NHS Agenda for Change training and pay. But equalising them into a single force with people moving seamlessly each way needs money \u2013 and a change in professional attitudes. Local integrated care systems can happen, where councils are treated as equal partners. It happens in places \u2013 such as Salford or Oldham \u2013 where both services are commissioned together, wards interchangeable with care beds. But the obstacle, as ever, is austerity forcing both sides to tussle over puny funding. Besides, for as long as most care homes and services are profit-making, bonding them with the NHS will always be a viper\u2019s nest of contradictions. Add to that the brutal truth that caring for those with dementia in their last years always lacks the status and glamour of heroic life-saving in university hospitals. Optimists look at the great leap forward in this crisis as the two sectors are thrown together as never before, breaking through professional iron curtains showing them to be utterly interdependent. But that was oiled by \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d cash. Those 15,000 put into the community and care homes arrived as NHS-paid patients. Ian Hudspeth, an Oxfordshire council leader and LGA lead on community wellbeing, points to the \u00a34,000 they cost in an acute bed, \u00a31,200 in a care bed or \u00a3400 cared for in their own homes: if they always arrived with an NHS endowment, those \u201cbed-blockers\u201d would be easily discharged. As it is, he says councils are \u00a310bn out of pocket in this crisis, only compensated with \u00a33.2bn by government. Here\u2019s yet another wicked care issue: families didn\u2019t protest when those thousands were transferred to care homes as they were still registered as NHS patients, not needing to not pay care home fees. But families might have kicked up a fuss if the usual means-testing had landed them with a steep bill. All the wicked issues in care come back to money \u2013 and until that\u2019s resolved there\u2019s no easy path for this \u201cintegration\u201d. Unlike the NHS, care was never free: with so much wealth accumulated in old people\u2019s property, few think younger generations with less property should pay via their taxes. But whatever system of payment \u2013 Burnham suggested a lump sum paid on retirement \u2013 care absolutely must be free at the point of use by the time old people need help, or the two systems will never meld. Here\u2019s that other wickedness, the Tory privatisation of care: in 1979, 64% of care homes were NHS or council owned, most others charitable, but by 2012, 94% were private or for-profit. Many are now teetering on the edge, costs rising as they are forced to isolate patients better \u2013 and each death means lost income. Ros Altmann, a former Tory pensions minister, castigates the big care firms \u201cbought up by hedge-funders at knockdown prices, loaded with debt, tripling their money\u201d. They know homes can\u2019t be allowed to collapse. \u201cBut,\u201d she rightly says, \u201cdon\u2019t bail them out, take them over.\u201d That would ease a host of problems. No wonder Hancock doesn\u2019t wear his Care badge. He wouldn\u2019t be able to account for this ramshackle array of 11,000 mostly private homes. Soon the NHS really will be overwhelmed by its gargantuan waiting lists. Can the public be kept clapping for broken social care when the NHS will again dominate the headlines? \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "body": "<p>A day of record high coronavirus infection numbers is an odd time to announce a route out of lockdown, but that is what Vladimir Putin did on Monday as he announced that the \u201cnon-working days\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/moscow-coronavirus-lockdown-stay-indoors-city\">imposed by the Kremlin at the end of March</a> would come to an end from Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes,\u201d said Putin by video link from his residence outside Moscow on a day when the country registered more than 11,000 new infections. Russia now has the second fastest rate of infections in the world after the US. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is among those in hospital with the virus.</p> <p>Rather than an invitation to Russians to stream back into the streets, however, Monday\u2019s announcement seemed to be the latest gambit in Putin\u2019s plan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/vladimir-putin-takes-backseat-in-russia-tackling-of-coronavirus\">to delegate responsibility for tackling the crisis to local leaders</a>, who he said would make their own decisions on when to end lockdown.</p> <p>Certainly, Russia\u2019s vast size means there is little point in lockdown restrictions in Vladivostok being tied to the epidemic growth seven timezones away in Moscow. But the health minister, Tatiana Golikova, later clarified that so far only 11 of Russia\u2019s 85 regions had an epidemiological situation that could allow for a loosening of restrictions, making Putin\u2019s announcement look to some like passing the buck.</p> <p>\u201cThis is abdication of responsibility, the architect of Russia\u2019s hyper-presidential system suddenly discovering local authorities when it is convenient,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Russia analyst and author of a book on Putin. \u201cPutin is giving them the responsibility to fight the pandemic without the funds or the powers.\u201d</p> <p>Putin has rarely shone in crisis management, something noted as far back as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/22/kursk.russia\">sinking of the Kursk submarine</a> 20 years ago during his first months in office, and this one appears no different.</p> <p>Since donning a yellow hazmat suit to visit coronavirus patients back in March, Putin has been largely confined to his residence, where he appears by video link to address the nation and cabinet. Russians who are used to seeing their president atop a horse or motorbike instead see a static-screen Putin who often seems bored.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1312da709bfa46a1f240eda67a4da1c007e46c2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1312da709bfa46a1f240eda67a4da1c007e46c2a/0_475_4434_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Putin attends a meeting on the transport system development via video.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Putin attends a meeting on the transport system development via video.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexei Nikolsky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last week he was spotted distractedly playing with a pen as his health minister discussed the regional response with him. On Monday Putin again looked less than enthusiastic as he simultaneously addressed the nation and his government. On several occasions he let out audible sighs in mid-sentence.</p> <p>The virus is asking hard questions of the Kremlin and the political system constructed by Putin over the past two decades.</p> <p>\u201cPutin\u2019s detached initial response to the spread of the coronavirus outbreak was at least partly a result of his staff\u2019s tendency to sanitise information and to portray events in the most optimistic light possible. Putin\u2019s staff reports about its achievements, not problems,\u201d wrote Tatiana Stanovaya in a recent <a href=\"https://carnegie.ru/2020/05/07/putin-regime-cracks-pub-81726?fbclid=IwAR2Bwovkyw9CRISsY8uXqW4hJLLbYM19eY--KwCHk8ZRh2bBM1n-bRU60AA\">report</a> for the Carnegie Moscow Centre.</p> <p>Coronavirus has also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/covid-19-puts-putins-power-plans-on-hold-and-economy-in-peril\">disrupted plans for a vote on constitutional amendments</a> that would have paved the way for Putin to rule until 2036. That was set for April, but instead he has found himself up against a pernicious, frustrating and invisible foe, and seen his approval ratings slide.</p> <p>\u201cThis is arguably the most serious challenge to Putin as national leader in the 20 years he has been in power, and he is failing it,\u201d said Galeotti.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A day of record high coronavirus infection numbers is an odd time to announce a route out of lockdown, but that is what Vladimir Putin did on Monday as he announced that the \u201cnon-working days\u201d imposed by the Kremlin at the end of March would come to an end from Tuesday. \u201cWe have a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes,\u201d said Putin by video link from his residence outside Moscow on a day when the country registered more than 11,000 new infections. Russia now has the second fastest rate of infections in the world after the US. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is among those in hospital with the virus. Rather than an invitation to Russians to stream back into the streets, however, Monday\u2019s announcement seemed to be the latest gambit in Putin\u2019s plan to delegate responsibility for tackling the crisis to local leaders, who he said would make their own decisions on when to end lockdown. Certainly, Russia\u2019s vast size means there is little point in lockdown restrictions in Vladivostok being tied to the epidemic growth seven timezones away in Moscow. But the health minister, Tatiana Golikova, later clarified that so far only 11 of Russia\u2019s 85 regions had an epidemiological situation that could allow for a loosening of restrictions, making Putin\u2019s announcement look to some like passing the buck. \u201cThis is abdication of responsibility, the architect of Russia\u2019s hyper-presidential system suddenly discovering local authorities when it is convenient,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Russia analyst and author of a book on Putin. \u201cPutin is giving them the responsibility to fight the pandemic without the funds or the powers.\u201d Putin has rarely shone in crisis management, something noted as far back as the sinking of the Kursk submarine 20 years ago during his first months in office, and this one appears no different. Since donning a yellow hazmat suit to visit coronavirus patients back in March, Putin has been largely confined to his residence, where he appears by video link to address the nation and cabinet. Russians who are used to seeing their president atop a horse or motorbike instead see a static-screen Putin who often seems bored. Last week he was spotted distractedly playing with a pen as his health minister discussed the regional response with him. On Monday Putin again looked less than enthusiastic as he simultaneously addressed the nation and his government. On several occasions he let out audible sighs in mid-sentence. The virus is asking hard questions of the Kremlin and the political system constructed by Putin over the past two decades. \u201cPutin\u2019s detached initial response to the spread of the coronavirus outbreak was at least partly a result of his staff\u2019s tendency to sanitise information and to portray events in the most optimistic light possible. Putin\u2019s staff reports about its achievements, not problems,\u201d wrote Tatiana Stanovaya in a recent report for the Carnegie Moscow Centre. Coronavirus has also disrupted plans for a vote on constitutional amendments that would have paved the way for Putin to rule until 2036. That was set for April, but instead he has found himself up against a pernicious, frustrating and invisible foe, and seen his approval ratings slide. \u201cThis is arguably the most serious challenge to Putin as national leader in the 20 years he has been in power, and he is failing it,\u201d said Galeotti.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Contactless payments, plastic screens and a ban on reusable cups are among the measures being put in place to protect customers and workers as the businesses reopen their doors.</p> \n<p>The government plan for rebuilding the economy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/11/what-is-covered-in-the-uk-governments-lockdown-easing-plan\">released on Monday</a>, said food providers, pubs and accommodation, as well as hairdressers, cinemas and places of worship would reopen \u201cno earlier than 4 July\u201d.</p> \n<p>However, the document said that when this phase arrived, \u201csome venues which are, by design, crowded and where it may prove difficult to enact distancing may still not be able to reopen safely at this point\u201d.</p> \n<p>The trade body UK Hospitality said it was drawing up rules to help its members operate safely at that point.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: \u201cThe size and diversity of the hospitality sector means that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reopening \u2026 Even within the same sector, there is bound to be a huge difference in the size, shape, location and layout of outwardly similar businesses.\u201d</p> \n<p>Starbucks said that since it shut in March it had been \u201ctesting and refining\u201d safety procedures\u201d, learning from what it had seen in China and the US, where the majority of its branches are now open.</p> \n<p>Customers will be encouraged to order online in advance and given staggered times to collect their orders.

Its chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: \u201cThe size and diversity of the hospitality sector means that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to reopening \u2026 Even within the same sector, there is bound to be a huge difference in the size, shape, location and layout of outwardly similar businesses.\u201d Starbucks said that since it shut in March it had been \u201ctesting and refining\u201d safety procedures\u201d, learning from what it had seen in China and the US, where the majority of its branches are now open. Customers will be encouraged to order online in advance and given staggered times to collect their orders. Employees have been told that customers waiting to collect an order should do so in a designated area where there is space for social distancing or, if this is not possible, only be allowed into shops one at a time. In a message to employees published on its website, Alex Rayner, Starbucks\u2019 UK retail general manager, said the goal was to be fully open by the end of June \u201cbut we will take our time, adapting to customer behaviour and in-store capabilities along the way\u201d. Burger King said it planned to reopen a further 72 branches next Monday and 40 a week after that. These will be for delivery or in a drive-through format only. The chain has provided staff with masks and gloves and given them training on distancing measures. It said stringent cleaning and contactless delivery options were also in place. Pret a Manger on Monday reopened a further 70 shops in London and other major cities and towns including Birmingham, Brighton, Cambridge and Oxford. It is now offering a delivery and takeaway service from more than 100 outlets. McDonald\u2019s plans to reopen 15 sites in south-east England this Wednesday.It has reduced its menu to make distancing easier in its kitchens, and introduced Perspex screens and floor markings where necessary.",

      "body": "<p>Anti-lockdown protests in Australia over the weekend mimicked some of the conspiracy theories and language of similar protests in the United States but they\u2019re unlikely to grow as big due to the limited size of the groups within Australia, according to one misinformation researcher.</p> <p>More than 100 people gathered outside parliament in Victoria and a smaller crowd gathered in Sydney to protest the lockdowns, \u201ctracking apps\u201d and vaccines.</p> <p>The weekend protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/ten-arrested-and-police-officer-injured-at-protest-against-victorias-covid-19-lockdown-laws\">were promoted on various Facebook groups</a> linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and various anti-vaxxers, with many of the signs at the protests targeting Microsoft founder Bill Gates for his work on vaccines \u2013 a popular target of conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>It is understood Facebook has removed events encouraging people to breach the physical distancing rules, and on one of the pages promoting the protests several posts have been removed for breaching Facebook\u2019s guidelines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/tech-firms-criticised-for-lack-of-answers-on-covid-19-disinformation\">Tech firms criticised for 'lack of answers' on Covid-19 disinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rallies followed much larger demonstrations in the US in recent weeks, with Australian protesters copying slogans and promoting similar conspiracy theories. The theme of posts on some of the group pages behind the weekend protests imitate those seen on fringe far-right groups in the US.</p> <p>But the groups often diverge in what they believe in, with the only common denominator being a purported link to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Axel Bruns, a professor in digital media research at Queensland University of Technology, told Guardian Australia the pandemic was bringing wildly differing conspiracy theory groups together.</p> <p>\u201cAny group with pre-existing conspiracy theories has projected their conspiracy theories on to the corona crisis in some form as well,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhether that\u2019s the anti-vaxxers or the anti-5G people \u2026 it\u2019s quite likely that all of these groups have some belief there is an underlying story they\u2019re not being told.\u201d</p> <p>Part of the problem, he said, was that information about coronavirus was slow to emerge as the pandemic took hold.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a very genuine information vacuum, even authorities didn\u2019t have all the answers and couldn\u2019t have all the answers at that point. That\u2019s always what happens at the start of a major crisis,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Unlike the anti-lockdown protests in the United States, Australia\u2019s so far have been relatively small. Bruns puts this down to a lack of a pre-existing network, and the Australian government\u2019s response to the economic impact.</p> <p>\u201cWe probably won\u2019t get to the [US] point because we don\u2019t have the undergrowth of existing conspiracy theorists or fringe groups, but it will be interesting to see how things develop as people get fed up with the ongoing restrictions or ongoing lockdowns.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad enough but it\u2019s certainly not as polarised and as dysfunctional as it is in the US \u2026 it\u2019s easy to get people who are already quite upset and annoyed and frustrated.

      "bodyText": "Anti-lockdown protests in Australia over the weekend mimicked some of the conspiracy theories and language of similar protests in the United States but they\u2019re unlikely to grow as big due to the limited size of the groups within Australia, according to one misinformation researcher. More than 100 people gathered outside parliament in Victoria and a smaller crowd gathered in Sydney to protest the lockdowns, \u201ctracking apps\u201d and vaccines. The weekend protests were promoted on various Facebook groups linked to fringe conspiracy groups including QAnon and various anti-vaxxers, with many of the signs at the protests targeting Microsoft founder Bill Gates for his work on vaccines \u2013 a popular target of conspiracy theorists. It is understood Facebook has removed events encouraging people to breach the physical distancing rules, and on one of the pages promoting the protests several posts have been removed for breaching Facebook\u2019s guidelines. The rallies followed much larger demonstrations in the US in recent weeks, with Australian protesters copying slogans and promoting similar conspiracy theories. The theme of posts on some of the group pages behind the weekend protests imitate those seen on fringe far-right groups in the US. But the groups often diverge in what they believe in, with the only common denominator being a purported link to the coronavirus pandemic. Axel Bruns, a professor in digital media research at Queensland University of Technology, told Guardian Australia the pandemic was bringing wildly differing conspiracy theory groups together. \u201cAny group with pre-existing conspiracy theories has projected their conspiracy theories on to the corona crisis in some form as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s the anti-vaxxers or the anti-5G people \u2026 it\u2019s quite likely that all of these groups have some belief there is an underlying story they\u2019re not being told.\u201d Part of the problem, he said, was that information about coronavirus was slow to emerge as the pandemic took hold. \u201cThere was a very genuine information vacuum, even authorities didn\u2019t have all the answers and couldn\u2019t have all the answers at that point. That\u2019s always what happens at the start of a major crisis,\u201d he said. Unlike the anti-lockdown protests in the United States, Australia\u2019s so far have been relatively small. Bruns puts this down to a lack of a pre-existing network, and the Australian government\u2019s response to the economic impact. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t get to the [US] point because we don\u2019t have the undergrowth of existing conspiracy theorists or fringe groups, but it will be interesting to see how things develop as people get fed up with the ongoing restrictions or ongoing lockdowns. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough but it\u2019s certainly not as polarised and as dysfunctional as it is in the US \u2026 it\u2019s easy to get people who are already quite upset and annoyed and frustrated. And here I think we\u2019ve managed to avoid that much more than they have.\u201d Conspiracy theories involving 5G popped up at the protest in Melbourne, with some in the comments in one of the groups linking the Cedar Meats outbreak to a nearby telephone tower. Chief health officer, Brendan Murphy, labelled connecting coronavirus to 5G \u201csilly misinformation\u201d. \u201cThere is absolutely no evidence about 5G doing anything in the coronavirus space,\u201d he said on Sunday. \u201cI have unfortunately received a lot of communication from these conspiracy theorists myself. It is complete nonsense \u2013 5G has got nothing at all to do with coronavirus.\u201d A search of tower licences on the Australian Communications and Media Authority website reveals Telstra was only granted a licence for its 5G network at that location earlier this month \u2013 well after the outbreak occurred. Another virulent conspiracy theory that appeared at the protest and in the groups is Plandemic, a video making claims about the origins of Covid-19 that was shared by celebrity chef Pete Evans and NRL Wag Taylor Winterstein. Plandemic has been viewed over 2.2m times in a matter of days, and has been shared by celebrities and other influencers across the world on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram. It was produced by Mikki Willis and has an interview with Judy Mikovits, a discredited researcher who makes a number of inaccurate claims about the origins of Covid-19.

      "body": "<p>Australian rugby is facing an existential threat \u2013 and it is not just the coronavirus crisis that is causing the code to suffer. The shocking, if somewhat unsurprising, revelations in News Corp publications about the cataclysmic financial position must be the final warning to a code that is in danger of sinking into oblivion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/rugby-union/rugby-australias-books-reveal-a-500m-blackhole/news-story/9c5f2a052544ecb123f13712e837a3d4\">According to the report</a>s, Rugby Australia (RA) blew $500m over the last four years and faces liabilities in excess of $20m. Those figures are believed to be accurate, though a bit dated, which means the situation could actually be worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/australian-only-super-rugby-competition-to-include-axed-western-force\">Australia-only Super Rugby competition to include axed Western Force</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How is RA to trade its way out of this financial black hole in the current economic crisis? All sports are struggling with the impact of the crisis, but rugby is suffering more than most, to the point where the very essence of the sport is under threat.</p> <p>It is time for Australian rugby to imagine the unimaginable \u2013 that the professional game in the country, with the possible exception of the Wallabies, will virtually cease to exist if something drastic is not done to rescue the code financially. Australian rugby cannot afford to be so complacent as to think it could not happen. Just look at basketball as a case study.</p> <p>In 1988 the National Basketball League predicted it would be the most popular sport in Australia by the year 2000 if it continued its pace of growth, but within a decade the game\u2019s popularity deteriorated to the brink of collapse. In 2003 Australian rugby was so popular it threatened to challenge rugby league as the major sport in NSW and Queensland, but has now fallen way behind its major rivals, the NRL and AFL.</p> <p>The parallels between rugby and basketball are frightening. Both sports suffered a mass exodus of players to rich overseas clubs and experienced difficulties with their broadcast partners.</p> <p>The fractured relationship between RA and its long-time broadcast partner, Fox Sports, is key to the survival of professional rugby below Test level \u2013 and that essentially means Super Rugby or some other provincial competition. Relations between RA and Fox Sports broke down when the former RA chief executive Raelene Castle rejected the broadcaster\u2019s initial offer of $20m a year, down from the current $57m, as part of the renegotiation of the broadcast deal for 2021 to 2025.</p> <p>If there is no other bidder for the rights, such as Optus, RA\u2019s interim CEO Rob Clarke will have to repair relations with Fox Sports, assuming the News Corp-owned pay-TV operator is still interested.</p> <p>It is difficult to see Fox Sports walking away from rugby completely because the demographics of the code\u2019s followers help to drive subscriptions. But Fox Sports, of course, has its own financial troubles. There have been reports that it will only offer RA $10m-15m for the broadcast rights. This may be a bargaining tactic but if the figures are correct it will have dire consequences for Australian rugby.</p> <p>It could result in a mass exodus of leading players to Europe and Japan once play in the northern hemisphere resumes post the lockdown. In this scenario, RA would be forced to abandon the so-called Giteau Law and consider all overseas-based Australian players for the Wallabies, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on Super Rugby.</p> <p>RA would also have to seriously consider reducing the number of Australian Super Rugby teams from four to three, or perhaps only two, to remain competitive with New Zealand and South African opposition. That is assuming Australian teams will be involved in an international provincial competition in the future.</p> <p>While Australian rugby\u2019s long-term future is uncertain, it is the here and now that urgently needs to be addressed. A prospective $17m loan from World Rugby would only see RA through to the end of the year, bringing up the possibility of insolvency. </p> <p>RA desperately needs a resumption in play to generate revenue, but what will it be able to put on the field and what will it be worth to a broadcaster if indeed any broadcaster is interested? Without a Trans-Tasman bubble, RA is to organise a domestic Australian Super Rugby competition and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/11/australian-only-super-rugby-competition-to-include-axed-western-force\">invite the Western Force back into the fold</a> to make up the numbers.</p> <p>If Fox Sports was only willing to pay $10m-15m for the rights to the whole Super Rugby competition, what would it be prepared to fork out for an Australian version lasting only three months? Anything less and an Australian domestic competition would not be commercially viable.</p> <p>RA, like the NRL appears set to do, needs to negotiate a long-term broadcast deal with Fox Sports which is front-loaded to survive the short-term but will also safeguard the long-term future of the game. Of course, that would require a fair amount of goodwill. The former Network Ten chief-executive Hamish McLennan is reportedly close to coming on to the RA board as chairman and his background in the News Corp culture would certainly help RA in its negotiations with Fox Sports.</p> <p>But what if Fox, as has been reported, has already walked away from rugby? What if there is no other bidder? RA would no doubt go into voluntary administration and Australian rugby would then be reduced to a community game with the Wallabies possibly the only remaining professional, or semi-professional, team in the country. That would be a serious threat to the code\u2019s very existence.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Australian rugby is facing an existential threat \u2013 and it is not just the coronavirus crisis that is causing the code to suffer. The shocking, if somewhat unsurprising, revelations in News Corp publications about the cataclysmic financial position must be the final warning to a code that is in danger of sinking into oblivion. According to the reports, Rugby Australia (RA) blew $500m over the last four years and faces liabilities in excess of $20m. Those figures are believed to be accurate, though a bit dated, which means the situation could actually be worse. How is RA to trade its way out of this financial black hole in the current economic crisis? All sports are struggling with the impact of the crisis, but rugby is suffering more than most, to the point where the very essence of the sport is under threat. It is time for Australian rugby to imagine the unimaginable \u2013 that the professional game in the country, with the possible exception of the Wallabies, will virtually cease to exist if something drastic is not done to rescue the code financially. Australian rugby cannot afford to be so complacent as to think it could not happen. Just look at basketball as a case study. In 1988 the National Basketball League predicted it would be the most popular sport in Australia by the year 2000 if it continued its pace of growth, but within a decade the game\u2019s popularity deteriorated to the brink of collapse. In 2003 Australian rugby was so popular it threatened to challenge rugby league as the major sport in NSW and Queensland, but has now fallen way behind its major rivals, the NRL and AFL. The parallels between rugby and basketball are frightening. Both sports suffered a mass exodus of players to rich overseas clubs and experienced difficulties with their broadcast partners. The fractured relationship between RA and its long-time broadcast partner, Fox Sports, is key to the survival of professional rugby below Test level \u2013 and that essentially means Super Rugby or some other provincial competition. Relations between RA and Fox Sports broke down when the former RA chief executive Raelene Castle rejected the broadcaster\u2019s initial offer of $20m a year, down from the current $57m, as part of the renegotiation of the broadcast deal for 2021 to 2025. If there is no other bidder for the rights, such as Optus, RA\u2019s interim CEO Rob Clarke will have to repair relations with Fox Sports, assuming the News Corp-owned pay-TV operator is still interested. It is difficult to see Fox Sports walking away from rugby completely because the demographics of the code\u2019s followers help to drive subscriptions. But Fox Sports, of course, has its own financial troubles. There have been reports that it will only offer RA $10m-15m for the broadcast rights. This may be a bargaining tactic but if the figures are correct it will have dire consequences for Australian rugby. It could result in a mass exodus of leading players to Europe and Japan once play in the northern hemisphere resumes post the lockdown. In this scenario, RA would be forced to abandon the so-called Giteau Law and consider all overseas-based Australian players for the Wallabies, which would have a hugely detrimental effect on Super Rugby. RA would also have to seriously consider reducing the number of Australian Super Rugby teams from four to three, or perhaps only two, to remain competitive with New Zealand and South African opposition. That is assuming Australian teams will be involved in an international provincial competition in the future. While Australian rugby\u2019s long-term future is uncertain, it is the here and now that urgently needs to be addressed. A prospective $17m loan from World Rugby would only see RA through to the end of the year, bringing up the possibility of insolvency. RA desperately needs a resumption in play to generate revenue, but what will it be able to put on the field and what will it be worth to a broadcaster if indeed any broadcaster is interested? Without a Trans-Tasman bubble, RA is to organise a domestic Australian Super Rugby competition and invite the Western Force back into the fold to make up the numbers. If Fox Sports was only willing to pay $10m-15m for the rights to the whole Super Rugby competition, what would it be prepared to fork out for an Australian version lasting only three months? Anything less and an Australian domestic competition would not be commercially viable. RA, like the NRL appears set to do, needs to negotiate a long-term broadcast deal with Fox Sports which is front-loaded to survive the short-term but will also safeguard the long-term future of the game. Of course, that would require a fair amount of goodwill. The former Network Ten chief-executive Hamish McLennan is reportedly close to coming on to the RA board as chairman and his background in the News Corp culture would certainly help RA in its negotiations with Fox Sports. But what if Fox, as has been reported, has already walked away from rugby? What if there is no other bidder? RA would no doubt go into voluntary administration and Australian rugby would then be reduced to a community game with the Wallabies possibly the only remaining professional, or semi-professional, team in the country. That would be a serious threat to the code\u2019s very existence.",

An analysis found the reduced economic activity over a five-week period was likely to have cut emissions from the country\u2019s coal-dominated power generation by only about 1% compared with previous years. Total electricity consumption between 16 March and 21 April was 2.4% lower than last year, but more than half of that drop was likely attributable to it being warmer in 2019 in that period, leading to people running power-hungry air-conditioners more often.

Early February was not a good time to be making economic forecasts. I speak from some experience, because on 4 February I wrote that \u201ctalk of a recession is a bit premature\u201d. So it gives me some small comfort to note that the Reserve Bank\u2019s statement on monetary policy on 6 February also saw little sign of the recession ahead. But how do times change! Fast forward to last Friday and the bank\u2019s latest statement saw massive plunges in its economic forecasts. In February it noted \u201cThe forecasts have also been revised a little lower in the near term to account for some effect from the recent bushfires and the coronavirus outbreak in China; beyond the near term, forecasts for growth are largely unchanged.\u201d Ah, the sweet optimism of three months ago. Now, the RBA says \u201cthe Australian economy is expected to record a contraction in GDP of around 10 per cent over the first half of 2020; total hours worked are expected to decline by around 20 per cent and the unemployment rate is forecast to rise to around 10 per cent in the June quarter.\u201d The prediction for unemployment has gone from being as low as 4.75% to now hoping within two years it can fall back to 6.5%: When the RBA predicts GDP growth and other measures it rather nicely provides its 70% and 90% confidence intervals. In February, the RBA was 90% confident that annual GDP in June would be between 0.25% and 3.5%. That is a large range \u2013 the economic equivalent of a barn door, and yet they missed \u2013 and missed by a lot: With this miss should also come some level of wariness when looking at its forecast for growth over the next two years. It hopes that the 12 months to June next year will see the economy grow by 7%, and for growth not to fall below 5% until midway through 2022. Given the economy has not grown above 5% this century, that is a heck of a rebound. But the associated unemployment figures show how huge is the task before us. The RBA has forecast unemployment to rise and fall in line with the long-term relationship between GDP growth and annual changes in the unemployment rate: The problem is unemployment rises faster than it falls. Historically, if GDP falls 6% in a year, unemployment will rise about 4%pts; conversely if the economy grows by 6%, unemployment will only fall by around 1.5%pts. That\u2019s why even with the RBA estimating strong growth after this year, it still has unemployment around 1.3% points above where it is now \u2013 a difference of about 180,000 people out of work. This is because when the economy goes backwards you need to not just get growth back to where it was, but you need to regain that lost production. We mostly talk about the growth of the economy, but we should not forget the actual amount is important. After the 1990s recession, it took around eight years for Australia\u2019s economy to get back on terms with where it had been heading: That shaded area in the graph is lost potential growth \u2013 lost profit and household income. You can see how massive this issue can be when we look at the UK before and after the GFC: The GFC in 2009 knocked the size of UK\u2019s economy back to 2005 levels \u2013 essentially setting it back four years. And over the past decade it has not only been unable to recapture that lost time, it has fallen further behind. Last year, the UK economy reached a level that it would have been expected to achieve in 2013 had it continued along the 1993-2007 trend \u2013 essentially it was six years behind schedule. And then came the coronavirus, which the IMF estimates will knock it back to 2015 levels \u2013 or where the UK was once on track to reach in 2010. That means the UK, due to the GFC, Brexit and now the coronavirus, is around a decade behind where in 2007 you would have predicted it would be. That\u2019s why when we look at the RBA\u2019s estimates, it is well to note that even with the estimated strong growth, the economy is not expected to recover to the size it was at the end of last year until March 2022: If things go bad, that won\u2019t happen until well into 2023 \u2013 or more than three years behind. And even with the baseline we are still well behind where we were tracking \u2013 and unlikely to get back on the pre-virus trend until after 2023. All of which make it seem rather odd to hear talk of winding back stimulus measures. We have a long way to go \u2013 not just to return economic growth to where it was, but to get the size of the economy \u2013 and with it the jobs and income \u2013 back. And given the level of uncertainty with the virus, such a return is very much not guaranteed. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Australians are increasingly comfortable with governments easing restrictions designed to slow the spread of coronavirus, but people surveyed in the latest Guardian Essential poll also want lockdowns and travel bans reinstated if infections surge. The latest poll comes as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will use an economic update to parliament on Tuesday to quantify the gains to gross domestic product if governments roll out the full, three stage, agreement to end the lockdowns signed off by the national cabinet last week. Frydenberg will report the GDP gains from easing coronavirus restrictions nationally will be $9.4bn a month. The treasurer says implementing stage one of the easing \u2013 which involves the reopening of retail outlets, permits cafes and restaurants to seat 10 patrons rather than just offer takeaway, and also encompasses the opening of outdoor gyms, playgrounds and skate parks and the return of schools \u2013 will boost GDP by $3.1bn. The Morrison government over the past week has been ramping up public focus on the economic and fiscal cost of the pandemic restrictions. Frydenberg will note the end of lockdowns will see 850,000 Australians return to work. With individual states in control of the timetable for easing restrictions, Tuesday\u2019s economic statement will break down the employment gains by state of returning to business-as-usual, and also quantify the GDP gains by state. Australia\u2019s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, are moving more slowly than other jurisdictions because they have had higher numbers of infections.

In employment terms, NSW would see 279,550 jobs return over the three stages, and Victoria 216,085 jobs. While Morrison has been careful not to inflame relations within the national cabinet, a number of Victorian Liberals have used the resumption of federal parliament to blast Daniel Andrews for hastening slowly on dismantling restrictions. With Australia moving to a period of easing restrictions, concern about the threat of the virus increased in this week\u2019s Guardian Essential survey. 49% of respondents say they are quite concerned, compared with 46% last week.

Expanding on a warning in January about the risk of an underclass, Keneally wrote in a recent opinion piece Australia\u2019s \u201cincreasing reliance\u201d on \u201ccheap supply of overseas, temporary labour\u201d undercuts wages \u201cfor Australian workers and takes jobs Australians could do\u201d. Keneally\u2019s position is supported by 67% of respondents. Women, Coalition voters, voters over the age of 55, and voters who support someone other than the major parties were more favourably disposed to the idea than men, voters under 34, and Greens supporters.

To maintain social distancing, the morning handover for interns and doctors happens in the historic animal-inspection building at Sydney University\u2019s veterinary teaching hospital. \u201cIt was a place where the students in my day used to celebrate the end of their faculty dinners with a keg into the wee hours, so it\u2019s got a lot sentimental value,\u201d says the hospital\u2019s CEO, Dr Mark Lawrie. \u201cThe acoustics are quite good and it gives the opportunity to the staff to socially distance whilst still communicating.\u201d That change in scenery is far from the only adjustment the hospital has made in the wake of Covid-19. The biggest change has been the \u201cdecision to exclude clients from coming in to the hospital building\u201d. Skye Welsh hands over her cavoodle, Jessie, to Dr Phan Mponda for surgery. Now, pet owners \u201cswap leads at the door without actually making close contact\u201d, or \u201cif it\u2019s a cat in a cage, they leave the cat inside the foyer on a red X and then the staff comes and wipes down the cage and the handles\u201d. From there, the hospital staff will examine the animal, while talking to the owner over the phone or FaceTime, much like a telehealth appointment. Most owners take the call while waiting outside in the parking lot. \u201cThe clients have been very understanding and sympathetic, more than we thought they would be,\u201d says Lawrie. The hospital is making an exception for euthanasia cases, where owners may still come into the building, but \u201cthey are limited to one or two family members wearing PPE\u201d. Mark Lawrie, the veterinary teaching hospital\u2019s chief executive, views an X-ray. The teaching hospital has also shifted its students to online learning, and split its workforce into two teams, so that even if there were a case of Covid-19 within the hospital\u2019s staff, operations could continue while exposed staff members were quarantined. \u201cInitially we reduced to emergency and urgent cases, so there\u2019s a little bit of a shifting scale as to what you do and what you can see,\u201d says Lawrie. He notes, however, that \u201cover time, if you don\u2019t do things like nail clips, then they become more urgent\u201d. A social distancing reminder in the teaching hospital. The number of emergency cases they are seeing \u201cseem to have increased\u201d, he says. \u201cIt was pretty hard and stressful to change operations like that, but we got there.\u201d Now \u201cwe\u2019re seeing lights at the end of the tunnel\u201d. Lawrie believes their current cohort of students will be able to complete their training and make way for the next class. They are also hoping to be able to take on more cases soon. \u201cWe delayed elective surgeries just like in the human sphere, but are looking at ramping that back up again as things draw closer to normality.\u201d",

Since then he has been \u201cslowly chipping away\u201d at the rest of his degree part-time.

You go from a very collaborative program, where everyone sees everyone, and you get constant feedback in class and from the teacher \u2013 to working from home where all that structure and support is much harder to come by.\u201d</p> <p>Eamonn McGrath-Lester, a final-year speech pathology student at La Trobe University, made a similar switch to 100% online learning, which he does from the home office in his shed in Preston, Melbourne.</p> <p>McGrath-Lester is even doing his clinal placement online, in which clients, student clinicians and the supervisor all log in through Zoom. Others were not so lucky, losing placements and facing delayed graduation as a result.</p> <p>\u201cThere are about 70 speech pathology students in my year \u2013 a lot of them are at hospitals, and while public hospitals stayed open and kept their students on, a lot of placements were cancelled outright, particularly at private hospitals and clinics,\u201d McGrath-Lester says.</p> <p>The other trend set to accelerate is short courses, or so-called micro-credentials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/10/time-to-click-reset-coronavirus-offers-chance-to-end-australias-welfare-wars\">'Time to click reset': coronavirus offers chance to end Australia's welfare wars</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The federal government has offered a funding guarantee, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/12/australian-universities-warn-covid-19-relief-package-not-enough-to-stop-21000-jobs-losses\">fell well short of the sector\u2019s demands</a>, and enacted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/04/australian-universities-angry-at-final-twist-of-the-knife-excluding-them-from-jobkeeper\">a series of changes to exclude universities from the jobkeeper wage subsidy</a>. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has spruiked price cuts in 20,000 short courses in nursing, teaching, health, IT and sciences as way forward for the sector.</p> <p>The University of South Australia is first out of the blocks with a program designed before coronavirus: a six-month professional certificate in aged care, which can expand into a diploma with a further six months of study.</p> <p>Prof Esther May, the dean of academic and clinical education in the health sciences division, says the course is structured around what the aged care industry requires of a \u201cwell-rounded worker\u201d, with no elective subjects.</p> <p>Aged care was chosen due to the high workforce demand, with job openings expected to double and a retiring workforce creating opportunities for \u201crejuvenation\u201d.</p> <p>While it\u2019s too early to profile students entering the course, May praises students from a retail and hospitality background who \u201ctend to be a very good match for aged care and disability because of their ability to communicate and work with customers\u201d.</p> <p>The most politically sensitive change to the tertiary education sector post-pandemic will be the student mix between domestic and international students, given that Liberal conservatives have cited universities\u2019 alleged over-reliance on Chinese international students as a reason to deny them further taxpayer support.</p> <p>Sheehy says international students are about 35% of the student body at the network\u2019s east coast universities, with universities planning \u201cmeticulously\u201d with a market-diversification strategy, and some, including UTS, adopting a soft cap.</p> <p>But few in the sector were prepared for a global pandemic, which has caused international student enrolments to plummet, irrespective of their country of origin.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"153359b1a04828e46ee05817984671c249e31103\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/153359b1a04828e46ee05817984671c249e31103/0_315_5321_3193/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Students at a University of Melbourne library\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Universities hope for arrangements that will make it possible for international students to resume travel, with periods of quarantine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeffrey Isaac Greenberg/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some international students were able to make it to Australia before restrictions. \u201cOur applications are up for second semester,\u201d the vice-chancellor of Sydney University, Michael Spence, told Guardian Australia in April.

Financial pressures may cause a rethink.</p> <p>There will also be a squeeze on research dollars. Spence says the basic problem facing universities is that high-quality research \u2013 the very thing that has propelled some of the Group of Eight universities into the top 100 \u2013 is increasingly expensive.</p> <p>Although funding has grown since Labor uncapped places in 2009, the government contribution on a per capita basis has declined, prompting universities to make up the gap from the fees that international students pay. Well-heeled universities have used that cream to set up institutes and research centres that take their place on the global stage, and in turn add to their lustre as desirable institutions.</p> <p>Either the federal government will either have to fund universities more heavily from taxpayer funds or make some hard decisions about how to allocate research dollars, Spence warns.</p> <p>Jackson says there are \u201ca number of outstanding issues under negotiation\u201d with the government, including visa changes and funding for short courses.</p> <p>Barnes says we \u201care now seeing the human cost of over 50% of university employees being in insecure employment\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe casualised model of employment gives university employers the flexibility to hire and fire at will, but at the extremely high cost of casual workers\u2019 careers and lives.\u201d</p> <p>Jackson concedes that universities are making cutbacks but says they are responding to ensure they are \u201cas equipped as possible to assist with the recovery\u201d by improving financial sustainability.</p> <p>The loss of revenue \u201cwill be very hard for universities to absorb, and it will be difficult to play as full a role as we\u2019d like to play in national recovery\u201d, she says, emphasising it is not just a loss to the institutions but research and the national interest at stake.</p> <p>But while the sector is making big changes, everyone agrees that campus life is not gone for good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/08/work-after-coronavirus-how-will-it-change-when-the-lockdown-is-over\">Work after coronavirus: how will it change when the lockdown is over?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Short courses and online education might suit those in the workforce, but Vann notes that \u201cmany things can\u2019t be done remotely, such as the hands-on skills for nurses, vets and dentists\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do a lot physical catchup when social distancing backs off,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Just as the federal government is pushing for schools to reopen, Vann suggests it will be pushing a similar message soon with university campuses.

      "bodyText": "While workplaces and schools around the country battled to take business and education online in response to Covid-19, Jack Begbie was \u201cin awe\u201d at how quickly University of Technology Sydney was able to make the switch. \u201cThey paused university for a week and then, when we started the next week, everything was online \u2013 all using Zoom and different programs,\u201d the fifth-year communications student says. But moving course content online is only the beginning for universities, which expect to lose up to 21,000 jobs and will have to remodel their offerings to provide new short courses and continue to attract international students. The university sector is both one of the greatest victims of the coronavirus economic contraction and vital to the road out, in terms of research capability, retraining opportunities and $23bn in export income. Andrew Vann, the vice-chancellor of Charles Sturt University, says the crisis will \u201caccelerate trends\u201d towards distance and online education which have been building for decades. \u201cThree-quarters of our students are already studying by distance already, so it is less of a transition for us than some of the metro unis,\u201d he says. \u201cI think a lot of people will say, \u2018I probably could study online\u2019 \u2013 it will give legitimacy to what was previously seen by some as a measure of last resort.\u201d Luke Sheehy, the executive director of the Australian Technology Network of universities, agrees, arguing that coronavirus is just the latest in a long line of disruptions that have required more innovation, including technology change and the automation of work. \u201cIf universities do go online with high quality, including high student contact, with highly interactive courses \u2013 you\u2019ll see a change in the way people behave,\u201d Sheehy says. \u201cIt is a growth area anyway, but I\u2019d expect from this crisis we might see stimulation of interest in that will be ongoing.\u201d Begbie started communications five years ago and quickly found full-time work in his industry of choice. Since then he has been \u201cslowly chipping away\u201d at the rest of his degree part-time. He describes the challenge of \u201ctrying to work out which subjects are available after hours, or at lunchtime, or early in the morning\u201d to squeeze study in around work, biking from his job in the city to UTS\u2019s Ultimo campus. \u201cIt worked to an extent but it could always be a bit easier,\u201d he says. \u201cIt feels like having options to learn online is something I\u2019ve been waiting for for a few years for \u2026 I wish we didn\u2019t have to have a global pandemic for a little change like this to happen.\u201d But Begbie acknowledges that 100% online learning \u201cwon\u2019t be the perfect solution for everyone\u201d. \u201cI know a few people at UTS have struggled with the transition. You go from a very collaborative program, where everyone sees everyone, and you get constant feedback in class and from the teacher \u2013 to working from home where all that structure and support is much harder to come by.\u201d Eamonn McGrath-Lester, a final-year speech pathology student at La Trobe University, made a similar switch to 100% online learning, which he does from the home office in his shed in Preston, Melbourne. McGrath-Lester is even doing his clinal placement online, in which clients, student clinicians and the supervisor all log in through Zoom. Others were not so lucky, losing placements and facing delayed graduation as a result. \u201cThere are about 70 speech pathology students in my year \u2013 a lot of them are at hospitals, and while public hospitals stayed open and kept their students on, a lot of placements were cancelled outright, particularly at private hospitals and clinics,\u201d McGrath-Lester says. The other trend set to accelerate is short courses, or so-called micro-credentials. The federal government has offered a funding guarantee, which fell well short of the sector\u2019s demands, and enacted a series of changes to exclude universities from the jobkeeper wage subsidy. The education minister, Dan Tehan, has spruiked price cuts in 20,000 short courses in nursing, teaching, health, IT and sciences as way forward for the sector. The University of South Australia is first out of the blocks with a program designed before coronavirus: a six-month professional certificate in aged care, which can expand into a diploma with a further six months of study. Prof Esther May, the dean of academic and clinical education in the health sciences division, says the course is structured around what the aged care industry requires of a \u201cwell-rounded worker\u201d, with no elective subjects. Aged care was chosen due to the high workforce demand, with job openings expected to double and a retiring workforce creating opportunities for \u201crejuvenation\u201d. While it\u2019s too early to profile students entering the course, May praises students from a retail and hospitality background who \u201ctend to be a very good match for aged care and disability because of their ability to communicate and work with customers\u201d. The most politically sensitive change to the tertiary education sector post-pandemic will be the student mix between domestic and international students, given that Liberal conservatives have cited universities\u2019 alleged over-reliance on Chinese international students as a reason to deny them further taxpayer support. Sheehy says international students are about 35% of the student body at the network\u2019s east coast universities, with universities planning \u201cmeticulously\u201d with a market-diversification strategy, and some, including UTS, adopting a soft cap. But few in the sector were prepared for a global pandemic, which has caused international student enrolments to plummet, irrespective of their country of origin. Some international students were able to make it to Australia before restrictions. \u201cOur applications are up for second semester,\u201d the vice-chancellor of Sydney University, Michael Spence, told Guardian Australia in April. The university relies heavily on students from China. \u201cAfter the travel bans were imposed, many students made an effort to come and spend the two weeks in a third country and then come to Australia,\u201d he said. But next year and beyond are far less certain and will depend on whether there are second and third waves of the virus that significantly affect Asia \u2013 the main markets for students \u2013 and what happens in countries that are the main competitors in education: the UK and US. It\u2019s hard to imagine that international travel will return to normal this year but universities hope for arrangements that will make it possible for international students to resume travel, with periods of quarantine. The sector is negotiating greater visa flexibility with the federal home affairs department, so universities can begin teaching international students online for semester two of 2020 and semester one of 2021 while disruption continues, with a guarantee they can come to Australia to complete study face-to-face. The Labor MP Julian Hill, co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of International Education, accuses Scott Morrison of \u201cactively harming\u201d the sector through \u201ctone deaf\u201d comments that visa holders, who are not eligible for jobseeker or jobkeeper payments, could instead go home. Hill has consulted with the international education sector, which wants greater certainty including for the department to process and issue visas in advance, with a defined date for students to come to Australia. The National Tertiary Education Union president, Alison Barnes, says there has been \u201cinadequate support from the federal government\u201d for international students, leaving state governments to try to fill the gaps but most measures have been \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. Ian Jacobs, the vice-chancellor of the University of New South Wales, warns that Australia may have damaged a key export market. The decision to exclude temporary visa holders from jobkeeper led to real hardship for students who depended on part-time jobs, often in hospitality. \u201cOur future students will be watching this,\u201d Jacobs says. The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, says it\u2019s \u201cimpossible to accurately forecast\u201d what the student mix will be because the decision rests with health authorities about when to reopen borders. Jackson and Spence both praise the Chinese government for waiving its requirement that students studying at foreign universities can\u2019t do more than a certain percentage online. \u201cThat\u2019s a way of making sure foreign universities don\u2019t just beam themselves into China and you have a whole lot of people having a fake foreign university experience,\u201d Spence says. \u201cThey have waived that requirement for those who have had to start online due to Covid-19.\u201d Meanwhile, universities are being forced to make cutbacks, with major projects and capital spending deferred, and casual budgets slashed across the board. Jacobs warns that universities could face a downward spiral, where the immediate crisis causes them to cut spending, making them less attractive to students of the future and adding to their financial woes. The higher education reforms of the Dawkins era more than 20 years ago sparked a wave of mergers. Universities absorbed colleges of higher eduction and broadened their offerings into vocational courses. But since then the trend has been for universities to expand their own course offerings rather than look at finding synergies with other organisations. Financial pressures may cause a rethink. There will also be a squeeze on research dollars. Spence says the basic problem facing universities is that high-quality research \u2013 the very thing that has propelled some of the Group of Eight universities into the top 100 \u2013 is increasingly expensive. Although funding has grown since Labor uncapped places in 2009, the government contribution on a per capita basis has declined, prompting universities to make up the gap from the fees that international students pay. Well-heeled universities have used that cream to set up institutes and research centres that take their place on the global stage, and in turn add to their lustre as desirable institutions. Either the federal government will either have to fund universities more heavily from taxpayer funds or make some hard decisions about how to allocate research dollars, Spence warns. Jackson says there are \u201ca number of outstanding issues under negotiation\u201d with the government, including visa changes and funding for short courses. Barnes says we \u201care now seeing the human cost of over 50% of university employees being in insecure employment\u201d. \u201cThe casualised model of employment gives university employers the flexibility to hire and fire at will, but at the extremely high cost of casual workers\u2019 careers and lives.\u201d Jackson concedes that universities are making cutbacks but says they are responding to ensure they are \u201cas equipped as possible to assist with the recovery\u201d by improving financial sustainability. The loss of revenue \u201cwill be very hard for universities to absorb, and it will be difficult to play as full a role as we\u2019d like to play in national recovery\u201d, she says, emphasising it is not just a loss to the institutions but research and the national interest at stake. But while the sector is making big changes, everyone agrees that campus life is not gone for good. Short courses and online education might suit those in the workforce, but Vann notes that \u201cmany things can\u2019t be done remotely, such as the hands-on skills for nurses, vets and dentists\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do a lot physical catchup when social distancing backs off,\u201d he says. Just as the federal government is pushing for schools to reopen, Vann suggests it will be pushing a similar message soon with university campuses. The universities never completely shut \u2013 there are still people in student accommodation and libraries open in campuses across the country. \u201cIf people feel safe, we\u2019ll see the students come back,\u201d Vann says. \u201cBut we\u2019ll need to be careful, you can\u2019t turn this on and off.\u201d Jackson says it has been \u201cextraordinary\u201d that students have adapted to learning in lounge rooms, bedrooms and garages but she doesn\u2019t think \u201cthere\u2019s any prospect\u201d university will remain 100% online. \u201cAs soon as it is safe to be back on campus, international and domestic students will be keen to get back on campus, back to tutorials and face-to-face learning.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Aviation bosses have torn into Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to impose a 14-day quarantine on people arriving in Britain, warning that it risks worsening the economic impact of Covid-19. In a letter signed by the chief executives of easyJet, Heathrow and Gatwick, the industry voiced \u201ccollective and serious concern and frustration\u201d and demanded a meeting with the prime minister. It questioned the scientific basis of the quarantine plan, cast doubt on whether it could be enforced and said industry representatives had not been consulted on the proposals before they were announced. \u201cAn open-ended quarantine, with no set end date, will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse,\u201d the bosses wrote. \u201cPeople will simply choose not to travel to and from the UK, at the same time as economies in Europe and around the world begin opening up their borders and removing their own quarantines, making the UK aviation sector unable to compete.\u201d \u201cIn short, passenger travel cannot restart, and clarity from government is needed as to whether such an outcome is the intention or expectation of this measure, which was announced without any pre-consultation with the sector.\u201d The letter was sent on Monday after the government published a 50-page document outlining its Covid-19 recovery strategy. The plans include a 14-day quarantine on new arrivals to the country, but there was no detail yet on when the new regime would begin or end. People landing in the UK will have to provide contact and accommodation details and agree to self-isolate for two weeks. International travellers will be required to stay in state-arranged accommodation if they cannot show where they plan to self-isolate. People arriving from the Republic of Ireland and France will be exempted from this. The sector is still hoping for some form of bailout to help it survive the crisis. Asked about support for the sector in parliament on Monday, Boris Johnson pointed to schemes designed to support businesses more broadly but offered no hints at an aviation-specific package. \u201cWe will do everything we can to \u2026 keep Britain flying and get Britain flying again,\u201d he said. In their letter, aviation bosses requested an urgent meeting with Johnson to discuss quarantine proposals and asked him to outline \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d how the government would support the sector. They questioned what scientific advice was behind the quarantine plan, and whether it was enforceable, and pointed out that France, which appears to be excluded from the quarantine requirement, allows in passengers from the EU. They said any quarantine should be \u201cas limited and short in duration as possible, kept under permanent review and applied only in the absence of workable, evidence-led and risk-based alternatives.\u201d Willie Walsh, the chief executive of International Airlines Group, said on Monday that the plan would force the group to review plans to restart operations in July, with the number of flights likely to be \u201cpretty minimal\u201d instead.

However, Walsh said the quarantine would make the prospects of a recovery in air traffic more difficult. The crisis has already led to planned jobs cuts, including 12,000 at BA with thousands more expected at IAG\u2019s other airlines. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing positive in anything I heard the prime minister say yesterday,\u201d Walsh told MPs on the transport committee on Monday. \u201cWe had been planning to resume on a pretty significant basis of flying in July.

      "body": "<p>The penny has dropped for Sir Richard Branson: you can\u2019t plead poverty, or lack of ready cash, when you own a stake in a publicly traded space tourism business worth almost $2bn (\u00a31.6bn).</p> <p>Virgin Group now intends to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/11/richard-branson-to-sell-500m-worth-of-virgin-galactic-shares\">flog about a quarter</a> of its holding in Virgin Galactic, which should raise the thick end of $400m after the minority Abu Dhabi partner takes its cut. If the entire proceeds were to be shovelled into Virgin Atlantic in the form of new equity, Branson \u2013 in theory \u2013 would take a big step towards saving his 51%-owned airline.</p> <p>It would then be a matter of rounding up a few private investors \u2013 probably hedge funds or sovereign wealth funds \u2013 as new shareholders to boost the size of the recapitalisation of Atlantic. Talks appear advanced.</p> <p>So can UK taxpayers breathe easily in the knowledge that Branson has now accepted that, if Virgin Atlantic is to be saved, he\u2019ll have to do the job himself? You\u2019d think so, but don\u2019t bet on it.</p> <p>The messaging from Shai Weiss, chief executive of the airline, is still about a \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d. What he means is that the airline, if necessary, would still like a state-backed loan or credit guarantee to supplement the infusion of private capital.</p> <p>Such a model, to be fair, is better than the straightforward bailout that Branson seemed to imagine (outrageously and wrongly) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/20/richard-branson-renews-virgin-plea-for-coronavirus-support\">would be forthcoming</a> at the outset of this saga. Yet this is the point at which the Treasury, if it\u2019s really open to getting involved with a company that was loss-making even before Covid-19 came along, needs to exercise extreme caution.</p> <p>For starters, financial transparency remains roughly zero. We\u2019ve yet to see the form in which Branson and any new would-be co-investors would put capital into Virgin Atlantic. Only maximum helpings of genuine at-risk equity capital should be acceptable. Virgin Group would also have to drop its licence fee arrangement and move the airline\u2019s ultimate holding company, as opposed to the operating company, to the UK.</p> <p>The Treasury, in other words, should keep pushing. If Branson comes up with, say, 60% of a refinancing package for Virgin Atlantic, the question to ask is why he can\u2019t manage 100%. There are, remember, a lot more shares in Virgin Galactic that could be sold over time.</p> <h2>Flexible but fiddly: the Treasury\u2019s job in rebuilding</h2> <p>The government\u2019s strategy document, Our Plan to Rebuild, said next to nothing about the economy. The single section was mostly a summary of what\u2019s been done so far, coupled with a warning that less will be done in future. \u201cThe government will \u2026 need to wind down the economic support measures while people are eased back to work,\u201d said the document. In other words, see Rishi Sunak for details.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s most important announcement could come as soon as Tuesday. It concerns the coronavirus job retention scheme, the most effective of the policies adopted in a hurry in March. Paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, has prevented the employment picture becoming even worse.</p> <p>A bill of \u00a314bn a month, or thereabouts, cannot be sustained indefinitely, however, so Sunak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">will have to be less generous at some point</a>. But dropping the rate from 80% to 60% from July \u2013 as some are urging \u2013 would be risky. Many employers would feel compelled to consult on redundancies immediately, defeating the purpose of the support efforts so far.</p> <p>Whatever date he chooses, Sunak needs to remember he cannot confidently predict the pace of the return to work. Timetables to ease the lockdown may have to be revised constantly. The guiding principle for other reforms, then, should be flexibility.</p> <p>In practice, that will mean allowing full-time workers to return on a part-time basis with wages topped up by the state. It could also involve shortening furlough structures, so that employees can been shifted in and out from one week to the next.</p> <p>Flexibility will be fiddly (both for government and employer) and contrasts with the simplicity of the present set-up.

      "bodyText": "The penny has dropped for Sir Richard Branson: you can\u2019t plead poverty, or lack of ready cash, when you own a stake in a publicly traded space tourism business worth almost $2bn (\u00a31.6bn). Virgin Group now intends to flog about a quarter of its holding in Virgin Galactic, which should raise the thick end of $400m after the minority Abu Dhabi partner takes its cut. If the entire proceeds were to be shovelled into Virgin Atlantic in the form of new equity, Branson \u2013 in theory \u2013 would take a big step towards saving his 51%-owned airline. It would then be a matter of rounding up a few private investors \u2013 probably hedge funds or sovereign wealth funds \u2013 as new shareholders to boost the size of the recapitalisation of Atlantic. Talks appear advanced. So can UK taxpayers breathe easily in the knowledge that Branson has now accepted that, if Virgin Atlantic is to be saved, he\u2019ll have to do the job himself? You\u2019d think so, but don\u2019t bet on it. The messaging from Shai Weiss, chief executive of the airline, is still about a \u201cpublic-private partnership\u201d. What he means is that the airline, if necessary, would still like a state-backed loan or credit guarantee to supplement the infusion of private capital. Such a model, to be fair, is better than the straightforward bailout that Branson seemed to imagine (outrageously and wrongly) would be forthcoming at the outset of this saga. Yet this is the point at which the Treasury, if it\u2019s really open to getting involved with a company that was loss-making even before Covid-19 came along, needs to exercise extreme caution. For starters, financial transparency remains roughly zero. We\u2019ve yet to see the form in which Branson and any new would-be co-investors would put capital into Virgin Atlantic. Only maximum helpings of genuine at-risk equity capital should be acceptable. Virgin Group would also have to drop its licence fee arrangement and move the airline\u2019s ultimate holding company, as opposed to the operating company, to the UK. The Treasury, in other words, should keep pushing. If Branson comes up with, say, 60% of a refinancing package for Virgin Atlantic, the question to ask is why he can\u2019t manage 100%. There are, remember, a lot more shares in Virgin Galactic that could be sold over time. Flexible but fiddly: the Treasury\u2019s job in rebuilding The government\u2019s strategy document, Our Plan to Rebuild, said next to nothing about the economy. The single section was mostly a summary of what\u2019s been done so far, coupled with a warning that less will be done in future. \u201cThe government will \u2026 need to wind down the economic support measures while people are eased back to work,\u201d said the document. In other words, see Rishi Sunak for details. The chancellor\u2019s most important announcement could come as soon as Tuesday. It concerns the coronavirus job retention scheme, the most effective of the policies adopted in a hurry in March. Paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, has prevented the employment picture becoming even worse. A bill of \u00a314bn a month, or thereabouts, cannot be sustained indefinitely, however, so Sunak will have to be less generous at some point. But dropping the rate from 80% to 60% from July \u2013 as some are urging \u2013 would be risky. Many employers would feel compelled to consult on redundancies immediately, defeating the purpose of the support efforts so far. Whatever date he chooses, Sunak needs to remember he cannot confidently predict the pace of the return to work. Timetables to ease the lockdown may have to be revised constantly. The guiding principle for other reforms, then, should be flexibility. In practice, that will mean allowing full-time workers to return on a part-time basis with wages topped up by the state. It could also involve shortening furlough structures, so that employees can been shifted in and out from one week to the next. Flexibility will be fiddly (both for government and employer) and contrasts with the simplicity of the present set-up. This, though, is how the Treasury earns its corn. It\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019re anxious to avoid a \u201ccliff edge\u201d. Only good and detailed design can make it happen.",

Look, Kyle. Maybe read the room a little. Maybe a short period of lockdown for the mouth might not be the worst idea right now.</p> <p>If Walker didn\u2019t know at the time that he had screwed up, then the reaction to his statement on social media \u2013 shrill, censorious, bordering on the vindictive \u2013 will quickly have set him straight. His club are said to be deeply unimpressed, to say nothing of the England manager, Gareth Southgate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/29/england-squad-gareth-southgate-tyrone-mings-euro-2020-qualifiers\" title=\"\">who has not picked him for a squad</a> in almost a year. And yet as deeply, dangerously foolish as Walker has been, let\u2019s not pretend that this is a story motivated solely by a heartfelt concern for public health.</p> <p>Consider, for example, why it was deemed necessary for a newspaper to trace Walker\u2019s movements around northern England for nine hours. If it was a form of noble public interest journalism, then it appears to have been a curiously selective one: walk down virtually any street in the country right now and you will find numerous examples of distances not being kept, of non-essential trips being made, of rules being flouted. So why the big fuss about Walker in particular? The answer, of course, is not all coronavirus offenders are made equal. The flimsy \u201crole model\u201d defence is often applied in cases like this, an attempt to rationalise the very British impulse to tear down the famous.</p> <p>It is an impulse that finds its expression not just in newspapers but in a good deal of online discourse, where the urge to expose, to embarrass, to excoriate, has morphed into a sort of macabre spectator sport. The bigger the name, the bigger the cross on their back. It was ever thus.</p> <p>But there is a more specific context at play here, one that only really becomes apparent when you examine a text box accompanying the original newspaper story: an \u201cAll-Star Covidiots XI\u201d comprising footballers alleged to have breached lockdown. Walker is captain, naturally, but Tottenham\u2019s Serge Aurier, Ryan Sessegnon and Moussa Sissoko are all in there with him for not respecting physical distancing rules. Arsenal\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette too, after standing too close to a valet who had visited his house to wash his car.</p> <p>Who benefits from all this? Perhaps it seems overly cynical to point this out, but you may have noticed that a monumental battle is being waged within Premier League clubs right now, and it is a battle of optics and PR as much as testing capacity and sporting integrity. The Premier League has made it clear that come what may, the remainder of the 2019-20 season must be scheduled: behind closed doors if necessary, every two or three days if necessary, with players and staff sealed off from their families and swabbed to the eyeballs if necessary.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/manchester-city-add-belgian-second-division-side-to-their-stable\">Manchester City parent company add Belgian team to their stable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of players have already voiced their concerns about taking the field in the jaws of a pandemic, when many of us will still be confined to our homes, when the virus is still killing hundreds of people daily. Sergio Ag\u00fcero says many are scared to play again. Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings and Norwich\u2019s Todd Cantwell have also voiced their concerns. Meanwhile, the news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/brighton-restart-covid-19-premier-league\" title=\"\">that a third Brighton player tested positive</a> for coronavirus over the weekend was greeted in some quarters not with concern or empathy but the accusation that Brighton were deliberately infecting their players with a deadly virus in order to get the rest of the season cancelled. Well, they do say you have to dig deep in a relegation struggle.</p> <p>The point is this. At a time when the game\u2019s powerbrokers are desperately making the case to resume top-level football, it needs to win the debate on player welfare. It needs to convince fans, authorities and the public that the interests of the game outweigh the interests of its participants. That task becomes much easier if people are already predisposed to believing that footballers are pampered, entitled self-serving millionaires with no sense of civic duty and a predilection for sex parties. We saw elements of this in last month\u2019s absurd controversy over player wage deferrals.</p> <p>Or, to put it another way: when the resumption debate turns to player wellbeing, the Premier League would rather you weren\u2019t picturing Ag\u00fcero, or Cantwell, or the three Brighton players with coronavirus. They\u2019d rather you were picturing Kyle Walker, hurtling along the M62 in his sports car while the rest of us sit at home. For all the damage done to his own reputation, perhaps Walker\u2019s gravest indiscretion has been to drain public sympathy from his profession at a time when it is needed more than ever.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2020 to remove references to a newspaper assigning a photographer to \u201cwait outside Walker\u2019s home\u201d and \u201ctrail him ... around northern England for nine hours\u201d. The Sun, which was the newspaper that reported on Kyle Walker breaching lockdown rules, has told the Guardian that while the player was photographed on its behalf in two locations that day, he was not followed.</p>",

Consider, for example, why it was deemed necessary for a newspaper to trace Walker\u2019s movements around northern England for nine hours. If it was a form of noble public interest journalism, then it appears to have been a curiously selective one: walk down virtually any street in the country right now and you will find numerous examples of distances not being kept, of non-essential trips being made, of rules being flouted. So why the big fuss about Walker in particular? The answer, of course, is not all coronavirus offenders are made equal. The flimsy \u201crole model\u201d defence is often applied in cases like this, an attempt to rationalise the very British impulse to tear down the famous. It is an impulse that finds its expression not just in newspapers but in a good deal of online discourse, where the urge to expose, to embarrass, to excoriate, has morphed into a sort of macabre spectator sport. The bigger the name, the bigger the cross on their back. It was ever thus. But there is a more specific context at play here, one that only really becomes apparent when you examine a text box accompanying the original newspaper story: an \u201cAll-Star Covidiots XI\u201d comprising footballers alleged to have breached lockdown. Walker is captain, naturally, but Tottenham\u2019s Serge Aurier, Ryan Sessegnon and Moussa Sissoko are all in there with him for not respecting physical distancing rules. Arsenal\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette too, after standing too close to a valet who had visited his house to wash his car. Who benefits from all this? Perhaps it seems overly cynical to point this out, but you may have noticed that a monumental battle is being waged within Premier League clubs right now, and it is a battle of optics and PR as much as testing capacity and sporting integrity. The Premier League has made it clear that come what may, the remainder of the 2019-20 season must be scheduled: behind closed doors if necessary, every two or three days if necessary, with players and staff sealed off from their families and swabbed to the eyeballs if necessary. A number of players have already voiced their concerns about taking the field in the jaws of a pandemic, when many of us will still be confined to our homes, when the virus is still killing hundreds of people daily. Sergio Ag\u00fcero says many are scared to play again. Aston Villa\u2019s Tyrone Mings and Norwich\u2019s Todd Cantwell have also voiced their concerns. Meanwhile, the news that a third Brighton player tested positive for coronavirus over the weekend was greeted in some quarters not with concern or empathy but the accusation that Brighton were deliberately infecting their players with a deadly virus in order to get the rest of the season cancelled. Well, they do say you have to dig deep in a relegation struggle. The point is this. At a time when the game\u2019s powerbrokers are desperately making the case to resume top-level football, it needs to win the debate on player welfare. It needs to convince fans, authorities and the public that the interests of the game outweigh the interests of its participants. That task becomes much easier if people are already predisposed to believing that footballers are pampered, entitled self-serving millionaires with no sense of civic duty and a predilection for sex parties. We saw elements of this in last month\u2019s absurd controversy over player wage deferrals. Or, to put it another way: when the resumption debate turns to player wellbeing, the Premier League would rather you weren\u2019t picturing Ag\u00fcero, or Cantwell, or the three Brighton players with coronavirus. They\u2019d rather you were picturing Kyle Walker, hurtling along the M62 in his sports car while the rest of us sit at home. For all the damage done to his own reputation, perhaps Walker\u2019s gravest indiscretion has been to drain public sympathy from his profession at a time when it is needed more than ever. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2020 to remove references to a newspaper assigning a photographer to \u201cwait outside Walker\u2019s home\u201d and \u201ctrail him ... around northern England for nine hours\u201d. The Sun, which was the newspaper that reported on Kyle Walker breaching lockdown rules, has told the Guardian that while the player was photographed on its behalf in two locations that day, he was not followed.",

If it exceeds one, the virus could rapidly take off again.</p> \n  <p>The Scottish government announced one change to the rules yesterday; allowing people to exercise outdoors more than once a day.

He faced some robust criticism from the opposition, but what was missing was any evidence of a backlash from Conservatives. Some Tory backbenchers are reportedly concerned that the lockdown is being allowed to continue for too long. But we did not hear that this afternoon. Partly that might be a function of the new format (there is no \u201cmood of the house\u201d on Zoom, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1258312562095128577\">as James Forsyth pointed out recently)</a>, but maybe they\u2019re just reserving judgment.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson rejected claims that people did not understand his new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. </strong>Yesterday <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-announce-covid-19-alert-system?page=with:block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c#block-5eb80b458f0858b1a810765c\">she did not know what this meant.</a> But when the SNP\u2019s <strong>Chris Law </strong>asked Johnson to explain this, he insisted it was clear. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It will be perfectly obvious to the house what we\u2019re trying to do, and what we\u2019re saying by \u201cStay alert\u201d. What we\u2019re now saying is we\u2019re emphasising, or re-emphasising, the importance of those who cannot work from home going to work, provided their workplaces are Covid secure, provided that they observe the rules of social distancing on public transport, or however they go to work. That is what staying alert means.</p> \n   <p>Staying alert is going to be absolutely vital to our continued success in beating this virus. I think the British public understands exactly what we are trying to do.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In response to another claim that his new guidance was not clear, Johnson said he trusted the British public to apply \u201cgood, solid British common sense\u201d. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/11/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-to-give-more-detail-on-lockdown-changes?page=with:block-5eb9675b8f0846f9cd556449#block-5eb9675b8f0846f9cd556449\">3.59pm.)</a></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the Health and Safety Executive would be enforcing the new \u201cCovid secure\u201d guidance for employers, using spot checks.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Health and Safety Executive [HSE] will be enforcing it and we will be having spot inspections to make sure that businesses are keeping their employees safe, and of course it\u2019ll be open to employees who do not feel safe to raise that, not just with their employers but with the HSE as well.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He hinted that the government would use <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/flushing-is-our-next-weapon-against-covid-19-if-youre-happy-to-have-your-sewage-scrutinised-136844\">sewage testing</a> to monitor for new coronavirus outbreaks.</strong> This is what he seemed to be referring to when he told the Conservative <strong>Robert Courts </strong>that there would be monitoring for local flare-ups. Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The intention is the Covid alert system in time will be sufficiently sensitive and flexible as to detect local flare-ups, so that for instance if Covid is detected in the water supply of a certain town, then steps can be taken, or in a school, in an area, then steps can be taken on the spot to deal with that flare-up. Measures can be taken to keep the R down locally as well as nationally.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the 18,000 new contract tracers being recruited by the government would be in place by 18 May. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said people should not use the new guidance on outdoor exercise as an excuse to visit second homes.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t want to see people, let me repeat, we don\u2019t want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home, that is not what this is about.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said parents without childcare should not be expected to go to work.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I want to stress if you can\u2019t get the childcare you need to get to work then that is plainly an impediment on your ability to work and your employer should recognise that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said there would be \u201cvery substantial reductions in capacity\u201d on public transport as a result of social distancing.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected a claim that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, failed to sign off the new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He rejected claims he had been reduced to acting as the prime minister of England, not of the UK</strong>.

Starmer said he was glad the issue had been raised, because we wanted to clear this up. He made two arguments.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Starmer said that, if the government cancelled rents, landlords would be entitled to compensation.</strong> That would not be a good use of public money, he argued.

There was also an increase in traffic and alcohol-related violence associated with VE Day celebrations.</p> \n  <p>While Johnson has said people will be able to travel to exercise, the message in Wales is that people should exercise locally.</p> \n  <p>Drakeford said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have concerns that traffic flow into Wales could continue to increase as a result of the prime minister\u2019s announcement that travel to exercise will be allowed in England.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>I want to be clear in Wales it is Welsh law that applies. Travelling to Wales to exercise is not to exercise locally.</p> \n  <p>He said signs would inform motorists of this on major routes in Wales but he said there were no plans to actually shut the border.</p> \n  <p>Drakeford said he had sympathy with people who would not grasp the differences between what was allowed in England and Wales. \u201cI do have sympathy with people who haven\u2019t heard that message with sufficient clarity because of the way it was announced yesterday,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He added:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I wish the UK government were sometimes clearer about when they are speaking for England and when they are speaking for the UK.

that he didn\u2019t want to see the \u201cheadroom\u201d Wales currently has in dealing with the crisis eroded \u201cbecause people are exercising freedoms they have elsewhere but not in

Blanchard writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>A note on scrutiny:</strong> Astonishingly this afternoon\u2019s session will mark the first time Johnson has even made a statement in the Commons on coronavirus, and only the second time he has turned up to make a statement on anything at all since this year. We\u2019re also still waiting for his first appearance before the Commons liaison committee, eight and a half months into his premiership. More pressingly the PM has refused to give a press conference or a media interview for the past 11 days, and has managed just one presser since March 25, having been off sick for much of April. Aides say he will only take pre-recorded questions from the public tonight.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb909aa8f08464cd4297daa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T08:18:45.377Z\">9.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Boris Johnson has been taking what has become his daily morning walk around St James\u2019s Park.

      "bodyText": "There is no guarantee of a Covid-19 vaccine, Boris Johnson said at this evening\u2019s press conference, though he said the UK is at the heavily involved in the work to develop one. I\u2019m hearing some very encouraging things from what\u2019s going on at Oxford to achieve a vaccine [but] this is by no means guaranteed. I believe I\u2019m right in saying that, even after 18 years we still don\u2019t have a vaccine for Sars. What I can tell you is that the UK is at the forefront of concerting international activity to try to deliver a vaccine. He said the UK government is putting \u201chuge sums\u201d into finding a vaccine, but added: If you ask me am I absolutely certain that we won\u2019t be living with this for a long time to come, I can\u2019t say that. It may be that we have to become ever more flexible, ever more agile, ever smarter in the way that we tackle, not just this infection, but potentially future infections as well. While he agreed the development of a vaccine cannot be guaranteed, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest care home operators have reported falling death rates from Covid-19, raising hopes that outbreaks which have devastated some of the most vulnerable and elderly people may finally be abating. The number of residents who have recovered from the virus has now eclipsed the numbers of deaths from it across 220 care settings operated by MHA, the largest charitable provider of homes, which by Monday had recorded 359 deaths in total. It said fatalities peaked around 22 April and have fallen gradually since. Meanwhile HC-One, the largest commercial operator which has lost 829 residents to confirmed or suspected Covid-19, said deaths had fallen from a peak of 31 a day on 19 April to four on Monday. A manager at a separate nursing home in Ealing that saw 27 residents killed in an outbreak last month told the Guardian she has recorded no new infections for a fortnight. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. Guardian political editor Heather Stewart said as low-skilled workers are four times more likely to die from the coronavirus, is the burden of the crisis falling on the most disadvantaged? Johnson said we\u2019ve got to look very carefully all the impact this virus has had on society. He added that workplaces must be \u201cCovid-secure\u201d and employers will not get away with forcing people to work in places that are not safe. The government will have random spot checks and Johnson called on employees to report unsafe work environments. \u201cWe have an ambition to get at least some hospitality going by July 4th,\u201d Johnson said. He added British people are an \u201cingenious bunch\u201d and will find ways to keep the economy going if a vaccine isn\u2019t found soon. Johnson said the Common Travel Area will remain between Northern Ireland and the republic of Ireland. Johnson said it is right that devolved nations are taking slightly different approaches to the lockdown as the virus is spreading at a different pace across the UK. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to respect local issues, local flare up, local problems,\u201d he added. When asked when will the public be allowed to see their family members, Johnson said: \u201cThere are new flexibility to ensure that people can see somebody who isn\u2019t in their household, but you have to do it one by one, outdoors and obeying social distancing.\u201d \u201cWhat we said to over-70s \u2013 who in my experience are often in rude, robust health \u2013 was they should take care. We didn\u2019t say they should be shielded,\u201d Johnson said. People with serious underlying health condition must be still protected, he added. Whitty said he is confident there will be a solution to the coronavirus, \u201cbut it will take time.\u201d Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser, said \u201cthere\u2019s been great progress made\u201d on vaccines across the world. He said he would be surprised if there wasn\u2019t either a vaccine or therapeutic drug. When asked whether he approved of the change of guidance, professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer, said Professor Chris Whitty, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been involved in all stages of the process. \u201cNeither Sir Patrick and I would consider ourselves to be comms experts so we\u2019re not going to get involved in actual details of actual comms strategies.\u201d Whitty could be responding to the Guardian\u2019s story that they were both not asked to approve the controversial new \u201cstay alert\u201d message I don\u2019t think any of us expect that suddenly tomorrow there will be a flood of people back to work, Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking baby steps.\u201d In response to a question on childcare arrangements for people who have been asked to return to work, but are not key workers and can therefore not send their children to schools, Johnson said it was an obvious barrier to work and employers should be understanding. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Kate Proctor tweeted what stay alert means. First question asks if people can see friends and families in the park if they maintain social distancing. Johnson said people can go to the park to exercise alone or with members of their own household, but if someone want to meet a person outside of your household, it must be them and another person - as a pair. \u201cIf everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control the coronavirus by keeping the R down,\u201d Johnson said. The R, or the \u201ceffective reproduction number\u201d, is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. Johnson: \u201cYes, staying alert, for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.\u201d Johnson reiterates: \u201cThose who cannot work from home should now speak to their employer about going back to work.\u201d Throughout the period of the lockdown, the UK has been in level four of the government\u2019s Covid alert levels, Johnson said. The UK is now in the position to take careful steps to go to level three. Johnson starts the press conference with the latest update on coronavirus cases and deaths. There have been been another 210 coronavirus deaths in the UK, taking the total to 32,065. Boris Johnson\u2019s evening presser is about to start. The prime minister will be taking four questions from journalists and eight from members of public. Branches of Burger King and Starbucks will reopen this week, as the UK\u2019s cafes and restaurants begin to emerge from the coronavirus lockdown, Hilary Osborne and Rebecca Smithers report. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Kate Proctor explains what the new lockdown rules are The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, the daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Sunday, 397 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 74 prisons, a 2% rise since Wednesday, when the data last published, while the number of infected prison staff rose to 479 workers across 69 prisons, an increase of 7% in the same period. The number of prisoners who have contracted Covid-19 and died stands at 21, while eight staff have died, including one prisoner escort and custody services worker. There are around 81,000 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons. The BBC has broadcast a short speech by Sir Keir Starmer responding to the prime minister\u2019s address last night. It will be on BBC One later, but it has already been on Radio 4. Here are the main points. Starmer accused Johnson of failing to provide enough clarity about the way forward. \u201cIf we\u2019re to complete the journey safely a roadmap needs clear directions,\u201d he said. Here is the passage in full. What we needed from the prime minister last night was clarity and reassurance. We needed to hear that nobody would be asked to go to work or send their children to school without it being safe to do so. We needed to know that the huge problems we\u2019ve seen with protective equipment are over. That the crisis in our care homes has finally been gripped. That everybody who needs a test can finally get one. Above all, we needed know when we could see our loved ones again. The prime minister said he was setting out a road map, but if we\u2019re to complete the journey safely a roadmap needs clear directions. He highlighted a series of questions that he said the government had failed to answer. He said: How can we be sure our workplaces are now safe to return to? How can we get to work safely if we need public transport to do so? How can millions of people go back to work while balancing childcare and caring responsibilities How do our police enforce these rules? And why are some parts of the United Kingdom now on a different path to others? He said that he was committed to \u201cworking constructively with the government in the national interest\u201d. He said that there should be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d after the crisis was over. He said: After all this, all the sacrifice and the loss, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual. We can\u2019t go back to a society where we clap our carers once a week but where half of our care workers are paid less than the real living wage. We can\u2019t go back to a society where we pay tribute to the heroes of the Second World War, but see our care homes as an afterthought. And we can\u2019t go back to a country where we don\u2019t invest in our public services, but expect our frontline workers to protect us. I\u2019m finishing now. For the rest of the evening, including for the Boris Johnson press conference at 7pm (where most of the questions will come from members of the public, not from journalists), Aamna Mohdin is in charge. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said the \u201crisks are too great\u201d to ease the lockdown and that too many people are still dying in her address to the nation. Sturgeon said the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care has fallen by almost two thirds in the last four weeks, while the number of deaths registered in a single week fell last week for the first time since the epidemic started The first minister welcomed this progress, but described it as fragile. She said: If we ease up too soon, the virus could run out of control again. That would mean more people dying and all of us staying in lockdown much longer. There will of course be risks whenever we start to ease the lockdown. But my judgement right now is that the risk is still too great. Sturgeon said too many people are still dying in Scotland and the situation in care homes remains a serious concern. The R number, the rate at which the virus reproduces, is still close to one, she added. If it exceeds one, the virus could rapidly take off again. The Scottish government announced one change to the rules yesterday; allowing people to exercise outdoors more than once a day. But the rest of the lockdown remains in place, despite some easing announced in England. Sturgeon said: As First Minister, I know the impact this has on all of you. And as a citizen, I miss my family too. But I won\u2019t risk unnecessary deaths by acting rashly or prematurely. So I am asking you please, for the moment, to continue to do what you have been doing so responsibly. I also want to say a special thank you to children. Not being at school, or seeing your friends, or hugging your grandparents is really tough. For all of us, I know it\u2019s getting harder but let\u2019s keep supporting each other even as we stay apart. Sturgeon emphasised the important of people in Scotland remaining at home, describing the measure as key to protecting loved ones. She said: Let\u2019s remember what matters most - health, family, community. Staying at home now is an expression of love, kindness and solidarity. We are doing it for each other, not just ourselves. It is how we protect each other, protect our NHS, and save lives. And it will also bring forward that moment when we can begin a return to normality. So once again, my thanks to each and every one of you. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this afternoon the prime minister\u2019s spokesman confirmed that, when Boris Johnson spoke about testing a town\u2019s water supply for Covid earlier (see 4.28pm), he was talking about sewage. \u201cWaste water\u201d was a polite term for it, the spokesman said. It sounds as if Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, was not convinced by Boris Johnson\u2019s denial of the Guardian report saying that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, did not sign off the new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. Davey has posted his question on Twitter. In response, Johnson just said: Mr Speaker, that\u2019s not right. Boris Johnson\u2019s statement to the Commons contained a few new insights, although nothing that substantially transforms the picture given by the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan published earlier. He faced some robust criticism from the opposition, but what was missing was any evidence of a backlash from Conservatives. Some Tory backbenchers are reportedly concerned that the lockdown is being allowed to continue for too long. But we did not hear that this afternoon. Partly that might be a function of the new format (there is no \u201cmood of the house\u201d on Zoom, as James Forsyth pointed out recently), but maybe they\u2019re just reserving judgment. Here are the main points. Johnson rejected claims that people did not understand his new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. Yesterday Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and Scottish first minister, said she did not know what this meant. But when the SNP\u2019s Chris Law asked Johnson to explain this, he insisted it was clear. He said: It will be perfectly obvious to the house what we\u2019re trying to do, and what we\u2019re saying by \u201cStay alert\u201d. What we\u2019re now saying is we\u2019re emphasising, or re-emphasising, the importance of those who cannot work from home going to work, provided their workplaces are Covid secure, provided that they observe the rules of social distancing on public transport, or however they go to work. That is what staying alert means. Staying alert is going to be absolutely vital to our continued success in beating this virus. I think the British public understands exactly what we are trying to do. In response to another claim that his new guidance was not clear, Johnson said he trusted the British public to apply \u201cgood, solid British common sense\u201d. (See 3.59pm.) Johnson said the Health and Safety Executive would be enforcing the new \u201cCovid secure\u201d guidance for employers, using spot checks. He said: The Health and Safety Executive [HSE] will be enforcing it and we will be having spot inspections to make sure that businesses are keeping their employees safe, and of course it\u2019ll be open to employees who do not feel safe to raise that, not just with their employers but with the HSE as well. He hinted that the government would use sewage testing to monitor for new coronavirus outbreaks. This is what he seemed to be referring to when he told the Conservative Robert Courts that there would be monitoring for local flare-ups. Johnson said: The intention is the Covid alert system in time will be sufficiently sensitive and flexible as to detect local flare-ups, so that for instance if Covid is detected in the water supply of a certain town, then steps can be taken, or in a school, in an area, then steps can be taken on the spot to deal with that flare-up. Measures can be taken to keep the R down locally as well as nationally. He said the 18,000 new contract tracers being recruited by the government would be in place by 18 May. He said people should not use the new guidance on outdoor exercise as an excuse to visit second homes. He said: We don\u2019t want to see people, let me repeat, we don\u2019t want to see people travelling to another home for a holiday or to a second home, that is not what this is about. He said parents without childcare should not be expected to go to work. He said: I want to stress if you can\u2019t get the childcare you need to get to work then that is plainly an impediment on your ability to work and your employer should recognise that. He said there would be \u201cvery substantial reductions in capacity\u201d on public transport as a result of social distancing. He rejected a claim that Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, failed to sign off the new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. He rejected claims he had been reduced to acting as the prime minister of England, not of the UK. (See 4.07pm.) Sir Richard Branson has agreed to sell shares worth around $500m (\u00a3405m) in his Virgin Galactic space business to raise funds for his struggling airline and leisure businesses, PA reports. The businessman, who has previously suggested he would be willing to remortgage his private Caribbean island to raise funds, said the cash would be reinvested into firms including Virgin Atlantic. Announcing the plans via the New York Stock Exchange, Virgin Group said it would sell 25m shares via Credit Suisse, with the process expected to cost the business $167,000. The shares, sold via Branson\u2019s British Virgin Islands-based shell company Vieco 10, account for around a fifth of the billionaire\u2019s stake in the space tourism business. The easing of some lockdown rules is a particularly tricky matter for the golfers of Llanymynech, on the border of England and Wales. Boris Johnson\u2019s exit plan means golfers in England have begun to dig out their gear in readiness for tee-off time on Wednesday, but clubs in Wales are expected to remain closed. The problem for Llanymynech, a hilly course located between Welshpool and Shrewsbury, is that some of it lies in England and some in Wales. Fifteen holes are wholly in Wales and two in England. On the fourth hole, the golfer hits his or her first shot in Wales and putts out on a green in England. The course has been closed since the start of lockdown but members are beginning to wonder if there is any way they can argue that it ought to reopen. The club secretary, Sian Whiteoak, said: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work it out. We have some holes in England and some holes in Wales, so we don\u2019t know what we can do.\u201d The photographer Jill Mead has been documenting the quirky, unusual and downright strange occurrences in her local neighbourhoods and other parts of the capital. Dan Sabbagh and Severin Carrell report on how the coronavirus biosecurity centre will monitor local outbreaks. Schools and businesses in a local area could be forced to close if the new coronavirus biosecurity centre identifies a new disease outbreak, according to the government\u2019s action plan for overcoming the pandemic. The Whitehall centre is to have an \u201cindependent analytical function\u201d to assess the rate of infection community by community \u2013 and recommend urgent lockdown measures if deemed necessary. \u201cIt will identify specific actions to address local spikes in infections\u201d according to the 60 page document and advise ministers \u201cto close schools or workplaces where infection rates have spiked\u201d to tackle unexpected outbreaks. The Joint Biosecurity Centre will also have responsibility for measuring a five-tier coronavirus alert system announced by Boris Johnson last night for England, and will be based in the Cabinet Office, responsible for cross-government coordination. But there was little other fresh detail about the centre in the plan, such as who would staff or run it. Its initial announcement on Sunday had already been criticised by the Scottish government for not briefing it in advance. Far from the moment of clarity and reassurance many were hoping for, Boris Johnson\u2019s Sunday evening address to the nation seemed to raise more questions than it answered. What day were people supposed to return to work? How many individuals were allowed to meet outdoors? Metro\u2019s front page on Monday invoked the prime minister\u2019s passion for classics with the headline \u201cIt\u2019s all Greek to us Boris\u201d, and the Mirror described lockdown Britain as \u201cchaos\u201d. From a public communications perspective, it was not \u2013 it is fair to say \u2013 a success. Chris Whitehouse, the managing director of the Whitehouse Consultancy communications agency, said: I am normally a Boris fan and I backed him for the Conservative leadership, but I thought his address yesterday was a dog\u2019s dinner in terms of communication. It sowed doubt, confusion and uncertainty. Ahead of the prime minister\u2019s speech on Sunday evening \u2013 an embargoed copy of which was shared with the media \u2013 government sources briefed political journalists with details of some additional measures that were included in the 50-page guidance to be published 24 hours later. Whitehouse added: I would have published the document first, embargoed to the media so they had time to read it and see precisely what it said, and then I would have kept the messaging very simple and very clear. Equality campaigners, including the former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott, have warned that the change in lockdown measures will hit black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people harder because they are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to to be forced to use public transport to travel to their place of work. Abbott said: \u201cLow-paid workers across the board are going to be hit by this recklessly premature move to exit the lockdown. This will also disproportionately affect black and Asian workers. No one should be forced to risk death at work. Workers need to know they will be supported if they refuse to do so.\u201d BAME people have already been disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Figures published last week showed that black people in the UK are more than four times more likely to die from coronavirus than white people. After taking into account age, measures of self-reported health and disability and other socio-demographic characteristics, black people were still almost twice as likely as white people to die a Covid-19-related death. Bangladeshi and Pakistani men and women were more than 1.5 times likely to die than their white counterparts, when other factors were accounted for. Recent research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that a third of all working-age black Africans are employed in key worker roles \u2013 50% more than the white British population. Sabby Dhalu, the Stand up to Racism co-convenor, said: \u201cWith the previous lockdown Britain already had one of the worst capita death rates in the world. The government\u2019s easing of the lockdown is creeping herd immunity and will inevitably lead to more deaths and infections, with BAME communities disproportionately hit once again.\u201d The UK government has given permission for the Premier League and other professional sports to return behind closed doors from 1 June, providing its five tests on controlling the coronavirus are met, Paul MacInnes reports. Around 3% of ambulance service staff with no Covid-19 symptoms have tested positive for the virus during a pilot scheme, PA reports. Figures released by West Midlands ambulance service (WMAS) said 16 of 543 asymptomatic members of its frontline staff had tested positive during a two-day trial. A spokesman said: West Midlands ambulance service can confirm that it has been taking part in a national project to understand better whether Covid-19 is prevalent among NHS staff and patients who do not have symptoms. Testing of ambulance service staff is the third phase of the project. In total, 543 frontline ambulance staff who did not have symptoms of coronavirus were tested over two days. Just over 97% came back negative. While the number of positive results is very small \u201316 in total \u2013 it does show the importance of us all continuing to practise social distancing. WMAS has been at the forefront of testing staff displaying symptoms of Covid-19, with almost 1,500 employees and immediate family members tested. Moves to reopen garden centres this week in England have been welcomed by the horticulture industry, PA reports. Garden centres in England are being allowed to open their doors follows months of closure. Many businesses have faced ruin as the market for seasonal plants shut down at a time when people normally flock to outlets to restock their gardens. Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) chairman James Barnes described the reopening of garden centres in England as \u201ca positive economic move\u201d and called for Scotland to follow suit. Barnes said: This is not only a positive economic move but gardening benefits the mental health and wellbeing of so many people isolating at home and the importance of having something to do at home keeps you at home. The Church of England said it was examining what steps were needed for churches to safely reopen following the publication of government\u2019s coronavirus recovery strategy, which said places of worship could be closed until July 4 at the earliest. In a statement, the Bishop of London Dame Sarah Mullally said: We look forward to the time when we are able to gather again in our church buildings. We are examining what steps we will need to take to do so safely and are actively planning ahead in preparation. We strongly support the Government\u2019s approach of continuing to suppress the transmission of the virus and accordingly, we recognise that at this time public worship cannot return in the interests of public health and safety. The government\u2019s plan to ease certain aspects of lockdown in England is \u201ctoo fast, too confusing and too risky,\u201d according to British Medical Association (BMA). The trade union has warned the government\u2019s measures risks a second spike of this virus. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: There is no detail of how those being asked to return to work will be protected from the infection or prevented from infecting others and there are mixed messages about returning workers not using public transport when many will not own cars. These pose serious risks of further spread of the infection. There is no clarity on how social distancing will be monitored and enforced when lifting restrictions to visiting parks and public places and opening travel to any part of the land. Meanwhile the level of testing to monitor spread remains far below the capacity needed and there is still no agreement even about the best app for testing and tracing. Peter Aldous, a Conservative, says constituents worry that reopening primary schools could be a significant threat, both in the classroom and at the school gate. Will the PM address these concerns? Johnson says 1 June is a possible date for schools, on the advice of the scientists. But that is only provisional, he says. And he says special guidance for schools will be published. And that\u2019s it. The statement is over. Johnson says he thinks the public understand exactly what \u201cStay alert\u201d means. Maria Eagle, the Labour MP, says the government originally said it would give the councils to cover all the money they spent on coronavirus. But now it is only saying it will pay them for tasks the government wants them to carry out. Will councils get everything they need? Johnson says he will consider this point, and take it up with the communities secretary. Sir Edward Leigh, a Conservative, says the country faces the biggest recession for centuries. Will the PM put in place effective accounting to ensure public money is not being wasted? Johnson says he will. But he says the biggest risk at the moment would be the virus returning. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem MP, says the government has produced figures on items of PPE supplied, but not items of PPE needed. Will the government release these figures? Johnson says he will consider this point. There have been no national stock-outs, he says. Johnson says the more relaxed rules on exercise do not mean that people should be travelling to second homes, or to the countryside for holidays. Labour\u2019s Kate Green asks Johnson to confirm that there is no intention to change the rules on benefit conditionality. She says no one should be penalised for not taking up a dangerous job. Johnson agrees. He says no one should be penalised for doing the right thing. Johnson says, if Covid is detected in the water supply of a town (presumably he means in the sewage), new restrictions could be imposed locally. UPDATE: He did mean sewage. See 6pm. The SNP\u2019s Chris Law asks if the PM will support above-inflation pay settlements for civil servants because of what they have done. Johnson says he will not comment on pay, but he says he wants to thank the civil service for their work \u201cfrom the bottom of my heart\u201d. Labour\u2019s Karen Buck asks if Johnson thinks everyone travelling on public transport in the capital should wear a face covering. Johnson says the government is not making it compulsory. But the government does view this as \u201cadvisory\u201d. Andy Carter, a Conservative, asks what will be done to help parents with childcare. Johnson says the government wants to bring some primary school pupils back in June. And it wants all primary school pupils to have at least a month in school before the end of July, he says. This what the coronavirus recovery plan says about schools. The government expects children to be able to return to early years settings, and for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to be back in school in smaller sizes, from this point. This aims to ensure that the youngest children, and those preparing for the transition to secondary school, have maximum time with their teachers. Secondary schools and further education colleges should also prepare to begin some face to face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in support of their continued remote, home learning. The government\u2019s ambition is for all primary school children to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible, though this will be kept under review. The Department of Education will engage closely with schools and early years providers to develop further detail and guidance on how schools should facilitate this. The SNP\u2019s Drew Hendry asks Johnson to confirm that the value of the furlough scheme will be reduced by a quarter. Johnson says Hendry should not believe everything in the press. The chancellor will make a statement on this tomorrow, he says. Alexander Stafford, a Conservative, asks if this plan is flexible enough to adjust to different circumstances. Johnson says the government will of course be flexible. If there are local flare-ups, \u201cwe will not hesitate to put on the brakes\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn, the former Labour leader, says the PM\u2019s announcement will make inequalities worse, because workers will not be safe in the workforce. Johnson does not accept that. He says now is the time to take some small steps forward. Johnson says there is a \u201chuge opportunity\u201d for the UK to have a cleaner, greener transport system after the crisis is over. Johnson says the government is committed to keeping employees safe. He says the Health and Safety Executive will be enforcing the new guidelines. And there will be spot inspections, he says. Henry Smith, the Conservative MP for Crawley, asks what will be done to protect aviation. He says his constituents will lose out because of the impact on Gatwick. Johnson says he wants to keep Britain flying, but first the government has to tackle coronavirus. Johnson says the new, increased fines for people breaking lockdown rules will be \u00a3100, or \u00a350 if paid early (instead of \u00a360/\u00a330). And they will rise to a potental maximum of \u00a33,600 for repeat offences, he says. (In reference to these measures Johnson is speaking as prime minister of England.) Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, says there is now a three nations approach; Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all agree. Can the PM confirm he is acting as prime minister of England? Johnson rejects that. He says he is offering good advice for the whole of the UK. But he says he accepts why in different places different policy may be needed. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, asks Johnson to confirm that neither the chief medical adviser nor the chief scientific adviser signed off the new \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. \u201cThat\u2019s not right,\u201d says Johnson. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the PM has generated confusion. He says: \u201cMixed messaging risks lives.\u201d First, he asks the PM to confirm that in the devolved nations the \u201cStay at home\u201d advice still applies. He says the PM said last night he had consulted with the devolved administrations. But will he confirm he did not consult on the slogan. Can he promise not to deploy the slogan in Scotland? When will quarantine be enforced? And is it true that Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, told the airline industry that if this was too complicated, it would not be enforced. And will the PM confirm people in Scotland should follow Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s advice? Johnson says the answer to question one is yes, and the answer to question four is no. On other points, he says the four nations have more in common than Blackford implies. Johnson says different approaches from the devolved nations are to be welcomed when needed because R, the reproduction number is different in different places. Referring to Wales having different rules on exercise, he says there will be many examples of anomalies like this. But he says everyone understands what the government is trying to do. He says he thinks people will apply \u201cgood, solid British common sense\u201d. Johnson says guidelines on places of employment will be published tonight. And the transport ones will be out tomorrow, he says. Johnson is responding to Starmer. He says until now people have been following the \u201cStay at home\u201d advice. People may have followed it more thoroughly than in other countries, he says. But now we have to take \u201csmall, limited steps\u201d to come out of the lockdown. He says, when you are coming out of a message that is so \u201cgloriously simple\u201d, there will inevitably be complexities. On childcare, Johnson says the government expects employers to be reasonable. If people do not have childcare, they cannot be expected to go to work. Johnson says parents without childcare should not be expected to go to work. Starmer is still speaking. He asks what rules will apply to public transport. And what about childcare? Will childcare workers go back on Wednesday? Starmer turns to the quarantine plan. Johnson says this would apply to people arriving by air. But the document says it will cover all arrivals? And is it England, or for the whole of the UK? He says there is no consensus on messaging between the UK government and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. He asks Johnson to confirm that people won\u2019t be able to travel to Scotland for exercise. Won\u2019t this make enforcement hard? Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is responding to Johnson. He starts by saying he accepts how difficult these decisions are. The country needs clarity and reassurance. At the moment both are in short supply, he says. He says the PM\u2019s statement caused \u201cconsiderable confusion\u201d. He says No 10 put out a press release on Sunday implying construction and manufacturing would go back on Monday. But the document says a wider set of employees (see 3.38pm) should go back on Wednesday. But safety guidelines are not ready. Will they be ready tomorrow? Have they been agreed? And will they only apply in England? Johnson sums up by using the \u201cStay alert\u201d slogan. Johnson says in July, if the data supports this, the government will move to stage three. It will then open some hospitality and leisure businesses. But that will only be if they can maintain social distancing, he sayss. And he says the government will not hesitate to put on the brakes if necessary. Johnson says from Wednesday there will be no limits on the outdoor exercise people can take. He is referring to England only, but does not make this clear. He says people can do this with members of their own households, or with one other person. And people can drive as far as they want to exercise this right, provided that they observe the rules of the devolved administrations. (In other words, they should not drive to Scotland or Wales, he means.) And he says people who are clinically vulnerable should continue to observe the current rules. This is what the document says about this group. It remains the case that some people are more clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 than others. These include those aged over 70, those with specific chronic pre-existing conditions and pregnant women. These clinically vulnerable people should continue to take particular care to minimise contact with others outside their households, but do not need to be shielded. Those in the clinically extremely vulnerable group are strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact; this is called \u2018shielding\u2019. It means not leaving the house or attending gatherings at all, with very limited exceptions. Johnson says the government is now advising people to wear face coverings in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not possible. But he says this does not mean people should wear medical face masks. Johnson says Dido Harding, a peer and chair of NHS Improvement, will take charge of a programme that will oversee mass testing. He says the government wants workers who cannot work from home to return to work. This is what the document says about this. All workers who cannot work from home should travel to work if their workplace is open. Sectors of the economy that are allowed to be open should be open, for example this includes food production, construction, manufacturing, logistics, distribution and scientific research in laboratories. The only exceptions to this are those workplaces such as hospitality and non-essential retail which during this first step the government is requiring to remain closed. The challenge now is to find a way forward, Johnson says. He says the government has a \u201csupremely difficult balance to strike\u201d. He says there may need to be divergence in different parts of the UK. But any such divergence should be short term, he says. Johnson says the British people have faced a grave threat. They have changed their way of live. Tragically many families have lost loved ones. Yet the NHS has not been overwhelmed. Many more lives would have been lost if it had been, he says. He says the reproduction number has been cut to between 0.5 and 0.9. Boris Johnson is starting his Commons statement about the coronavirus recovery plan now. \u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste\u201d is sound political advice, normally attributed to the former Barack Obama aide Rahm Emanuel, and it seems from the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan, that Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, is taking it to heart. Cummings has for years been a fierce critic of the way Whitehall is structured and the civil service operates. He used to say Brexit would be \u201can exercise far beyond Whitehall as it currently works\u201d. His critics think he was right about that one. Now the government is proposing \u201ca rapid re-engineering of government\u2019s structures and institutions\u201d to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Here is the relevant extract from the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan (pdf). Covid-19 has been perhaps the biggest test of governments worldwide since the 1940s. As the government navigates towards recovery, it must ensure it learns the right lessons from this crisis and acts now to ensure that governmental structures are fit to cope with a future epidemic, including the prospect of an outbreak of a second epidemic - for example, a pandemic flu - while the government is still responding to Covid-19. This will require a rapid re-engineering of government\u2019s structures and institutions to deal with this historic emergency and also build new long-term foundations for the UK, and to help the rest of the world. The government have published further guidance on what the public can and cannot do as the lockdown is eased. Check out the update to the frequently asked questions on how they will apply in England. The IWGB union, which represents some of workers hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic such as security guards and cab drivers, is taking legal action against the government for its failure to provide income protection and sick pay. The union\u2019s general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, said: The fact that security guards and private hire drivers have one of the highest death rates from Covid-19 is unfortunately not very surprising. The workers on the front lines, who cannot work from home, and often work for some of the worst employers in the UK are at extreme risk. Their health and safety needs to be treated with far more care. That is why the IWGB is taking legal action against the government over its failure to provide proper income protection and sick pay to millions of precarious workers. Sky\u2019s Sam Coates has a useful summary of more lines from the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan. Our colleague Dan Sabbagh is interested in a passage at the end of the coronavirus recovery plan. Dominic Ponsford, the editor of the Press Gazette, says No 10 has backed down on its plan for Boris Johnson not to take any questions from the press later today (see 9.48am). We have not been told yet when this will be, although there are suggestions that it might be later than the usual 5pm. A female worker at a meat processing plant in Northern Ireland has died of coronavirus, prompting union demands for the factory to be temporarily shut down. It is understood she died five days ago and was originally from East Timor. After learning about her death, the Unite union called for Moy Park\u2019s site in Dungannon, Co Tyrone, to be shut down while its workforce and their families are tested for the virus. Unite also said the Health and Safety Executive of Northern Ireland must be instructed to carry out \u201cunannounced physical inspections\u201d of all meat processing sites across the region. Sam McKeever, Unite\u2019s regional officer, said the union had been raising concerns for some time over alleged failures to ensure proper physical distancing on meat production lines at Moy Park plants in Dungannon and Portadown. The coronavirus recovery plan says the UK should become self-sufficient in PPE, the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth reports. Obviously this is a reference to manufacturing capacity, not just people at home sewing their own along the lines set out at 2.42pm. As Heather Stewart reports, the government is also offering advice on how to make your own face covering. She has posted a link on Twitter to the relevant page on the government\u2019s website. The government is talking about face coverings, not face masks, because it does not want people buying up surgical face masks needed by the NHS. Here is our first story on the government\u2019s coronavirus recovery plan. It\u2019s by Heather Stewart. This is how it starts. The public will be advised to wear face coverings in crowded places and wash their clothes regularly, as the government imposes \u201csmarter controls\u201d to limit the spread the coronavirus until a successful treatment or vaccine is found. After Boris Johnson\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday, which a backlash from unions and opposition politicians about the lack of a clear message, the government has published a 60-page document called Our Plan to Rebuild. More outdoor activities are being allowed from this week but the public will be expected to take extra caution, including by wearing face coverings in some situations. One union leader has said Boris Johnson is treating workers like expendable guinea pigs by failing to set rules over workplace safety and social distancing. The PCS\u2019s general secretary, Mark Serwortka, said: Boris Johnson has issued confusing advice, and that confusion will cost lives. But he has clarified one thing \u2013 that the government views those he is telling to go back to work as expendable. Employers are not fully prepared for masses of people to return to workplaces safely. Guidance is only just being issued today and unless trade union health and safety reps are a key component of this, workers will have no confidence in the safety and social distancing measures being put in place. Ministers are treating workers like guinea pigs and gambling with peoples\u2019 lives. The Department for Health and Social Care says there have been been another 210 coronavirus deaths in the UK, taking the total to 32,065. This figures just covers people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died. There will be many people who have died from coronavirus without testing positive. The government has just published what it calls its coronavirus recovery plan. It\u2019s here (pdf). It runs to 60 pages. We will be posting highlights here on the live blog shortly. The BBC is going to broadcast a message to the nation from Sir Keir Starmer tonight, giving the Labour leader a right to reply to what Boris Johnson announced last night. The imminent return of jury trials has been widely accepted as necessary. (See 11.39am.) David Lammy, Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, welcomed the move and called for remote justice hearings to be made accessible to the public. He said: Safety is rightly the priority during this pandemic, but the justice system must still be able to do its job. There is still more the government can do. Many public buildings, including university lecture halls, school buildings and leisure centres are currently sitting empty. Labour is calling on the Ministry of Justice to co-opt these buildings to carry out further socially distanced jury trials according to public health advice. Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council of England and Wales, said: It is very encouraging to see that jury trials will start up again from mid-May. Jury trials are essential to our criminal justice system and to the rule of law. It is reassuring that efforts to restart jury trials have involved a painstaking and cautious approach, that prioritises practical measures to ensure the safety of all those involved in the delivery of criminal justice. Judging by the comments, a lot of readers enjoyed Piers Morgan\u2019s clash with the Tory MP Andrew Bridgen on Good Morning Britain this morning. Bridgen was defending the PM and his record on coronavirus. You can watch it in full here. The stark contrast between death rates for care home workers and their NHS counterparts, revealed today by the Office for National Statistics, has triggered an angry reaction from the care sector. The ONS found that 45 men and 86 women working in social care died from Covid-19 in England and Wales, based on death registrations up to 20 April. (See 12.16pm.) This was around twice the mortality rate from the virus experienced among NHS workers whose likelihood of being killed by the virus was in line with the general population. Care England, which represents many of the largest care home providers, said it was wrong to blame its members for a failure to supply enough personal protective equipment because their ability to buy kit was hampered at the start of the pandemic by central government moving to commandeer supplies for the NHS. \u201cThe government completely stopped our supply chain,\u201d said Martin Green, the chief executive of Care England. Everything was being sent to the NHS. Our normal supply chains were being disrupted by the government. They focused every single bit of energy on the NHS. Why weren\u2019t care staff given the same protection as NHS staff? By 24 April there were 5,890 deaths from Covid-19 in care homes in England and Wales, according to ONS figures based on what is written on death certificates. On Sunday, HC-One, the largest provider of private care homes, said it alone had lost 829 residents to confirmed or suspected cases of the disease. Boris Johnson conceded in his Sunday evening TV address that there had been \u201cawful epidemics in care homes\u201d. Care home staff have also been struggling to get tested and tests for residents with suspected cases have been limited, operators say, with tests not carried out after an outbreak has been confirmed in a home. As our colleague Rowena Mason reported yesterday, Momentum, the Labour group set up to promote Jeremy Corbyn and his brand of politics, has criticised Sir Keir Starmer for not advocating rent cancellation for people who cannot afford to pay their landlords because they have lost work because of coronavirus. Our colleague Owen Jones, a prominent Labour leftwinger, also tweeted on this last week. This might seem like an arcane policy dispute in a party that is out of power, but it is interesting because it is the first serious indication of Starmer falling out with the Labour Corbynite left. A lot will depend on whether this becomes the norm, and, if so, who prevails. During his LBC phone-in this morning Starmer was asked about this by a Labour party member who is also renting who asked why he should support Starmer when Starmer was prioritising his landlord\u2019s income over his own. Starmer said he was glad the issue had been raised, because we wanted to clear this up. He made two arguments. Starmer said that, if the government cancelled rents, landlords would be entitled to compensation. That would not be a good use of public money, he argued. He said: If all rents are suspended full stop, then the government will have to pay to compensate landlords. There\u2019s no question about that. And therefore public money will be paid to landlords for the fact that they haven\u2019t got rent, even where people don\u2019t lose their jobs. He said that, if renters did lose their job, he favoured helping them through the benefits system. He said: If somebody does lose their job, then the benefits system should be paying the rent at a better rate. Almost 400,000 people have signed a petition demanding that parents should be given the choice about whether or not to send their children back into schools once they start reopening to more pupils next month. The petition was launched following Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on Sunday that the government plans to press ahead with opening primary schools in England from as early as June 1, starting with reception and years 1 and 6, followed by the rest of the primary year groups. Currently schools are only open to a tiny minority of pupils, who are either children of key workers or pupils classed as vulnerable, and many parents and head teachers are concerned about the safety implications of opening up to more pupils - particularly younger pupils who struggle to observe social distancing rules. The Change.org petition, which was started by London parent Lucy Browne, states: I\u2019m calling on the UK government to give parents and guardians the option of not sending their children back to school if they reopen in June - as Boris Johnson has suggested this could happen in England. As a mum I don\u2019t want to face serious repercussions for making a choice I feel affects the safety of my daughter during a global pandemic. The UK now has the highest death toll in Europe and second highest in the world. Many of us have lost confidence in the government\u2019s handling of this crisis and feel it is too early to return children to schools. It seems it could pose risks not only to children but also teachers and those they live with - grandparents, parents and those underlying health conditions. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has expressed concern that Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement on changes to lockdown could lead to more coronavirus cases in Wales. Drakeford said he was worried that the prime minister was not as clear as he ought to have been on what the changes meant across the UK. He warned people not to travel from England to Wales to exercise and said there had been an increase in traffic in Wales over the weekend. Speaking at the daily press conference in Cardiff, Drakeford said he still believed that all parts of the UK were moving in the same direction, making small adjustments to the lockdown. But he said: There are some differences in the messaging between England and Wales which I am concerned may cause confusion. Drakeford said the four Welsh police forces had reported a \u201cdistinct increase\u201d in activity over the bank holiday weekend and suggested this was after many UK national newspapers reported that a major easing of the lockdown was on the horizon. There was also an increase in traffic and alcohol-related violence associated with VE Day celebrations. While Johnson has said people will be able to travel to exercise, the message in Wales is that people should exercise locally. Drakeford said: We have concerns that traffic flow into Wales could continue to increase as a result of the prime minister\u2019s announcement that travel to exercise will be allowed in England. I want to be clear in Wales it is Welsh law that applies. Travelling to Wales to exercise is not to exercise locally. He said signs would inform motorists of this on major routes in Wales but he said there were no plans to actually shut the border. Drakeford said he had sympathy with people who would not grasp the differences between what was allowed in England and Wales. \u201cI do have sympathy with people who haven\u2019t heard that message with sufficient clarity because of the way it was announced yesterday,\u201d he said. He added: I wish the UK government were sometimes clearer about when they are speaking for England and when they are speaking for the UK. I didn\u2019t think that was as clear as it could have been all the time yesterday. He once again called for more regular meetings between the four UK nations. Asked if he was worried that the tone of Johnson\u2019s announcement could have an impact on the number of Covid-19 cases in Wales, he said: \u201cI have to be concerned about that.\u201d He added that he didn\u2019t want to see the \u201cheadroom\u201d Wales currently has in dealing with the crisis eroded \u201cbecause people are exercising freedoms they have elsewhere but not in Wales.\u201d Asked whether the furlough scheme would remain longer in Scotland, Sturgeon said she wants the financial government to stay as long as needed. \u201cIf we have different parts of the UK on slightly different timelines, then the schemes have to recognise that,\u201d she added. An estimate published last week suggests 26,000 people in Scotland have been infected with the virus, Sturgeon said. Sturgeon said there is not any plan or any need for increased policing at the Scottish border. It\u2019s not for me to judge whether these actions are premature for England, Sturgeon said, but insisted actions to ease the lockdown are premature for Scotland. \u201cI can\u2019t judge the right speed for England, but it is my responsibility to judge the right speed for Scotland.\u201d Sturgeon said she still wants as much alignment as possible with all four UK nations, but it has to be guided by science and advice as it applies in Scotland. When the Guardian\u2019s Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, asked whether Scotland would also be adopting England\u2019s five colour alert system, Sturgeon said she didn\u2019t have a definitive answer yet. \u201cIdeally, it would be good if the whole of the UK had the same system of phasing, maybe not the same dates and timescales,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cWe would certainly be very open to looking at what the UK government publishes today.\u201d Sturgeon said she doesn\u2019t want to play \u201cRussian roulette\u201d with people\u2019s lives in response to Scotland\u2019s different response to the easing of the lockdown. Sturgeon said the differences in easing the lockdown are not down for political reasons, but factor in the different spread of the virus across the UK. \u201cI think the prime minister has to make it clearer when he is talking only for England,\u201d Sturgeon said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think is right for any government to do is to say we\u2019re encouraging people to go back to work who haven\u2019t worked so far before the guidance on what a safe working environment is has been published. That\u2019s the bit that should come first,\u201d Sturgeon said. When asked about a Scottish resident who works on a construction site in England and been told to return to work, Sturgeon said the position in Scotland has not changed. \u201cWe are saying to businesses that have not been operational so far, we are not encouraging you to get back to work right now,\u201d she added. Scotland\u2019s R number is between 0.7 to 1, Sturgeon said. She believes that R number has come down from above 3. Nicola Sturgeon said if you\u2019re coming from England to Scotland for reasons not deemed essential purposes you may be breaking the law. \u201cIf you are in Scotland, the law of Scotland applies and the law states right now you can only be outside of your house right now for essential reason.\u201d When asked if Scotland is remaining in lockdown because it is slightly behind on the infection curve, Sturgeon said: Based on our assessment of the R number, we think we are slightly higher than the rest of the UK. During the press briefing, Sturgeon specified that in Scotland, people should not be sunbathing or having a picnic during lockdown Throughout the briefing, Sturgeon warned against lifting the lockdown too soon as it would it only result in the country in being in some form of a lockdown for much longer and lead to the loss of many more lives. Sturgeon called on Scottish people not to be distracted by other messages from other nations within the UK. Sturgeon reiterates that the lockdown measures will remain the same in Scotland. \u201cTo combat this virus we still need to stay apart from each other, we still need to stay at home.\u201d Nicola Sturgeon said the key message remains the same in Scotland: \u201cStay at home.\u201d Businesses and schools are not being encouraged to open. Speaking of Boris Johnson\u2019s road map to reopen the country, Sturgeon said: I want to reiterate that those announcements do not apply yet here in Scotland. That is not let me stress for any political reasons. It is because the Scottish government is not yet confident that these changes can be made safely in Scotland yet without running the risk of the virus potentially running out of control again. The second coronavirus bill set to go through Scottish parliament will provide more financial support for carers, Sturgeon said. In the past 24 hours, five more people have died after contracting the coronavirus in Scotland bringing the total number to 1,862, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said in her daily press briefing. She added 13,627 people had now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, a rise of 141 from 13,486 the day before. There are 1,453 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down 31 from 1,484 the previous day. Of these patients, 80 are in intensive care, a fall of two. One of Britain\u2019s biggest undertakers has seen the proportion of clients choosing lower-cost funerals during the coronavirus pandemic triple. Dignity, which operates more than 800 funeral locations across the UK, said that in April the proportion of clients choosing a \u201c simple\u201d funeral jumped to 60% of all services conducted, up from 20% between January and March. The company charges up to \u00a33,578 for a full service funeral and about \u00a32,047 for a basic package. It said the restrictions on funeral services meant that the average cost of its full service reduced by about \u00a3400 in April to \u00a33,150, as it withdrew add-ons such as limousines. The company performed 20,000 funerals in the first quarter this year. Overall, Dignity said the average income per funeral fell from \u00a32,648 in the first quarter to \u00a32,200 in April. The ONS report out today (see 9.54am and 11.24am) also looks at the coronavirus death rate amongst healthcare workers and social care workers. Although coronavirus deaths amongst NHS workers have (rightly) received a lot of media attention, the ONS says that the death rate amongst this group is about the same as it is amongst the working-age population as a whole. It says: Among healthcare workers, rates of death involving Covid-19 were not found to be statistically different to rates of death involving Covid-19 in the general working population, with 10.2 deaths per 100,000 males (43 deaths) and 4.8 deaths per 100,000 females (63 deaths). But social care workers are roughly twice as likely to die from coronavirus as other workers, the figures show. Here are the figures for men working in social care and healthcare. The thick black line shows the average for working-age men. And here are the figures for women working in social care and healthcare. Lockdown fines will remain unchanged in Scotland after the nation\u2019s government found no evidence to suggest an increase was required, PA Media reports. People found breaking lockdown rules in Scotland will be first fined \u00a330 by police, which rises to \u00a360 if not paid within 28 days. Cumulative fines for repeat offenders are capped at \u00a3960. A Scottish government spokeswoman said: We do not have evidence which suggests that increasing the fixed penalty notice (FPN) amount is required in Scotland. The total levels of FPNs being passed down in Scotland are proportionately lower than in England. The approach being taken by Police Scotland is that enforcement is the last option and the vast majority of the public have been cooperating with lockdown regulations throughout the Covid-19 pandemic. Only on a minority of occasions has it been necessary to issue a fixed penalty notice. Regulations and guidance continue to be kept under review. The boss of British Airways owner said he heard \u201cnothing positive\u201d from the prime minister\u2019s proposal to quarantine people flying into the UK. In last night\u2019s address to the nation, Boris Johnson said it would \u201csoon be the time\u201d to bring in a quarantine period for air passengers to limit Covid-19 infections from abroad. Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA\u2019s parent company, International Airlines Group, said there was \u201cnothing positive\u201d in the address, PA Media reports. Giving evidence to the Commons transport select committee about the demand for air travel, Walsh said: The announcements yesterday of a 14-day period (for people) coming into the UK, it\u2019s definitely going to make it worse. There\u2019s nothing positive in anything that I heard the prime minister say yesterday. We had been planning to resume - on a pretty significant basis - our flying in July. I think we\u2019d have to review that based on what the prime minister said yesterday. Johnson and the French president, Emmanuel Macron ,have agreed that quarantine measures would not apply between France and the UK \u201cat this stage\u201d, according to a joint statement issued after the address. Walsh admitted he was surprised by the proposal, which did not mention arrivals by sea, and did not make clear whether it would include passengers on internal UK flights or on flights from the Republic of Ireland. Walsh said: Despite the fact that there had been some rumours about this quarantine period, I don\u2019t think anybody believed that the UK government would actually implement it if they were serious about getting the economy moving again.\u201d Brexit trade and future relationship talks resume today with the agenda, below, showing fisheries, level playing field and governance issues centre ground. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negogiator, will give an update on progress on Friday. The GMB union has described the ONS figures showing raised rates of deaths involving Covid-19 among men in certain occupations (see 11.24am) as \u201chorrifying\u201d. John Phillips, acting GMB general secretary, said: These figures are horrifying, and they were drawn up before the chaos of last night\u2019s announcement. If you are low paid and working through the Covid-19 crisis you are more likely to die - that\u2019s how stark these figures are. Ministers must pause any return to work until proper guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe. Jury trials, suspended in March due to the coronavirus crisis, will resume under new safety conditions in a limited number of crown courts in England and Wales from next week, the lord chief justice has announced. Lord Burnett of Maldon said the first courts in which juries can be sworn in from 18 May will include the central criminal court at the Old Bailey in London and Cardiff crown court. Special arrangements to maintain the safety of all participants and the jury have been agreed with the Ministry of Justice in line with Public Health England and Public Health Wales guidelines. Part-heard trials, suspended due to the pandemic, will begin cases before then \u201cwhere this can be done safely\u201d, according to the announcement. The lord chief justice said: \u201cIt is important that the administration of justice continues to function whenever it is possible in an environment which is consistent with the safety of all those involved.\u201d Small numbers of trials are expected to take place initially. Other courts around the country are being assessed for use. Trials will involve juries being spread out to allow social distancing and the use of a second courtroom linked by closed circuit TV, \u201cto enable reporters and others to watch the proceedings\u201d. The number of jurors has not been reduced and will remain at twelve. Welcoming the move, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, said: I am pleased that the courts are now in a position, with approval from Public Health England and Public Health Wales, to take some first steps towards the resumption of jury trials. A limited number of trials will take place, conducted safely and observing social distancing rules, at courts including the Old Bailey in London and at Cardiff crown court. These will also help us to understand how it might be possible to conduct trials more widely as the situation with coronavirus develops. Any person who plays a part in a criminal trial \u2013 including victims, witnesses, jurors, and legal professionals \u2013 is making a huge contribution to society that is rightly recognised as an essential reason to leave their home. They have our gratitude and they deserve our protection \u2013 and measures are being put in place to support everyone who comes to court, in whatever capacity, to do so without putting themselves at unnecessary risk. Police across the UK have had a nightmare bank holiday weekend trying to police the lockdown, particularly in tourism hotspots \u2014 and are now frantically trying to work out what the relaxation of restrictions means for enforcement. In Cumbria, more than 100 fines were dished out from Friday to Sunday, assistant chief constable Andrew Slattery told the Guardian. \u201cThat\u2019s more than we have issued in the entire rest of the lockdown period,\u201d he said. \u201cThat comes down to a number of factors. One, I\u2019m sad to say, is the newspaper headlines on Thursday last week, which very much gave the impression that lockdown was over and set the tone for the weekend. Then we had the hot weather and VE day on Friday, a lot of street parties and people drinking in the street. Our number of incidents doubled on Friday. Then into the weekend we had a large number of people who decided lockdown no longer applied and that they were free to drive the length and breadth of the country and had spurious reasons for doing so.\u201d He said his force was trying to work out what Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201csoundbite\u201d meant for policing, when the prime minister told the nation on Sunday: \u201cYou can sit in the sun in your local park, you can drive to other destinations, you can even play sports but only with members of your own household.\u201d Slattery said it would be hard to enforce social distancing in the most popular destinations in the Lake District: \u201cIf people come en masse to the Lake District next weekend it will make social distancing very difficult if they congregate in the same car parks, go on the same busy footpaths in the honeypot areas,\u201d he said. Latest figures show that Barrow in Furness in west Cumbria has by far the highest infection rate in England with 804 cases per 100,000 people. Lancaster, on the other side of Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, is second with 513 and South Lakeland third with 482. Almost 30 million people watched Boris Johnson\u2019s TV address last night, according to Darren McCaffrey from Euronews. Turning back to the ONS report showing that lowest paid workers are most at risk of dying from coronavirus (see 9.54am), here are two charts from document showing the death rates from men and women by profession. Amongst men, who are more at risk of dying from coronavirus than women anyway, low-skilled workers in \u201celementary occupations\u201d, like construction, cleaning and security, are almost four times as likely to die from coronavirus as professionals. Amongst women, those in the caring professions are more at risk, but the differences between employee groups is less stark. Carers face nearly twice the risk of dying from coronavirus as the \u201csafest\u201d workforce group, female managers. Jury trials in England and Wales are to resume from next week, the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett, has announced, according to PA. Fears of repeat scenes of overcrowded tube carriages and platforms failed to materialise in London today despite Boris Johnson\u2019s messages that those who cannot work from home such as construction workers and manufacturers should be \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to work. A snapshot of tube stations across London between 7.30am and 9.30am revealed passenger levels were either slightly up on last week or the same. Christian Vergara, driver of the 388 bus from Stratford City to London Bridge, said: This morning on the first journey at 5.50am I had maybe 10 people, last week the bus might have been empty or had two or three people. I think it\u2019s too early for people to go back to work. Key worker Mohammed Thaniyan, who works in food supplies, was waiting for a central line with about 50 others at Stratford, one of the busiest commuter hubs in the capital. He said he noticed it was \u201cbusier than last week\u201d but that every week was a little busier on the bus and tube. Another man, who asked not to be named, was returning to work for the first time. Why? \u201cI need the money. I was furloughed,\u201d he said. He works in a company providing documentation for the NHS and said he had not been told to go back to work. In his speech last night Boris Johnson said the lockdown rules for England were being changed so that people could play sports, \u201cbut only with members of your own household\u201d. But at the same time No 10 briefed journalists separately that people would be allowed to meet one other person from outside their household outdoors, provided they kept two metres apart. As already mentioned, Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, confirmed this when he gave interviews this morning. He told BBC Breakfast: If you\u2019re out in the park and you\u2019re two metres apart, we\u2019re saying now, and use some common sense and you socially distance, you can meet up with other people. The key thing is people want to get outdoors, particularly with this weather, particularly I think for mental health and, frankly, the frustration people feel if they\u2019re cooped up for too long for protracted periods. We want to make sure that that people can enjoy the outdoors more ... but people must stay alert, because the more we do some of the things that we want to do, the more we need to just be careful about this social distancing. Asked if people could meet both their parents outside like this, at one point he agreed with a suggestion that you could meet one parent in the morning, and another in the afternoon. But in another interview he said you could meet both at the same time, provided you kept two metres apart. (See 8.59am.) UPDATE: As BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham and the BBC\u2019s Nick Eardley report, Raab\u2019s team subsequently retracted what he said about people being allowed to meet two other people outside at the same time. It is just one person (including just one parent) you\u2019re allowed to meet. Ministers in Northern Ireland aim to publish their plan for exiting lockdown tomorrow, Arlene Foster, the first minister, said this morning. And she said restrictions on outdoor activities would be eased before indoor ones. She told the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Ulster programme the position around when to reopen schools has not yet been decided but suggested it could be in late August or early September. She said: We looked at our medical evidence here in Northern Ireland and decided that, for the public health of the people of Northern Ireland, that we proceeded to reimplement those [coronavirus] regulations whilst at the same time looking at a roadmap for our destination to the new normal. I don\u2019t think there is any surprise at all that we are trying to make sure that that plan comes out, hopefully tomorrow if we get signed off. In a phone-in on LBC this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said that the new strategy announced by Boris Johnson last night seemed to be \u201cunravelling\u201d this morning. Starmer explained: I accept that for some things, like when can a school open, that\u2019s going to be conditional, but on this business of going back to work, the suggestion was last night that people go back to work today if they can\u2019t work at home, but don\u2019t use public transport - and that\u2019s really difficult, particularly if you\u2019re in a city like London - and without guidelines in place as to how work places need to operate. You know, simple things like how do you keep people two metres apart? What about sanitation, protective equipment? These are things that were discussed in a consultation document last weekend but not resolved yet. I was actually quite surprised the prime minister said, effectively in 12 hours\u2019 time, start going back to work without those bits in place. We needed that clarity and it is unravelling a bit this morning because I think the foreign secretary has now said, \u2018Well, go back to work doesn\u2019t really mean until Wednesday\u2019, so suddenly it has shifted. Some of the lowest paid workers have the highest Covid-19 death rate according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics. Security guards, care workers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail workers are all at a greater risk of dying from Covid-19, according to new analysis. Among people of working age men are at a greater risk of dying from the virus than women, with 9.9 deaths compared to 4.2 fatalities per 100,000 people. However the figures show men working in the lowest skilled jobs face the greatest risk of dying from the virus. Men working as security guards had one of the highest rates, with 45.7 deaths per 100,000, followed by taxi drivers and chauffeurs (36.4), bus and coach drivers (26.4), chefs (35.9), and sales and retail assistants (19.8). Care workers and home carers had higher death rates, with 23.4 deaths per 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths per 100,000 women. However healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate when compared to the general population. The figures come as the government has directed workers in some sectors to return to work if possible. The government will not be holding a press conference this afternoon, journalists are being briefed. Instead Boris Johnson will just take questions from members of the public. The daily press conference now seems to have become a daily Q&amp;A. We don\u2019t have a timing for this yet. It might be at 5pm, when the press conferences usually take place, or possibly later, because Johnson is making a statement in the Commons at 3.30pm on his coronavirus strategy. This will coincide with the publication of the government document setting out details of the plan Johnson announced in outline last night. Of course there is nothing wrong with politicians doing Q&amp;As with members of the public. Sometimes they pose harder or more interesting questions than journalists. But normally they don\u2019t, and if you believe that it\u2019s beneficial having a media that holds politicians to account, you might be concerned about Johnson avoiding the press on the day of such a major government announcement. Jack Blanchard from Politico Europe has a good summary of Johnson\u2019s aversion to scrutiny in his London Playbook briefing. Blanchard writes: A note on scrutiny: Astonishingly this afternoon\u2019s session will mark the first time Johnson has even made a statement in the Commons on coronavirus, and only the second time he has turned up to make a statement on anything at all since this year. We\u2019re also still waiting for his first appearance before the Commons liaison committee, eight and a half months into his premiership. More pressingly the PM has refused to give a press conference or a media interview for the past 11 days, and has managed just one presser since March 25, having been off sick for much of April. Aides say he will only take pre-recorded questions from the public tonight. Boris Johnson has been taking what has become his daily morning walk around St James\u2019s Park. But he\u2019s replaced the Costa cup he was carrying last week with a china mug. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. The Times\u2019 Matt Chorley has some snap YouGov polling on the PM\u2019s announcement last night, and his new \u201cStay alert\u201d messaging. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, seems exasperated with the vague instructions from the government. He has repeatedly asked to be included in the government\u2019s emergency Cobra planning meetings, given that the infection rate in the north-west is currently higher than London and everywhere else in England apart from the north-east. Appearing on Sky News, Burnham said the changes announced by Boris Johnson on Sunday night were \u201cquite substantial\u201d and posed challenges particularly for the police. How do the police enforce this, given that it is a significant loosening? I honestly don\u2019t know how they will do that. He said the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Ian Hopkins, had already rung him up asking how his officers should enforce the new rules. It\u2019s going to be difficult, in his words. Because we are saying to people, \u2018you can go to a park and stay two metres apart\u2019 and apparently they can be anybody, but you can only play golf with someone from your household. It feels contradictory. I think the police are going to have difficulties enforcing it, and the worry about that of course is that you lose the discipline. Burnham also said there was \u201cno clarity\u201d on how businesses were supposed to open up again and keep their staff safe. \u201cPeople are being encouraged to go back to work this morning without the clarity about what safe working means,\u201d he said. The north-west of England currently has the second highest rate of infection in England, with 22,342 confirmed cases (306.4 per 100,000 people \u2014 compared with 290 per 100,000 in London). The north-east has the worst infection rate in England, with 336.7 cases per 100,000 people. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Raab appeared to say that people could meet up with their two parents in a park, as long as you stay 2 metres away from them. This not only contradicts what the prime minister said last night (that just two people from different households could meet up outside), but it also contradicts what he told BBC breakfast earlier. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA), has been speaking to BBC Breakfast. He said he did not know \u201con what basis\u201d the government had decided to relax the lockdown rules, as there is still \u201ca considerable amount\u201d of the virus in the community . \u201cAt the moment we have more people dying on Saturday than we had at the beginning of the lockdown,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also seen about 4,000 new cases every day over the weekend, and that\u2019s just a fraction of the real number of new cases because of the limited testing so there\u2019s a considerable amount of community circulation of the virus going on.\u201d If we now allow the public to go to local parks in an unlimited sense, and to go outdoors ... what we\u2019ve not heard is how the government will enforce social distancing and how it will avoid a whole neighbourhood playing in a park, with footballs moving from one group to another, and spreading the disease. So, I\u2019m really concerned that there is no clarity. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, has tweeted about the confusion over when people are being encouraged to return to work. Responding to Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, saying that the government was a return to work for people who could not work from home from Wednesday (see 8.17am), not from today as the PM implied, Miliband said the government should have been clearer. The general secretary of a leading teachers\u2019 union has said the profession has \u201cvery serious concerns\u201d about children returning to school on 1 June. Patrick Roach, of NASUWT, told BBC Breakfast: The fact of the matter is the government has announced a date but hasn\u2019t come forward with a plan about how schools will ensure that they\u2019re safe for pupils and safe for staff to be in from 1 June. And the prime minister said that it would be madness to risk a second spike in relation to transmission of the virus. Well the profession has got very serious concerns about that announcement of June 1, whether indeed it is possible to achieve it, but also how to achieve that in a way which is safe for pupils and staff. He said there is strong evidence schools are lacking personal protective equipment (PPE), and that parents were going to want to know how schools were being made safe for their children. The National Education Union\u2019s website crashed last night after being overwhelmed by applications \u2013 in a further sign of concern among teachers. Government sources have briefed the Telegraph that the Premier League could return in June. The paper says a government paper on elite sports is expected to be published on Tuesday. These will give the green light for professional sports to return next month, including the Premier League\u2019s planned resumption on June 12, subject to safety conditions being met and coronavirus infection rates not rising. However Boris Johnson\u2019s go-ahead comes as up to eight Premier League clubs are expected to argue against the use of neutral venues and call for \u2018Project Restart\u2019 to be put back at a crucial meeting today. In light of that clarification from Raab \u2013 that people will be encouraged to go to work from Wednesday, not today \u2013 here is an image of the Jubilee line on London\u2019s Underground network this morning, courtesy of the BBC\u2019s transport and environment correspondent. First secretary of state Dominic Raab has told the BBC that the new measures \u2013 including urging people to go to work if possible \u2013 would come in to effect from Wednesday, despite reports they were in place today. \u201cThat won\u2019t start until Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be guidance out. We have been working with employers to make sure it can be done in a safe way.\u201d Unions and business groups have expressed alarm following the prime minister\u2019s address yesterday that the guidance was being changed with 12 hours notice. This was from Ed Miliband, now shadow business secretary, last night \u2013 On the new rules about seeing people from outside your household, Raab told the BBC: If you are out in the park and you are two metres apart \u2013 and use some common sense and you socially distance \u2013 you can meet up with other people. He said people wanted to get outdoors for their mental health, \u201cbut we must stay alert\u201d. He said you could meet multiple people each day, individually, outside, as long as you are socially distanced. But households still cannot mix indoors. He said they had asked Sage for more advice on that issue. Raab said that under the new regulations, you can drive as far as you like to a beauty spot, as long as it\u2019s not across a border. He said people would not be able to play football in the park, as it is difficult to stay two meters apart, but that the could play a sport like tennis. Boris Johnson famously dislikes disappointing the people around him, writes the Guardian\u2019s deputy political editor Rowena Mason in this analysis. The result is this weekend\u2019s barrage of confused messaging over whether the lockdown is ending, as he tries to please both sides in the battle raging within the Tory party about how to respond to the coronavirus crisis. On the one hand, the rightwing hawks in his cabinet have been pushing him towards a swift return to business as usual to save the economy, setting out a roadmap to lifting the lockdown sooner rather than later. On the other, the more centrist doves, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have been pulling him in another direction, urging caution for fear of a second peak and more lost lives. The received wisdom is that Johnson is now on the side of the doves following his brush with death during a four-day spell in intensive care suffering from Covid-19. Martin Farrer has a roundup of this morning\u2019s UK front pages \u2013 Good morning. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be guiding you through this morning\u2019s developments in the UK\u2019s coronavirus crisis. Boris Johnson is set to explain his plan for easing coronavirus restrictions to parliament today, following criticism that yesterday\u2019s address to the nation was vague and confusing. It will be the first time the prime minister has ever made a statement in the commons on coronavirus. Johnson will publish a 50-page \u201cblueprint\u201d for the next stage in tackling the virus this afternoon, before heading to the chamber for a one hour session with MPs at 3.30pm. He\u2019ll then take part in a Q&amp;A, answering questions submitted by the public. He announced yesterday that people who can\u2019t work from home should start returning to work from today if they can \u2013 \u201cif possible\u201d avoiding public transport and instead using a car, walking or cycling. We\u2019ll see how that goes this morning. Unions have raised alarm that asking people to return to work before proper guidance is in place risks lives. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: The government still hasn\u2019t published guidance on how workers will be kept safe. So how can the prime minister \u2013 with 12 hours\u2019 notice \u2013 tell people they should be going back to sites and factories? It\u2019s a recipe for chaos. Johnson also announced that he was hoping for a rapid reopening of primary schools in England on 1 June while older pupils remain at home. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) \u2013 which represents most primary school heads in England \u2013 said there was \u201clittle explanation of why or how such a return is considered to be safe\u201d, and that the announcement would not convince parents or school leaders. The first minsters of both Scotland and Wales have said they will not be reopening schools so soon, and are both sticking with the \u201cstay at home\u201d message, rather than the UK government\u2019s new \u2013 widely criticised \u2013 \u201cstay alert\u201d alternative. You can read about Johnson\u2019s other announcements \u2013 including that two people from separate households can meet outside, providing they they stay 2m apart \u2013 in this explainer from Guardian political correspondent Peter Walker.",

      "bodyText": "Fears of foreigners bringing infectious disease into the country. Enhanced border checkpoints. And the use of disinfectant spray to sanitize human beings. These aren\u2019t notes from one of Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling press conferences. The United States\u2019 troubled response to the coronavirus pandemic is such that the Mexican border city of Nogales, Sonora, has set up \u201csanitizing tunnels\u201d to disinfect people leaving the US through Nogales, Arizona. On the Mexican side of two major border crossings, drivers coming from Arizona must exit their vehicles and step into an inflatable tunnel that sprays them with a cleansing solution. Videos posted to social media by the municipal government of Nogales, Sonora, show people rotate under the vapor, stretch their arms and lean over to allow the disinfectant to reach their entire bodies. In a press release, the Nogales government states that the cleansing solution is biodegradable and protects from \u201cany virus or bacteria, including Covid-19\u201d for up to 24 hours. It adds that the tunnels \u201creduce the chances that a foreign citizen or citizen of this city who presents symptoms of the disease will infect other people on the Mexican side\u201d. The border city\u2019s mayor has told Mexican news outlets that a majority of the people who have tested positive for Covid-19 in Nogales, Sonora, had recently returned from the US. The Mexican border city plans to install five sanitizing tunnels to disinfect people arriving through its two main ports of entry from Nogales, Arizona. A sanitizing tunnel is also stationed outside a hospital in Nogales, Sonora, where visitors must brush open or duck through clear plastic curtains to be washed with the disinfectant mist. News reports identify the cleansing solution as biozinc. On its Facebook page, the government of Nogales, Sonora, announced on 7 May that \u201cthis measure came in response to requests from Nogales citizens to avoid infections from Arizona, one of the states most affected by coronavirus in the American Union\u201d. Arizona has more than 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and a death toll of over 500 people. The Navajo Nation in the north-eastern corner of the state has been hit especially hard and continues to reel from a per-capita infection rate surpassed only by New York and New Jersey. Sonora, Mexico, has just over 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 32 in Nogales. But doctors in Mexico City have come forward in the recent days to warn that the true toll of the virus has been dramatically underreported by the federal government as many people treated for Covid-19 symptoms fail to receive coronavirus tests, even when they die.",

Staged at the opera house in Ghent, where the original 16th-century story is set, its citizens oppressed under Spanish occupation, Franz Schreker\u2019s 1932 \u201cmagic opera\u201d tells of Smee the Blacksmith\u2019s (\u201cDer Schmied\u201d) Faustian pact. He negotiates untold wealth not with the devil but his mistress, Astarte, she of the diabolic eyes; Satan himself towers monstrously over proceedings, his palace a riff on Ghent\u2019s medieval Gravensteen castle. So far so local, but Ersan Mondtag, in his opera directing debut, boldly draws a parallel with Belgium\u2019s later colonial history, suggesting that, in time, the oppressed become the oppressors. The music stops altogether for Patrice Lumumba\u2019s speech proclaiming Congolese independence, and Smee \u2013 sung by the brilliant Leigh Melrose \u2013 ends up as King Leopold II, desperate to get into heaven. Schreker\u2019s score is eclectic, his own libretto often comic. Mondtag makes it zany and outrageous, but his indictment of empire-building and its atrocities is searing. It inevitably invokes, too, the Nazi era, which spelled the end of Schreker\u2019s hitherto illustrious career.

Perhaps because it lacked the conciseness of En Saga, The Wood Nymph received only a handful of performances over the next century, until it was rehabilitated and recorded by <a href=\"https://www.harrisonparrott.com/artists/osmo-vanska\">Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4</a> and the Lahti Symphony in 1996. Rouvali\u2019s parents were members of that Lahti orchestra: the young conductor must have grown up listening to V\u00e4nsk\u00e4\u2019s crisp, no-nonsense Sibelius interpretations.

The measures are expected to become a \u201cnew normal\u201d until an effective vaccine or treatment for the virus can be found.

Thomas has paranoid schizophrenia, and has been more in than out of state hospitals for 20 years; Dominick is bound to him by ties of love and duty, abraded by resentment, grief and fatigue. They are both the product of a home dominated by a violent stepfather, and labouring under the loss of their mother three years previously from breast cancer. She never told them who their father was, but left Dominick the unread manuscript of her Sicilian father\u2019s autobiography, whose secrets are revealed in flashback as the series goes on.</p> <p>We open with a grisly, but not gratuitous, scene. Convinced that a personal sacrifice will end the ongoing Gulf war, Thomas hacks off his own hand in a public library. Thereafter, the six-part, six-hour-long series (adapted from a 900-page 1998 bestseller of the same name) starts to fold in tighter and tighter upon itself, becoming more of a mood piece than melodrama. It is an approach that might have paid greater dividends at shorter length because, while the exact point will vary for each viewer, few will avoid compassion fatigue setting in, as the tale of the brothers\u2019 relentless suffering goes on.</p> <p>Perhaps this is a perfect reflection of life with chronic mental illness and of caring for someone with such a condition. But art is not life, and you need to guard against the law of diminishing returns. After the library \u201cincident\u201d, Thomas is relocated to a high-security psychiatric prison, and Dominick must draw once more on his waning emotional resources to fight against those who, as he sees it at least, do not have his brother\u2019s best interests at heart.</p> <p>While that story unfolds in the drama\u2019s present, Dominick\u2019s suffering continues as his childhood and more recent past unfold in memory and (slightly ponderous) voiceover. He and his wife separated and divorced after the sudden death of their baby daughter. We see how the early years of suppressing his feelings and frustrations in a violent household, and then subsuming his needs beneath those of his brother as an adult, have left him unable to express himself, however dire the circumstances. His current, much younger, girlfriend has no patience with his unwillingness to pay her more than a fraction of the attention he does to Thomas, and they scream at each other across a gulf of misunderstanding and need.</p> <p>It is heavy stuff.

On the other, many public health experts warn thousands will become infected as the state reopens.</p> <p>Handren, who is also the mayor of the small town of Boerne, said that although his cinemas would keep patrons 6ft apart and offer a reduced menu there remained debate in the community about whether the shutdown had been necessary at all.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I still interact with people that believe Covid-19 is a hoax concocted by the media after all this time. That\u2019s the extreme on that side of the equation \u2026 \u2018We should have never shut down\u2019. Even the lieutenant governor said that. And then there are others who want to hunker down and hibernate for the next six months. I\u2019ve had to, as a mayor, balance health and economics.\u201d</p> <p>Abbott, a Republican, last week ended a stay-at-home order and allowed businesses including barber shops and retail outlets to open. The move followed decisions in other southern states including Florida and Georgia, and earned praise from Donald Trump.</p> <p>The president told reporters: \u201cTexas is opening up and a lot of places are opening up. And we want to do it, and I\u2019m not sure that we even have a choice. I think we have to do it. You know, this country can\u2019t stay closed and locked down for years.\u201d</p> <p>In private, Abbott has acknowledged that his decision to reopen is likely to cause an increase in coronavirus cases. Leaked audio <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-governor-greg-abbott-admits-dangers-of-reopening-state-on-private-call-with-lawmakers/\">obtained</a> by the Daily Beast captured comments during a private call with state lawmakers.</p> <p>Abbott, who has sought to downplay the increased risk to the public, said: \u201cThe more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility is for transmission. The goal never has been to get transmission down to zero.\u201d</p> <p>Infectious disease experts <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/infectious-disease-experts-think-texas-will-see-an-increase-in-cases/\">predict</a> the average daily Covid-19 positive test rate in Texas could rise from 1,053 at the beginning of May to up to 1,800 by June.</p> <p>As of this weekend, Texas had an estimated <a href=\"https://txdshs.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/ed483ecd702b4298ab01e8b9cafc8b83\">16,670 active cases and 1,049 deaths</a>.

Abbott has <a href=\"https://abc13.com/face-masks-harris-county-coronavirus-emergency-management-texas/6132070/\">publicly criticized her</a>.</p> <p>Dr Aaron Miller, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Harris county, reopened his clinic last week with social distancing in place. He told the Guardian that even after his decision to reopen, because of the pressing needs of patients, he was experiencing significant anger from those who refuse to wear masks.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some pushback from families because we won\u2019t let them in without a mask. They\u2019ve been ugly to the staff.

      "bodyText": "Tim Handren, the chief executive of Santikos Entertainment, a small cinema chain in San Antonio, admits his business is not essential. But while the giants of the industry keep their screens closed, he has taken a different approach. Since last weekend, three of nine Santikos cinemas have reopened to the public, among the first in America to do so during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cTake your mask off and relax,\u201d Handren said in a recorded message to customers. \u201cBreathe in some great buttery popcorn smells, watch a great movie, and just enjoy some time with your family.\u201d The reopening is among the starker examples in Texas, where one of the quickest and most expansive efforts to reignite the economy has drawn significant controversy. On the one hand, some civil liberty advocates have argued that their right to drink at bars, have their hair cut and dine at restaurants has been curtailed. On the other, many public health experts warn thousands will become infected as the state reopens. Handren, who is also the mayor of the small town of Boerne, said that although his cinemas would keep patrons 6ft apart and offer a reduced menu there remained debate in the community about whether the shutdown had been necessary at all. \u201cUnfortunately, I still interact with people that believe Covid-19 is a hoax concocted by the media after all this time. That\u2019s the extreme on that side of the equation \u2026 \u2018We should have never shut down\u2019. Even the lieutenant governor said that. And then there are others who want to hunker down and hibernate for the next six months. I\u2019ve had to, as a mayor, balance health and economics.\u201d Abbott, a Republican, last week ended a stay-at-home order and allowed businesses including barber shops and retail outlets to open. The move followed decisions in other southern states including Florida and Georgia, and earned praise from Donald Trump. The president told reporters: \u201cTexas is opening up and a lot of places are opening up. And we want to do it, and I\u2019m not sure that we even have a choice. I think we have to do it. You know, this country can\u2019t stay closed and locked down for years.\u201d In private, Abbott has acknowledged that his decision to reopen is likely to cause an increase in coronavirus cases. Leaked audio obtained by the Daily Beast captured comments during a private call with state lawmakers. Abbott, who has sought to downplay the increased risk to the public, said: \u201cThe more that you have people out there, the greater the possibility is for transmission. The goal never has been to get transmission down to zero.\u201d Infectious disease experts predict the average daily Covid-19 positive test rate in Texas could rise from 1,053 at the beginning of May to up to 1,800 by June. As of this weekend, Texas had an estimated 16,670 active cases and 1,049 deaths. With the occasional dip, the number of cases continues to rise even while testing lags behind other states. Harris county, which includes Houston, has 157 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people \u2013 31% higher than the state average. Last month, officials said African Americans accounted for two-thirds of Covid-19 deaths in the city despite making up only 22.5% of the population. Harris county judge Lina Hidalgo, a Democrat, has attempted to enforce a mandatory mask order. Abbott has publicly criticized her. Dr Aaron Miller, a pediatric ophthalmologist in Harris county, reopened his clinic last week with social distancing in place. He told the Guardian that even after his decision to reopen, because of the pressing needs of patients, he was experiencing significant anger from those who refuse to wear masks. He said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had some pushback from families because we won\u2019t let them in without a mask. They\u2019ve been ugly to the staff. While I respect their civil liberties, I am entitled to not see them.\u201d Last week, Abbott took power away from officials who arrest Texans for certain Covid-19 violations. The move was prompted by a conservative backlash against the arrest of a salon owner in Dallas \u2013 another hotspot \u2013 who opened up against local rules. In an act that exacerbated the divisions on the case, Texas senator Ted Cruz appeared at the salon to receive a haircut from the recently released owner. Houston lies in a sprawling industrial region with more than 500 petrochemical facilities, a busy shipping channel, large highways and commercial railroads, and one of the highest densities of polluting industries in the country, if not the world. Air quality, specifically particulate matter, which increases the risk of multiple lung and heart conditions also associated with Covid-19 complications, has been worse in some parts of the city despite the lockdown, leading environmentalists to criticise the decision to reopen so quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s a blind, uninformed decision based on optimism that everything will be better, even though the evidence points to the contrary,\u201d said Elena Craft, senior director at the Environmental Defence Fund (EDF), which coordinates a local project tracking air quality. The meatpacking industry is also linked to several emerging hotspots in the Texas panhandle, a semi-rural region of 26 northern counties where Trump won 79.9% of the vote in 2016 and the Republican party dominates every level of government. Moore county has the highest infection rate in Texas. Its death rate is 28 per 100,000 people, almost 10 times higher than Harris county and the state average. Moore, where around 55% of residents identify as Latino or Hispanic, is home to the massive Brazilian-owned JSB meatpacking plant, which employs mostly Hispanic and migrant workers, many bussed in on company shuttles from towns including Amarillo. Nationwide, industrial meat plants have emerged as incubators for coronavirus spread. Amarillo, the region\u2019s largest city, situated across Potter and Randall counties, had 1,304 cases as of last Wednesday, including at least 18 deaths. The infection rate is rapidly rising. Potter county has the second worst rate in Texas, with infections doubling every seven or eight days. Just to the south, in the city of Odessa, a group of armed militia men were arrested last week as they protested alongside bar owner Gabrielle Ellison, who attempted to reopen in violation of an executive order which mandates bars should remain closed. The six men were members of a militia named Open Texas, which according to reports has operated across the state, offering armed support to business owners. Ellison, who was also arrested, told local news from jail: \u201cI think some rights were taken away from us, which one of them was like a right to survive. We have to survive and I think those rights were stripped from us.\u201d \u2022 This story was amended on 11 May to more fully reflect the quotation from Tim Handren, the mayor of Boerne.",

      "bodyText": "The radio host Alan Jones has announced his retirement, saying he has to \u201clisten to the experts\u201d and wind back his work commitments. Jones is the top-rating talkback breakfast presenter in Sydney and made the announcement he would quit at the end of the month on his regular 2GB show on Tuesday morning. \u201cWe are living in the world of coronavirus,\u201d Jones told listeners. \u201cThe most repeated statement we hear is \u2018we must listen to the experts\u2019. Well, the experts are telling me in no uncertain terms, and not for the first time I might add, \u2018continuing with the present workload is seriously detrimental to your health\u2019. \u201cI have listened to the experts and I am taking this opportunity to indicate to my radio family that I will be retiring from radio at the end of this month.\u201d The departure of the 79-year-old broadcaster comes earlier than his planned retirement from 2GB at the end of his contract in June 2021 and would be a relief for Nine Radio, which was paying him $4m a year despite an advertiser boycott which stripped 50% of the show\u2019s revenue last year. Jones is also costing his employer millions in legal fees, including $3.4m in damages for being \u201cwilfully blind to the truth\u201d when he made \u201cvicious and spiteful\u201d comments about the Toowoomba-based Wagner family in 2018. The broadcaster has dominated breakfast radio in Sydney for 35 years, recording an unequalled 226 survey wins, but his conduct on air has led to the radio station losing advertisers and haemorrhaging revenue. His program had been under review by what was then Macquarie Media after hundreds of advertisers pulled out in the wake of his comments about the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. After Jones said Scott Morrison should shove a sock down Ardern\u2019s throat, 2GB and 4BC suffered an exodus of advertisers across the schedule. His retirement comes nine months after management said he was on his final warning for offensive comments and took the unprecedented step of scolding him publicly. Nine Entertainment\u2019s chief executive, Hugh Marks, made it clear Jones was not indispensable when he said Jones\u2019 breakfast show was \u201cless than 10% of the revenue of the radio business and a fraction of the revenue of Nine\u201d. \u201cAlan\u2019s a good broadcaster, Macquarie have made plenty of comments about their relationship and recent events so I won\u2019t go into that, but yes, of course, that business can survive the loss of any of its talent,\u201d Marks said after Nine acquired the remaining shares in Macquarie Media. Jones has survived numerous controversies, including cash-for-comment on 2UE in 1999 and the attacks on Julia Gillard in 2012. The broadcaster said the then prime minister should be \u201cshoved in a chaff bag\u201d and later that her father had died \u201cof shame\u201d because she \u201ctold lies every time she stood for parliament\u201d. Reaction to his announcement was immediate, with praise from some and criticism from others. The managing director of Nine Radio, Tom Malone, told staff that loyalty was at the centre of \u201ceverything Alan does\u201d. \u201cHe has been loyal to this company and to his listeners \u2013 their greatest advocate \u2013 and they have repaid him in kind with their ears and their hearts,\u201d Malone said. \u201cHis success in radio stemmed from an already rich and experienced life in teaching, sport and politics. He can talk with equal ease to prime ministers and the everyday person. Of course, we know and love him for his unique turn of phrase and warm sense of humour. I\u2019ll always remember one of my first days in the 2UE newsroom as a cadet in the late 90s, when Alan advised me: \u2018If you\u2019re going to be a dog, be an Alsatian\u2019.\u201d Nine clearly had a succession plan, immediately announcing that the drive host, Ben Fordham, a Channel Nine veteran, would replace Jones. \u201cI feel a sense of both responsibility and opportunity,\u201d Fordham said. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge responsibility in taking over from Alan and the opportunity to bring my own flavour to breakfast.\u201d Scott Morrison called in to Jones\u2019 show as politicians across the spectrum lined up to congratulate him. \u201cYou\u2019ve always spoken your mind to everyone, including me, and we\u2019ve had one or two disagreements, but you\u2019ve always done the right thing for your country,\u201d the prime minister said. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, wished him well and the former prime minister Tony Abbott called in and told Jones \u201cit was a significant day\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global confirmed death toll exceeds 285,000 The number of people known to have died since the pandemic began reaches at least 285,307, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 4,165,752 people are known to have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic because they are based on official and media reports. White House staff ordered to wear masks The White House directs staff working in the West Wing, where the daily operations of Donald Trump\u2019s administration are carried out, to wear masks. A senior administration official says the directive will apply at all times other than when staff are at their own desks. Trump accused of racism over press conference comments The president was criticised for telling an Asian-American journalist to direct her questions on the US\u2019s epidemic to China, instead of to him. Trump insisted he would have answered the question the same way regardless of who had asked it. After fellow reporters helped ensure Trump could not simply dismiss CBS\u2019 Weijia Jiang\u2019s follow-up question, Trump refused to take further questions and abruptly ended the press conference. CNN\u2019s influential chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, said Trump\u2019s actions had \u201cracist overtones\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s racist to look at an Asian-American correspondent and say \u2018ask China\u2019; it\u2019s part of a pattern from the president.\u201d Senegal eases restrictions The west African nation is reopening mosques and churches and easing other restrictions, even as it sees its largest one-day rise in cases. The president, Macky Sall, had ordered places of worship closed in March and imposed a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Since then, the daily pace of new cases has picked up \u2013 177 on Monday from a previous high of 104 \u2013 with increasing community transmission in hotspots such as the holy city of Touba. Algeria touts rapid test kits Algeria starts producing rapid test kits with a detection time of 15 minutes and a production capacity of 200,000 units per week, its government says. A laboratory in the capital, Algiers, developed the test kits in partnership with Canadian and Jordanian firms, the junior minister in charge of pharmaceutical production, Lotfi Benbahmed, says. \u2018No guarantee\u2019 of vaccine, UK\u2019s PM says There is no guarantee of a Covid-19 vaccine, says the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, but he adds that the UK is heavily involved in the work to develop one. The British government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, agrees the development of a vaccine cannot be guaranteed, but says: \u201cI would be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something.\u201d \u2018Extreme vigilance\u2019 needed as lockdowns end \u2013 WHO The World Health Organization says \u201cextreme vigilance\u201d is needed as countries begin to exit lockdowns imposed to curb the virus\u2019 spread. Germany has reported an acceleration in new infections after taking early steps to ease its lockdown. South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, has seen a new outbreak in nightclubs. Putin eases Russia lockdown despite infection surge The Russian president announces an easing of the nationwide lockdown, even as the country sees a record number of new infections.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been urged to extend the coronavirus wage subsidy scheme until September to avoid spiralling job losses across Britain this summer. Against a backdrop of mounting pressure on the government to provide continued support as lockdown measures are gradually removed, the Resolution Foundation said the extension would cost the exchequer as much as \u00a348bn but would prevent a fresh surge in unemployment. After Boris Johnson announced on Sunday his blueprint for the gradual lifting of restrictions, industry groups warned it was incomplete without urgent details about the job retention scheme. Lex Butler, the chair of the Hotel Booking Agents Association, said: \u201cWe immediately need to know that the furlough scheme will be extended beyond the end of June and on what terms. We need clarity now to prevent closures and large scale loss of jobs.\u201d Employees in the hospitalities sector are expected to return to work last, possibly from July. Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cFirms will need to know that government support schemes, which have helped save millions of jobs in recent weeks, will continue for as long as they are needed so that they can plan ahead with confidence.\u201d Johnson told parliament on Monday that Sunak would announce details on the future of the furlough scheme on Tuesday. The chancellor is widely expected to announce the gradual wind-down of the scheme amid rising concern over its cost, which is roughly \u00a314bn a month. Under the scheme, workers receive 80% of their pay up to \u00a32,500 a month. More than 6 million were protected at 800,000 firms in the first two weeks of the scheme\u2019s operation. Options the Treasury is understood to be considering include cutting the level of support to 60% while allowing staff to work some of their hours. The Resolution Foundation urged the government to allow for \u201cpartial furloughing\u201d from as early as June, but said the 80% support should also be kept in place across the economy until at least August. It could then gradually be scaled back. However, the thinktank recommends 80% support continuing until at least September for businesses in sectors where the return to work will take longer, including hospitality. Sunak is under pressure from business leaders to provide an update this week because employers have to allow for at least 45 days to consult on redundancies of more than 100 staff. Companies face a deadline of 18 May to begin the redundancy consultation process if the furlough is no longer available in July. Torsten Bell, the chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, said: \u201cMoving too quickly could spark a huge second surge in job losses at a time when unemployment already looks set to be at the highest level for a quarter of a century. \u201cThe scheme cannot last forever however. It should be phased out gradually, with a longer timeframe for the hardest-hit sectors.\u201d On Sunday Johnson said it was time for sectors in which home-working was not possible \u2013 including manufacturing and construction \u2013 to get back to work. But the Confederation of British Metalforming (CBM), which represents about 200 manufacturing companies across Britain, said it would take longer for the economy to recover and that further financial support would be required while production levels remain below normal. The CBM said up to 30% of jobs (12,000) among its members could be cut if assistance was taken away at the end of June. The finance lobby group TheCityUK said it expected UK firms would face unsustainable debts of up to \u00a3105bn that would need to be managed before March next year. Alongside continued support from the government, the major high street banks have been ordered by the Bank of England to make more loans to firms to help keep them running. A spokesman for the Treasury said the job retention scheme had already protected millions of jobs. \u201cFuture decisions around the scheme will take into account the wider context of the measures in place, as well as the public health response,\u201d they said. \u201cWe have been clear there will be no cliff edge and people will be eased back into work in a measured way.\u201d",

Twenty-two people have died and 378 have recovered from the virus. </p> \n  <p>On Saturday there were almost a thousand new cases announced by the government. The rate of infections has fuelled worries that the relaxed measures have caused the virus to spread further. In what is still technically an election year, criticism of the government has grown more intense.</p> \n  <p>The former president John Mahama, a candidate against Akufo-Addo\u2019s re-election, tweeted on Saturday: \u201cFrom 3,091 to 4,012 #COVID19 cases within 24 hours.

So far 160,000 tests have been administered in Ghana, one of the highest totals in Africa. </p> \n  <p>Addo said a sharp rise in cases was partly due to a backlog of tests, which had now been cleared. Many recently confirmed cases were not new infections. Clusters of cases were being tightly traced, such as 533 infections at a fish processing factory which he said were all linked to one individual. </p> \n  <p>Health officials in Ghana feel the larger case numbers, among the highest in Africa, are largely a result of its more comprehensive and widespread testing campaign relative to other countries.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a brand new blog at the link below \u2013 head there for the latest updates from around the world: Global confirmed death toll exceeds 285,000. The number of people known to have died since the pandemic began has reached at least 285,445, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 4,168,427 people are known to have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic. White House staff ordered to wear masks. The White House directs staff working in the West Wing, where the daily operations of Donald Trump\u2019s administration are carried out, to wear masks. A senior administration official says the directive will apply at all times other than when staff are at their own desks. Trump accused of racism over press conference comments. The president was criticised for telling an Asian-American journalist to direct her questions on the US\u2019s epidemic to China, instead of to him. Trump insisted he would have answered the question the same way regardless of who had asked it. Trump refused to take further questions and abruptly ended the press conference. CNN\u2019s influential chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, said Trump\u2019s actions had \u201cracist overtones\u201d, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s racist to look at an Asian-American correspondent and say \u2018ask China\u2019; it\u2019s part of a pattern from the president.\u201d Senegal eases restrictions. The west African nation is reopening mosques and churches and easing other restrictions, even as it sees its largest one-day rise in cases. The president, Macky Sall, had ordered places of worship closed in March and imposed a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Since then, the daily pace of new cases has picked up \u2013 177 on Monday from a previous high of 104 \u2013 with increasing community transmission in hotspots such as the holy city of Touba. Algeria touts rapid test kits. Algeria starts producing rapid test kits with a detection time of 15 minutes and a production capacity of 200,000 units per week, its government says. \u2018No guarantee\u2019 of vaccine, UK\u2019s PM says There is no guarantee of a Covid-19 vaccine, says the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, but he adds that the UK is heavily involved in the work to develop one. \u2018Extreme vigilance\u2019 needed as lockdowns end \u2013 WHO. The World Health Organization says \u201cextreme vigilance\u201d is needed as countries begin to exit lockdowns imposed to curb the virus\u2019 spread. Germany has reported an acceleration in new infections after taking early steps to ease its lockdown. South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, has seen a new outbreak in nightclubs. Putin eases Russia lockdown despite infection surge. The Russian president announces an easing of the nationwide lockdown, even as the country sees a record number of new infections. Vladimir Putin says people in some sectors will return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings will remain in place. \u201cWe have a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes,\u201d he tells Russians. Donald Trump\u2019s press conference on coronavirus testing ended abruptly after a terse exchange with two female reporters. Asked by CBS\u2019s Weijia Jiang about his focus on international comparisons rather than US deaths, Trump snapped: \u2018Don\u2019t ask me, ask China that question\u2019. After being asked by Jiang, who is Asian-American, why he had directed the remark at her, Trump cut off the CNN reporter Kaitlan Collins as she asked a question and walked away from the podium: Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. The best way to get in touch with me \u2013 and I welcome questions, comments or tips \u2013 is on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Here\u2019s the PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor on how the ending to Trump\u2019s briefing played out: In Washington, Trump has ended his briefing on a sour note. Asked by CBS White House Correspondent Weijia Jiang why he is fixated on comparing the US\u2019s testing capability with other countries as opposed to focusing on the lag that still exists in the US, Trump replied: \u201cMaybe that\u2019s a question you should ask China. Don\u2019t ask me, ask China that question, OK?\u201d He then called on CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, who ceded the mic to Jiang so she could ask her follow-up. Jiang, who is Asian-American, replied to Trump: \u201cSir, why are you saying that to me, specifically, that I should ask China.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m telling you, I\u2019m not saying it specifically to anybody. I\u2019m saying it to anybody that would ask a nasty question like that,\u201d he said. Collins then tried to ask her question but Trump skipped her. He then refused to take any more questions and left the podium. Senegal is reopening mosques and churches and easing other restrictions, even as it sees its largest one-day jump in cases. Its president, Macky Sall, ordered places of worship closed in March and imposed a dawn-to-dusk curfew. Since then, the daily pace of new cases has picked up \u2013 177 on Monday from a previous high of 104 \u2013 with increasing community transmission in hotspots such as the holy city of Touba. Senegal has recorded 1,886 cases in total, including 19 deaths. Sall, like other leaders in West Africa, has confronted public pressure to find more sustainable ways to balance public health with economic realities in the face of an epidemic that the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned could drag on across Africa for years. He told the nation: In the best of cases, Covid-19 will continue to circulate in the country until the month of August, or even September. In this new phase, that will last not a few weeks but three or four months, we need to learn to live in the presence of the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 985 more deaths and 23,792 more confirmed cases since the weekend\u2019s update, taking the overall totals to 79,756 and 1,324,488. The CDC said the weekend\u2019s numbers were preliminary and had not been confirmed by individual states. The Guardian has published its editorial on the British prime minister\u2019s message to the country as it moves into a dangerous new phase of the epidemic. For more than 30 years, the term \u201cconsensus politics\u201d fell out of fashion in Britain. For generations of Conservative politicians schooled in the dogmas of Thatcherism, the phrase came to connote unpleasant images of sandwiches with union leaders in No 10 and weak government. Boris Johnson urgently needs to discover the virtues of consensus-building now, after a chaotic few days of mixed messages and confused assertions. Donald Trump has been taking questions at his White House briefing. The first was about the White House staff who tested positive. \u201cI don\u2019t think the system broke down at all,\u201d he said. He said the person who tested positive \u201cwill be fine\u201d and will be \u201cout of quarantine very soon\u201d. He says it is \u201cshocking\u201d, given the number of people who come in and out of the White House every day, how few positive cases there have been. He adds: \u201cI\u2019ve felt no vulnerability whatsoever.\u201d Asked when Americans can get tested every day like his senior staff can, Trump said it would be \u201cvery soon\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving that up to the governors,\u201d Trump said when asked how Americans should feel about going back to work without more testing capacity. He then argued that some governors are being too slow to lift their restrictions. Trump said it was his decision to require West Wing staffers to begin wearing masks. Morocco has cleared disposable face masks for export after reaching a daily production capacity of 10m by 24 factories during its epidemic, the country\u2019s industry minister, Hafid Elalamy, has said. An average of 2m masks are sold daily in Morocco and the surplus will be exported now that a strategic stockpile of 50m masks has been secured, Elalamy told members of parliament. Reusable masks will only be cleared for export once Morocco secures a stockpile of 15m, he said. Morocco, which has been on lockdown since 20 March, has made wearing face masks mandatory since 7 April. The north African country has been exporting medical protective gear and face shields, the minister said. He added that Morocco has secured self-sufficiency in ethanol, key to making sanitisers, with a daily production capacity of 24,000 litres. Energy demand has plummeted during the Covid-19 crisis and global carbon dioxide emissions are anticipated to be 8% lower this year, compared with 2019. Is this affecting our weather and will it affect the global climate in years to come? Carbon dioxide hangs around in the atmosphere for decades so it takes a long time for the impact to play out. Keith Shine, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading, estimates the Covid-19 effect might reduce warming by a measly 0.0025C in about 20 years time. This is far below anything we can observe. If we were to sustain this 8% reduction over the coming years, Shine calculated, we would avoid about 0.15C of warming but, sadly, we would still massively overshoot our Paris agreement target of 1.5C. This emphasises the scale of the task we have ahead of us. Algeria has started producing rapid test kits with a claimed detection time of 15 minutes and a production capacity of 200,000 units per week, its government has said. A laboratory in the capital, Algiers, developed the test kits in partnership with Canadian and Jordanian firms, the junior minister in charge of pharmaceutical production, Lotfi Benbahmed, said on state television, without naming the two foreign partners. Slovenia will admit international air passengers from Tuesday, ending an eight-week suspension. The country\u2019s government said: The prohibition of international air flights from the EU area and from other countries to Slovenian international public airports is no longer needed. In the US, the governor of California Gavin Newsom has said he and local health officials will speak to Tesla bosses after the company ordered workers back on the job despite ongoing local restrictions. Newsom said he expected the plant to open as soon as next week and that he did not know about the order to return to work or photographs circulating on San Francisco Bay Area news sites showing its full parking lot. Fears of foreigners bringing infectious disease into the country. Enhanced border checkpoints. And the use of disinfectant spray to sanitise human beings. These aren\u2019t notes from one of Donald Trump\u2019s freewheeling press conferences. The United States\u2019s troubled response to the coronavirus pandemic is such that the Mexican border city of Nogales, Sonora, has set up \u201csanitising tunnels\u201d to disinfect people leaving the US through Nogales, in Arizona. Albania has seen its lowest daily number of infections in eight weeks as half of its 2.8 million population began enjoying more freedom in green zones and life went on almost as normal in the other half. With its economy heading for a recession of up to 5%, or 6.9% if most of the economy starts working by late summer, Albania has begun to gradually restart parts of its economy over the last two weeks. Just four new infections were traced in the last 24 hours, the lowest daily number in the last eight weeks, said Eugena Tomini of the health institute in her daily update. The White House has directed staff working in the West Wing, where the daily operations of Donald Trump\u2019s administration are carried out, to wear masks. A senior administration official said the directive would apply at all times other than when staff are at their own desks. ABC News first reported that a new memo directed everyone who enters the wing to cover their faces. With Trump\u2019s valet and vice-president Mike Pence\u2019s press secretary both testing positive for the virus last week, pressure is growing for the White House to take further steps in protecting the health of country\u2019s 73-year-old president. There is no guarantee of a Covid-19 vaccine, the British prime minister Boris Johnson has said, though he said the UK was heavily involved in the work to develop one. I\u2019m hearing some very encouraging things from what\u2019s going on at Oxford to achieve a vaccine [but] this is by no means guaranteed. I believe I\u2019m right in saying that, even after 18 years we still don\u2019t have a vaccine for Sars. What I can tell you is that the UK is at the forefront of concerting international activity to try to deliver a vaccine. He said the UK government was putting \u201chuge sums\u201d into finding a vaccine, but added: If you ask me am I absolutely certain that we won\u2019t be living with this for a long time to come, I can\u2019t say that. It may be that we have to become ever more flexible, ever more agile, ever smarter in the way that we tackle, not just this infection, but potentially future infections as well. The UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, agreed the development of a vaccine could not be guaranteed, but said: I\u2019d be surprised if we didn\u2019t end up with something. The crew of a virus-stricken cruise ship have finally been allowed to disembark after nearly two months stranded off the coast of Uruguay. Passengers on the Greg Mortimer \u2013 60% of whom had tested positive \u2013 flew home from Montevideo on two chartered medical flights to Australia and the US in mid-April. But the original 85 crew remained onboard anchored off the coast of Uruguay, with 37 continuing still carrying the virus and confined to their cabins, in many cases for more than a month. Crew members greeted the news in joyful WhatsApp videos, audios and messages to the Guardian. \u201cI thank Jesus for answering our prayers and the press for drawing attention to our plight,\u201d said the ship\u2019s Colombian medical officer, Mauricio Usme. Marvin Paz Medina, a Honduran crew member who had been confined to his cabin since 4 April and tested positive four consecutive times, said: \u201cAs long as we remained onboard on this virus-loaded ship there\u2019s no way we could start testing negative.\u201d Some crew members had started to entertain suicidal thoughts from the confinement, said Usme, who has tested positive five consecutive times. The risk of suicide, of individual or collective psychosis, of mutiny, was there. There\u2019s people who thought of leaving their rooms and lighting flares, who thought of jumping overboard and swimming to the coast for help. The reproduction rate in Germany remains above the critical threshold of 1, with an estimated value of 1.07 on Monday after 1.13 on Sunday, the Robert Koch Institute for public health and disease control (RKI) has said. The number indicates that 100 infected people on average infect 107 others, meaning the number of new infections is accelerating again. That could signal the beginning of a second wave of the pandemic in Europe\u2019s largest economy. The RKI said: The increase in the reproduction number R makes it necessary to observe the development very closely over the coming days. Here are the latest headlines in our global coronavirus news coverage. The World Health Organization says \u201cextreme vigilance\u201d is needed as countries begin to exit lockdowns imposed to curb the virus\u2019 spread. The warning comes after Germany reported an acceleration in new infections after easing its lockdown, and South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, saw a new outbreak in nightclubs. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, denied reports his senior scientific and medical advisers were not consulted on the much-maligned new messaging attached to his plan to ease the country\u2019s lockdown as he set out the details in parliament. Amid muddled guidance from ministers on what the new rules actually allow, Johnson insists the public understands his government\u2019s message. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, announced an easing of the nationwide lockdown, even as the country reported a record number of new infections. Putin said people in some sectors would return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place. Men\u2019s blood has higher levels of an enzyme used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to infect cells, the results of a study published in the European Heart Journal show. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is found in the heart, kidneys and other organs. It is thought to play a role in how the infection progresses into the lungs. The Afghan capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for infections, as 161 new cases were reported, and the health ministry warned transmission would continue to surge across the country. The total number of confirmed cases in the city, Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected area, reached 1,257, with about half of the 325 tests carried out coming back positive on Monday. Saudi-backed authorities in Yemen declared Aden an \u201cinfested\u201d city as the number of cases there rose. The Aden-based national coronavirus committee announced 17 new cases, 10 of them in the southern port city. That raises the total count in areas under the Saudi-backed government\u2019s control to 51, with eight deaths. Half a million more people could die from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa if efforts are not made to overcome interruptions to health services as a result of the pandemic, the World Health Organization warned. According to modelling, the disruption to health services could take Aids-related deaths in the next year back to 2008 levels, when it claimed 950,000 lives. The UK and WHO are to lead a global information campaign around the coronavirus pandemic. The \u201cStop the Spread\u201d campaign, intended to counteract \u201cincorrect and false information\u201d about the virus, will appear across BBC World television channels, websites and apps from this month and throughout June. A potential deal to release a renowned Iranian scientist from a US jail and return him to Iran appears to be in danger of breaking down after a senior US official questioned whether Tehran really wanted him returned, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, claimed on Monday that Sirous Asgari had been freed by US authorities and would be able to return to Iran immediately if he tested negative for coronavirus. But his remarks were dismissed as \u201cBS\u201d by a senior US Department of Homeland Security official, who accused Iran of slow-walking a deal. A well-regarded materials scientist, Asgari was acquitted on charges of stealing US trade secrets but remains in immigration detention where he contracted the coronavirus. Zarif said on Monday thatAsgari \u201chas been acquitted of false charges and we have been very active in preparing the ground for his return. If his coronavirus is negative he could return on the first flight\u201d. Zarif\u2019s statement was reported on the margins of an Iranian parliament foreign and security committee meeting in Tehran. A day of record high coronavirus infection numbers is an odd time to announce a route out of lockdown, but that\u2019s what Vladimir Putin did on Monday as he announced the \u201cnon-working days\u201d imposed by the Kremlin at the end of March would come to an end from Tuesday, writes Shaun Walker. \u201cWe have a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes,\u201d said Putin by video link from his residence outside Moscow, on a day when the country registered more than 11,000 new infections. Russia now has the second fastest rate of infections in the world after the US. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is among those in hospital with the virus. Rather than an invitation to Russians to stream back into the streets, however, Monday\u2019s announcement seemed to be the latest gambit in Putin\u2019s plan to delegate responsibility for tackling the crisis to local leaders, who he said would make their own decisions on when to end lockdown. Certainly, Russia\u2019s vast size means there is little point in lockdown restrictions in Vladivostok being tied to the epidemic growth seven timezones away in Moscow. But the health minister Tatiana Golikova later clarified that so far only 11 of Russia\u2019s 85 regions had an epidemiological situation that could allow for a loosening of restrictions, making Putin\u2019s announcement look to some like passing the buck. Health authorities in Norway have said opening up nurseries and primary schools has not rekindled the country\u2019s coronavirus epidemic, AFP reports. Norway was among the first countries in Europe to open up nursery schools on 20 April, followed by schools for pupils between ages six and 10 the following week. The reopening of the schools, which had been closed on 12 March, was initially met with concern among parents. But fears appear to have been unfounded. \u201cWe have so far not seen that opening nurseries and schools have had a negative effect on the infection situation,\u201d Frode Forland, a senior official from the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, told a daily press briefing. \u201cIf the opening would have had a negative effect, we would have begun to see that in an increased number of infections.. The same seemed to be true for hair salons, physiotherapists, as well as some other healthcare-related professions that have been allowed to operate since 27 April, according to Forland. The rest of the country\u2019s primary schools, high schools and colleges are due to reopen later in the week. As of Monday, Norway had confirmed 8,106 cases of coronavirus, and 224 people had died in the country of 5.4 million people. Forty-seven vulnerable migrants have arrived in the UK on an \u201cunprecedented\u201d family reunion flight from Greece, Harriet Grant reports. British refugees travelled to Heathrow to greet nephews, brothers, husbands and wives after Monday\u2019s flight brought people from Syria, Somalia and Afghanistan to join close family in the UK. The reunion was the result of two months of intense lobbying by the campaign group Safe Passage and the British peer Alf Dubs. Many of the individuals, some with severe health problems, had been living for several months in the dire conditions of Greek refugee camps. The World Health Organization has said \u201cextreme vigilance\u201d is needed as countries begin to exit from lockdowns, Reuters reports. Germany earlier reported an acceleration in new coronavirus infections after it took early steps to ease its lockdown. South Korea, another country that had succeeded in limiting virus infections, has seen a new outbreak in nightclubs. \u201cNow we are seeing some hope as many countries exit these lockdowns,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, head of the WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, told an online news briefing. \u201cIf the disease persists at a low level without the possibility to investigate clusters, there\u2019s always the possibility that the virus takes off again,\u201d he said. Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing Covid-19. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the same briefing that lifting restrictions was \u201ccomplex and difficult\u201d and that the \u201cslow, steady lifting of lockdowns\u201d was key. Tedros said Germany, South Korea and China all had systems in place to respond to any resurgence in cases. Mike Pence, the US vice-president, will not enter quarantine despite a rash of coronavirus cases in the White House in recent days, including a positive test for Pence\u2019s press secretary, writes Tom McCarthy, the Guardian US national affairs correspondent in New York. \u201cVice-president Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow,\u201d Devin O\u2019Malley, a backup spokesman for Pence, said in a statement on Sunday night. As the Trump administration urges Americans to return to workplaces and Donald Trump touts a \u201ctransition to greatness\u201d ahead, the White House faces a delicate balancing act in projecting business as usual even as coronavirus cases spread through the halls of power. There were 179 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Monday, bringing the death toll to 30,739, while the number of new infections rose by 744, 58 less than on Sunday, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. While new infections have been declining across all the Italian regions, there has been an unusual rise in Molise, the sparsely populated southern region. After registering several days of zero infections during the first week of May, the rate suddenly went up, with 81 new cases recorded since 7 May, reportedly from among the Roma community in the regional capital of Campobasso. The region has had 383 confirmed cases to date, the lowest in Italy, and 22 deaths. The president of Madagascar has dismissed criticism over his promoting a homegrown remedy for Covid-19, accusing health experts of taking a condescending attitude towards traditional African medicine, AFP reports. The World Health Organization (WHO) has repeatedly warned that the infusion, derived from artemisia and other indigenous herbs, has not been clinically tested. But the Madagascan leader, Andry Rajoelina, claims the infusion cures patients within 10 days. In an interview with French media, he said: If it wasn\u2019t Madagascar, and if it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don\u2019t think so African scientists \u2026 should not be underestimated. I think the problem is that (the drink) comes from Africa and they can\u2019t admit \u2026 that a country like Madagascar \u2026 has come up with this formula to save the world. Already Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger and Tanzania have taken delivery of consignments of the potion, which was launched last month. \u201cNo country or organisation will keep us from going forward,\u201d Rajoelina said in response to the WHO\u2019s concerns. He said proof of the tonic\u2019s efficacy was in \u201cthe healing of our sick\u201d. Madagascar has officially reported 183 coronavirus infections and 105 recoveries, with no deaths. The government of Jordan decided on Monday to allow civil servants to return to work from 26 May following a break of around two months imposed as part of measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. Amjad al-Adailah, a government spokesman, said civil servants, who comprise the bulk of Jordan\u2019s public sector, would return after the three-day Eid holiday that marks the end of Ramadan. The government will maintain a night curfew until further notice despite the easing of a tight lockdown over the last two weeks that has allowed most businesses to resume work, he added. The European commission will tell airlines and travel companies to offer vouchers valid at least 12 months for travel cancelled as a result of the coronavirus crisis when it presents this week its recommendations to help the ailing tourism industry, officials told Reuters. Vouchers should offer the same services, same route in case of a flight and same travel conditions as the original booking. Customers who end up not using the vouchers would still be able to ask for a full refund no later than 12 months after the vouchers were issued, the officials said on Monday. The EU executive is also due to tell member states to guarantee vouchers to convince customers to accept them instead of a cash refund, according to a document seen by Reuters before official publication due on Wednesday. The proposal will come as guidance to the 27 EU member states and European companies, rather than a law they would be obliged to follow. Germany and other countries have urged a suspension of EU rules that force cash-drained airlines and the hospitality industry to offer full refunds for cancelled flights and trips. Tunisia on Monday urged continued vigilance against the coronavirus, a day after recording no new cases for the first time since 2 March as it eases strict lockdown measures, AFP reports. The country\u2019s overall toll stood at 1,032 cases on Sunday, the same as the previous day, with 45 deaths \u2013 unchanged for several days \u2013 and 700 recoveries. But the health minister, Abdellatif Mekki, urged caution despite the encouraging figures. \u201cIt\u2019s true that it boosts morale, but there could be a return of cases tomorrow,\u201d he told the parliamentary health committee. He called on Tunisians to continue respecting hygiene and social distancing measures. Tunisia closed its schools, places of worship and non-essential shops in mid-March, despite having recorded fewer than 20 cases of the Covid-19 illness. It began a partial easing of the lockdown in late April, although schools will largely remain closed until September. Richard Branson is to sell $500m (\u00a3405m) in Virgin Galactic shares in order to prop up his airline and leisure interests, which have been ravaged by the coronavirus crisis. In a statement to the New York stock exchange, Branson\u2019s Virgin Group said it intended to sell 25m shares via a series of transactions, prompting a 5% fall in the share price of Virgin Galactic during pre-market trading. The shares, which account for just over a fifth of the billionaire\u2019s stake in the space tourism business, were worth $500m at their pre-announcement price of $20. The company said: Virgin intends to use any proceeds to support its portfolio of global leisure, holiday and travel businesses that have been affected by the unprecedented impact of Covid-19. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, is now giving one of his thrice-weekly press conferences on coronavirus. You can also view it in the player embedded at the top of the blog. Particular focus in Germany in the struggle against coronavirus is being paid to the meat industry, where there has been a disturbingly high number of infections, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Critics of the industry have said they believe that working conditions, including the accommodation where workers \u2013 mainly from eastern European countries \u2013 are often housed collectively in very close quarters, are at least in part to blame. In one abattoir in particular, in the municipality of Coesfeld in North Rhein-Westphalia, there have been 249 confirmed cases of coronavirus among workers. The meat industry has hit back at the claims, insisting the working conditions are not to blame. Instead, it says the reason is that the meat industry had to keep going even as the virus took hold in Germany, while other industries, such as the automobile industry, were forced to stop. \u201cThe industry had to keep going in order to ensure that the food supply was not interrupted\u201d, Heike Harstick, the CEO of the association of the German meat industry, told the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung in an interview. She said if workers had to be kept in separate rooms, that would lead to higher rent and many abattoirs would go out of business or be forced abroad. As a result of the scandal in Coesfeld, and other incidents elsewhere, all workers at abattoirs across NRW will now have a coronavirus test by the end of this week, said Karl-Josef Laumann, the state\u2019s health minister. The opposition Green party has called for a debate in the Bundestag for the coming week on working conditions in the meat industry across the country and is calling for tighter controls and better worker protection to be introduced.

On an unseasonably chill grey May morning, in coats and scarves, Paris came out of lockdown in much the same mood as it went into it two months ago: a bit hesitantly, dragging its feet, not entirely sure what the rules were of another new non-normality, writes Jon Henley, the Guardian\u2019s European affairs correspondent. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit frightened,\u201d admitted Marianna Mota, reopening her florist\u2019s on Rue Condorcet in the 9th arrondissement for the first time since 17 March. \u201cI only hope the customers will come and I only hope they\u2019ll be careful. We need them to be.\u201d It nearly did not happen at all. According to local media, the government hesitated until the last minute before finally confirming last week it would lift the lockdown in the French capital and its surrounding area, the country\u2019s most densely populated region and the hardest hit by Covid-19. Unlike most of the rest of France, classified green, and to a much greater extent than the three other regions coloured red for high-risk \u2013 broadly the country\u2019s north-east quarter \u2013 the coronavirus is still circulating in and around Paris, where Covid-19 patients currently account for more than 10% of admissions to emergency care wards. The UK government has given the all clear for the Premier League and other professional sports to return behind closed doors from 1 June, providing its five tests on controlling the coronavirus are met. The news was contained in a 60-page document, Our Plan to Rebuild, which sets out in broad terms the government\u2019s strategy for recovery from the pandemic. Sport would be able to resume as part of the second stage of the government\u2019s recovery plan. This would permit \u201ccultural and sporting events to take place behind closed-doors for broadcast, while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact\u201d. Full report by Paul MacInnes here. Cape Town and the surrounding Western Cape province have become South Africa\u2019s coronavirus hotspot, accounting for more than half of the nation\u2019s confirmed cases, which have climbed above 10,600, Associated Press reports. Western Cape province has had 5,621 cases, according to figures released Monday, and of the country\u2019s 206 deaths registered from Covid-19, 116 have occurred in the province. Cape Town, with its poor, densely populated townships, is the centre of the cases in the province. South Africa has the continent\u2019s highest number of confirmed cases and has eased its restrictions to allow an estimated 1.6 million people to return to work in selected mines, factories and businesses. However, the concentration of cases in Cape Town may lead to the city returning to a stricter lockdown, according to the health minister, Zweli Mkizhe. Vladimir Putin announced an easing of Russia\u2019s nationwide lockdown on Monday, even as Russia recorded a record number of new coronavirus infections. Putin said people in some sectors would now return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place. \u201cWe have a long and difficult process ahead of us with no room for mistakes,\u201d he said in a televised address to the nation. He noted the size of Russia and said the epidemiological situation in different regions varied greatly, thus local governments would retain the right to keep lockdown measures in place. In Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s coronavirus epidemic, the lockdown is due to remain in force until the end of May at least. Russia on Monday announced 11,656 new cases over the past 24 hours, a record number. The country has had a total of 221,344 confirmed cases of the virus and 2,009 deaths. It has the second highest rate of new infections after the US. \u201cThis should be remembered. Putin has ended national self-isolation measures aimed at fighting the epidemic on the very day when we have registered a record for new infections. W for Wisdom,\u201d wrote the opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Twitter. In a long address, Putin also surveyed the economic situation in the country, noting that the number of registered unemployed had doubled since early April, and he announced a new package of economic measures. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the blog while Damien goes for a break. Please do drop me a line via email caroline.davies@theguardian.com with any tips or suggestions for things we should be covering Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has just given the briefest of briefings following relaxation of the lockdown rules over the weekend, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. Appearing in the sky lobby of her chancellery in Berlin, she said: It is very important to me to bring attention to the fact that we are coming into a new phase of the pandemic and that it will now be necessary that along with the relaxations we really have certainty that people will stick to the basic precepts, which are: keeping distance, wearing a mouth and nose covering in consideration for other people. That is very important. Thank you very much. That was it. Then she disappeared. Her statement, delivered in an unusually breathless voice and lacking her usual calm, was widely interpreted as a reaction to the news at the weekend that thousands of demonstrators gathered in cities around the country protesting against the infringement of their civil liberties, and reports that many people were failing to abide by the distancing or face covering rules. The number of infections in Germany as of Monday afternoon was 172,658, and 7,681 people had died from the virus. Half a million more people could die from Aids-related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa if efforts are not made to overcome interruptions to health services as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization has warned. According to the modelling carried out on behalf of the WHO and UNAids, the disruption to health services could take Aids-related deaths in the next year in the region back to 2008 levels, when it claimed 950,000 lives. \u201cAnd people would continue to die from the disruption in large numbers for at least another five years, with an annual average excess in deaths of 40% over the next half a decade,\u201d the agencies said. \u201cIn addition, HIV service disruptions could also have some impact on HIV incidence in the next year.\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the WHO, was quoted as saying: The terrible prospect of half a million more people in Africa dying of Aids-related illnesses is like stepping back into history. We must read this as a wake-up call to countries to identify ways to sustain all vital health services. For HIV, some countries are already taking important steps, for example ensuring that people can collect bulk packs of treatment, and other essential commodities, including self-testing kits, from drop-off points, which relieves pressure on health services and the health workforce. We must also ensure that global supplies of tests and treatments continue to flow to the countries that need them. In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 25.7 million people were living with HIV and 16.4 million (64%) were taking antiretroviral therapy in 2018. The Netherlands reported 16 more Covid-19 deaths on Monday, the fewest in nearly two months, bringing the total death toll from its outbreak to 5,456. In its daily report, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) also said 161 more people had tested positive for the virus, the lowest daily figure in almost as long. The Netherlands has registered 42,788 cases of coronavirus, although RIVM says the actual numbers of infections are higher since not all patients are tested. Kenya has reported 28 new confirmed cases of coronavirus. The UK government and its national broadcaster, the BBC, is joining forces with the World Health Organization to implement a global information campaign around the coronavirus pandemic The \u201cStop the Spread\u201d campaign, intended to counteract \u201cincorrect and false information\u201d about the virus, will appear across BBC World television channels, websites and apps from this month and throughout next month. According to a WHO statement: The campaign aims to raise awareness among BBC audiences of the risks of misinformation on Covid-19. It encourages them to double check information from unreliable sources and promotes WHO and national health authorities as trusted sources of information. The UK government is funding the campaign and will track engagement, and will also provide a campaign toolkit to partner governments to translate and use in their own countries, to create a worldwide unified message around the coronavirus outbreak. The WHO added: This tripartite partnership campaign supports WHO\u2019s work for addressing the infodemic of false information about Covid-19 and for busting myths about the spread and treatment of the disease. Men\u2019s blood has higher levels than women\u2019s of a key enzyme used by the new coronavirus to infect cells, the results of a European study showed on Monday, Reuters reports. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is found in the heart, kidneys and other organs. In Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus, it is thought to play a role in how the infection progresses into the lungs. The study, published in the European Heart Journal, also found that widely prescribed drugs called ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) did not lead to higher ACE2 concentrations and should therefore not increase the Covid-19 risk for people taking them. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are widely prescribed to patients with congestive heart failure, diabetes or kidney disease. The drugs account for billions of dollars in prescription sales worldwide. \u201cOur findings do not support the discontinuation of these drugs in Covid-19 patients,\u201d said Adriaan Voors, a professor of cardiology at the University Medical Centre (UMC) Groningen in the Netherlands, who co-led the study. The Covid-19 pandemic has infected more than 4 million people worldwide and killed almost 277,000, according to a Reuters tally. Death and infection tolls point to men being more likely than women to contract the disease and to have severe or critical complications if they do. Kosovo\u2019s caretaker prime minister has said he is in self-isolation after an official in his government \u201chad close contact\u201d with someone who tested positive for coronavirus, according to AFP. Albin Kurti made the announcement on his Facebook page, saying he would stay in his apartment until test results were available for the official from the ministry of European integration who had contact with the infected person. \u201cToday is the first day when I will not go to work at the prime minister\u2019s office,\u201d the 44-year-old wrote. With tight restrictions on movement and early moves to shut down public activities, Kosovo has so far prevented a widespread outbreak of Covid-19 among its population of 1.8 million. According to government figures, 884 infections have been detected and 28 people have died from the disease. South Korea has pushed back its reopening of schools by a week as health authorities try to isolate virus carriers and trace their contacts after finding dozens of coronavirus infections linked to clubgoers, the Associated Press reports. Before discovering the new transmissions, the country had relaxed social distancing guidelines amid what had been a slowing caseload and scheduled the reopening of schools, starting with high-school seniors on Wednesday. But the vice-minister for education, Park Baeg-beom, said in a briefing on Monday that the school openings for high-school seniors would be pushed back to next Wednesday. Local education authorities including Cho Hee-yeon, the superintendent of Seoul\u2019s education office, had earlier called for the government to postpone the reopening of schools, raising concerns that children could be exposed to larger infection risks. The country\u2019s elementary, middle and high schools have been providing remote learning since April. Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Poland had a record low turnout of 0%, Shaun Walker, the Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent, reports. The vote was not officially cancelled but polling stations stayed closed, leading to a strange ghost election after weeks of legal wrangling over whether or not it should go ahead. The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been accused of rolling back democratic norms in recent years, tried to hold the election despite the challenges of voting in times of Covid-19. The PiS-allied incumbent, Andrzej Duda, was the firm favourite to win, and the opposition accused the government of trying to push through the vote now to make it easier for him to win in the first round. Up until Wednesday evening, the government insisted a postal vote would go ahead. In a televised address on Sunday night, Ghana\u2019s president, Nana Akufo-Addo, extended a ban on public gatherings until at least the end of the month, writes Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian\u2019s West Africa correspondent. Addo\u2019s address primarily set out to defend the government\u2019s easing of the lockdown three weeks ago, amid fierce criticism. Since Ghana\u2019s measures were eased, cases of Covid-19 in the country have accelerated, doubling in the last week to 4,263. Twenty-two people have died and 378 have recovered from the virus. On Saturday there were almost a thousand new cases announced by the government. The rate of infections has fuelled worries that the relaxed measures have caused the virus to spread further. In what is still technically an election year, criticism of the government has grown more intense. The former president John Mahama, a candidate against Akufo-Addo\u2019s re-election, tweeted on Saturday: \u201cFrom 3,091 to 4,012 #COVID19 cases within 24 hours. Government is certainly failing the people of Ghana.\u201d In the president\u2019s address the following day, he indirectly responded: \u201cI know some political actors would want you to believe that the new numbers represent a failure on our part, do not begrudge them.\u201d The government insists that its fairly robust testing and tracing measures allow it to track the spread with precision and focus restrictions on specific locations rather than entire cities. So far 160,000 tests have been administered in Ghana, one of the highest totals in Africa. Addo said a sharp rise in cases was partly due to a backlog of tests, which had now been cleared. Many recently confirmed cases were not new infections. Clusters of cases were being tightly traced, such as 533 infections at a fish processing factory which he said were all linked to one individual. Health officials in Ghana feel the larger case numbers, among the highest in Africa, are largely a result of its more comprehensive and widespread testing campaign relative to other countries. Yet each new rise in cases casts the lockdown in a more critical light. Sweden has reported 348 new cases of coronavirus, as the country begins to see a downward trend in new infections despite having eschewed the kinds of strict lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe. The latest figures from Sweden\u2019s public health authority pushed the total number of cases in the country to 26,670. So far 3,256 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19, with 31 new deaths reported on Monday. Earlier on Monday the head of Sweden\u2019s civil contingencies agency admitted authorities could have acted \u201ca little faster\u201d to contain the spread of coronavirus among vulnerable people. In a radio interview, Dan Eliasson said that \u201cwhen major crises occur, you will always look at it afterward. So comes the question, did we react fast enough?\u201d Last month the health minister, Lena Hallengren, told Swedish television that \u201cwe failed to protect our elderly. That\u2019s really serious and a failure for society as a whole. We have to learn from this.\u201d In recent weeks Swedish media have reported cases of large death tolls at retirement homes where staff were continuing to work despite a lack of protective gear or despite exhibiting symptoms. Some retirement homes have faced shortages of staff because employees have refused to work or have been encouraged to stay home with mild symptoms. More from Africa: Zambia reports no new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours! The World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for Africa says that more than 63,000 cases of coronavirus were confirmed across the continent as of Monday morning. So far African countries have reported 2,283 deaths associated with Covid-19, it adds. Fears of a widespread outbreak in Africa have so far failed to materialise, although there are suggestions that numbers of infections and deaths linked to the virus could be underestimates due to relatively limited testing. The latest coronavirus figures from Iran appear to show a trend towards increased transmission is continuing in the country, with 1,683 new cases recorded in the past 24 hours, the highest daily figure since 11 April, writes Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. At the same time the number of deaths reported by the Iranian health ministry was 45, the lowest number since the early days of the outbreak two months ago. A total of 6,685 Iranians have died. Deaths tend to lag behind infections which should suggest the death toll will rise again in the coming days although it is possible that improved testing means those lightly infected are showing up in the official figures. The recent incline in the number of infections has lasted about a fortnight. It came as the Iranian government continued to lift restrictions with the move justified by pointing to the number of provinces that are now coming out of the crisis. Religious places, restaurants and hairdressers are all due to open gradually after Ramadan subject to health protocols. Many mosques opened at on Friday But two provinces Tehran and Khuzestan a province bordering Iraq are suffering badly. The province is being put in effective quarantine for a week with the authorities blaming locals for failing to follow guidelines. The total numbers infected in Iran since the outbreak began is 109,286, and the Iran government is unofficially projecting fewer than 10,000 will die. Iranian opposition groups dispute the official figures and say the number of deaths is already close to 40,000. The supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was confidently tweeting at the weekend that the outbreak had shown the failure of the west. He tweeted \u201cWestern civilisation\u2019s failure in their global trial of combating coronavirus is obvious and quite visible. The West and westernised people do not want this failure to be seen. However it is necessary to study and speak about the various dimensions ands reasons for failure.\u201d Such remarks \u2013 turning treatment of the disease into a test of rival ideologies \u2013 are hardly likely to encourage the Iranian medical authorities to challenge the official figures. Our US-focused coronavirus liveblog has just got going in the past half an hour. If you are interested in more coverage from the country then take a look. The authority that sets the rules of the French language has decreed that Covid-19 is a feminine noun, according to an AFP report. In French, every noun has a gender, with, for example, bread \u2013 \u201cpain\u201d \u2013 referred to with the masculine article \u201cle\u201d and beer \u2013 \u201cbi\u00e8re\u201d \u2013 referred to with the feminine \u201cla\u201d. Now l\u2019Academie Francaise has proclaimed \u201cCovid-19\u201d is a feminine noun and urged an end to what has become the widespread practice in France of referring to it as masculine. \u201cThe use of the feminine would be preferable,\u201d the Academie Francaise said in a directive published on its website under the category \u201cfaulty use\u201d. \u201cIt is perhaps not too late to give this acronym back the gender it should have.\u201d The \u201cOffice quebecois de la langue francaise\u201d also recommends its feminine use, and the Royal Spanish Academy has issued similar guidance, citing the same grammar rationale. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Pakistan passed 30,000 on Monday, after 1,476 new infections were detected in the past 24 hours, according to the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The latest increase brings the total number of people found infected with the virus to 30,941, of whom 667 have died and 8,212 have recovered. The country\u2019s has so far conducted 277,698 tests. The most affected province is Punjab, with 11,568 cases, followed by Sindh, which has 11,480. The Cannes film festival appears to have halted any plans for a physical edition for 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, but is aiming to sponsor screenings at other festivals and cinemas of the films that would have been selected for the festival, Andrew Pulver, the Guardian\u2019s film editor, reports. In an interview with Screen, the Cannes artistic director, Thierry Fr\u00e9maux, said he \u201ccould never have imagined\u201d something like the cancellation of the festival, which was originally due to start tomorrow and was \u201covercome with a great sense of melancholy and nostalgia\u201d. He added: Under the circumstances, a physical edition of Cannes 2020 is hard to envisage, so we\u2019ll have to do something different \u2026 Everyone understands that [it is] impossible this year. The festival announced in April that it had been forced to call off its event in its traditional mid-May slot, after restrictions by French government effectively banned mass gatherings until mid-July at the earliest. However, tentative suggestions that a postponed version could be mounted later in the year appear to have been abandoned. Cannes has also appeared to resist calls to go down the digital route and construct a \u201cvirtual\u201d festival online. Fr\u00e9maux said that, at the beginning of June, Cannes would announce a list of films that would have screened in the 2020 festival. Then, Fr\u00e9maux said, \u201cthe aim is to start organising events in cinemas\u201d \u2013 what he termed \u201cCannes hors les murs\u201d, or \u201cCannes outside the walls\u201d. Authorities in South Korea are struggling to contain a new coronavirus outbreak linked to the capital\u2019s nightclub district as a backlash against the country\u2019s gay community increases, prompting fears LGBT people will fail to get tested out of fear of being outed, Nemo Kim in Seoul reports. South Korea had been praised for its innovative efforts to contain the pandemic, going from the second most infected region outside China to having just a handful of cases before the latest outbreak a week ago. But the increasing number of cases related to nightclubs in Seoul is raising concerns about a possible second wave as well as over the high level of deeply entrenched homophobic attitudes in the conservative society. Of 35 new cases, 29 were found to be linked to Itaewon, the capital\u2019s gay district, according to officials from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), bringing the total number of cases related to the clubs to 86. After Kookmin Ilbo, a local media outlet with links to an evangelical church, reported that businesses visited by an infected man over the long weekend were gay clubs, many other South Korean media followed suit, revealing not only the identity of clientele but also some of their ages and the names of their workplaces. The media frenzy reached a new level when another infected man was found to have been to an LGBT sauna in Gangnam, prompting a slew of homophobic content in newspapers and online. Lurid reporting, along with South Korea\u2019s use of the trace and test method, has led to members of the gay community reporting feeling scared to get tested and even suicidal. Officials said 3,112 people who were in the nightclubs were currently not contactable. Lee Youngwu , a gay man in his 30s, told the Guardian: I admit it was a huge mistake to visit the gay district when the corona situation was not fully over. But visiting the area is the only time when I can be myself and hang out with others similar to me. During the week, I have to pretend to like women. My credit card company told me that they passed on my payment information in the district to the authorities. I feel so trapped and hunted down. If I get tested, my company will most likely find out I\u2019m gay. I\u2019ll lose my job and face a public humiliation. I feel as if my whole life is about to collapse. I have never felt suicidal before and never thought I would, but I am feeling suicidal now. Spain\u2019s health ministry reported 123 coronavirus deaths on Monday, the country\u2019s lowest level in seven weeks and down from a peak of 950 in early April, Reuters reports. The overall death toll from the epidemic rose to 26,744 on Monday from 26,621 on the previous day. The number of confirmed cases rose to 227,436 from 224,390 on Sunday. It came as about half of Spain\u2019s 47 million people progressed to the so-called Phase 1 of a four-step plan to relax one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns after the government decided that the regions in which they live met the necessary criteria. In regions that qualify, including most of Andalusia - Spain\u2019s most populous - as well as the Canary and Balearic Islands, bars, restaurants, shops, museums, gyms and hotels were allowed to open, most at reduced capacity. But Madrid, Barcelona and other cities including Valencia, Malaga and Granada will remain in Phase 0. Church services resumed with limited capacity and chairs, rather than pews, were spaced out inside for worshippers to keep 2m apart. Under the lockdown relaxation, up to 10 people can gather together and people are allowed to move freely around their province. Europe\u2019s largest minority, the Roma people, are being particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic in many countries, because they face a combination of health risks, economic deprivation and increased stigmatisation, reports Shaun Walker, the Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent, in Budapest. Around 80% of Europe\u2019s 10 million Roma live in densely populated neighbourhoods and overcrowded houses, and many do not have access to running water. This means the basic distancing and sanitary measures required to combat the spread of the virus are more difficult. In some countries this has already led to scapegoating of Roma communities as potential illness hotspots. \u201cThis disaster will not only affect the Roma but also mainstream societies, economies, and politics, and heighten inter-ethnic conflict to a level not seen in the last three decades,\u201d according to a recent report by the Open Society Foundations on the impact of coronavirus on Roma in six countries with sizeable communities: Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Slovakia and Spain. Roma neighbourhoods in Bulgaria and Slovakia have been cordoned off amid fears of the virus spreading. Police checkpoints were introduced outside two large neighbourhoods in Sofia, and people were only allowed to leave the area if they could show a work contract or prove another urgent reason for doing so. Forty-five more people in Iran have been recorded as dying from coronavirus in the past 24 hours, according to the spokesman for the country\u2019s health ministry. In a televised statement, Kianoush Jahanpour said said that 1,683 new infected cases have been detected since yesterday, bringing the total number of infections to 109,286. So far 87,422 people have recovered from the virus, while 6,685 have died and 2,703 are currently in hospital in a critical condition, Jahanpour was quoted as saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency. He added that 601,324 tests have so far been carried out in Iran. Saudi-backed authorities in Yemen have declared Aden an \u201cinfested\u201d city after the number of coronavirus cases there rose, Reuters reports. The Aden-based national coronavirus committee late on Sunday announced 17 new Covid-19 cases, 10 of them in the southern port city, to raise the total count in areas under the Saudi-backed government\u2019s control to 51 with eight deaths. The Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which controls Sanaa, the national capital, and most large urban centres, has reported two cases, with one death. The Aden-based government has accused Houthi authorities of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, an accusation they deny. The committee said Aden had been declared an \u201cinfested city\u201d due to the spread of the coronavirus and other diseases already rife in the country after recent flooding. It said movement from Aden to other regions was barred, except for transport of goods. \u201cThe administrative and political situation in Aden is also hampering efforts to combat the coronavirus and this should be remedied so relevant entities can carry out their duties,\u201d the committee said on its Twitter account. A five-year war has shattered Yemen\u2019s health system, pushed millions to the brink of famine and divided the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is community transmission of the virus in Yemen, with the disease spreading undetected among a population with some of the lowest levels of immunity to disease compared with other states. Testing capabilities are inadequate but the WHO has also urged local authorities to transparently report confirmed cases. Hi this is Damien Gayle taking the reins on the blog now for the next eight hours, with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. As usual, I\u2019m keen to hear your input.

This is Paul MacInnes signing off. Damien Gayle will be taking over till 7pm UK time. Thanks for reading and for your emails too. India is to reopen parts of its railway network this week, despite an ongoing rise in the coronavirus infection rate in the country. The government\u2019s railway ministry said it would gradually restart passenger services on Tuesday with 15 trains connecting Delhi to Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and other big cities. \u201cThereafter, Indian Railways shall start more special services on new routes,\u201d the government said in a statement. India\u2019s 1.3bn people are currently under lockdown until May 17 and a growing number of politicians and business groups are clamouring for an end to the measures. An estimated 20m Indians use the railways each day under normal circumstances, and any resumption of services will be essential to restarting the Indian economy. Figures released by the government on Sunday, however, showed coronavirus infections had jumped by 4,214 to 67,152, the biggest recorded daily rise. India\u2019s rising numbers of infections are in part the result of increased testing, which has grown from 2,000 tests per day in late March, to 85,000 to 90,000 a day now, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was due to hold a meeting with state chief ministers later on Monday to determine a path out of the lockdown even as infections spread. Passengers taking the trains that will start up on Tuesday will have to wear masks and undergo screening at the stations, a government official said. In Afghanistan, the capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for coronavirus infections after 161 new cases were reported and the health ministry warned transmission will continue to surge across the war-torn country. The total number of infections in Kabul, which has so far been Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area, reached 1,257 confirmed cases. Around half of 325 tests in Kabul went back positive today. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said out of 709 tests across the country in the past 24 hours, 285 were positive and two patients had died of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections to 4,687 and death toll to 122. There have so far been 574 recoveries. Majroh warned that the country is going toward the peak of the virus and that the number of transmissions \u201cwill continue to surge\u201d. He also said the testing capacity of the country will increase. Despite government authorised lockdown in the capital and several other provinces, cities are still crowded and some provinces eased lockdowns on Sunday. Majroh said there is \u201ca need for people to act responsibly and take the lockdown seriously\u201d. He called on people to stay at home and asked the people to \u201cadapt their life with the coronavirus and observe health guidelines\u201d. The Afghan government has announced that it has started a plan to distribute bread amongst the country\u2019s poor after around two million Afghans lost their jobs due to the pandemic. The announcement came after at least six people were killed in a protest against unfair distribution of the aid in central Ghor province on Friday. Officials in Kandahar announced over the weekend that governor of Kandahar tested positive as 30 new confirmed cases reported today, pushing the total number of infection to 537 with 12 deaths. Kandahar governor is the second high profile official in Afghanistan to get infected to Covid-19 after Ferozuddin Feroz, the health minister infected to virus last Thursday. Heath ministry spokesman said Feroz is in good condition. The western province of Herat recorded 7 new cases overnight. Herat borders Iran and first case of Covid-19 confirmed in the province as thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Herat is the country\u2019s second worst affected city with 901 confirmed cases. Toward the east, six out of the eight of Sunday\u2019s positive cases in Nangarhar were from province\u2019s prison, said Shah Mahmoud Meyakhil, provincial governor, adding there are 12 other suspected cases are in the prison, 16 new cases confirmed today in Nangarhar. Meanwhile, the war has intensified as at least six security forces were killed and five others were wounded in a Taliban attack in Laghman province on Sunday night, defense ministry said Monday. At least 25 civilians were killed and 75 wounded in Taliban attacks over last week, according to country\u2019s National Security Council spokesman. Russia has reported a record rise in the number of new coronavirus infections with 11,656 new cases in the last 24 hours. The Russian government attribute the spike in cases to an increased testing programme. The country\u2019s coronavirus response centre also reported 94 new deaths, taking the overall death toll to 2,009 people. Schoolchildren began trialling temperature-monitoring bracelets at Beijing schools on Monday, in China\u2019s latest high-tech measure for tracking possible exposure to Covid-19. The bracelets collect real-time temperature data that can be monitored by schools and parents via an app, the Beijing Daily reported. If a student\u2019s temperature rises above 37.2 degrees, the bracelet will prompt their teacher to alert the police, The bracelets were rolled out in five Beijing districts as middle school students went back to school for the first time in months. \u201cThe bracelet is similar to a normal fitness tracker ... We recommend that students wear them 24 hours a day,\u201d one unnamed teacher told the Beijing Daily. Over the past few weeks, a wave of schools have gradually reopened across China with extra health and safety measures that include daily temperature monitoring, compulsory mask-wearing and social-distancing policies. This follows measures taken in Chinese society more broadly. Thermal cameras have been in public areas and most places require people to show an app with green, yellow and red ratings that determine a person\u2019s infection risk based on travel history. Some Chinese regions have taken back-to-school measures that are even more vigilant. The southern province of Guangdong required all 167,000 of the first batch of returning high school students and 30,000 teachers to undergo nucleic acid testing in late April. Confirmed coronavirus infections in the Philippines have broken past the 11,000 mark, the health ministry said on Monday. In a bulletin, the health ministry reported 292 additional cases, bringing the total to 11,086. It recorded seven more deaths, increasing the total to 726 while 75 more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 1,999. Tr\u00f3ndur Arge writes: The last time KI Klaksvik and B36 Torshavn met, last October, it was to decide the destiny of the Premier League title, a match that attracted a record 6,000 people \u2013 about 11.5% of the population of the Faroe Islands. On Saturday they played again, with no more than 50 people allowed into the stadium including the 22 players on the field, as European domestic football got back under way on the rocky archipelago between Scotland and Iceland. Saudi Arabia has announced plans to raise taxes and cut public spending as it attempts to deal with both the Covid-19 pandemic and a collapse in oil prices. Taxes on basic goods are to triple to 15%, spending on major projects cut by $26bn and a \u2018cost of living allowance\u2019 for individuals is to be scrapped. \u201cWe are facing a crisis the world has never seen the likes of in modern history, a crisis marked by uncertainty,\u201d said the Saudi finance minister and acting minister of economy and planning, Mohammed Al-Jadaan. \u201cThese measures that have been undertaken today, as tough as they are, are necessary and beneficial to maintain comprehensive financial and economic stability.\u201d Saudi Arabia has experienced a substantial coronavirus outbreak, reporting 39,000 confirmed cases and 246 deaths. But the country has also been hit hard by the fall in oil prices, with crude now trading at around $30 a barrel, less than half the price at the end of 2019. This is far below the range Saudi Arabia needs to balance its budget. The kingdom has also lost revenue from the suspension of Muslim pilgrimages to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, which were closed to visitors due to the virus. The decision to cut $26bn in expenses, or about 100 billion Saudi riyals, includes cancelling, extending, or postponing some operational and capital expenditures for government agencies, as well reducing costs for major Vision 2030 projects that are the centerpiece of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s plans for the country. The cost-of-living allowance, is also to be withdrawn from June, a supplement that had cost the state about $13.5bn a year. VAT will also rise from 5% to 15% in July. The tax on most goods and services was only introduced in Saudi Arabia in 2018. Switzerland has announced a range of measures to loosen lockdown conditions in the country. From today, primary and \u2018lower secondary\u2019 schools will reopen, meaning children up to the age of 15 can resume their education. Shops, markets, museums, libraries and restaurants will also be allowed to reopen provided they comply with \u201cprecautionary measures\u201d. The level of threat from coronavirus in the country remains \u2018extraordinary\u2019 however, according to the government\u2019s classification. Switzerland has reported 30,305 cases of the disease, according to the John Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, with 1,833 deaths. Many of us have turned to the television set for solace during the coronavirus lockdown. But with much of the world behind closed doors, production of new content for the small screen has ground to a halt. In Japan, this has led to an almost unprecedented situation: a lack of new episodes of \u201cSazae-san\u201d, the world\u2019s longest running cartoon. A mainstay of the Japanese weekend, production of the cartoon has been interrupted by the coronavirus, forcing the broadcast of re-runs for the first time in decades. \u201cSazae-san\u201d, which first aired in 1969, revolves around the life of Mrs Sazae, a cheerful but klutzy housewife who lives with her parents, husband, son, brother and sister. The 30-minute episodes aired Sunday nights are very popular, and for many in Japan have come to denote the end of the weekend. But the cartoon, recognised as the longest-running animated TV series by Guinness World Records, has been hampered by the outbreak of the virus, with animation dubbing halted to keep staff safe, broadcaster Fuji Television Network said. \u201cWe will halt broadcast of new episodes of \u2018Sazae-san\u2019 for the time being from May 17 and instead air re-runs,\u201d it announced on Sunday. It is the first time the network has been forced to air re-runs since 1975, when the economic effects of an earlier oil crisis lingered.. Hi this is Paul and I\u2019ll be taking you through for the next four hours. My Twitter is largely defunct (I just lurk really), but you can mail me here I\u2019ll now hand over to my colleague Paul MacInnes in London. Thanks for your company. You can catch up on the most recent developments with our global wrap here: Donald Trump is culpable in the deaths of thousands of Americans by using the coronavirus pandemic to boost his electoral prospects and line the pockets of big business, Prof Noam Chomsky has said. In an interview with the Guardian, the radical intellectual argued the US president was stabbing average Americans in the back while pretending to be the country\u2019s saviour during the worst health crisis in at least a century. He said Trump, who will seek re-election later this year, had cut government funding for healthcare and research into infectious disease for the benefit of wealthy corporations. Chomsky said: \u201cThat\u2019s something that Trump has been doing every year of his term, cutting it back more. So [his plan is] let\u2019s continue to cut it back, let\u2019s continue to make sure that the population is as vulnerable as we can make it, that it can suffer as much as possible, but will of course increase profits for his primary constituents in wealth and corporate power.\u201d Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, professor Michael Kidd, is addressing media about the pending easing of restrictions in some states. \u201cWe have very serious risks if overcrowding starts to occur,\u201d Kidd says. \u201cCovid-19 is still out there in our country.\u201d \u201cIf you see a crowd, please go in the other direction.\u201d Kidd says ideally employers would have people working from home if possible, otherwise having staggered start and finish times. Individuals also need to take personal responsibility, for example not getting into a lift if it looks too full. Kidd reports there are no new cases in the ACT, the Northern Territory, South Australia, Western Australia, or Tasmania. Taiwan\u2019s leader, Tsai Ing-wen has posted a clip of an interview affirming Taiwan\u2019s wish to rejoin the World Health Organisation. Taiwan\u2019s membership has been blocked by the Chinese Communist Party government, which claims ownership over Taiwan as a Chinese territory. Amid tensions between China and other nations (including the US and Australia), there has been growing international pressure on the WHO to allow Taiwan to be given back its observer status. Tsai expressed gratitude to the countries supporting Taiwan\u2019s acceptance into the WHO, and reasserted the country\u2019s right to as the world for help. \u201cWe have the right to participate in the WHO as a world organisation responsible for the health of everybody in the world,\u201d said Tsai. \u201cAnd of course we do have a right to be part of it.\u201d She said Taiwan wanted access to information and to exchange experiences and learn from the international community, but also \u201cto be useful and helpful to the international community\u201d. \u201cWe are more than happy to share with the rest of the world.\u201d Footage showing half a dozen dead bodies lying on beds next to Covid-19 patients in hospital has horrified India and exposed how the nation\u2019s health system is struggling, in some areas, to cope during the pandemic. The footage from Sion hospital in Mumbai showed the bodies, wrapped in black plastic, lying next to patients undergoing treatment. Families tending to the patients were also seen moving around the ward, with the bodies lying nearby . The vision provoked public outrage and echoed the fears expressed by many Indians that some states might be overwhelmed if there is an increase in cases. The country\u2019s official Covid-19 figures remain low compared with the scale of the pandemic in Europe and the US, and given its population. The hospital\u2019s dean, Pramod Ingale, blamed the families of the dead for failing to collect the bodies of their loved ones and said the bodies were left in the ward because the morgue was full. Ingale said the rules were not clear about what the hospital should do with unclaimed bodies. Regulations state the body of a Covid-19 patient has to be removed 30 minutes after being declared dead. New Zealand to move to level 2 lockdown, easing some restrictions. Jacinda Ardern said parties, weddings, stag dos, and funerals will be capped at 10, both inside and outside, as the director-general of health had deemed these events \u201chigh-risk\u201d, with the country\u2019s largest Covid-19 clusters spreading from a wedding, a St Patrick\u2019s day party and a conference. It came as the country reported three new cases. South Korea has reported 35 new cases on Monday, 29 linked to Seoul clubs and bars which were attended by a man in his 20s. More than 1,500 people have been contacted as possible contacts.It was the single biggest daily toll since 9 April, and the country\u2019s containment measures are being put to the test, Yonhap News reports. Japan could lift a state-of-emergency in many regions this week if new coronavirus cases are under control, the economy minister said on Monday, as it inches towards a gradual return of economic activity. In Ghana, one worker at a fish-processing factory in the Atlantic seafront city of Tema infected 533 other workers, according to President Nana Akufo-Addo. The first Disneyland resort has reopened, in Shanghai. Chinese state media reports the park is reopening to guests with restrictions on numbers and traffic flow. Children\u2019s playgrounds and indoor theatres are staying closed for the time being. An untraced coronavirus outbreak in a Chinese city near the Russian border and a spate of new cases in Wuhan has prompted fears of a fresh wave of infections in China. Wuhan has recorded its highest number of new infections since 11 March, reporting five new cases for 10 May, among 17 new cases nationwide, the highest in almost two weeks. Five locally transmitted cases were in three provinces bordering Russia and/or North Korea - Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning. Scientists have found evidence for mutations in some strains of the coronavirus that suggest the pathogen may be adapting to humans after spilling over from bats. US vice president Mike Pence is self-isolating, or at least distancing somewhat, from others at the White House. His office said Pence was not in quarantine and plans to be at the White House on Monday, local time, but was taking precautions. In the United Kingdom Boris Johnson has announced plans to ease restrictions, but they\u2019ve been labeled divisive, confusing and vague after he said some places could reopen and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work, without giving details of how. Thailand reported six new coronavirus cases on Monday, bringing its total to 3,015 cases since the outbreak began in January, Reuters has reported. The new cases were all in Thailand\u2019s southern provinces, including four on the tourist island of Phuket and one each in Narathiwat and Yala provinces, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman of the government\u2019s Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration. Daily new cases in the single digits have prompted Thailand to begin cautiously reopening some businesses that had been closed to slow the spread of the virus. The death toll remained at 56, while 2,796 patients have recovered. Earlier I posted coverage of a protest in Australia, where a small group of demonstrators in Melbourne were angry about lockdown restrictions, Bill Gates, and 5G. Australian health authorities are now using social media trying to combat the growing conspiracy theories about the (non-existent) link between the 5G network and Covid-19. Four days after many newspapers looked forward to a widespread easing of restrictions on \u201cMagic Monday\u201d, the story was very different following Boris Johnson\u2019s Sunday\u2019s night\u2019s televised address to the nation. \u201cBoris keeps handbrake on\u201d, says the Mail\u2019s front page headline alongside a large picture of the prime minister clenching his fist as he makes a point during the broadcast. It says Johnson set out the \u201cfirst steps to free Britain\u201d. Freedom is also the theme of other front pages with the Express proclaiming \u201cBoris: our route to freedom\u2026 in baby steps\u201d, and the Telegraph saying: \u201cThe long road to freedom\u201d. However, the broadsheet also carries a front page commentary which says that the prime minister \u201cgave us the map, but only a few vague directions\u201d. So that was Jacinda Ardern announcing New Zealand will move from level 3 restrictions to level 2 on Thursday. Ardern praised the public\u2019s efforts in staying home to protect the country\u2019s most vulnerable and thanked New Zealanders for the huge sacrifices they had made in protecting the country\u2019s most vulnerable, including the elderly and the immunosuppressed. She said parties, weddings, stag dos, and funerals will be capped at 10, both inside and outside, as the director-general of health had deemed these events \u201chigh-risk\u201d, with the country\u2019s largest Covid-19 clusters spreading from a wedding, a St Patrick\u2019s day party and a conference. Ardern says: \u201cIn 10 days time we will have reopened most businesses in New Zealand... Our plan was go hard, go early so we can get our economy going sooner.\u201d Malls, playgrounds and gyms will reopen. \u201cYou can begin to move around New Zealand,\u201d Ardern says. On Monday 18 May, all schoolchildren will be able to return to school and nursery. On 21 May, bars will be able to reopen. Ardern is talking about what has worked - including strong border controls and strict hand hygiene, but warns \u201cwe have not won the war.\u201d \u201cThere is still a chance of silent spread in the future... so today I am announcing that cabinet agrees we are ready to move to level 2, to open up the economy as safely as possible.\u201d We are expecting an update from New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern on her plans to ease lockdown measures further. New Zealand has recorded three new cases of coronavirus today. Stay tuned... \u201cEmerging from weeks of strict coronavirus lockdown, itself a cause of serious mental health disruption, the lifting of restrictions brings for many a sense of trepidation and unease. While some are bucking at the gate, waiting to return to life in the new normal, others are experiencing a lingering fear of contagion of the virus about which little is still understood.\u201d As several nations plot a course back to an approximation of normal life, Celina Riberio takes a look at the phenomenon of return anxiety: Here is our full report on the latest from China, where new cases in two cities are causing concern: South Korea has reported 35 new cases on Monday, most linked to Seoul clubs and bars. It was the single biggest daily toll since 9 April, and the country\u2019s containment measures are being put to the test, Yonhap News reports. 29 new cases are linked to clubbers in the Itaweon district after man in his 20s tested positive. More than 1,500 people, from 85 nationalities, are believed to have visited five venues at the same time as the man. Reuters: Japan could lift a state-of-emergency in many regions this week if new coronavirus cases are under control, the economy minister said on Monday, as it inches towards a gradual return of economic activity. The state of emergency, in place since last month, gives governors of the 47 prefectures stronger legal authority to urge people to stay at home and businesses to close, but there are no fines or arrests for non-compliance. The government last week extended the emergency to the end of May, saying it would reassess the situation on May 14. Some non-essential businesses, even in the 13 hardest-hit prefectures designated \u201cspecial alert districts\u201d, including Tokyo and Osaka, have already reopened despite the extension. Japan has avoided an explosive outbreak of the novel coronavirus, with some 15,800 domestic cases and 630 deaths. The number of new infections has been on a declining trend over the past week. \u201cWe have been able to proceed steadily towards an end,\u201d Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a parliamentary session, referring to the epidemic. Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the government could lift the emergency this week in regions that have seen a notable improvement, even among the 13 hardest-hit prefectures, while warning that any reversal of the trend could change that. \u201cIf signs of an overshoot emerge after the lifting, we would need to consider a re-implementation,\u201d he said in parliament. Abe has warned of a long battle against the virus and asked the public to continue practising social distancing. People would need to adopt a \u201cnew lifestyle\u201d for the coronavirus era, he said, even after the state of emergency is lifted. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 357 to 169,575, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. The reported death toll rose by 22 to 7,417, the tally showed. In Ghana, one worker at a fish-processing factory in the Atlantic seafront city of Tema infected 533 other workers, according to President Nana Akufo-Addo. Via Reuters: Ghana\u2019s health authorities reported the outbreak at the industrial facility late on Friday, but did not provide details. \u201cAll 533 persons were infected by one person,\u201d President Akufo-Addo said. He did not provide details of how the disease spread in the facility or if safety measures had been in place. He said that the 533 positive cases, which represents around 11.3% of Ghana\u2019s total infections, were part of a backlog of about 921 cases going back as far as April 26 that are only recently being reported. The new cases pushed Ghana\u2019s total since the pandemic was first reported in the West African nation in mid-March to 4,700 as of Sunday night, the highest number of infections in West Africa. Reuters: New Zealand reported three new Covid-19 cases on Monday, ahead of a decision on whether to ease restrictions further and allow more business and recreational activities to resume after weeks of disruptions. The cases - two hospital nurses and one related to overseas travel - bring New Zealand\u2019s total confirmed infections to 1,147, the ministry said, adding that 93% of all confirmed and probable cases have recovered. The Pacific nation was locked down for more than month under \u201clevel 4\u201d restrictions that were eased by a notch on April 28. It has continued to enforce strict social measures on many of its citizens and businesses, helping prevent widespread community spread of the virus. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to announce at 4pm local time her decision on easing restrictions further and putting the country under alert level 2, which would allow retail, domestic travel and local sport to resume. If the country moves to alert level 2, children can return to schools while staff could return to offices, Ardern has said. Malls, cafes, hairdressers and other services would be also be allowed to re-open, but the country\u2019s borders would remain closed except for returning New Zealanders.T hree new cases of CovidD-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, were confirmed on Monday, the health ministry said in a statement. Disneyland Shanghai is the first Disney theme park to reopen after the pandemic caused global closures. Chinese state media reports the park is reopening to guests with restrictions on numbers and traffic flow. Children\u2019s playgrounds and indoor theatres are staying closed for the time being. In Australia, restrictions in various states are beginning to ease. Victoria\u2019s premier has just announced the state\u2019s residents can have five visitors inside their home, and can go outside for outdoor activities in groups of up to 10. Schools will start looking at a return to on-site learning Professional sports may restart training, and counselling services and community groups can restart for up to 10 people in a group, and with physical distancing measures. In Queensland and New South Wales children also began returning to school on Monday after the outbreak saw many of them pulled from school before holidays began a few weeks ago. From AP: The NSW government said it has delivered thousands of litres of soap and hand sanitiser to schools, as well as personal protective equipment and temperature monitors. Class sizes will be reduced and activities will involve minimal physical contact between the students, many of whom have not attended school since mid-March. \u201cI know this is a huge relief for families,\u201d NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. \u201cIt is a huge relief for the state government because we know how important it is for students to receive that face to face teaching,\u201d she added. Final year students, whose exams were interrupted by the virus response, would attend at least three days per week in class, Berejiklian said, with the plan to return to full-time class attendance for all students by the end of May. Reuters: In Indonesia a traditional market on the island of Java has moved outdoors and set stalls at least a metre (3.3 ft) apart as Indonesia looks to safely maintain the bazaars where most people go to get affordable food and are part of the fabric of society. The 857 vendors at the Salatiga market in Central Java province, as well as visitors, are required to wear masks and avoid physical contact with each other to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, the head of the vendor association said. A vegetable seller said the social distancing measures made him feel safe and comfortable at work. At least eight confirmed cases of the virus have been found in the city of Salatiga, local media has reported. Indonesia, which had over 14,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday, has been reluctant to enforce a complete nationwide lockdown. Instead, many cities have adopted \u201clarge-scale social restrictions\u201d that have closed businesses and encouraged people to stay home. The Chinese city of Wuhan has recorded its highest number of new infections since 11 March, reporting five new cases for 10 May. The five are among 17 new cases nationwide, the highest in almost two weeks. Of the new cases, seven were imported cases involving travellers from overseas, compared with two imported infections the previous day. Five locally transmitted cases were in three provinces bordering Russia and/or North Korea - Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning. China\u2019s has reported a total of 82,918 cases and the death toll remained unchanged at 4,633. The number of asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, those who were infected but not exhibiting symptoms, fell to 12 on 10 May compared with 20 reported a day earlier. Scientists have found evidence for mutations in some strains of the coronavirus that suggest the pathogen may be adapting to humans after spilling over from bats. The analysis of more than 5,300 coronavirus genomes from 62 countries shows that while the virus is fairly stable, some have gained mutations, including two genetic changes that alter the critical \u201cspike protein\u201d the virus uses to infect human cells. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stress that it is unclear how the mutations affects the virus, but since the changes arose independently in different countries they may help the virus spread more easily. \u201cThis is exactly what we need to look out for,\u201d Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases and a senior author on the study, said. \u201cPeople are making vaccines and other therapies against this spike protein because it seems a very good target. We need to keep an eye on it and make sure that any mutations don\u2019t invalidate any of these approaches.\u201d We are seeking clarity on the reports that Mike Pence is self-isolating, or at least distancing somewhat, from others at the White House. His office has just released a statement to say that despite reports, Pence is not in quarantine and plans to be at the White House on Monday, local time. \u201cVice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,\u201d spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley said in a statement. \u201cAdditionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow,\u201d the statement added. NBC reported Pence had just had a \u201clow key weekend\u201d. The Trump administration has no plans to keep President Donald Trump and Pence apart, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, as concerns rise about the spread of the coronavirus within the White House. In Australia, a small group of people staged a protest in Melbourne echoing some of the wilder theories that we\u2019ve been seeing in the US in recent weeks. Demonstrators in Melbourne held signs about 5G, China and the Murray-Darling River while chanting \u201carrest Bill Gates\u201d. Various speakers claimed Covid-19 was a conspiracy orchestrated by \u201cglobalists\u201d, while one of the main organisers of the rally, Fanos Panayides, told the crowd he promised his father he would never be microchipped. Panayides, previously a contestant on the Nine Network program Family Food Fight, was later arrested by police as he tried to find a verse from the Bible on his mobile phone. In India: One of the world\u2019s largest train networks will \u201cgradually\u201d restart operations from Tuesday as India eases its coronavirus lockdown. India has recorded more than 60,000 cases of Covid-19 including more than 2,000 deaths. Some 30 train journeys - 15 pairs of return trips - will run from the capital New Delhi to other cities including Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, Indian Railways said late Sunday. \u201cIndian Railways plans to gradually restart passenger train operations from 12th May, 2020... Thereafter, Indian Railways shall start more special services on new routes,\u201d the railways ministry added in a statement. \u201cIt will be mandatory for the passengers to wear face cover and undergo screening at departure and only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed to board the train.\u201d The vast train network, which had carried more than 20 million passengers daily, was halted in late March as India imposed a strict lockdown to stem the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. Since early May, the government said some 366 special trains carrying up to 1,200 passengers on each service have operated to help stranded poor, rural migrant workers who lost their jobs in cities in the lockdown to return to their villages. \u201cI appeal to all the states to give permission to evacuate and bring back their stranded migrants so that we can get all of them back to their homes in the next 3-4 days itself,\u201d Railways Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted Sunday. Local media reported some provinces were charging for the rail tickets, which most migrants can\u2019t afford. AP has more details on reports that US vice president Mike Pence is self-isolating after an aide tested positive for the coronavirus last week. He joins three of the nation\u2019s top scientists in taking protective steps after possible exposure. An administration official said Pence was voluntarily keeping his distance from other people in line with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He has repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 since his exposure but was following the advice of medical officials. Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,\u201d spokesman Devin O\u2019Malley said Sunday. \u201cAdditionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow. Pence has been at home since returning to Washington from a day trip to Iowa on Friday and did not appear at President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting with military leaders Saturday at the White House. Pence was informed of the aide\u2019s positive test shortly before departing for that trip. An official initially said Pence planned to continue working from home, before Pence\u2019s office clarified that he planned to work from the White House on Monday. t was not immediately clear how Pence\u2019s steps to self-isolate would impact his professional or public engagements. Hello, and welcome to our continuing global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, which has now infected more than 4.09m people, killing 282,000. You can catch up on the latest developments here. In the United Kingdom Boris Johnson has announced plans to ease restrictions, but they\u2019ve been labeled divisive, confusing and vague after he said some places could reopen and the government was \u201cactively encouraging\u201d people to return to work, without giving details of how. The UK is about to start requiring all international arrivals to quarantine for 14 days \u201csoon\u201d. Arrivals from France are exempt. The measure, which is to ensure that any potential carriers of the virus do not spread it further before being tested, has been in place in numerous other countries for months. Britain has the second highest number of recorded fatalities in the world, at almost 32,000. Italy, which has the third highest number of fatalities (30,560), recorded 165 new deaths on Sunday. The number of new infections rose by 802, which was the lowest daily rise since 6 March. The country, which started easing lockdown restrictions last Monday, has recorded a total of 219,070 cases. France and Spain are also preparing to lift their restrictions. In France hair salons, clothes shops, florists and bookshops will open again on Monday, while bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport. Everyone will be able to move outside without having to present a form on demand but people will only be able to go 100km from their place of residence. Half of Spain\u2019s 47m people will be able to meet with family or friends in gatherings of up to 10, within provinces, as of Monday. Outdoor spaces at bars and restaurants can reopen with limited capacity. Hardest-hit Madrid and Barcelona are excluded from the easing, though football clubs FC Barcelona resumed training on Friday and Real Madrid will follow Monday. US vice-president Mike Pence is reportedly self-isolating after an aid tested positive for Covid-19. It\u2019s one of several cases of the illness among White House staff who are in close proximity to the president. What Pence\u2019s self-isolation actually entails isn\u2019t clear, as both Reuters and the New York Times are reporting - per unnamed sources - that there is no plan to keep him separated from Donald Trump. The two are being tested daily. Trump\u2019s personal valet has been diagnosed with Covid-19, as has Pence\u2019s press secretary, Katie Miller, the wife of Trump\u2019s senior adviser, Stephen Miller. Three members of the White House coronavirus taskforce are self-isolating: Top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci; director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn. The US has recorded more than 79,000 Covid-19 fatalities. More than 90% of the 2,000 hospital beds reserved for Covid-19 patients in Tokyo have already been occupied, the Japanese health ministry has announced. In China the city of Wuhan, where it all began, has reported its first case in weeks, but in the northeast of the country there is a possible new wave of cases, with one city in Jilin province being reclassified as high-risk. In Colombia Avianca Holdings, Latin America\u2019s No. 2 airline and one of the oldest in the world, has filed for bankruptcy, after failing to secure aid from Colombia\u2019s government and with a bond payment deadline looming.",
