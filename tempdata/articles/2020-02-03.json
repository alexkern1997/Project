It\u2019s a bit of a rum affair, really.</p> \n  <p>Graham Norton will be hosting the show \u2013 Joanna Lumley did it for the previous two years, and got rather a mixed reception for her pains. The Baftas have also come in for quite a bashing for their lack of diversity, so expect some mention of that on stage tonight. Oh, and there\u2019s that little thing called Brexit, too. </p> \n  <p>Join us from now until midnight \u2013 yes, midnight \u2013 for red carpet fashion, trenchant assessments of the winners and losers, and many lame jokes by me.

See you for the Oscars this time next week, and thanks for watching the Baftas with us. We\u2019ve just launched our gallery of the best images of the night. Here are the people who lost out tonight: Al Pacino, the royals and Cats for three. Florence Pugh looks as if she\u2019s finally letting her hair down. Our Stuart Heritage is somewhere at the afterparties as we speak. Quentin Tarantino\u2019s somewhat gloomy countenance at the Baftas is being talked about on Twitter \u2013 particularly when Bong June-ho won the screenplay award for Parasite and beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. And, naturally, we\u2019re going to be doing this all again, only on a bigger scale, for the Oscars next Sunday. If you\u2019re a Guardian liveblog addict, then we\u2019ve got a pair of them starting for the Super Bowl. Follow the actual game here and we\u2019re blogging the attendant hoopla, ads and half-time show from J Lo here. Here\u2019s that speech on diversity by Joaquin Phoenix, plus some commentary by writer Rebecca Carroll. The success of For Sama tonight was definitely something to celebrate. As this tweet from Channel 4\u2019s Krishnan Guru-Murthy puts it: As for the hosting, some people are missing Stephen Fry: So that\u2019s it \u2013 a Baftas that talked the talk about diversity but perhaps didn\u2019t really walk the walk, a factor called out by Joaquin Phoenix in a powerful speech. Plus, it\u2019s pretty surprising that The Irishman \u2013 the Guardian\u2019s film of the year, no less \u2013 didn\u2019t win a single gong. But that\u2019s awards for you \u2013 often arbitrary and rather difficult to fathom. 1917 won a bunch more awards \u2013 it won seven in all, putting it at the front of the queue for the Oscars when they\u2019re dished out next Sunday. They\u2019re now recapping the awards that weren\u2019t broadcasted, including original score, which was won by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, whom we interviewed a few weeks ago. You can see the full list here. Kathleen Kennedy remembers filming Raiders of the Lost Ark in London and having Steven Spielberg and George Lucas as mentors, vows that more will be done to be inclusive, and generally wraps up the evening with class. That\u2019s it! This is quite a montage, taking in Star Wars, Back to the Future, Lincoln, Schindler\u2019s List, ET and a whole lot more \u2013 all produced by Kathleen Kennedy. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega are on stage to give the award to Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy. The camera keeps panning to a stone-faced Adam Driver who will be going home empty-handed tonight. William adds that more needs to be done to address diversity in Bafta and the film industry. \u201cBafta take this issue seriously and have commissioned a thorough review.\u201d Now it\u2019s the fellowship award presented by Prince William, who says: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should be proud or alarmed by the amount of winners who have portrayed members of my own family.\u201d George Mackay, the film\u2019s star, pays tribute to the crew and \u201cthe goodness that can come in working on something bigger than yourself.\u201d Sam Mendes thanks the people who\u2019ve gone to see the film: \u201cIt\u2019s still on,\u201d he points out. And best film is 1917. Sam Mendes and the cast are on their feet again. Hugh Grant is giving out the award for best film with a Bridget Jones gag: \u201cWell done, Jones.\u201d The nominee are 1917, The Irishman, Joker, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Parasite. Backstage, Zellweger\u2019s been talking to Lanre and the assembled hacks about what Judy Garland meant to the gay community. It\u2019s impossible to accurately represent the legacy of Judy Garland without touching on what she meant to the LGBTQ+ community. Being one of the first people who spoke out and advocated publicly at a time when folks weren\u2019t safe to live authentically, it could be worse, you could be ostracised or becoming a social pariah. It was illegal. I can\u2019t imagine what that must have meant to a person who felt ostracised at that time, it must have meant everything. That was Rupert [Goold\u2019s] decision to put that in. Zellweger pays lavish tribute to Jessie Buckley who was also in the film, although she was nominated instead for Wild Rose, and gives a shout-out to a list of people including her \u201cstage moms\u201d and director Rupert Goold. Not a big surprise: Ren\u00e9e Zellweger gets the gong for her portrayal of Judy Garland. Robert De Niro says that Graham Norton was his muse for The Irishman, then gives out the gong for best leading actress: Jessie Buckley, Scarlett Johansson, Saorsie Ronan, Charlize Theron and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. A hard-hitting speech from Joaquin Phoenix: \u201cI think we send a message to people of colour that you\u2019re not welcome here \u2026 I\u2019m part of the problem, I\u2019ve not done enough to make sure that the sets I work on are inclusive.\u201d He calls out Hollywood\u2019s \u201csystemic racism\u201d and says that \u201cpeople who have benefited from a system of a oppression are the ones who have to dismantle it, so that\u2019s on us.\u201d Olivia Colman gives the award for best actor: \u201cI\u2019d have a Wagamama with any of this lot\u201d \u2013 Leonardo DiCaprio, Adam Driver, Taron Egerton, Joaquin Phoneix and Jonathan Pryce. Joaquin wins, wearing his famous tuxedo. Lanre spoke to Sam Mendes at the Albert Hall. \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely over the moon \u2013 at the risk of sounding like an out of work football manager. \u201cI feel like somehow, because of the idea of shooting it without a cut, because of the crew and the amount of time we spent working together, it was kind of a utopia for me which I\u2019ll never experience again. I thought: \u2018I have to enjoy every second of this\u2019, because I found it hard to imagine those circumstances ever happening again. \u201cIn this movie, every single member of the crew was engaged with every single shot and that\u2019s never happened before. It became a very selfless and unified group of people and that\u2019s very unusual in film because it\u2019s usually a fragmented process. \u201cEveryone behind the camera, in front of the camera \u2013 there were 1,000 people involved in making it. Everything from the trenches, to orchards, to farmhouses was made by these people and it\u2019s a testament to them. I\u2019m proud that that work was recognised.\u201d Sam Mendes gets best director for 1917. \u201cI had a director\u2019s paradise in this film which I will never have again,\u201d he says. He pays tribute to the \u201cincredible cast\u201d, his family and Roger Deakins, the great cinematographer. And a zinger! \u201cLooking at this category \u2013 Sam Mendes, Martin Scorsese, Todd Phillips, Quentin Tarantino, Bong Joon-ho, I don\u2019t think I could do what they do. I just don\u2019t have the balls.\u201d Which gets the biggest laugh of the night. She puts the mask to her face: \u201cWhat a great way to stop yourself from getting coronavirus.\u201d Maybe Wilson should host next year. Wilson is wearing a half-red, half-black dress. \u201cThe black is from the funeral I went to for the film Cats.\u201d Oh blimey. Here comes Rebel Wilson: \u201cGood evening distinguished guests and those who don\u2019t identify as that. It\u2019s an honour to be at the Royal Andrew Hall\u201d \u2013 oof! \u201cTonight you\u2019re getting a gifting wallet \u2013 which is what I call my vagina. So maybe I\u2019ll win best original score at the afterparty tonight.\u201d Lanre\u2019s been talking to Bong Joon-ho, who said: \u201cI think in any country you have the rich and you have the poor and between those classes you have staircases. Being here today going up and down the staircases of the Royal Albert Hall is making me sweat. \u201cParasite is a movie about a poor man who wanted to go up the stairs but ends up going down the stairs, and I think it\u2019s a sad portrait of our current times.\u201d The compere, Miranda Sawyer, then explained that the press conference takes place in the basement of Royal Albert Hall and Bong said: \u201cThis is the bunker! You are the best people.\u201d On diversity, the hot-button subject this year, Bong said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m contributing to the diversity of the Oscars or Baftas because I\u2019ve been making films for the last 20 years, it\u2019s a huge honour to be invited to these events. But from the various efforts we\u2019ve been putting in, we will arrive at a day when we do have diversity whether that\u2019s about gender, sexuality or people of colour.\u201d Daniel Kaluuya gives the award for rising star to Essex\u2019s finest, Micheal Ward, so great in Top Boy and Blue Story. His mum is overcome, bless her. Michael himself also goes a bit wobbly in a very touching speech. \u201cYou have to see the opportunities and see a vision.\u201d It\u2019s the people we\u2019ve lost section including Rutger Hauer, Terry Jones, John Singleton, Peter Fonda, Agn\u00e8s Varda, Doris Day and Franco Zeffirelli. Really can\u2019t wait to see Parasite, a genre-mashing film which my colleagues, including the Guide\u2019s Gwilym Mumford, have raved about. Here\u2019s our review from Cannes, where it debuted last year. Indeed, Parasite took the prize, adding to its tally of 170 awards to date. So we\u2019re on best film not in the English language: The Farewell, For Sama, Pain and Glory, Parasite and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. I loved Pain and Glory but it won\u2019t win. Here\u2019s film critic Peter Bradshaw\u2019s verdict on how the night went down \u2013 again, wait until the end to read it if you\u2019re spoiler-wary. 1917 takes the prize for its one-take, immersive depiction of the first world war. So it\u2019s best special visual effects: 1917, Avengers Endgame, The Irishman (for the De Niro de-aging), The Lion King and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. What, no Cats? Well I guess that was good if you like that kind of thing? Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, who plays Judy in the film, seemed to enjoy it anyway. As my colleague Hadley puts it: Now Cirque du Soleil are doing a Judy Garland tribute which involves a woman in a black basque and knickers being flung around by three blokes in baggy white trousers. The stars, including Olivia Colman, applaud politely. So here\u2019s our story about the Bafta fashions \u2013 not many people got the memo about sustainability. And he\u2019s calling the award Harry \u201cbecause he\u2019s really excited about bringing it back to the States with him.\u201d Boom boom! So Brad Pitt just won best supporting actor for One Upon a Time in Hollywood while I was in the loo. He\u2019s not here, so his speech (including the aforementioned Brexit joke) is read out by his co-star Margot Robbie. Bong says that he wrote Parasite in coffee shops and never dreamed that he\u2019d be standing at the Albert Hall. And the winner is Parasite, a popular choice on the red carpet. Read our interview with its director and writer Bong June-ho here. His speech is in Korean, translated by the trusty Sharon Choi. Florence Pugh presents the award for original screenplay. The contenders: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Parasite, Marriage Story, Knives Out, Booksmart. Waad Al-Kateab is a bit tearful accepting her award for a documentary filmed in Aleppo, Syria, as bombs rained down. \u201cAs we speak there\u2019s a bombing and shelling on 3.5 million civilians.\u201d She appeals for Britain not to turn its back on the Syrian people. The winner is For Sama! And Sama (having been running amok backstage according to Lanre) herself is hoisted on to the stage. It\u2019s the best documentary award: The Great Hack, Apollo 11, For Sama, American Factory and Diego Maradona are the contenders. Well that was a touching speech with the sting in the tail that both of Serkis\u2019s parents \u201cslipped away while I was filming on the other side of the world\u201d. Andy Serkis, the most agile actor in London according to Ian McKellen, thanks his partner and three children for \u201callowing me to gallivant around the world wearing grey spandex and not disowning me\u201d. Here\u2019s our news story on the Baftas \u2013 but don\u2019t click if you\u2019re spoiler-wary. Andy Serkis, Gollum in Lord of the Rings, takes the gong. Last seen playing a talking anus, FYI. So there\u2019s quite a long riff about the disparity in heights between the cast of Lord of the Rings. Someone only came up to belt-height: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much acting as navel-gazing.\u201d Now it\u2019s outstanding British contribution to cinema presented by a dapper Ian McKellen. Quite a bold choice for something in black-and-white and filmed on 16mm camera \u2013 and about Cornish fishermen, as Jenkin says in his touching speech. And the Bafta goes to Bait! Our Laura Snapes interviewed the director Mark Jenkin here. So the nominations are Bait, Only You, For Sama, Retablo and Maiden. Sex Education\u2019s Gillian Anderson and Asa Butterfield come on to give the award for outstanding debut with a slightly awkward gag about imagining everyone naked. Adam Driver is wearing a codpiece, apparently. Lanre talks to Jacqueline Durran, who won the costume prize for Little Women. She says: \u201cI wish the film would have got more nominations. It\u2019s an absolutely fantastic thing that she [Greta Gerwig] has taken a female-centric story, written a script and directed it. She\u2019s made a successful film and that\u2019s the thing that opens door: you make movies that people love, you get to make more movies.\u201d Jessie Buckley is now singing Glasgow from Wild Rose. Plenty of closeups of stars intently listening \u2013 as they should to this splendidly sung number. Was Laura Dern shedding a tear there? The Baftas\u2019 view of Jojo Rabbit was not shared by our Peter Bradshaw, who gave the film one star. So Jojo Rabbit wins. Taika Waititi accepts the award saying \u201ccoming from the colonies, we know it\u2019s been a hard week for you guys and it\u2019s been very nice to take a bit of your gold back home where it belongs\u201d. George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman from 1917 are back and giving out the award for best adapted screenplay: the nominees are Jojo Rabbit, The Irishman, Joker, Little Women, The Two Popes. Waad Al-Kateab and Edward Watts, the directors and producers of For Sama, have been talking to Lanre. \u201cPeople say it\u2019s too much, in the film that was only 10% of what we shot and that is only a tiny percentage of what\u2019s happening in Aleppo. In the past six months more than 71 attacks have happened on 51 medical facilities, 10 of them were maternity hospitals. I know it\u2019s hard to watch but it\u2019s harder to take for those who it\u2019s happening to.\u201d Meanwhile Sama, the director\u2019s daughter, \u201cwas running riot in the press area dismantling microphones and keeping compere Miranda Sawyer on her toes \u2026\u201d \u201cWhen I was six years old my mother received this very award in this category thanks to Mr Scorsese,\u201d says Laura Dern about her mother Diane Ladd, who won for Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore. She goes on to pay tribute to Rada, where she studied, and Peter Sellers. The gong goes to Laura Dern. No argument there, she chews up the scenery in Marriage Story. Best supporting actress now, and the contenders are Margot Robbie for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Scarlett Johansson for Jojo Rabbit, Florence Pugh for Little Women, Margot Robbie again for Bombshell and Laura Dern for Marriage Story. Co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns gives the acceptance speech, paying tribute to the \u201cincredible bravery\u201d of the men who fought in the first world war. Not a big surprise there, it\u2019s 1917. Director Sam Mendes takes the stage. So the first award is for outstanding British film and the contenders are 1917, Bait, The Two Popes, For Sama, Sorry We Missed You and Rocketman. \u201cLet\u2019s get on with the awards because, unlike Robert De Niro in The Irishman, we\u2019re not getting any younger.\u201d De Niro gives that a mildly avuncular smile. We\u2019ve now got a montage of the year in film set to Hot Chip\u2019s Melody of Love. Cats is in it. Good Irishman gag. \u201cThey said don\u2019t watch it on your phone, but whose battery lasts that long?\u201d This is definitely better than the Joanna Lumley opening monologue, although that\u2019s a low bar. \u201cI think this will be remembered as the year when white men really broke through,\u201d says Norton. Joker, he says, \u201cis the story of a white man who makes himself even whiter.\u201d Our Catherine says that the EE on the podium has the suggestion of two testicles. Graham Norton\u2019s on in a red velvet jacket. \u201cYou\u2019re in safe hands, I\u2019m not going to be mean to anyone. I loved Cats, I\u2019m not even joking.\u201d So that was a genuinely good gag from Asim Chaudhry from People Just Do Nothing to Sam Mendes. \u201cCall my agent if you need another brown guy for your war films \u2013 it\u2019s Laurence Fox.\u201d Although there\u2019s definitely a sense that the Baftas are having their diversity cake and eating it \u2026 Robert De Niro says: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as confidence, you do your best.\u201d And there\u2019ll be strong language and flashing images apparently. Sam Mendes loved Parasite, Andrew Scott loved Uncut Gems ... we\u2019re back on the red carpet. So here\u2019s a lovingly crafted red carpet gallery from our fashion team. So Call the Midwife\u2019s ending. Is it just me who always imagines that title to the tune of Robyn\u2019s Call Your Girlfriend? The longer the ceremony goes on, and the more info about it there is on social media, the stranger it seems that we have to contend with a two-hour delay. But there we are. Thanks for bearing with us. The TV broadcast starts in five minutes on BBC1, stand by for us liveblogging the hell out of it. From our Lanners: Taika Waititi on using one well-placed F-word in Jojo Rabbit. I wanted kids to see the film. I think it\u2019s important that they saw it and understand what has happened in the past and because humans are such idiots we could be doomed to repeat. In America you\u2019re probably aware that you can only have the F-word once in a movie. Anything above that it\u2019s an automatic R-rating so you\u2019re cutting out anyone below 18, so I was determined to keep it clean-ish. In the room where it happens, Brad Pitt has just cracked a pretty good Brexit gag: \u201cHey Britain. Heard you just became single. Welcome to the club!\u201d As Catherine wrote recently, it\u2019s part of a pretty effective charm offensive that\u2019s seen him cut a wisecracking swather through awards season. What we don\u2019t know \u2013 yet \u2013 is who\u2019s penning these rib-ticklers. As we said in the story: \u201cThe idea that Pitt has a speechwriter is not news,\u201d says Anne Thompson, Indiewire\u2019s editor-at-large. \u201cThey all use them. Carrie Fisher used to do it. This one is good, whoever they are.\u201d Lily-Rose Depp, whose parents are Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis, has the genes that mean something like a lace dress over a lace catsuit feels almost unremarkable. Of course, it isn\u2019t \u2013 it has a rock\u2019n\u2019roll, Parisian, Helmut Newton feel that has not found its way to the red carpet anywhere else. We\u2019re into it. According to Screen International Laura Dern commented on the #dernaissance hashtag celebrating her great year thusly: \u201cI\u2019ve heard this pun and I\u2019m liking it. Roles are changing because culture is changing. \u201cPeople say: \u2018You played a couple of powerful women!\u2019 \u2013 because there are a couple of them to play! Women are heads of finance and divorce lawyers and they weren\u2019t 15 years ago. They\u2019re complicated and powerful, and amazing characters to play.\u201d Our Lanre adds that she \u201calso bigged up Rada, and said she worshipped Shakespeare\u201d. How much are the Baftas bellwethers for the Oscars? Well, there\u2019s a 25% crossover in the voters according to film editor Catherine Shoard so films that do well at the Baftas usually do well on Hollywood\u2019s big night. There\u2019s also the magic \u201cmomentum\u201d, which A Star Is Born lost last year and, er, Green Book very much gained. Oscar voting closes on Tuesday so this is the last chance the film companies have to drum up support. Sandy Powell, as the costume designer for The Irishman, knows about innovative fashion. She wore a suit covered in the signatures of luminaries in the film industry, which will be auctioned off after the Oscars in order to raise money for Artfund\u2019s campaign to save Derek Jarman\u2019s Prospect Cottage and create a residency programme there for young artists. So while we\u2019re in a bit of a lull as the actual ceremony takes place, have a look at our film critic Peter Bradshaw\u2019s definitive list of who will win, and who should win, the gongs tonight. No, it wasn\u2019t a dog collar on the Bafta red carpet for Andrew Scott. But Fleabag\u2019s \u201cHot Priest\u201d still stands out from the usual monochrome choice of men at award ceremonies. His green velvet jacket is smart and has a bit of glamour, so it\u2019s a double thumbs up from us \u2013 even without anything ecclesiastical involved. In Sex Education, Gillian Anderson makes a case for wafty robes and wedges. On the red carpet, the actor ups the classic glamour. This strapless black velvet dress is so chic because it is so simple. All that\u2019s needed? Satin red naked sandals and a string of sparkle. It\u2019s all a long way from Moorfield High. A disembodied leg is now a well-known trope of the modern red carpet. Angelina Jolie\u2019s at the Oscars in 2012 is still a meme somewhere on the internet. Naomie Harris\u2019s pose here puts her in the mix too \u2013 and it\u2019s even her right leg, the same as Jolie\u2019s. Her dress, which has the fringing that other actors have worn too, is worth noting as well. \u201cNack all going on here,\u201d says our man in the Albert Hall. I\u2019m getting into the spirit with a warm can of Kronenbourg, which could be a mistake. It\u2019s not often that red carpet dressing makes concessions to the weather. So we applaud Al Pacino, who is nominated for supporting actor for his role in The Irishman, for doing what\u2019s sensible on a February evening in the UK and wearing a coat. Top marks also for his sensible shoes in the form of New Balance trainers. Less practical, though, are the sunnies. Sundown today was 16:53. As Renata Klein in Big Little Lies, Laura Dern makes a case for 21st-century power-dressing, in all its stealth wealth glory. Dern herself has an approach to style which comes with, you might say, less rage and more joy. This frock, in the shade of watermelon, is fresh, glamorous and also somehow nonchalant. Perhaps that is down to the pockets. For spring/summer 2020, sexy necklines with an architectural twist are big. Charlize Theron has brought the look to the red carpet with a dose of fun thanks to the purple. The black nail polish is anything but emo on a look that seems inspired by the severe lines of brutalism. Barbican-chic rendered in Technicolor from the leading actress nominee. Greta Gerwig may have been snubbed in the best director category, with her take on Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women not earning her a place alongside male directors Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes, but she\u2019s come out in a look that oozes old Hollywood glamour. Her sumptuous emerald-green velvet gown is offset with straps made from enough crystals to fill a small Hatton Garden shop. Olivia Colman looks like the kind of woman who knows what she likes when it comes to what she wears \u2013 see chiffon sleeves, florals and understated jewellery. This outfit, with its art nouveau florals and soft poet sleeves is like a sequel to the Prada outfit she wore when winning her Oscar last year. Although not nominated for a Bafta this time around, she is a strong contender for some fashion praise tonight. Big up to MikeMoonlight for this Al Pacino-related gag. She is indeed and looking spiffing. Al Pacino did indeed take a tumble on the red carpet according to this story from the Mirror. Be careful out there, Al! Without the same tradition of red carpet theatrics that womenswear can draw on, menswear has to introduce some drama where it can, even if it\u2019s in hushed tones via a bit of sparkle on a collar. Here the Queen and Slim actor Daniel Kaluuya is giving it some subtle welly with his embellished shirt. For real red carpet menswear pyrotechnics, you can\u2019t do much better than Billy Porter\u2019s motorised fringe hat on the Grammys red carpet last week. Still, hats off to Kaluuya for trying. Drama in the venue \u2013 Al Pacino has fallen over according to this Twitter feed. Jodie Turner-Smith, the star of Queen &amp; Slim, is the latest member of a still surprisingly small club: women who do the red carpet while pregnant. Her floorlength sunshine yellow gown, with its halter bodice, is a classy take. File with Beyonce\u2019s red sequin dress in 2017, Natalie Portman in Prada the same year and \u2013 of course \u2013 Kim Kardashian-West in that much-meme\u2019d floral frock at the Met Ball in 2013. We\u2019re posting a list of Bafta winners as the ceremony progresses. We\u2019re doing this in real time, not from the TV feed. So don\u2019t click if you want to avoid spoilers. Big up to MontoyaFan below the line who is not into Scarlett\u2019s mermaid dress/tattoos combo: That\u2019s definitely the end of the Facebook coverage \u2013 we just had a high tone and what older viewers like myself would call the test card. I\u2019m still watching the Facebook feed. Someone just said: \u201cAre we still live? I\u2019ve had absolutely no communication for the past hour.\u201d A dispatch from our Lanre Bakare, who is in the room where it happens (well, the press pen in the Albert Hall). \u201cHeard more people saying the word on the street is that big Prince Willy is going to say \u2018something\u2019. That \u2018street\u2019 is a room full of bored journalists waiting to be taken into a basement but still \u2026 Excitement is building.\u201d There\u2019s been a lot of speculation about whether the Duchess of Cambridge would rewear an old gown, something she\u2019s done on several occasions. And lo and behold, here is a wardrobe repeat for her: she wore this Alexander McQueen gown to a dinner hosted by Malaysia\u2019s head of state during the diamond jubilee tour, way back in 2012. Quite digging the haiku-style news stories from the BBC. Red carpets of the 00s would have been awash with them, and Saoirse Ronan\u2019s spaghetti straps are nodding to that period\u2019s revival in fashion of late. The actor, nominated for her role as Jo March in Little Women, has polished off the look with earrings that look like an elevated take on the contents of a Skittles bag. Plus: pockets! Because every dress deserves them. Scarlett Johansson is unrecognisable from her roles in both Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story for the Baftas. This is a dress that is ready to party. It\u2019s a bit reminiscent of the one Beyonce wore to the Met Gala in 2011, with the pose out of Rihanna\u2019s playbook - see the popstar\u2019s tribute to Josephine Baker at the CDFA awards in 2014. Both great references and a great dress. So that\u2019s it for a bit. The ceremony starts at 7pm but it\u2019s not on TV until 9pm, so stay tuned for some slightly awkward filler \u2013 I mean sparkling bon mots \u2013 over the next couple of hours. Vick sums up her time on the red carpet meeting Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. \u201cI touched them! I shook their hand!\u201d she says. She didn\u2019t ask them any decent questions, mind, but maybe that\u2019s one for next year. Nominated twice, once for her role in Bombshell and once for Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Margot Robbie has gone for a look that is demure with a capital D. Its long hemline and colour palette take it a million miles from the Fox News \u201clook\u201d of Bombshell or the hippy babydoll dresses of her role in Tarantino\u2019s latest. \u201cShe looks like a real-life mermaid\u201d is the not inaccurate summary of Scarlett\u2019s dress from our friends at Facebook. Scarlett Johansson is wearing an eye-popping dress. The Mail will describe it as barely there. Curves are being flaunted and so are her tattoos. Hats off! Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is nominated for her role as Judy Garland in the biopic Judy. She takes a style leaf out of Garland\u2019s book here - with a dress that feels as midcentury as it does 2020. The off-the-shoulder detail and the lush pink taffeta only add to the mood, while the bracelets on both wrists are unexpectedly Wonder Woman. Hey, whatever works. We\u2019re back on the red carpet with Laura Dern, whose turn as a hard-as-nails lawyer in Marriage Story should surely net her a gong tonight. Nominated for best supporting actress for her role as Amy March in Little Women, Florence Pugh has come in a hot pink and black dress that would make her on-screen character proud. It\u2019s one to arrest the eyeballs on Instagram feeds. The wide silhouette speaks to the current trend for all things Renaissance in fashion, from panniers to pearls \u2013 titled Renaissancecore it has had fashion show front rows doing their best to look like Anne Boleyn. Robert De Niro on the red carpet at his first ever Baftas. What was it like seeing himself de-aged? \u201cI liked it\u201d \u2013 and who wouldn\u2019t? I interviewed Dustin Hoffman a few years ago who told me that he loved the Baftas because, unlike the Oscars, the stars can get pissed while watching it. There\u2019s something brilliantly Buffy the Vampire Slayer about Zazie Beetz\u2019s high-glam vampy red carpet look here, from the burgundy strapless dress to the burgundy lipstick. Plus she\u2019s opted for that most powerful of sartorial moves: the thigh-high slit. The Joker star is not here to mess about. John Boyega looks unrecognisable from his turn as stormtrooper turned good guy in the Star Wars franchise. No desert-coloured survival style here. Instead, this brocade-style red suit is a bold choice and, with a lot of the men on the red carpet still playing it safe with black tuxes, one that we heartily approve of. No wonder he looks pleased with himself. We have an answer to the number of glasses worn by Taron Egerton in Rocketman. Fifty-four. As for \u201csinging singing floor\u201d, that was La La Land ... right. It\u2019s the great John Boyega on the red carpet with Vick Hope. What do the awards mean to him? \u201cA pat on the back\u201d says the former winner of the rising star award. He\u2019s not going to the party after because he\u2019s training for a film called Rebel Ridge. And he\u2019s also wearing a very fancy red jacket. We have an answer to Tintenfische\u2019s query about the Bafta mask, sort of. It was sculpted by Mitzi Cunliffe in 1955. So now you know. George Mackay and Dean-Charles Chapman, the stars of 1917, are on the red carpet. What was it like to film? \u201cMuddy,\u201d they say. 1917 is tipped to sweep the board tonight although the most namechecked film on the red carpet so far has been Parasite. There\u2019s something a bit Vegas lounge singer about Rebel Wilson\u2019s outfit - which makes us like it a lot. Also, if you study this picture for long enough, it looks like Wilson is actually wearing two dresses. And that adds a bit of Balenciaga edge to proceedings. Vick\u2019s on the red carpet with Jonathan Pryce, saying that her mum loves his film The Two Popes. Is she Catholic, asks Jonathan Pryce, somehow implying that it\u2019s only of interest to Catholics. He also had a great time acting with Anthony Hopkins according to the interview. I wonder whether an actor has ever said \u201cI hated every minute with my co-star\u201d? \u201cPlaythings wake up\u201d \u2026 but is playthings one word or two, our hosts want to know? One according to the Guardian style guide. This is some heroic filling our hosts are doing. Having drawn the titles of the nominated films they\u2019re now giving three-word clues. \u201cSinging singing floor\u201d \u2026 is this Rocketman? How many pairs of glasses did Taron Egerton wear in Rocketman? More than 50 according to the Facebook hosts \u2013 who I now know, thanks to Google, are Jack Howard, Nush Cope and Tyler West, with the excellently named Vick Hope on the red carpet. Charlie\u2019s Angel star Ella Balinska has given the red carpet what it wants: a train the size of your Duke of Edinburgh awards sleeping bag. The soft florals are offset with sky-high black stilettos and her hair is pulled back into the A-list\u2019s favourite hairstyle du jour: the high ponytail. Richard E Grant is now on the red carpet. He\u2019s presenting the award for best supporting female actor and hopes it goes to Laura Dern. Joaquin Phoenix said before the award season that he would wear the same Stella McCartney suit to all of the ceremonies he attended. Judging by this picture, it looks as if the Joker star was true to his word. A classic tux that we\u2019ll probably be seeing again this time next week at the Oscars. The hosts on Facebook are now discussing Bafta\u2019s vexed issue of diversity \u2013 36% of the nominees are women according to the hosts on Facebook. While that doesn\u2019t sound impressive, it\u2019s better than last year \u2013 perhaps an example of the glacially slow progress on this issue of Hollywood at large. And it\u2019s a warm welcome to Tintenfische below the line. If you were in any doubt about which fashion decade it is, look to Jessie Buckley\u2019s dress to jog your memory. The Wild Rose star\u2019s monochromatic look is all about the flapper-filled roaring 1920s, complete with feathers and razor-sharp bob. Now we\u2019re with an eccentrically dressed Al Pacino, who\u2019s being asked about the role he\u2019d always like to play. The answer \u2013 Hamlet, although he says that Richard Harris told him that if you don\u2019t play Hamlet when you\u2019re young, you never will. \u201cYou\u2019re still young,\u201d says Vic the host to Pacino, who is 79. Well, buttering up the stars never went amiss. Kaitlyn Dever was just on the red carpet saying that Olivia Wilde, the director of Booksmart, is \u201can alien\u201d (meant complimentary). Now we\u2019re with David Furnish, who is spruiking (as the Australians would say).Rocketman, the biopic of his husband, Elton John. Taron Egerton, he says, \u201cbecame Elton on a molecular level\u201d when playing the star \u2013 blimey. Kaitlyn Dever has been spotted in Miu Miu, Dior and Valentino of late. Here big-potatoes Hollywood stylist Karla Welch has dressed the Booksmart star in a beautiful frock that looks a little like a high-fashion loo roll doll, all lovely frills and float; no Flash bathroom cleaner in sight. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it as a meme \u2013 2020\u2019s highest form of flattery. Monochrome sparkle is a no brainer for winter afterdark dressing - and Emilia Clarke is a pro. This outfit could - feasibly - work for anything from a 40th birthday party to the evening do of a wedding. Wearing it on the red carpet gives Clarke an edge of understated cool. The slicked back hair and twinkly earrings score further points. Asif Kapadia is on the red carpet. He\u2019s nominated for his film about Diego Maradona. He went to art school next door to the Albert Hall, and says he feels like an underdog \u2013 much like Diego\u2019s team Napoli. The segment ends with a handshake so awkward that the hosts are getting another two minutes of material out of it. Ella Balinska, the star of Charlie\u2019s Angels, is on the red carpet now. She\u2019s saying that the films this year are exploring what it means to be human, which is simultaneously a big call and stating the bleedin\u2019 obvious. Meanwhile, there\u2019s a poll on the best plot twist of all time. When we looked at it The Sixth Sense had 100% and the rest were on zero, which strongly implies that a grand total of one person had voted. This might be the Baftas, but Zo\u00eb Kravitz has come as a resplendent Oscars statuette. The look\u2019s a long way from the knitted vests and Beastie Boys tees she wears in the forthcoming High Fidelity series. It\u2019s high-Hollywood glamour transported to a cold, February in South Kensington, complete with a stylishly extreme side-parting. She can do no sartorial wrong. We\u2019re back on the red carpet. Sam Mendes and David Furnish are here, the atmosphere\u2019s electric, the fashion is sustainable, the food is plant based and they\u2019re even recycling the red carpet. Well, according to the hosts anyway. So there\u2019s news from the red carpet coming live and direct on Facebook. At the moment, though, we\u2019re in the studio, where the hosts are drawing their interpretations of the contending films. This could be a long night. New Baftas host Norton celebrates with something of a Christmassy vibe \u2013 red velvet and embroidery worthy of the finest opera coat. With attendees encouraged to be mindful of the planet when choosing their outfits this year, you might speculate that this outfit was found in Norton\u2019s archive. He has now been dressing for the limelight for over 20 years so that wardrobe is bound to have some treasures. The red carpet is already in full swing. This year, guests have been encouraged to opt for more planet-friendly fashion choices by wearing something they already own, renting an outfit, wearing vintage or opting for a designer that produces sustainable clothes, such as Stella McCartney, Mother of Pearl or Bethany Williams. London College of Fashion\u2019s Centre of Sustainability wrote a pamphlet to help celebrities up their sustainability credentials on the red carpet. They offer information on mending and reselling; as well as sustainability heads in the fashion world to follow, such as Aja Barber, Lucy Siegle and Fashion Revolution. Awards season is in full pelt, and tonight it\u2019s the British film industry\u2019s turn for the spotlight. Yes, it\u2019s the Baftas, and the stars are assembling at the Albert Hall in London. Lanre Bakare and Mark Brown are down there \u2013 meanwhile, there\u2019s a crack team in the Guardian office covering it from the TV feed. So a word about that TV feed: you\u2019ll be seeing it two hours after the actual event. To avoid spoilers, we\u2019re going to liveblog along with your viewing pleasure, but you might well see some of those spoilers on social media. It\u2019s a bit of a rum affair, really. Graham Norton will be hosting the show \u2013 Joanna Lumley did it for the previous two years, and got rather a mixed reception for her pains. The Baftas have also come in for quite a bashing for their lack of diversity, so expect some mention of that on stage tonight. Oh, and there\u2019s that little thing called Brexit, too. Join us from now until midnight \u2013 yes, midnight \u2013 for red carpet fashion, trenchant assessments of the winners and losers, and many lame jokes by me. Please get involved in the comments: tweet to me @alexneedham74 or even email me at alex.needham@theguardian.com if you feel that strongly. Let\u2019s go!",

      "bodyText": "The understanding of the novel coronavirus has evolved, with authorities now conceding that person-to-person transmission has occurred outside Hubei \u2013 even in some circumstances where the sick person displayed few or no symptoms. Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus has escalated from suggesting only those in direct contact with the sick should be excluded from school, to warnings in some states that all students returning from China should stay away for a fortnight. The Australian government has fumbled the issue of whether evacuees from China will be charged for flights to Christmas Island \u2013 first insisting they would be, then conceding that was not standard practice. And now Australia has implemented even more extreme measures excluding travellers from mainland China, a measure then copied by New Zealand. So how did the improved understanding of the disease lead to starker warnings? 12 December First case of novel coronavirus is detected in Wuhan, China but is not disclosed for several weeks. 7 January Chinese authorities confirm they have identified the novel virus, named 2019-nCoV. 9 January The first death, of a 61-year-old man from Wuhan is linked to the virus. 20 January Chinese authorities confirm the virus can spread from person-to-person. The novel coronavirus with pandemic potential is added as a listed human disease under the Biosecurity Act of 2015, enabling the use of enhanced border measures in Australia. 21 January Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, explains that \u201cadditional proportionate border measures\u201d are in place, with biosecurity and border security staff to meet passengers from three direct flights a week from Wuhan to Sydney. Passengers are given information and asked to identify themselves if they have symptoms such as fever, with New South Wales health officials to follow-up with passengers suspected of having the virus. Murphy says authorities also worked to identify which of the 160 weekly flights from China were likely to contain travellers from Wuhan. 23 January The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade raises the level of travel advice for Wuhan to level three: \u201creconsider the need to travel\u201d. Flight MU 749 from Wuhan lands at Sydney Airport and is subject to the biosecurity protocols. No ill passengers are found on the flight although Murphy notes that \u201cit is always possible that \u2026 there could be people incubating the virus on that plane today\u201d. Murphy advises that Chinese authorities have stopped transport out of Wuhan city, meaning that flight will be the last direct from Wuhan to Australia, nor will there be transport out of Wuhan to other parts of China. Morrison notes the department of health \u201cdoes not currently recommend mass screening of passengers at airports, including thermal scanning, due to the limited evidence of effectiveness of those measures\u201d. 24 January Dfat raises the level of travel advice for Wuhan and Hubei province in China to level four: \u201cdo not travel\u201d. 25 January The first case of coronavirus in Australia is confirmed \u2013 a man from Wuhan who Murphy says travelled on flight CZ321 from Guangzhou to Melbourne on 19 January. \u201cHe was well when he arrived but developed an illness during the last week and is currently in stable condition under isolation in a hospital in Melbourne,\u201d Murphy says. A further three cases are confirmed in Sydney \u2013 all three men \u2013 one who arrived on 6 January, one on 19 January and one on 20 January. 26 January The federal government provides information to Victorian and NSW authorities to contact passengers from the planes bearing those who later developed symptoms and then tested positive for the virus. Murphy says \u201cit\u2019s likely, because this virus is similar to other coronaviruses, that people aren\u2019t infectious until they have symptoms\u201d. \u201cBut because these two patients developed symptoms within about 24 hours of arrival, we\u2019re being absolutely cautious and contacting those people.\u201d 27 January Murphy confirms a fourth case in NSW, the fifth in Australia.

He confirms that evacuees from China sent to Christmas Island will be charged. Two people with coronavirus are isolated in Gold Coast University Hospital after taking a Tigerairways flight from Melbourne to Coolangatta on Tigerair flight TT566 on January 27. 31 January The World Health Organization declares a public health emergency of international concern over the global outbreak of coronavirus. Murphy says Australia has been \u201cbeen calling for that for some days\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean much for Australia,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are already responding very actively to ensure that we detect and contain any cases of this virus that have been exported here from China.\u201d Scott Morrison insists it is \u201cnot true\u201d that people evacuated during the Arab Spring were not charged, claiming the plan by DFAT to charge for assisted departures is part of \u201cthe standard arrangements\u201d. Health minister Greg Hunt confirms there are nine cases in Australia, all stable, with two NSW patients released after being declared post-viral. 1 February The Australian government announces that foreign arrivals from mainland China will not be allowed entry into Australia. Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family, legal guardians and spouses are excepted from the measure. The government also raised the travel advice warning to level four, recommending that no Australian travel to mainland China. All travellers arriving out of mainland China (not just Hubei Province) after 1 February will be asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they leave mainland China. 2 February The treasurer Josh Frydenberg announces that Australians evacuated from China will not be charged $1,000, blaming DFAT for providing incorrect advice about previous practice. There are now 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia, although a third case in NSW was discharged having cleared the virus. Internationally, there are approximately 14,561 confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV, and 305 deaths have been reported \u2013 a 2.09% fatality rate. 3 February New Zealand follows Australia and eight other countries\u2019 lead \u2013 closing its borders to any foreigners arriving from China \u2013 including those who have passed through in transit.

Let\u2019s get started.</p> \n<p>Sudesh Amman, who stabbed two people on Streatham High Road in London, had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/02/streatham-attacker-was-released-terror-offender-sudesh-amman\">released from jail</a> after serving half of his sentence of more than three years for possessing and distributing extremist material, it has emerged. Amman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/02/streatham-terror-attack-first-witness-accounts\">shot dead outside a Boots</a> on Sunday by police using pistols normally carried by surveillance officers. He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/02/streatham-attacker-police-surveillance-monitored\">under active police surveillance</a> following his release.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"043079a8-c8c4-4418-b86c-cc1ef045e668\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bNZHWr83jZk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three people were taken to south London hospitals. One man\u2019s condition was no longer life-threatening after treatment; a woman with minor injuries was discharged; and another woman had minor injuries believed to be from glass shattered by police gunshots. Amman had previously been noted by police as having a \u201cfascination with dying in the name of terrorism\u201d. He had been jailed aged 18 in December 2018. A Whitehall source claimed that the attack was evidence that Boris Johnson should be able to enact harsher anti-terror laws. \u201cThere was nothing that could be done to keep him behind bars under existing laws, hence why he was under surveillance and strict licensing conditions,\u201d the source said. After an emergency meeting in Downing Street, Johnson said: \u201c[On Monday] we will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>British screen\u2019s night of whites \u2013 </strong>Sam Mendes\u2019s war drama 1917 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/baftas-2020-sam-mendes-and-1917-emerge-victorious-with-seven-awards\">won seven Baftas at last night\u2019s awards</a> including best film and outstanding British film, best director, sound, production design, special visual effects and cinematography.

France replied with interest to Eddie Jones\u2019s pre-match threat as England foundered on Shaun Edwards\u2019 strictly organised defence in their Six Nations opener. Gregor Townsend leapt to the defence of his new captain, Stuart Hogg, after the Scotland full\u2011back lost control of the ball in the act of touching down against Ireland, who won 19-12. Dan Biggar, whose flick through his legs helped Wales to a 42-0 defeat of Italy, has warned that facing Ireland will be far tougher. The women\u2019s Six Nations champions, England, began their 2020 campaign with a pulsating victory in Pau that owed as much to scramble defence as it did to their impressive attacking repertoire. Novak Djokovic says he does not believe he crossed the line when touching the chair umpire during a volatile Australian Open men\u2019s final. By beating Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the women\u2019s final, American Sofia Kenin upstaged her lauded compatriot Coco Gauff and showed a champion\u2019s resolve. And Sonny Bill Williams\u2019s first game of rugby league since 2014 ended in defeat as Toronto Wolfpack lost 28-10 to Castleford at Headingley in the Super League. Business Shares in London are set to open higher this morning despite a turbulent night on the Chinese stock markets. The authorities in Beijing reeled off a series of measures to try to stem the losses, including a cut in bank funding rates, interest payment holidays for companies affected by the virus outbreak and a \u00a3130bn flood of liquidity into the financial system. The pound is on $1.316 and \u20ac1.187. The papers Words like \u201cterror\u201d, \u201cjail\u201d, \u201cfreed\u201d and \u201cearly\u201d are a common thread on today\u2019s front pages. \u201cKnife jihadi freed days earlier\u201d, reports the Express.

The FT has \u201cNissan draws up plans for UK pivot if Brexit leads to EU trade barriers\u201d \u2013 apparently the Japanese carmaker believes this would give its Sunderland-built cars a competitive edge in the British market, over continental imports.

It\u2019s exhausting and it\u2019s not over. </p> <p>Also not over: the #SportsRort affair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/02/scott-morrison-wants-the-sports-rorts-mess-to-be-over-with-mckenzies-exit-it-wont-be\">despite how much the prime minister might want to draw a line under it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bridget McKenzie </strong>may be gone (for now) from the Nationals leadership team and from cabinet (but not from the Senate) but she was given one of the most glowing fall-on-your-sword farewells I have ever heard. And her resignation doesn\u2019t do anything to answer the questions the auditor general\u2019s report raised in the first place. Those questions were allegedly settled by the report on the matter by Morrison\u2019s departmental head (and former chief of staff) <strong>Phil Gaetjens </strong>\u2013 but we aren\u2019t allowed to see that for 20 years or so. So don\u2019t you worry about that, chickens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> has decided now is as good as time as any to shoot his shot \u2013 he\u2019s told anyone who will listen, including the public, that if <strong>Michael McCormack\u2019s</strong> leadership position is thrown open tomorrow, when the Nats will decide on a new deputy leader, he\u2019ll be throwing his ever-present hat into the ring.</p> <p>Under the Nationals rules, just one person can call for a spill. Which means that Joyce can call on the spill himself if he so chooses.</p> <p>The numbers in the Nationals party room have not shifted since Joyce was forced to step down. Which is to say, no one has the numbers. McCormack isn\u2019t exactly what you would call a popular leader but there is no one else who can claim to be, either. So the 21-strong party room is split on ... no one.</p> <p>Fun times for the country, given that under the Coalition agreement, the leader of the Nats is also the deputy prime minister. And acting prime minister if, you know, the PM decides to take off to Hawaii or something for a short break.</p> <p>We\u2019ll bring you all the day\u2019s events as they come to hand. Parliament doesn\u2019t actually sit until tomorrow but we all know the real action in this place is in the hallways anyway.</p> <p>You have <strong>Mike Bowers </strong>who HAS NOT STOPPED this summer, as well as <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>,<strong> Sarah Martin </strong>and<strong> Paul Karp</strong>. And you have what is left of me, which, with only one coffee this morning, is about four brain cells and 10 fingers. Six of which work.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWith due respect, there will be a spill, and I will be standing. The prime minister talks about the quiet Australians, our job is to represent the near invisible Australians,\u201d Barnaby Joyce says. \u201c... We\u2019ve got to make sure that we are not a shadow of another party, that we speak with our own voice.\u201d Looks like he was caught just outside the parliament for that one. So, once again \u2013 the spill is on. Joyce isn\u2019t saying if he has the numbers, but he is not not saying that either. This is new territory for the Nationals \u2013 they do not usually do their leadership spills this way. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll see you tomorrow, bright and early. Wait \u2013 just a quick addendum \u2013 Barnaby Joyce is on Sky News. He says he has told Michael McCormack he will be challenging tomorrow \u2013 he phoned him this afternoon to let him know. The spill will be moved and seconded. He says his pitch to his colleagues is the Nationals need to \u201csurvive and thrive\u201d as a party. \u201cWe are under threat from all sides,\u201d he says. On the numbers, Joyce won\u2019t say what he thinks his chances are. \u201cBut this is serious,\u201d he says. And on that note, we are going to wrap up the blog for this evening \u2013 don\u2019t worry though, we will be back tomorrow morning bright and early, ready to cover whatever else this messy diva of a 2020 parliamentary year decides to throw at us. Just a reminder \u2013 it is not even day one yet. That\u2019s tomorrow. And yet we have two leadership spills on our hands. What a great start to the year of the rat. So while we take a breath ahead of that \u2013 a very big thank you to Mike Bowers, who is still out there working, and to Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp and the rest of the Guardian brains trust for all they do and continue to do. I\u2019ll also be back bright and early tomorrow morning to cover all the insanity. Thanks for joining us today. We hope to see you again. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Who could second the spill? Well, George Christensen is the obvious candidate. Not that he would tell us. But he has been very quiet today. David Littleproud has also been quiet, and it is not exactly a secret that he hasn\u2019t had the easiest time of it under Michael McCormack\u2019s leadership \u2013 he lost agriculture, and was effectively sidelined, until the bushfires happened. Don\u2019t rule out David Gillespie, who didn\u2019t give what you would call a glowing recommendation of McCormack today. And Bridget McKenzie herself could be a dark horse. Right, so I have confirmed Lucy Barbour\u2019s report (not that she is ever wrong, but journalism rules are rules) and yes, there will be a spill called tomorrow. Llew O\u2019Brien says he will call on the spill. Allegedly, there is a seconder, but he won\u2019t say who. Which, if that stands up, means Michael McCormack\u2019s position will be thrown open. Barnaby Joyce will be putting his hand up. It is always, always the Queenslanders. It was always going to be Llew. Someone still has to second it though. And then the numbers get laid bare. Just reading over the chief Nationals whip Damian Drum\u2019s interview with Patricia Karvelas again \u2013 really enjoying hearing a Coalition MP argue against merit. Given that, you know, it is allegedly the only thing taken into account in preselections and ministerial spots. Streem, a media monitoring company, have taken a look at recognition of Greens MPs ahead of the party\u2019s leadership vote tomorrow \u2013 Adam Bandt, the frontrunner for the job, is also the best-known MP. And just in case it wasn\u2019t clear the first two times, Damian Drum has a third go of explaining how the sports grants program was biased towards seats the Coalition wanted to win, while chatting to the ABC: It might have been used, you may be right, it may have been used not so much marginal seats but trying to maximise the performance at the last election. If Bridget did that ... she\u2019s probably guilty of making the same mistake, that every government has made ever since the federation has been enacted. And, as I said in earlier interviews, I was in the Victorian government and the Victorian parliament for 14 years. We now know in Victoria, we have had Labor party who have been spending their money recklessly in only Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong, calling that regional investment. Damian Drum once again admits the sports grants program was pork barrelling: Firstly, I think Bridget has done a fantastic job. She has been criticised for her role as sports minister, fair enough, she has borne the brunt of using I suppose ministerial discretion to the maximum, she has been criticised fiercely for that \u2026 Bridget has been seen to not have her ministerial details up to scratch. The fact she was a member of a shooting club, didn\u2019t disclose that on time. Used to discretion probably too much. She has borne the brunt and taken the cost of all of that, she has paid a very heavy price. A very smart hard-working and tenacious minister has paid the ultimate price*. She will go to the backbench for doing that. I think, you would acknowledge, that worse things have happened that have been swept under carpets. * Let\u2019s just calm our farms here. She hasn\u2019t died in service of her country. She\u2019s been sent to the backbench for a bit. And then we get some more on that, after Patricia Karvelas asks Damian Drum to expand: Because a bureaucrat doesn\u2019t understand the communities. A bureaucrat doesn\u2019t understand one particular project may have an enormous amount of community in-kind support, a minister who has been there on site would understand that. I have been in this position as sports minister for the state of Victoria; I\u2019ve seen the differences from projects to other projects. We may have a project that is from a very high, affluent community up against, that might rank well in terms of usage and patronage and cash they have available to contribute but they may not be as worthy as a smaller community with tremendous support. It will have all these volunteers and club members put their own hard work into it and hard-earned money into a project. It\u2019s only a minister that can have that wideness of knowledge. Damian Drum: We want a government that has ministers that lead their departments. We don\u2019t want to have a government where a department, faceless bureaucrats, lead the ministers. Damian Drum says no one will call a spill for the Nationals leadership tomorrow because he knows that Michael McCormack has \u201cvery strong support\u201d. But he hasn\u2019t made \u201ca single phone call\u201d. He just knows. The Coalition has gotten itself in a spot of bother by politicising grant schemes. So it was a bit of a surprise to see Alan Tudge, the population minister, just tweet out a promo for a multicultural grants scheme with the Liberal party\u2019s logo plastered all over it. That would, of course, be a grant scheme funded by commonwealth money, not the Liberal party\u2019s money. Thankfully, keen-eyed Twitter users have taken him to task. Damian Drum will be on Afternoon Briefing on the ABC this afternoon. Drum, for those who are asking, is a longtime Nationals MP who has a habit of loudly talking about the way things should be. He\u2019s also the party whip. The prime minister and opposition leader are both headed to the War Memorial for the traditional Last Post ceremony before parliament begins. Tomorrow morning they will both head to church. Tuesday will be entirely dedicated to the bushfires, so we won\u2019t have parliament, parliament, until Wednesday. Michelle Landry on why we are talking about Michael McCormack being replaced (AGAIN) to the ABC: Politics is a very volatile business and people always want positions of leadership. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about, it\u2019s about other people wanting positions of leadership. If there\u2019s a spill tomorrow \u2013 and I don\u2019t believe there will be \u2013it\u2019s up to the party room to decide who they want as their leader. At this stage the only position that is open is for the deputy leader and I believe that\u2019s how it should remain. And what (other than developing a personality) could McCormack do to calm down the agitators? Look, I think they probably want him to be out in the media spotlight more. Michael is certainly out there quite a bit but I think that he probably needs to talk to the agitators, to see what they actually expect of him. Probably just that he does his job, but I am not a Nationals MP, so what do I know. I spoke to the Australian Medical Association, Equality Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission last week about the second draft of the religious discrimination bill. Many of their concerns aired about the first bill remain, and in some respects the new bill is worse. Today the Australian Industry Group has reiterated its concerns. According to the chief executive, Innes Willox: \u201cSignificant aspects of the bill are problematic for Australian employers and workplaces.\u201d He said: The second exposure draft ... would still impose unreasonable restrictions on businesses and would give employees a very wide ability to argue that they should not have to comply with reasonable company policies. Businesses\u2019 main concern is the statement of religious belief provisions in subsection 8(3) \u2013 the so-called Israel Folau clause that bans employers from setting codes of conduct that would restrict employees\u2019 religious speech unless it is necessary \u201cto avoid unjustifiable financial hardship\u201d. Willox warned the provision would likely: \u201cUnfairly restrict the legitimate and necessary operating policies and procedures of businesses, including in circumstances where such policies are needed to manage obligations under current employment laws\u201d; \u201cReduce tolerance for religious diversity in workplaces by protecting a broad range of statements of belief about religion and/or other religions, including statements that cause offence\u201d; and \u201cLead to increased workplace grievances that are unable to be resolved by employers, but which nonetheless impact an employer\u2019s business\u201d. Employers want the provision removed, or a new defence for complying with existing laws (such as workplace health and safety laws requiring a safe workplace). Michelle Landry is now on the ABC. We are really ticking the Nationals off today (still haven\u2019t heard from David Littleproud though \u2013 probably because he\u2019s busy making phone calls). Landry is asked whether she believes there will be a spill tomorrow for the leadership position. Look, not from what I\u2019m hearing. I don\u2019t believe so. I believe that the only position that is vacant is the deputy position. Asked if she will vote for a spill, if it comes up \u2013 she says no. I would vote against it. I believe that Michael McCormack is doing a very good job. I mean, every leader is different in how they do things. And Michael certainly is out there working his butt off right across this country and I think we\u2019re just focused on that deputy position andI don\u2019t believe there should be a spill tomorrow. Darren Chester\u2019s whole quote after being asked whether Michael McCormack\u2019s position is safe: Absolutely. There is no vacancy and this is not how the National party does business anyway. The trigger against the National party leadership is the election. We had an election, we did very well, we held on to all our lower house seats. Michael continued in the leadership role and he has my strong support and I think he has the overwhelming support of the party room. We don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 do it this way we have trigger events being elections, we don\u2019t try to roll people halfway through a term. He is doing a very difficult job very very well. I know he doesn\u2019t get a lot of credit for it but from from the colleagues I speak to they comfortable with the fact that worked his guts out for regional Australia and we back him, we support him, and we can get back to the issues that matter in regional Australia And here are his portraits of Bridget McKenzie. Mike Bowers has been very busy today. Adelaide\u2019s InDaily has written up an interesting story on the factional fallout from Cory Bernardi\u2019s resignation from the Senate \u2013 he had won the seat as a Liberal, so it reverted back to the party when he quit, even though he was an independent. (Thanks to Sarah Martin for the tip.) The state Liberals\u2019 conservative faction could be set to formally splinter amid rancour from the weekend\u2019s \u201cepic defeat\u201d for the party\u2019s hard Right, which saw moderate-backed MLC Andrew McLachlan snatch an emphatic win in the race for Cory Bernardi\u2019s vacated senate seat ... \u201cBut the bloodletting is set to continue, spilling over into the forthcoming contest for the SA Liberals\u2019 state Upper House ticket, with nominations to close on Wednesday this week. The senate race opened deep divisions within the party, with one senior source declaring the result an \u201cepic defeat for the hard Right\u201d, who \u201cmassively overreached\u201d in their push to install Morry Bailes as their candidate. The defeat was made more bitter coming just months after the Right effectively won control of the state party, winning every vice-presidential position at last year\u2019s Liberal AGM \u2013 with Bailes at the top of the ticket. You can read more here. (Side note: InDaily is setting up in Queensland and the reporter roster looks excellent, so keep an eye out for that.) \u201cOne person\u2019s pork barrel is another person\u2019s legitimate project,\u201d says Darren Chester, who saw a roller derby application, which was rated as 98% eligible for a grant by Sports Australia, miss out under the grants issued by Bridget McKenzie, in his own electorate. Darren Chester also says that Micheal McCormack is \u201cabsolutely\u201d safe as the Nationals leader. Chester says it is a \u201cmyth\u201d that McCormack isn\u2019t advocating strongly enough for the party. Darren Chester says he won\u2019t be going for the deputy leadership. Which all but sews it up for David Littleproud. Now we have Darren Chester popping up on Sky News. If you\u2019re a Nat who hasn\u2019t appeared on TV today, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Come on, guys. You only get these spills once, twice, maybe five times a year. Take your shot, peeps. Damian Drum thinks that all the Nationals problems have been driven by the media \u2013 Barnaby Joyce included. I think this one has been largely driven by media. I think Barnaby Joyce, you know, his problem was largely driven by media. But that\u2019s OK. We all understand the rules. And when the media has fixated on a particular minister \u2026 all\u2019s fair in love and war. On whether or not Damian Drum thinks it is OK, given that he just said it happens and both sides do it, the Victorian MP says: It\u2019s a really tough one. And it\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not right that we have government bias in spending. But it\u2019s such a hardened part of the political landscape. It\u2019s a bit rich for you to all of a sudden, to just pick this one grand scheme, this one grant program and effectively go after Bridget the way you did. I understand why. And I understand there was a scathing report. I just find it a little bit hypocritical, when we forget about everything else ... The media seem to think it\u2019s OK for the Labor party to, you know, just squirrel money into the projects in its electorates, and thinks it\u2019s not OK for the Coalition to do the same, or [give] a fraction, an absolute fraction of those pennies. Damian Drum goes on to say that he doesn\u2019t see a problem with how the grants were awarded either, and gives us an actual honest answer on what the program was about. I don\u2019t think bias in government spending is anything new. So where has been the media\u2019s frenzy on the state Labor party in Victoria, just with its incredible bias towards its own seats? ... So why do you all of a sudden pick one area of government spending and go crazy about it \u2013 the three weeks \u2013 when it goes on every day, in every state jurisdiction, for ever and eternity? So why do you pick this one? ... All I am saying is this is a standard practice of government. And it\u2019s been going on for [as long as] I\u2019ve been parliament, for 20 years, [in] state and federal parliaments \u2013 and it makes you sick when you see a Labor party just refuse to spend money in regional Australia, but you put up with it and you know it, you know, it\u2019s so, so true. And so much a part of everyday politics. The Labor party in Victoria refused to spend money in the regions unless they have members in those seats. So you put up with it and it goes the other way, a little bit the other way, and the media go crazy. Damian Drum also doesn\u2019t believe Bridget McKenzie did anything wrong. In fact, she thinks she resigned because of the media. I think you guys had a bit more to do with that than Bridget being a member of a shooting club. There was an unbelievable frenzy by the media to go after Bridget. On the point that the auditor general criticised the program: The most important aspect about all of this is that the minimum ministers must be accountable for their decisions, not bureaucrats, not departmental people. And in this case, not Sport Australia. It\u2019s up to the minister to make the final decisions. She made those decisions, she\u2019s accountable for them. And she should be held to account for all the decisions that were made. Did she do anything wrong? In my opinion, not really. (The auditor general has questioned whether or not McKenzie did have the legal authority to make those decisions.) Damian Drum on Barnaby Joyce running for the National party leadership: Well, I don\u2019t think Barnaby would do that, if he doesn\u2019t have the numbers and I don\u2019t think he has the numbers, so I don\u2019t think it will happen. That\u2019s as straight up and as long as I can be. I think there\u2019s so much support in the room for Michael [McCormack]. I think that that position just will \u2026 that won\u2019t be an issue. The National party has a fantastic role to play within regional Australia and we need to replace Bridget now. Find the best deputy. You know, put the best people in cabinet and make sure that the Liberals, and regional Australia, know who\u2019s out there supporting regional Australia. Is Joyce a destabilising presence? I don\u2019t think so. I mean, I love Barnaby. I think he\u2019s such an amazing asset for the Nationals, and such an amazing asset for regional Australia. So, you know, he has aspirations for the top job.[But] the top job\u2019s not available at the moment, because we\u2019ve got a fantastic leader in that position at the moment. So it\u2019s a little bit like watching Mum and Dad have a fight. So you\u2019d rather not go for one, but that\u2019s the way it is. Thanks to our friends at SBS, we have just listened to that whole interview Damian Drum gave at the airport and oh boy. I\u2019ll bring you some excerpts as soon as I finish transcribing/retrieving my eyeballs from where they have rolled down the hallway. Excuse the small break in posts there \u2013 I was having slight internet problems. Back on deck now. Speaking to Sky News, the constitutional expert Anne Twomey says it is a \u201ccomplete mystery how the commonwealth has come to this conclusion\u201d in regards to there being a broad executive power to direct a corporate entity (in this case, Sports Australia). Catherine King has released a statement on her request to the auditor general. She says she asked for the audit after Channel Nine reported that 156 of 166 projects which received grants under round three of the building better regions infrastructure fund were Coalition seats or Coalition-targeted seats. Michael McCormack\u2019s cash splash saw $185 million funnelled into projects to support Coalition MPs or candidates at the election out of a possible $197 million. Coalition seats or Coalition targets received 94 percent of projects and 94 percent of funds. Only 10 projects were awarded to five safe Labor or Independent seats, worth $12 million. 23 eligible regional and outer-urban seats held by the Labor Party at the election missed out completely. 13 eligible Coalition seats and one eligible Independent seat failed to secure a project \u2026 I have asked the auditor general to take a thorough look at what clearly appears to be another Morrison government rort. The auditor general indicated he will consider an audit as a part of his 2020-21 work plan. Labor wants the auditor general to take a look at another Coalition grants program. Can\u2019t decide if they are investigating Angus Taylor yet or not, but can make jokes about the Super Bowl half-time show: I can answer this one for them \u2013 it\u2019s not in their jurisdiction. For the record, it is still very unclear over whether or not Bridget McKenzie had the legal authority to make the decisions she did. We\u2019ve been told that it has been fine \u2013 but in reports and advice no one is allowed to see in full. You may remember that Christian Porter once tried to give the solicitor general\u2019s legal advice to the parliament without tabling it \u2013 he said the legal advice was the medevac bill was unconstitutional. Tony Smith made him table it and the whole advice found that, yes, there was an element of the bill which was unconstitutional (because it originated in the Senate, the pay for the independent health panel wasn\u2019t allowed) but that there was an easy fix. Just take out the bit about renumeration. Which was done. Which is why a lot of people want to see the whole report and the whole advice. It\u2019s like if I read out the parts of my report cards which said how much potential I had, without reading the next part about being easily distracted and a distraction to others. Bridget McKenzie leaves after this exchange: Q: Do you think there are others in the government who need to take responsibility for their role in this scheme? McKenzie: I\u2019m the minister responsible. That\u2019s what the Westminster system is all about. I had ministerial discretion. It was used appropriately. Q: The prime minister wasn\u2019t involved? McKenzie: We have 684 programs funded across the country delivering great results. Bridget McKenzie on her resignation: I took that step because I accept that my failure to declare my membership to certain sports shooting clubs in a timely manner constituted a breach of the ministerial standards and that is something I take very, very seriously. I do not accept that those memberships were a conflict of interest, I received no personal benefit, they did not inform my decision making at all. I am very proud of a program by this government to fund 684 local sports clubs around the country to get Australians more active, and it was a good thing. The Prime Minister and Cabinet\u2019s report confirms that ministerial discretion was exercised in an appropriate manner, that there was no political bias in my decision making. It\u2019s been an immense honour and privilege to have served the Australian people as a National party minister in two Coalition governments. To have been part of a leadership team that delivered a surprising and iconic victory last May, and an immense honour to be our nation\u2019s very first female agriculture minister. A lot of unfinished work there and I hope I won\u2019t be the last. Nearly a decade ago I came into the Senate to serve the needs and interests of rural and regional Australians, to champion them, in parliament, and to make a difference to their life. I plan to continue to do that. And she\u2019s out. Bridget McKenzie walks away after three or so questions. On the issue of Barnaby Joyce, Bridget McKenzie says she won\u2019t talk to the media about any potential spill of the leadership. Bridget McKenzie is now speaking. She says she accepts that her failure to declare her membership to \u201ccertain\u201d sporting clubs in a timely matter was something she should have done, and she therefore resigned. But she does not accept that there was a conflict of interest. On the sports grant program, she says it was \u201ca good thing\u201d because clubs were funded. McKenzie calls the Coalition\u2019s win last May \u201csurprising and iconic\u201d. Beyonc\u00e9 is iconic. Winning an election \u2013 less so. Because 2020 has seemingly decided that it wants to rival 2019 for bizarre and unnecessary actions, Joe Hockey is topless on Instagram, giving an update on the Iowa caucus from an Australian beach. And then ... Adam Bandt confirms he will be standing for the Greens leadership. Marise Payne says the government has been able to assist 243 Australians who were in Wuhan, where the coronavirus is believed to have originated. Bridget McKenzie will now make a statement at 12.30. Because you know, the Nationals had just moved off the national media stage, so why not. Marise Payne, the foreign minister, will hold a press conference at 12.15. She will be updating on the coronavirus situation. There are rumours of a co-leader scenario for the Greens moving forward (I mean, hey \u2013 the Brisbane Lions did it) but we will all find out by tomorrow. Richard Di Natale: I\u2019ve been in this gig 10 years, I\u2019ve seen half a dozen prime ministers come and go, I\u2019ve seen political chaos and turmoil all around us. We had our challenges but we have been the most stable and enduring political force in our parliament and we are growing. We are going from strength to strength and I feel very confident in my future for the Greens. It\u2019s going to be a decision to the party room. It\u2019s probably worth me letting you know. We have a party meeting in 24 hours so we expect there will be a ballot on who nominates tomorrow morning. As for me, look, [I won\u2019t] hang around the parliament [like a bad smell]. I can\u2019t believe we have some of these jokers hanging around causing problems for future leaders the best thing you can do once you\u2019ve made a decision to resign is to leave your phone number with the person who follows you and let them know you are always there, should they need your advice but only if they want your advice. So I\u2019m going to resign as a senator, once my replacement is chosen, and I expect that will happen at some point towards the middle of the year. Richard Di Natale is saying thank you to his party\u2019s supporters but that it is time for him to move on. For some reason, that will most likely never become clear, Malcolm Roberts is hosting a movie premiere in Parliament House at the end of the month: Senator Malcolm Roberts invites you to the AUSTRALIAN PREMIERE of Dark Waters Date: Wed 26 Feb 2020 Time: 7.30pm Location: APH Theatre Dark Waters is based on this article. Well if Damian Drum doesn\u2019t think Bridget McKenzie did anything wrong, obviously everything is completely hunky dory and what are we even doing here? The Australian Conservation Foundation has done some number crunching on the AEC disclosures and found: The fossil fuel industry directly donated more than $85.7m to Australian political parties in the 2018-19 financial year, highlighting the need for serious reform of the political donations system. The political party returns for 2018-19, released today, reveal: The biggest fossil fuel donor was Clive Palmer\u2019s Mineralogy, which donated $83,681,442 to Palmer\u2019s United Australia party. The biggest donor to the major parties was the gas company Woodside, which donated $135,400 to Labor and 147,940 to the Liberal-National Coalition. The fossil fuel industry in total donated $85,719,747 to Australian political parties. Excluding donations to the United Australia party, fossil fuel industry donations totalled $1,894,024. The top three fossil fuel industry donors, excluding Clive Palmer-linked companies, were Woodside, Adani (through Adani Mining and the Carmichael Rail Network Trust) and the gas industry lobby group Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA). These donated a total of $692,299. Which party was the big fossil fuel winner? The Coalition received the most from fossil fuel industries, receiving a total of $1,147,376. Labor received $725,448 in donations from fossil fuel industries. Woodside was the largest fossil fuel donor to the Liberal party, donating $137,750. Woodside was the largest fossil fuel donor to Labor, donating $135,400. Adani (through Adani Mining and the Carmichael Rail Network Trust) was the biggest donor to the Nationals, donating $121,800. And Labor won\u2019t be dropping the sports grants saga either. On whether the Phil Gaetjens report should be released, Anthony Albanese says: Of course they should release the Gaetjens report. Once again this government pretends it has precedents that it just ignores. Whether it is a precedent about notifying who\u2019s actually running the country as acting prime minister, whether it\u2019s a precedent that they had two positions on yesterday morning in an hour over whether people would have to pay for the flight from Wuhan, or whether it be this precedent. It\u2019s very clear that there needs to be the report released. Because it\u2019s just a farce. The existing provisions for grants mean that when there is a change and ministerial intervention, they have to notify the reasons to the Department of Finance. They have to go through various procedures of transparency that are there now that have been ignored. Phil Gaetjens, if he doesn\u2019t know that, then I don\u2019t know how he has got the job as the head of Prime Minister and Cabinet. It\u2019s quite farcical, this whole exercise. Anthony Albanese held a press conference in the midst of all that. He had a few things to say about Barnaby Joyce\u2019s hope of political reincarnation: Look, this is a Coalition that\u2019s in chaos. They have no plan for the economy. They had no plan to deal with the bushfire crisis. They have a plan just about themselves. And that\u2019s what the sports rorts saga showed. All about themselves, not about the national interest. And the idea that they are contemplating bringing Barnaby Joyce back as the deputy prime minister just shows how low they have sunk. They have a choice between various people who\u2019ve been discredited in the past but then again, you\u2019ve had Stuart Robert brought back, you\u2019ve had Sussan Ley brought back and, of course, Bridget McKenzie, I\u2019m sure has been given a nod and a wink. If she goes quietly, she\u2019ll be brought back sometime in the future. So, it\u2019s quite bizarre that Barnaby Joyce could be considered to be a future deputy prime minister as well as one who\u2019s a past deputy prime minister. Can I say that, as a former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce\u2019s presence there has devalued the currency. And I don\u2019t want to see that happen again. And Richard Di Natale\u2019s statement: It has been a privilege and an honour to lead the Australian Greens in the federal parliament for the past four years, fighting every day for the values that millions of Australians care so deeply about. But leading a political party is a tough, demanding job so after nearly a decade as a senator \u2013 half that time as leader \u2013 I have decided to step aside as parliamentary leader of the Australian Greens. Before I became one of them, I thought that politicians who said they want to \u2018spend more time with their family\u2019 were guilty of using one of the biggest cliches in politics. As it turns out, in some cases it\u2019s true. My boys are nine and 11 years old and they have only ever known their dad as a busy, tired and sometimes grumpy politician. As they grow up quickly to become young men, I want to spend more time by their side than a relentless political schedule allows. Looking back on the last decade in parliament, there are so many things I am proud of. The carbon price we negotiated in 2010 with the Gillard government, which showed what can be accomplished when political parties work together for a common goal; the much-needed royal commissions into the banking and disability sectors; and, of course, the historic vote to achieve marriage equality. As for what comes next for the Greens, I have great confidence in the intelligence, compassion and courage of every one of my parliamentary colleagues. But the success of our party and cause has never and will never depend upon one person. Our party will succeed because we are part of a much broader community movement, a movement that is growing stronger each day. I don\u2019t know what comes next for me but I intend to continue to make a positive contribution to the issues about which I have been so passionate for my entire adult life: Green politics, climate change, health, issues affecting First Nations people and tackling inequality. So many Australians are making it clear that they want urgent climate action and, as a Greens MP, I am proud to have represented them in our parliament. I will be ending my time as leader filled with optimism about the future, buoyed by the millions of young people who I marched alongside during the student climate strike in Melbourne last year. The future of progressive politics is in the parliament and in the streets, and I am filled with confidence about the direction that each is heading. Richard Di Natale will hold his media conference at 11.45am in Canberra. Here is who is attending: Greens senator for Victoria Dr Richard Di Natale Greens member for Melbourne Adam Bandt MP Greens senator for Queensland Larissa Waters So the 2020 parliamentary year hasn\u2019t officially started yet and we have two minor parties spilling leadership positions. I mean, it\u2019s been a while since we had a leadership battle, so why not have two? Richard Di Natale told his colleagues this morning in a surprise meeting (to more than just his colleagues) but he will stay in the Senate until his replacement is determined \u2013 and that could be months. But the Greens leadership positions are all open. For the record, it was the SMH and Age reporter Judith Ireland who first reported that this morning. On the Phil Gaetjens report, which found there was no problem with the administration of the sports grants (in contradiction to the independent auditor report), David Gillespie tells Sky: The inner workings of the PMO generally remain in PMO and I probably won\u2019t ever see that report, but the prime minister has spoken about it. And that\u2019s the outcome \u2026 I think it\u2019s important that PMO has the confidence that its discussions, deliberations, remain with them as long as \u2026 and they will release what they want to release. But it is with regards to the [report], they will release what they want to release. We have confirmed it \u2013 but are working on getting more details for you. The health minister, Greg Hunt, lobbied his cabinet colleague Michael Sukkar to include gender and sexuality questions in the census \u2013 despite the assistant treasurer\u2019s intervention to have the politically sensitive questions dumped from the census test. In a letter to the Victorian equality minister, Martin Foley, earlier in January, Hunt revealed he had written to the assistant treasurer in support of the inclusion of questions that would \u201cgreatly inform the government\u2019s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census\u201d. Hunt\u2019s support for the questions is significant as it is the first sign of division at the cabinet level as to whether to ask Australians their gender and sexuality in the upcoming census. Gender and sexuality questions were among eight potential new topics identified by consultation in 2018 and were set to be included in a census test late last year. In October Guardian Australia revealed that the Australian Bureau of Statistics had dumped the questions from the test after intervention from the assistant treasurer\u2019s office, prompting a backlash from stakeholders including the LGBTI Health Alliance. Would David Gillespie support a spill motion for the leader\u2019s position? He tells Tom Connell, who he has just spent 10 minutes talking to, on air, about internal party matters, that he can\u2019t talk about internal party matters. Look, if you don\u2019t talk about anything like that \u2013 that is quite inappropriate to be talking about anything, internal party stuff. Anything that I do in the party room stays in the party room. I am sure you would love to get a comment, but I won\u2019t be able to comment. Connell asks if he supports Michael McCormack. Look, at the moment, Tom, that isn\u2019t the conversation. The conversation is the deputy leadership position and I\u2019ll be having plenty of conversations with my colleagues, but that will remain private. Well, Gillespie has said he believes he is the man to get the Nationals more broadly on the national consciousness and so far he is managing quite well, but maybe not for the reasons he thinks. Asked flat out by Sky\u2019s Tom Connell if he is saying that Michael McCormack hasn\u2019t been doing a very good job, David Gillespie says: Well look, the media space is very well known, my thoughts on this. You don\u2019t need to be Sherlock Holmes to work out what I am saying. It is common that I have said that in the past \u2026 At the moment, that isn\u2019t what my conversations are at the moment. My conversations with my colleagues are about whether they would support me for the leadership role and I will continue to that. Who would be a better leader of the National party? That is hypothetical at the moment. Michael is our leader and the deputy leadership position is up for decision and that is what I am focusing on. Would he support a spill of the leadership? That is hypothetical, at the moment, Tom. Yes it is, Dr Gillespie. It\u2019s all hypothetical. Including your own bid for deputy leader. But Barnaby Joyce isn\u2019t on his agenda, he says. His agenda is solely the deputy leader. Who, you know, has to serve under a leader. And so far he has said the current leader isn\u2019t exactly doing a bang-up job. So hypothetically, if Gillespie were the deputy leader, who would be his choice for leader? I\u2019d serve under any leader ... I would serve under anyone. And at the moment our leader is Michael McCormack, that is what is in front of me. And one of the strengths I bring to the role is I get on with everyone in the party room. I get on with our Liberal colleagues, who are the senior partners in our Coalition. I have a track record of being able to work with the bureaucracy and the media, which is a good compendium of skills, if you want someone in your leadership to get out there and argue the case. David Gillespie to Tom Connell on Sky News a little earlier: Well, we\u2019re all making calls and having discussions amongst ourselves which will remain private but I can say, Tom, that regional Australia is crying out for more transparent vocal representatives in the leadership role and that\u2019s what I am very happy to do \u2026 I have some, 18 months ago, I did speak to my leader about upping the ante in the media space and this is my opportunity to help. If I do get the nod of my colleagues I\u2019ll try and get a much more vocal presence, not just in the building, but in the conversation around the nation. Connell asks whether McCormack promised to be more vocal. Gillespie: Well, yeah, he made the commitment to do that, but the opportunity for me to step up is now, and that\u2019s why I put my hand up. So did McCormack fail, in Gillespie\u2019s view, asks Connell? Well, look, other people have been very prominent in the media, as you know. And Michael does a lot of media in the bush. But when you\u2019re in the leadership ... I\u2019d still like him to do more in the national space. People in my area want to see their leaders out about. We have been through the biggest bush crisis that we should see for generations with the bushfires. We\u2019ve got the drought, and we have had ministers out there. But I would have taken a slightly different tack and if I was in a leadership position, being able to be a bit more prominent. David Gillespie, who is speaking to Sky purely about internal party matters \u2013 his desire for the Nationals deputy leadership \u2013 says he is not going to talk about internal party stuff when it comes to Michael McCormack\u2019s leadership. David Gillespie is making his pitch for the deputy leadership of the Nationals by saying he has not been impressed by the Nationals leadership lately \u2013 and that he even had a chat to Michael McCormack about it. But he won\u2019t say whether or not he thinks McCormack should go. \u201cAt the moment our leader is Michael McCormack,\u201d he tells Sky. \u201cThat is what is front of me. And one of my strengths is I get on with everyone in the party room.\u201d David Gillespie is on Sky talking about why he is the best option for the Nationals deputy leadership. The biggest scandal though, is his shirt (blue, yellow and red checked) and tie (green, yellow crosses (?)) combo. The Australian Electoral Commission\u2019s donations disclosures reveal that the Liberal party received a $4.1m donation before the 2019 election, one of the largest donations in political history, dwarfing the former leader Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s $1.75m gift before the 2016 election. The donation was made in multiple instalments by Sugolena Pty Ltd, a company linked to the philanthropist Isaac Wakil, who made his fortune in the clothing industry and invested heavily in property around the Sydney suburb of Pyrmont. Together with his wife, Susan, Wakil owned a property portfolio worth $200m which the couple began to sell off in 2014 to fund their charitable foundation. Susan Wakil died in 2018. The couple\u2019s philanthropy has included a $35m donation to the University of Sydney and $20m to the Art Gallery of New South Wales\u2019 planned Sydney Modern wing \u2013 both the largest donations in those organisations\u2019 history. Just on the \u201cBridget McKenzie was a great servant of regional Australia\u201d line Michael McCormack trotted out: a reminder that the Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby \u2013 which sits in Darren Chester\u2019s Nationals seat and scored a 98% eligibility rating for a grant from Sports Australia \u2013 missed out on its $44,909 funding request, while much lower-rated applications, in more marginal seats, were granted funds. Why am I annoyed at that? Because the Nationals represent some of the poorest electorates in this country and money for a community project, which we know helps to band people together and keep spirits high, was diverted for purely political reasons. Giving those clubs the money they missed out on, in another grants funding round (as has been widely hinted at by the prime minister) does not solve the problem. AAP has an update on the Qantas plane arriving in Wuhan to evacuate Australians: The volunteer Qantas crew manning the Boeing 747 that will fly stranded Australians out of the Chinese city of Wuhan are ready \u201cto get this done\u201d, the airline\u2019s CEO says. More than 200 citizens and permanent residents will soon be airlifted from the epicentre of the coronavirus to the RAAF Learmonth base in Exmouth in northern Western Australia, before being taken to Christmas Island in smaller aircraft where they will be quarantined. The Qantas plane carrying four pilots and 14 cabin crew is now on the ground in Wuhan in Hubei province in central China, after arriving early Monday morning AEDT, and is being refuelled. \u201cI spoke to the crew last night and through FaceTime video and they were all very keen to get this done and get the Aussies out,\u201d Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said. \u201cWe put in a whole series of protections for these volunteers to make sure that they are protected. The flight is on the ground in Wuhan at the moment.\u201d The 244 passengers will go through health checks before boarding and will wear surgical masks. We have people working on the disclosures to give you a more comprehensive idea \u2013 but just to confirm what we all knew \u2013 Clive Palmer\u2019s Mineralogy company spent $89m in the last financial year. Anthony Albanese will be shooting the breeze at 10.30am. Bob Katter is officially handing over the leadership of his party to his son, the Queensland Katter\u2019s Australian party MP Robbie Katter. The media alert says the \u201coutgoing KAP Leader and federal member for Kennedy\u201d will speak to the media about midday. No word on his plans for his seat \u2013 but he can\u2019t just hand that over to his son \u2013 that\u2019s a byelection. Katter (the senior) had been considering his future at the last election but decided to go around one more time. The plan \u2013 whether Robbie wants it or not \u2013 is that Katter (the junior) take his place eventually \u2013 Robbie Katter has been in the Queensland parliament since the Newman government, and has been keeping the party together, so don\u2019t be surprised if you see him wandering the halls of Canberra after the next election. The Australian Electoral Commission has published the donations data for the last financial year. You can see who has donated to which political party here. For the record, one of the country\u2019s leading constitutional experts, Anne Twomey, also has questions about what legal authority Bridget McKenzie had to make the decisions she did: So to what extent do ministers have discretion and what are the limits on it? Ministers have discretion in directing their departments, but do not have the same ministerial discretion in directing corporate entities such as Sport Australia. If we were being charitable to senator McKenzie (and every other minister spouting about ministerial discretion) we could say that she was confused and really thought the same rules applied to making these sporting grants as would normally apply in relation to a departmental grant program. Perhaps somehow she was not informed that she had only limited legal powers in relation to the Sport Australia, despite it pointing this out. But even if this was so, she must still have known and believed she was subject to the following constraints. You can read the rest of her piece for the ABC here. And Michael McCormack says he \u201cwill believe\u201d the report that Scott Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff and now prime minister and cabinet departmental head (a non-political position, as opposed to chief of staff, which is a political position) handed down on the sports grants, which found that everything was just tickety-boo, hunky dory. So not surprisingly, McCormack chooses to believe the report which found that there was no problem with the sports grants program (and which has been hidden away as confidential in-cabinet for 20 years) as opposed to the independent audit (released in full) which put question marks over it. I will believe the PM&amp;C report. You will always have people who look at things in a different light. I believe the PM&amp;C report that has been handed down, I believe there was no bias there and what I would like to see is the sports grants have ongoing rounds of funding because then those electorates that missed out, those sporting clubs and organisations which missed out, might have better luck next time. I know that right throughout Australia there are a lot of sports clubs which, yes, put in countless hours to ensure that their reports, their applications, were all as they should be and I have to say that every single project that was funded, round one, two and three were eligible to Sport Australia and eligible according to the department and the minister. That is what she was faced with. Every single application was eligible and she [Bridget McKenzie] based her decision on that. As I have said before, I am eligible to be Australian of the Year, but I won\u2019t be, because there are many more worthy people ahead of me. I\u2019m also eligible to be prime minister. That seems an easier bar to aim for. Oh and no one in the National party has called Michael McCormack to say there would be a spill, so he says he is fine. But he then gives a grocery list of his \u201cachievements\u201d anyway, despite everything being totally fine. The fact is there is no vacancy for the leader of the National party. We have a vacancy for the deputy of the National party. We will have a meeting and decide this decision then. Back to the loaf of white bread serving as our deputy prime minister, speaking about his former deputy: She had ministerial discretion. That is important to note. I know Australians when they send members of parliament and senators to this place and when they become ministers, people in the public, particularly regional Australians, want those ministers to make decisions for it on their behalf. They don\u2019t want the government and ministers to outsource everything to the departments, to the bureaucracy and that is so important and critical to remember this ministers have to have overall discretion for these sort of things \u2026 [There is] critical need in regional Australia, particularly in the sports program, for such things as women\u2019s change rooms, women\u2019s netball courts and the like. Shower facilities. Women have to get dressed in cars and behind trees and that sort of thing to play the sport they will. With the growing demand for women\u2019s sport, this has become so critically important, Bridget McKenzie saw the need to ensure that women didn\u2019t have to put up without any facility at all or with very sloppy facilities and she made sure that she addressed that need. I thank her for the role that she\u2019s played in that regard and I thank her for her service in the past, currently and going forward to the National party and to regional Australians in particular. She\u2019s been a great servant of the National party, but moreover, a great servant to regional Australians and that is what National party members of parliament do. We represent regional Australians. We want regional Australians to know that they are our focus, not ourselves, not the Canberra bubble. The people in regional Australia are hurting through the bushfires, the ongoing drought. We are there to serve them. We are there to put their needs and wants and expectations first and foremost. I thank Bridget McKenzie for her service to this nation and I look forward to serving with her and the National party in the future. Peter Dutton decided to stop by doors this morning (when ministers deliberately enter the parliament by the doors media can access, so they can deliver whatever lines they need to). He was asked about the Nationals and Michael McCormack: Question: Would you be urging the Nationals against spilling both leadership positions? Dutton: I don\u2019t urge other parties except for the Labor party \u2013 I offer them free advice and regularly \u2013 but not to other parties. Q: Is Michael McCormack doing a good job? Dutton: Yes he is. Thanks very much. Michael McCormack is holding a press conference. Allegedly about the Qantas Wuhan flight and the drought \u2013 before moving on to Bridget McKenzie. But it really is a plea to his colleagues not to knock him off. It\u2019s going about as well as you would think it is. David Gillespie has also put his hand up for deputy position in the Nationals party room. He says you need someone who can talk to the media \u2013 like him \u2013 in the role. That makes almost half a dozen or so in the 21-strong party room who are now going for the job. David Littleproud Darren Chester Gillespie Keith Pitt (as a maybe) Damian Drum On the question of Michael McCormack\u2019s position, Gillespie wouldn\u2019t confirm that there have been talks about bringing Barnaby Joyce back (but there have). I\u2019ve checked in with the Australian federal police this morning \u2013 the force has still not decided whether or not to take up an investigation into the doctored document affair, after the NSW police referred the matter to it on 20 December. So Angus Taylor is NOT being investigated by the AFP \u2013 it has a referral for an investigation and is deciding what to do with that referral. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, says the opposition still wants to set up a Senate inquiry into the awarding of sports grants. He told the ABC: Ultimately, we will do everything that we can in terms of working with the crossbench in order to achieve that. We need to know what is going on here. There is more than the question of Bridget McKenzie being in a gun club. We have got a whole program with $100m, which is very clear was being distributed on the basis, not of merit, not on where the best buck could be spent in terms of community sport, but on the basis of electoral politics. Spreadsheets which set out the margin neutrality of seats being the basis [of which] which people are getting their grants. We have got emails from the prime minister\u2019s office. We need to understand exactly how much up to his neck in it the prime minister is in. There is a lot more which needs to come forward here. Oh, and it\u2019s Groundhog Day. For reals. (in the northern hemisphere) Also worth noting, as the #SportsRort scandal rolls on \u2013 there is still no timeline for any sort of federal Icac. The government missed its own deadline late last year, and now says it\u2019ll come when it comes. Which, if it\u2019s anything like the Care Bear my mother promised me when I was a child, will be about two decades from now. Barnaby Joyce decided that this morning was the best time to go public with his (never-abandoned) return-to-the-leadership hopes. He told the Seven network that, if called upon by his colleagues, he would rise to the occasion. If there is a spill then I will put my hand up. I will leave that up to my colleagues. They can make the call. That has made Labor\u2019s Joel Fitzgibbon the happiest coal-supporting man in parliament \u2013 and revealed his new favourite word. Barnaby Joyce just told us that the National party is dysfunctional and indeed hopeless. My concern is that a dysfunctional government just got a whole lot more dysfunctional. Welcome back to Politics Live \u2013 although I don\u2019t think any of us feel like we had a summer break. The bushfire emergency, hazardous air quality (not to mention Scott Morrison\u2019s earliest response to it all), the ongoing drought, the storms, refusal to budge on climate policy, and then the coronavirus all meant most of us spent the summer in a state of alert. It\u2019s exhausting and it\u2019s not over. Also not over: the #SportsRort affair, despite how much the prime minister might want to draw a line under it. Bridget McKenzie may be gone (for now) from the Nationals leadership team and from cabinet (but not from the Senate) but she was given one of the most glowing fall-on-your-sword farewells I have ever heard. And her resignation doesn\u2019t do anything to answer the questions the auditor general\u2019s report raised in the first place. Those questions were allegedly settled by the report on the matter by Morrison\u2019s departmental head (and former chief of staff) Phil Gaetjens \u2013 but we aren\u2019t allowed to see that for 20 years or so. So don\u2019t you worry about that, chickens. Meanwhile, Barnaby Joyce has decided now is as good as time as any to shoot his shot \u2013 he\u2019s told anyone who will listen, including the public, that if Michael McCormack\u2019s leadership position is thrown open tomorrow, when the Nats will decide on a new deputy leader, he\u2019ll be throwing his ever-present hat into the ring. Under the Nationals rules, just one person can call for a spill. Which means that Joyce can call on the spill himself if he so chooses. The numbers in the Nationals party room have not shifted since Joyce was forced to step down. Which is to say, no one has the numbers. McCormack isn\u2019t exactly what you would call a popular leader but there is no one else who can claim to be, either. So the 21-strong party room is split on ... no one. Fun times for the country, given that under the Coalition agreement, the leader of the Nats is also the deputy prime minister. And acting prime minister if, you know, the PM decides to take off to Hawaii or something for a short break. We\u2019ll bring you all the day\u2019s events as they come to hand. Parliament doesn\u2019t actually sit until tomorrow but we all know the real action in this place is in the hallways anyway. You have Mike Bowers who HAS NOT STOPPED this summer, as well as Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. And you have what is left of me, which, with only one coffee this morning, is about four brain cells and 10 fingers. Six of which work. (The lavender oil is burning overtime this morning.) Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

On Saturday, the government announced new travel restrictions on people who had visited China, barring all those except Australian citizens, permanent residents and certain family members from entering the country, in order to limit the spread of the new coronavirus. In one case, the 67-year-old mother-in-law of an Australian had travelled to China to attend her brother\u2019s funeral but was barred at the last minute from boarding a flight back to Australia. Steven, an Australian citizen from Sydney, said his wife \u2013 who is a permanent resident and was travelling with her mother \u2013 was told by ground staff at a Tokyo airport that her mother was not considered \u201cimmediate family\u201d, hours after the new policy was announced. He said his wife told the staff her mother was a pensioner and dependent on her, but her mother was denied boarding at the airport.

But we would want them to be wearing personal protective equipment when they\u2019re in contact with passengers.\u201d</p> <p>Qantas conducted two webinars where cabin crew were able to dial in to ask questions of senior management and medical officers. But several staff have reportedly said their concerns were minimised or dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cThe company, in my opinion and also the opinion of most of my cabin crew colleagues, are taking an extremely negligent approach to dealing with the WHO-declared emergency, to the detriment of all of us who fly, as well as to the general public,\u201d the cabin crew member said.</p> <p>The crew member said they were not seeking to act \u201clike some kind of scare-monger \u2026 but I am deeply concerned not only for my own health and safety and that of my loved ones but also for the greater impact this can have on the Australian public, and for that matter, the global impact of this virus\u201d.</p> <p>The 14-person cabin crew and four pilots left Sydney on a Boeing 747 on Sunday afternoon. The flight travelled to Hong Kong before landing in Wuhan overnight on Sunday.</p> <p>The plane left Wuhan airport at 8.03am local time.

      "bodyText": "Qantas flight crew have raised concerns that the 14-member cabin crew responsible for bringing evacuated Australians out of China\u2019s Wuhan province will return to work staffing commercial flights around the country without a period of quarantine. A crew member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they and their colleagues were concerned about the health protocols surrounding the cabin crew, who will board domestic flights to return to their home cities and return to working on flights around the country and the world without being placed in quarantine. \u201cThe breaking straw really for me is their response that the jumbo crew returning from Wuhan with the potentially infected passengers will not themselves be subject to any kind of quarantine, and will be back online flying with the rest of us as per usual as soon as possible, as Qantas do not deem them to be of any risk to the rest of us,\u201d the staff member said. Those passengers being evacuated from Wuhan will be required to spend 14 days in quarantine on Christmas Island, before being allowed to return home. Qantas has said it would never have launched the evacuation operation if it was not safe for all involved and the broader public. It said a number of additional health precautions had been put in place to manage the risk of transmission of coronavirus among passengers and crew on the flight, including health checks for passengers before boarding, masks for all onboard to be changed hourly, limited interaction between passengers and crew, and medical-grade air filters on board. The airline said it was acting on the advice of the commonwealth chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, that a quarantine period for flight crew was unnecessary. Murphy said Sunday: \u201cWe think that if air crew are wearing personal protective equipment, which is probably just a mask and gloves when they\u2019re in close contact, that that would prevent them from any material exposure, and we wouldn\u2019t want them to be quarantined. But we would want them to be wearing personal protective equipment when they\u2019re in contact with passengers.\u201d Qantas conducted two webinars where cabin crew were able to dial in to ask questions of senior management and medical officers. But several staff have reportedly said their concerns were minimised or dismissed. \u201cThe company, in my opinion and also the opinion of most of my cabin crew colleagues, are taking an extremely negligent approach to dealing with the WHO-declared emergency, to the detriment of all of us who fly, as well as to the general public,\u201d the cabin crew member said. The crew member said they were not seeking to act \u201clike some kind of scare-monger \u2026 but I am deeply concerned not only for my own health and safety and that of my loved ones but also for the greater impact this can have on the Australian public, and for that matter, the global impact of this virus\u201d. The 14-person cabin crew and four pilots left Sydney on a Boeing 747 on Sunday afternoon. The flight travelled to Hong Kong before landing in Wuhan overnight on Sunday. The plane left Wuhan airport at 8.03am local time. It landed at RAAF base Learmonth in Exmouth, Western Australia, about 4pm WA time. About 270 passengers and crew were on board, including significant numbers of children and the elderly, who were prioritised for the evacuation mission. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said the airline had worked closely with the Australian government, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, on the \u201ccomplicated logistics\u201d and health protocols for the flight. Joyce told ABC radio that the additional precautions put in place to manage the coronavirus transmission risk on the flight including the crew remaining on the aircraft\u2019s upper deck. \u201cThey are there for safety requirements, manning doors on departure and arrival. All the passengers and the crew have been given masks and hand sanitisers, and the crew have gloves.\u201d Food and drinks would be laid out on seats for passengers before boarding to minimise crew interaction with passengers, he said. Officials from the Department of Health would also be on board the flight. Joyce said medical-grade air filters put new air into the cabin every five minutes, making it cleaner than a restaurant or public transport. \u201cThere is a lot of medical assistance on board, passengers are checked before they get on board, we\u2019ve put in the maximum amount of protection that we can.\u201d Joyce said the crew had volunteered to get Australians out of Wuhan. \u201cThere are a lot of children, a lot of elderly passengers, we need to get them home and out of Wuhan.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Mahomes leads Chiefs to 31-20 triumph over San Francisco At just 24, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes became the youngest ever Super Bowl MVP on Sunday night after leading his team to a 31-20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, with a fourth-quarter charge that overturned a 10-point deficit to give the Missouri team its first NFL title in half a century. Mahomes has already earned comparisons to iconic QBs including Tom Brady, who also won his first Super Bowl at 24 \u2013 and has since won five more. Half-time show. The half-time show was the best in years, writes Eve Barlow, with Shakira and J-Lo combining for \u201can asthma-inducing 15 minutes\u201d that sent an electric burst of energy through the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Trump tweet. Donald Trump sent his congratulations in a geographically challenged tweet, saying the Chiefs \u201crepresented the Great State of Kansas\u201d. Kansas City is in Missouri. Democrats make closing arguments as Iowa caucuses arrive The Democratic presidential candidates have been making their final pitch to voters in Iowa before the state\u2019s crucial caucuses. The first contest of the 2020 race is the closest in years, with four hopefuls regularly polling above 15%. Yet Bernie Sanders appears to be ahead of Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren going into Monday\u2019s nominating contest. Iowans are taking their responsibility seriously, though many in the state remain shut out of the process by physical and legal barriers. John Kerry. Many Democrats are horrified by the prospect of a surging Bernie Sanders. John Kerry, the former US secretary of state, has been forced to deny he is mulling his own late presidential bid to stymie the Vermont socialist. Mike Bloomberg. The former New York mayor, who is running as a Democrat but not competing in Iowa, traded insults with Trump on Sunday, calling the president \u201ca pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan\u201d. Politics blog. Today\u2019s blog is up and running. Read it here. Senate Republicans poised to acquit Trump on Wednesday The US Senate looks all set to acquit Trump at the end of his impeachment trial on Wednesday, with some predicting not only that every Republican in the chamber will vote to exonerate the president, but that several Democrats up for re-election in swing states will join them. Just two Republican senators, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins, broke ranks with their party in Friday\u2019s 51-49 vote blocking testimony from new witnesses; it was the first time in history that the Senate has elected not to hear such evidence. Trump interview. In a Sunday evening interview with his close friend and unofficial adviser Sean Hannity, of Fox News, Trump said Democrats \u201cdon\u2019t care about fairness \u2026 I think they just want to win. It doesn\u2019t matter how they win.\u201d Dozens more deaths in Wuhan as coronavirus crisis grows Chinese state media has reported 57 new deaths caused by the coronavirus, all but one of them in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. That brings the overall death toll from the disease to 362, including one in the Philippines \u2013 the first reported death outside China. One of two new hospitals built over the past 10 days to combat the virus is set to open in Wuhan on Monday, but China has issued an appeal for medical equipment including masks, protective suits and safety goggles. US response. An 11th case of the virus has been confirmed in the US, but a Beijing foreign ministry spokesman criticised America\u2019s new ban on people travelling from China, accusing Washington of creating and spreading panic. Share drop. Chinese shares slumped by almost 9% on Monday, the Chinese stock market\u2019s biggest daily fall for five years, amid fear and uncertainty over the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. Cheat sheet Joaquin Phoenix has been praised for criticising the film industry\u2019s \u201csystemic racism\u201d as he accepted the Bafta award for best actor for his performance in Joker on Sunday night. A 20-year-old man shot dead by police after stabbing two people in London on Sunday had recently been freed from prison, after serving half of a three-year sentence for the possession and distribution of extremist material. Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the author of the administration\u2019s controversial new proposals for the Middle East, has said he hopes the Palestinian leadership will at least \u201cread the plan\u201d, which they have already rejected outright. The daughter of the convicted Mexican drug lord Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n has married Edgar Cazares, who also has deep familial links to the underworld, in a lavish ceremony at the cathedral of Culiac\u00e1n in the country\u2019s cartel heartland. Must-reads Guess who\u2019s coming to dinner: confronting prejudice over pasta Regina Jackson, who is black, and Saira Rao, who identifies as Indian American, are the founders of Race to Dinner, which invites groups of liberal white women to discuss their own racism over a meal.

The \u2018forever chemicals\u2019 fueling a public health crisis Across the US, some 700 sites have been identified as contaminated by PFAS, which are known as \u201cforever chemicals\u201d for their longevity in the environment \u2013 and which are blamed for causing rare cancers and other deadly conditions.

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector showed signs of stabilising last month to emerge from the longest downturn since the financial crisis, according to a survey.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.markiteconomics.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/4a0074b22f044e1da3f64622621d2453?s=1\">monthly snapshot</a> from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals from the UK economy, showed that factory output remained steady in January after eight months of contraction.</p> <p>Bringing to an end the deepest slump in manufacturing activity since 2009, the IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 50.0 in January, up from 47.5 a month ago. Anything above 50.0 separates growth from contraction. The reading was marginally higher than the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/24/pressure-eases-on-bank-to-cut-interest-rates-as-uk-economy-improves-bank-of-england\">49.8 \u201cflash\u201d estimate</a> made last month.</p> <p>Reduced levels of political uncertainty after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Boris Johnson</a>\u2019s unexpectedly decisive election victory helped to boost new orders and business confidence, with optimism among manufacturers hitting an eight-month high.</p> <p>Employment levels were broadly unchanged on the month, halting a nine-month sequence of job losses.</p> <p>Despite the improvement in the PMI reading, growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a tenth of the economy, remains at stall speed due to a broader global slowdown and lingering uncertainty over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>.</p> <p>Manufacturers warned that weak economic growth in key markets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/eurozone-growth-stalling-french-italian-gdp\">especially within Europe</a> \u2013 dragged down new export orders in January. Although optimism among UK manufacturers rose, it remained low compared with historical standards \u2013 in part due to a continuing lack of clarity over the country\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU.</p> <p>Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the government\u2019s commitment to a clean-break Brexit at the end of 2020 would continue to weigh on the prospects of the manufacturing sector.</p> <p>\u201cMany manufacturers will be reluctant to invest in new productivity-enhancing kit, while Britain\u2019s future trade links are uncertain,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The pound sold off sharply on Monday as Johnson outlined plans for a tough stance in trade talks with Brussels, warning that Britain would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/02/uk-refuse-close-alignment-eu-rules-boris-johnson-trade\">refuse close alignment with EU rules</a> and reject the jurisdiction of the European courts.</p> <p>After almost half a century of EU membership, UK manufacturers have developed close ties and complex supply chains with their EU counterparts that could be left economically unviable by higher trade barriers.</p> <p>Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said the survey of about 600 manufacturers indicated that business investment remained depressed. \u201cA full revival in capital spending may still be some way off, likely reflecting lingering uncertainty about the Brexit roadmap in the coming year,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The stabilisation in business confidence among manufacturers follows a difficult period for industrial firms around the world, against a backdrop of weaker global trade due to the US-China trade war.</p> <p>Although there were hopes of a rebound in manufacturing output and industrial trading activity since the phase one trade deal was signed between Washington and Beijing last month, there are fears the coronavirus outbreak in China could stand to derail the recovery.</p> <p>Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK, the manufacturing industry lobby group, said: \u201cBusiness confidence remains fragile and concerns about our future trade rules mean export orders are still falling. This is the main cause for concern so all eyes will be on the nature and quality of any trade deals secured over the next eleven months.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector showed signs of stabilising last month to emerge from the longest downturn since the financial crisis, according to a survey. The monthly snapshot from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which is closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signals from the UK economy, showed that factory output remained steady in January after eight months of contraction. Bringing to an end the deepest slump in manufacturing activity since 2009, the IHS Markit/Cips manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) rose to 50.0 in January, up from 47.5 a month ago. Anything above 50.0 separates growth from contraction. The reading was marginally higher than the 49.8 \u201cflash\u201d estimate made last month. Reduced levels of political uncertainty after Boris Johnson\u2019s unexpectedly decisive election victory helped to boost new orders and business confidence, with optimism among manufacturers hitting an eight-month high. Employment levels were broadly unchanged on the month, halting a nine-month sequence of job losses. Despite the improvement in the PMI reading, growth in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for about a tenth of the economy, remains at stall speed due to a broader global slowdown and lingering uncertainty over Brexit. Manufacturers warned that weak economic growth in key markets \u2013 especially within Europe \u2013 dragged down new export orders in January. Although optimism among UK manufacturers rose, it remained low compared with historical standards \u2013 in part due to a continuing lack of clarity over the country\u2019s future trading relationship with the EU. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the government\u2019s commitment to a clean-break Brexit at the end of 2020 would continue to weigh on the prospects of the manufacturing sector. \u201cMany manufacturers will be reluctant to invest in new productivity-enhancing kit, while Britain\u2019s future trade links are uncertain,\u201d he added. The pound sold off sharply on Monday as Johnson outlined plans for a tough stance in trade talks with Brussels, warning that Britain would refuse close alignment with EU rules and reject the jurisdiction of the European courts. After almost half a century of EU membership, UK manufacturers have developed close ties and complex supply chains with their EU counterparts that could be left economically unviable by higher trade barriers. Rob Dobson, a director at IHS Markit, said the survey of about 600 manufacturers indicated that business investment remained depressed. \u201cA full revival in capital spending may still be some way off, likely reflecting lingering uncertainty about the Brexit roadmap in the coming year,\u201d he added. The stabilisation in business confidence among manufacturers follows a difficult period for industrial firms around the world, against a backdrop of weaker global trade due to the US-China trade war. Although there were hopes of a rebound in manufacturing output and industrial trading activity since the phase one trade deal was signed between Washington and Beijing last month, there are fears the coronavirus outbreak in China could stand to derail the recovery. Seamus Nevin, chief economist at Make UK, the manufacturing industry lobby group, said: \u201cBusiness confidence remains fragile and concerns about our future trade rules mean export orders are still falling. This is the main cause for concern so all eyes will be on the nature and quality of any trade deals secured over the next eleven months.\u201d",

I\u2019ve just spoken to Ian Mackay, <a href=\"https://virologydownunder.com/about-me/\">a virologist at the University of Queensland</a> about what some of those might be.</p> <h2>1. How many cases are mild and how many are severe?</h2> <p>The disease appears to spreading more efficiently than its cousins Sars or Mers. That\u2019s probably down to the fact that the world is much more dense and interconnected than in 2003, when Sars emerged, and because this coronavirus is more easily transmitted. \u201cIt\u2019s more like the flu, which can whip around the world in no time,\u201d says Mackay.</p> <p>It appears that China will not be able to contain its spread within the country, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the death toll will spike, he says. \u201cOne big hole in our understanding is whether the disease is more dangerous than Sars,\u201d he says. \u201cThat part is hard to answer because we\u2019re missing a big important number, which is how many people are confirmed cases but haven\u2019t gone to the hospital and are being quarantined at home, and how many have recovered.\u201d</p> <p>That matters, because it will tell us how many people have gotten only mildly or moderately sick, and therefore how deadly the disease is. If we take the cases that have been reported outside China, the death rate is less than 1%. But understanding the full spectrum of infections inside China will give us a much better idea.</p> <h2>2. How many of those infected are kids?</h2> <p>\u201cUsually with respiratory viruses we see the young end of town as the virus spreaders,\u201d says Mackay. Think of the way that kids go to school, spread a cold, then take it home to their parents, who in turn might carry the virus to work.</p> <p>\u201cSo I\u2019m wondering why we\u2019re not seeing kids among the cases,\u201d Mackay says. He speculates it might be because we\u2019re focusing on the most severely infected people, who are presenting to hospital, and missing the fact that many people, including children, might have the coronavirus but are only presenting with relatively minor symptoms and recovering at home.</p> <h2>3. Is the virus mutating?</h2> <p>Viruses are \u201crelentless replicating adaptive machines\u201d that are constantly evolving, and this coronavirus will be no exception, Mackay says. Virologists need to see a larger selection of genome sequences of the virus than are currently available \u201cto see more of what\u2019s happening with the virus as it\u2019s passing through thousands, possibly tens of thousands of hosts\u201d.</p> <p>Chinese officials have made comments suggesting that the virus is now transmitting more easily. Scientists will want to see evidence of those new cases \u201cjust to make sure that there aren\u2019t consistent changes building up in the virus over time that might have an effect\u201d on how it should be fought, he says.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e37ff688f08e1332473c0dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/patrick-greenfield\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T11:09:41.291Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Over the weekend, major international talks on biodiversity loss that were set to take place in China were moved because of the coronavirus outbreak. </p> <p>The first round of negotiations for a Paris-style agreement on biodiversity, which had been due to take place in Kunming, Yunnan province, between 24 and 29 February, has been moved to Rome. </p> <p>Biodiversity experts and government policy makers had been set to meet in the city in southern China to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/un-draft-plan-sets-2030-target-to-avert-earths-sixth-mass-extinction-aoe\">plans to protect a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land by 2030</a>.</p> <p>The UN said the decision to move talks was made in consultation with the Chinese government. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T12:23:02.569Z\">at 12.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e37f9968f08e1332473c0b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/angela-giuffrida\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T10:44:59.100Z\">10.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sixty Italians evacuated from Wuhan arrived at a military base near Rome on Monday. </p> <p>A passenger who was expected to be onboard the flight remained in Wuhan after contracting a fever, Italian media reported.

An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to improve the immune response and means the amount of antigen required per dose can be reduced \u2013 allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people, which is crucial in a pandemic.</p> <p>Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of CEPI, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Gaining access to GSK\u2019s world-leading adjuvant technology is a huge step forward in developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.

It has committed $11m to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, and the University of Queensland, with the hope of having a viable vaccine in production within 16 weeks, although testing for safety and efficacy will take much longer.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a research team at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland has prepared a modified version of a key section of the virus to encourage the body to produce antibodies against the disease.

The race is now on to identify everyone he came into contact with, including passengers in the aircraft he flew in, and staff in the hotels where he stayed.

My colleague Lily Kuo in Beijing also just filed this wrap of the day\u2019s events, focusing on the reports of dozens more deaths in Wuhan, where hospitals are said to be increasingly undersupplied and overburdened. We appreciate you reading along. Keep checking with us for updates as the day goes on. We\u2019re learning more about this coronavirus each day, but a month since it emerged, there remain some important holes in our understanding \u2014 what the former US secretary of defence, Donald Rumsfeld, might have called known unknowns. I\u2019ve just spoken to Ian Mackay, a virologist at the University of Queensland about what some of those might be. 1. How many cases are mild and how many are severe? The disease appears to spreading more efficiently than its cousins Sars or Mers. That\u2019s probably down to the fact that the world is much more dense and interconnected than in 2003, when Sars emerged, and because this coronavirus is more easily transmitted. \u201cIt\u2019s more like the flu, which can whip around the world in no time,\u201d says Mackay. It appears that China will not be able to contain its spread within the country, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the death toll will spike, he says. \u201cOne big hole in our understanding is whether the disease is more dangerous than Sars,\u201d he says. \u201cThat part is hard to answer because we\u2019re missing a big important number, which is how many people are confirmed cases but haven\u2019t gone to the hospital and are being quarantined at home, and how many have recovered.\u201d That matters, because it will tell us how many people have gotten only mildly or moderately sick, and therefore how deadly the disease is. If we take the cases that have been reported outside China, the death rate is less than 1%. But understanding the full spectrum of infections inside China will give us a much better idea. 2. How many of those infected are kids? \u201cUsually with respiratory viruses we see the young end of town as the virus spreaders,\u201d says Mackay. Think of the way that kids go to school, spread a cold, then take it home to their parents, who in turn might carry the virus to work. \u201cSo I\u2019m wondering why we\u2019re not seeing kids among the cases,\u201d Mackay says. He speculates it might be because we\u2019re focusing on the most severely infected people, who are presenting to hospital, and missing the fact that many people, including children, might have the coronavirus but are only presenting with relatively minor symptoms and recovering at home. 3. Is the virus mutating? Viruses are \u201crelentless replicating adaptive machines\u201d that are constantly evolving, and this coronavirus will be no exception, Mackay says. Virologists need to see a larger selection of genome sequences of the virus than are currently available \u201cto see more of what\u2019s happening with the virus as it\u2019s passing through thousands, possibly tens of thousands of hosts\u201d. Chinese officials have made comments suggesting that the virus is now transmitting more easily. Scientists will want to see evidence of those new cases \u201cjust to make sure that there aren\u2019t consistent changes building up in the virus over time that might have an effect\u201d on how it should be fought, he says. Over the weekend, major international talks on biodiversity loss that were set to take place in China were moved because of the coronavirus outbreak. The first round of negotiations for a Paris-style agreement on biodiversity, which had been due to take place in Kunming, Yunnan province, between 24 and 29 February, has been moved to Rome. Biodiversity experts and government policy makers had been set to meet in the city in southern China to discuss plans to protect a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land by 2030. The UN said the decision to move talks was made in consultation with the Chinese government. Sixty Italians evacuated from Wuhan arrived at a military base near Rome on Monday. A passenger who was expected to be onboard the flight remained in Wuhan after contracting a fever, Italian media reported. The group will be quarantined for up to two weeks. Meanwhile, panic over the virus continues in Italy, with general practitioners and hospital emergency units overwhelmed with people suffering flu symptoms or simply seeking information from professionals. Codacons, the consumers\u2019 group, has called for group tours at popular sites, including the Colosseum in Rome, to be banned. On Friday, Italy announced a state of emergency that will be in place for six months. As researchers are racing to develop a vaccine for the Wuhan coronavirus, the British drugmaker GSK has teamed up with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) to aid efforts to produce a vaccine. GSK, one of the world\u2019s biggest vaccine makers, says it will make its \u201cadjuvant platform technology\u201d available. An adjuvant is added to some vaccines to improve the immune response and means the amount of antigen required per dose can be reduced \u2013 allowing more vaccine doses to be produced and made available to more people, which is crucial in a pandemic. Dr Richard Hatchett, the chief executive of CEPI, says: Gaining access to GSK\u2019s world-leading adjuvant technology is a huge step forward in developing a vaccine against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV. Coupling GSK\u2019s adjuvant systems with the pioneering platform technology we are funding has the potential to make more vaccine available more rapidly \u2013 by decreasing the dose of vaccine antigen required to protect each individual. CEPI, a public-private group based in Norway, is one of several organisations working on a vaccine. It has committed $11m to three programmes led by the companies Inovio Pharmaceuticals and Moderna, and the University of Queensland, with the hope of having a viable vaccine in production within 16 weeks, although testing for safety and efficacy will take much longer. Meanwhile, a research team at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland has prepared a modified version of a key section of the virus to encourage the body to produce antibodies against the disease. And France\u2019s Pasteur Institute said last Friday that it had set up a taskforce aimed at developing a vaccine against the virus within 20 months. In Germany, eight people have tested positive for the virus so far. Seven of them, five Germans and two Chinese nationals, are employees of the car parts supplier Webasto, headquartered in Stockdorf, Bavaria. The eighth is the child of one of the employees. All eight patients were in a \u201cstable clinical condition\u201d and had only shown \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d, said a spokesperson for the Bavarian health ministry. Four of the infected Webasto employees had taken part in a training workshop run by a Chinese employee who only started to feel ill on her return flight to China, where she subsequently tested positive for the 2019-nCov virus. The company\u2019s headquarters in Stockdorf was disinfected by experts over the weekend and was to remain closed until Tuesday. A further 140 employees were tested for the virus, with 80 of them being ordered to stay indoors and avoid human contact even though their test results had returned negative. If you\u2019re just checking in with us this Monday, here are the major developments in the ongoing coronavirus story: There are now 17,459 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The death toll is 362 people, while 489 have recovered. The death toll is now higher than that from the Sars epidemic, which was 349 people. More and more countries are temporarily banning people coming from mainland China from entering. Among them is New Zealand, whose prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, this morning cited \u201cthe range of unknowns in the way the virus is being transmitted\u201d to justify her country\u2019s decision. We\u2019ve registered the first fatality from the disease outside China. A 44-year-old Chinese citizen has died in the Philippines after travelling there from Wuhan, where he was from. The race is now on to identify everyone he came into contact with, including passengers in the aircraft he flew in, and staff in the hotels where he stayed. He was travelling with a 38-year-old woman who was confirmed to have had the virus but was no longer showing symptoms. Outside China, Hong Kong and Macau, the highest number of confirmed cases are in Japan (20 people), Thailand (19), Singapore (18), South Korea (15), Australia (12) and the US, which confirmed its 11th case overnight. A woman in Santa Clara, California, had recently travelled to Wuhan and returned with the virus. But her symptoms are said to be minor and she\u2019s being quarantined at home. The outbreak has battered Chinese stock markets, which have plunged at least 7% after reopening for the first time since they closed for the lunar new year on 23 January. Trading in several commodities was suspended after losses quickly exceeded their daily limits. Stick with us. We\u2019ll be sharing more as it emerges today. A group of British nationals and some of their foreign relatives currently in quarantine for coronavirus say they are holding up well. The 94 people are being kept in isolation at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral after being evacuated from the centre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, on two repatriation flights. They will be held for two weeks to monitor for any symptoms of the virus. Kharn Lambert, a PE teacher, has lived in Wuhan for the last five years and was being visited by his 81-year-old grandmother, Veronica Theobald, when the outbreak occurred. He told Sky News\u2019s Kay Burley on Monday: \u201cIt\u2019s quite weird being home but not being home, and also being locked in \u2013 almost like being back in Wuhan really \u2013 where we can\u2019t get outside certain perimeters and go further, so it\u2019s a bit of a weird feeling, really.\u201d Lambert said that, out of the first group of 83 arrivals, no one was showing any coronavirus symptoms or complaining about feeling unwell. \u201cEverybody is in good spirits,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not the best of circumstances but we\u2019re all trying to keep our spirits high. \u201cWe\u2019re playing jokes on each other, we\u2019re having a laugh when we have the chance to see each other.\u201d People in Wirral have donated supplies, including toys and video-game consoles, to keep the quarantined cohort entertained. The second group of evacuees, made up of seven British nationals and four of their family members, arrived at the Merseyside hospital on Sunday evening. Lambert said he has not seen the new arrivals and believed they were being housed away from the other people in quarantine. He praised the staff taking care of the evacuees in the hospital accommodation block. \u201cThey\u2019re all being told to wear protection, ie masks and gloves, when they\u2019re in the communal areas. \u201cThey\u2019ve been absolutely fantastic since the moment we arrived and we can\u2019t thank them enough for everything they\u2019re doing for us at the moment.\u201d Chinese stock markets plunged on Monday morning as investors absorbed the news that coronavirus cases had increased in recent days. Markets had been closed since 23 January for the lunar new year and the falls \u2013 including by 7.7% on the Shanghai stock exchange composite index \u2013 were not surprising, after share prices elsewhere dropped on the expectation that the virus, which has prompted bans on public gatherings in many Chinese cities and total lockdown of others, would batter economic activity. We\u2019re tracking the impact of the virus on the markets and all the rest of today\u2019s business news here: My colleague Kim Willsher has passed along some good news from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, which announced at the weekend that it had managed to isolate and grow a culture of this coronavirus. That means it is available for research, which puts scientists on track to develop a vaccine. However, that isn\u2019t a quick process. Christophe D\u2019Enfert, a scientific director with the Pasteur Institute, told reporters in Paris the vaccine could be made available in 20 months if \u201call goes well\u201d. \u201cAt the end of August, we could enter clinical trials and, provided all goes well, obtain a vaccine candidate within 20 months,\u201d he said. In other positive developments this morning, tests on 20 French passengers on a second plane of 36 people repatriated from Wuhan on Sunday have come back negative. They will still be held in 14-day quarantine, a junior health minister said. A French government spokesperson said all those French citizens who had asked to be brought back to France had now returned. Hello, this is Michael Safi, I\u2019ll be updating you with the latest developments in this story over the next hours. We\u2019re getting a little more now from the press conference (given online, not in person) by the Chinese foreign ministry. The government has been at pains to emphasise that it has the tools to control the spread of this coronavirus outbreak, but this morning did concede it needs help \u2013 in the form of protective medical equipment. \u201cWhat China urgently needs at present are medical masks, protective suits and safety goggles,\u201d the foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a press briefing on Monday morning. China\u2019s factories can produce 20 million masks a day, but panic over the virus has prompted people in the country of 1.4 billion to stock up on them, while frontline medical personnel have reported equipment shortages. Agence France-Presse provides this context: At full capacity, China\u2019s factories are only able to produce around 20m masks a day, according to the ministry of industry. The foreign ministry said countries including South Korea, Japan, Kazakhstan and Hungary had donated medical supplies. Tian Yulong, of the industry ministry, said earlier on Monday that authorities were taking steps to bring in masks from Europe, Japan and the US, adding that supply and demand in China remained in \u201ctight equilibrium\u201d as factories returned to production after the lunar new year break. He said they were now operating at between 60% and 70% capacity. In addition to Hubei, the province of more than 50 million people at the centre of the outbreak, several other provinces and cities across China have made it compulsory to wear masks in public. These include Guangdong \u2013 China\u2019s most populous province \u2013 plus Sichuan, Jiangxi, Liaoning and the city of Nanjing, with a combined population of more than 300 million. China\u2019s foreign ministry has issued a strongly worded criticism of the US, accusing its global rival of acting to create and spread fear about the coronavirus outbreak instead of offering any significant assistance. The US was the first nation to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travellers, the ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. \u201cAll it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,\u201d Hua told an online news briefing, adding that China hoped countries would make judgments and responses that were reasonable, calm and based on science. Initial tests carried out on about 20 people who were repatriated to France from China presented negative results for coronavirus, the French junior health minister Adrien Taquet has told BFMTV. More than 250 people from 30 countries arrived in France on Sunday after being flown out of Wuhan (more details here). The Associated Press has published an updated list of global cases of the coronavirus: China: 17,205 cases on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong has 14 cases and Macau has seven. Most of the 361 deaths have been in central Hubei province, where illnesses from the new type of coronavirus were first detected in December. Japan: 20 Thailand: 19 Singapore: 18 South Korea: 15 United States: 11 Germany: 10 Taiwan: 10 Malaysia: 8 Australia: 7 Vietnam: 8 France: 6 United Arab Emirates: 5 Canada: 4 India: 3 Philippines: 1 death, 1 additional case Russia: 2 Italy: 2 Britain: 2 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far today on the coronavirus outbreak: 361 people have died in China, one in the Philippines. Confirmed infections in China are 17,238 (official Chinese figures include Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau). Outside of China, infections stand at more than 150 (for simplicity of comparison between the numbers, I have removed Taiwan [10], Hong Kong [15] and Macau [8] from this global figure). 36 people on France\u2019s evacuation flights from Wuhan showed symptoms of the flights \u2013 20 French nationals and 16 foreign nationals. China\u2019s markets plunged on opening, on the first day of trading since the extended lunar new year. Shanghai is down nearly 8%. Health workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike, calling for closure of the border with China. Vietnam and the US confirm three new cases each. A Qantas charter flight carrying Australian citizens has departed Wuhan and is due to arrive in Western Australia at about 4pm local time. New Zealand has banned foreign travellers from China from entering. The Maldives has banned entry of travellers from China. The new hospital in Wuhan, built to accommodate coronavirus patients, has opened. The Maldives has banned travellers arriving from China as a precautionary measure to combat the spread of coronavirus, Ali Waheed, the tourism minister of the Indian Ocean islands, said on Monday. More than 280,000 Chinese tourists visited the luxury holiday destination in 2019, government data shows, the largest number from any country. I may have spoken too soon on calling my favourite post from Chinese state media today. The Global Times has released a video, headlined by the Hollywood actor Jackie Chan, called \u201cBelieve Love Will Triumph\u201d. The GT says the video is a call for people to \u201cstand together and stay strong\u201d during the fight against the coronavirus. Trading has resumed on China\u2019s stock markets after the lunch break. The losses have been staunched slightly from the falls of almost 9% earlier in the day but it\u2019s still very ugly. Oil has lost $0.51 to $56.11 a barrel, reflecting concerns about slowing demand in the global economy. The Shanghai Composite is off 7.91%. Shenzhen Component down 7.59%. The Australian ASX200 has closed down 1.34%. The Nikkei is off 0.85%. Kospi in Seoul is down 0.12. Hang Seng up 0.26%. Brent crude loses $0.51 to $56.11 a barrel. The yuan has fallen to 7.01 to the US dollar, its worst since August. Futures point to 0.55 lift on FTSE100. Dow Jones expected to rise 0.75%. Interesting that the Hong Kong market is up today. It\u2019s the only major bourse in the black and perhaps says more about the medium-term outlook on the markets, where many expect the Chinese economy to bounce back once the virus is under control. There seems a fairly concerted effort just now to put a positive spin on how China is handling the virus, with a series of tweets from state media. They include: The government promising to purchase the surplus production from enterprises when coronavirus epidemic ends. The overall production of face masks in China exceeding 20m per day \u2013 \u201cthe highest in the world\u201d. The virus stimulating online shopping and online entertainment, despite its impact on other industries. \u201cChina has better capabilities to contain the economic impact of the epidemic compared with the time of SARS outbreak: official,\u201d reports the Global Times. My personal favourite is this video below from CGTN, which says people have chosen to stay in Wuhan because of \u201clove, people and responsibilities\u201d. \u201cEveryone is united and we will work together to battle the coronavirus,\u201d it says, adding: \u201cI believe everything will be back to normal. Cherry blossoms will bloom, streets will be busy and people will have hot dry noodles for breakfast at restaurants.\u201d A close second is the People\u2019s Daily most recent post of a field of \u201cthriving\u201d rape flowers. \u201cThat\u2019s the brightness we need,\u201d the post says. The city of Guyuan, 1,200km north-east of Wuhan, has brought in new measures to stop the virus spreading, according to state-run media. It means no more than 25 people are allowed in every 100 sq metres in public venues. Hundreds of Hong Kong medical workers walked off their jobs on Monday, demanding the city close its border with China to stop the coronavirus spreading \u2013 with frontline staff threatening to follow in the coming days. Hong Kong has 15 confirmed cases of the virus. The action by non-essential medical staff comes as authorities refuse to completely seal the border, instead closing down some crossings. The extended lunar new year ended in China today, raising concerns that travel across the country could affect the spread of the virus. Agence France-Presse reports that in Beijing, some neighbourhoods have sealed themselves off \u2013 including with homemade barriers \u2013 to force visitors or anyone returning home from the holiday to register their travel history. One district in northern Shijiazhuang city is offering cash incentives of 2,000 yuan ($288) AFP says, for reporting anyone who has travelled to Wuhan in the past two weeks. For some communities, anyone who has visited central Hubei province \u2013 of which Wuhan is the capital \u2013 is no longer welcome at all. \u201cEven if you live here, you can\u2019t enter,\u201d said a security guard at the entrance of a Beijing neighbourhood when asked about returning Hubei residents. \u201cThose from Hubei could bring the infection here,\u201d he told AFP, wearing a blue mask. \u201cIf you\u2019re from Hubei, you have to notify the neighbourhood committee.\u201d Frances\u2019s health minister has confirmed that 36 people on an evacuation flight from Wuhan were showing symptoms of the coronavirus. In all, 254 people arrived in France from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the deadly virus was first detected, on the second such flight. \u201cAbout 20 people who presented symptoms have stayed on the tarmac\u201d at Istres airport in the south of France to undergo further testing, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said. They included French and non-European nationals, Agence France-Presse reported. Tests were carried out to establish whether they had the coronavirus and the results will be known on Monday. A further 16 foreign nationals displaying symptoms were flown back to their respective countries. The second evacuation flight was carrying people of 30 different nationalities, most of them European. Sixty-five of the returnees were French. A total of 124 non-French evacuees swiftly travelled on to their home countries, according to military sources in Istres, AFP says. Nine Belgians and three of their partners as well as 15 Dutch citizens and their two Chinese partners were isolated after travelling on from Istres to a military airport near Brussels, according to Belga news agency. However, 60 others from Mexico, Rwanda, Brazil and Georgia remained on French soil, Buzyn told reporters. So far in France, only six cases of coronavirus have been detected. China\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily is publishing pictures of the air force bringing in medical staff and supplies to Wuhan. Vietnam has confirmed three new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total cases in the country to eight. Health officials in California said there were now 11 confirmed cases of the virus in the country, adding three to the previous tally. A woman in Santa Clara county and the family she is staying with are being quarantined and she is now in isolation at their home. However, the woman, who recently travelled to Wuhan, was not sick enough to require admission to hospital. The other two cases involve a married couple in San Benito county, the San Benito county public health services announced in a release late on Sunday. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far today on the coronavirus outbreak: 361 people have died in China, one in the Philippines Confirmed infections in China are 17,238 (official Chinese figures include Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau). Outside of China, infections stand at more than 150 (for simplicity of comparison between the numbers, I have removed Taiwan [10], Hong Kong [15] and Macau [8] from this global figure). China\u2019s markets plunged on opening, on the first day of trading since the extended lunar new year. Shanghai fell 8.7%. A Qantas charter flight carrying Australian citizens has departed Wuhan. New Zealand has banned foreign travellers from China from entering. The new hospital in Wuhan, built to accommodate coronavirus patients, is due to open on Monday. The eastern Chinese city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang province on Sunday closed roads and confined people to their homes to try and stop the spread of the virus. Wenzhou, an industrial port city, is 800km (500 miles) from Wuhan, where the health emergency began. It has a population of around three million. Three officials in China\u2019s Zhejiang province are reported to have been \u201cpenalised for their negligence of duty after failing to report seven infected cases\u201d of coronavirus, Chinese state media is reporting. One source of figures on the deaths and infections from the coronavirus that we have been referring to is from Johns Hopkins University in the US. Its tracker shows Chinese and global cases of infections and deaths, including visual representations of the virus. Below is a snapshot of what it\u2019s showing now. The headline figures are: 17,318 confirmed cases globally 362 deaths globally (all in China except one in Philippines) It\u2019s worth noting that they separate out cases in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, whereas the Chinese Health Commission groups them in their figure all under China. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, is also having a torrid time today. It has fallen back through the seven-to-the-dollar mark to trade at its lowest point since December. The higher the number the weaker it is because, unlike with most other currencies, its movements tend to be expressed in yuan rather than the US dollar. For example, the Aussie dollar is usually quoted in US cents \u2013 today it\u2019s standing at US$0.669. Trading in a whole range of commodities has been suspended in China after losses quickly exceeded the daily limit today. The maximum level of losses, known as limit-down in trading parlance, was reached for iron ore, nickel, copper, eggs, palm oil, crude oil and other produce. Here are some images from the state broadcaster CGTN from inside the new hospital built to take coronavirus patients in Wuhan. Back to the markets. The Shenzhen composite is down 9.13% and the yuan has been fixed at its lowest point this year in onshore trade. The Shenzhen market is smaller than the Shanghai one and is made up of smaller, more tech-based companies. It makes the Shenzhen index more like the US Nasdaq. More bad new from China is that factory activity slowed in January, according to data in a closely watched survey released today. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) eased to 51.1 from 51.5 in December, missing expectations but remaining above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for the sixth straight month. Analysts had expected a reading of 51.3. Industrial profits also fell 6.3% on a year earlier to 588.39bn yuan ($85.22bn) in December, official data showed on Monday. China\u2019s acting ambassador to Israel apologised on Sunday after comparing the closure of several national borders to Chinese citizens amid fears of a new virus from China to the turning away of Jewish refugees during the Holocaust, the Associated Press reports. Dai Yuming told reporters at an English-language press conference in Tel Aviv that the \u201cerrors\u201d to limit or even ban entries of Chinese citizens reminded him of the old days, the old stories that happened in the second world war, the Holocaust, the darkest days in human history. The Chinese embassy in Israel later issued a statement saying there was no intention whatsoever to compare the Holocaust with the current situation and the efforts taken by the Israeli government to protect its citizens. \u201cWe would like to apologise if someone understood our message the wrong way,\u201d the embassy said. While trading in Shanghai plunged on opening, Chinese state media is reporting that shares of Improve Medical, which makes face masks, jumped 8.5%. Just some more on the new Wuhan hospital, the Global Times has tweeted photos of military medics waiting to admit the first patients. You can read more on the Chinese stock market\u2019s fall from Martin Farrer here, who says the fall is the biggest daily drop for five years as traders rushed to sell amid continued fears about the impact on the global economy of the coronavirus epidemic. The benchmark Shanghai composite index fell 8.7% at the opening on Monday on a wave of negative sentiment that has built up for 10 days during the long market shutdown for the lunar new year. Stocks in Shanghai have fallen 8.7% at the opening. The maximum allowed before trading is suspended for the day is 10%. So we could be in for a short day. One of the two new hospitals that have been built in Wuhan to cope with the coronavirus is due to start receiving patients today, according to the state-run Global Times. Deutsche Welle\u2019s east Asia correspondent, William Yang, is reporting a Chinese ministry of environment statement announcing it would monitor waste water from hospitals in order to prevent the virus from being spread via human excrement and waste water. We\u2019ve already seen stocks fall across a lot of Asia Pacific this morning amid mounting concerns about the spread of the virus. But the real action will begin in about 20 minutes when trading opens on stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen, which have been closed for 10 days and therefore ringfenced from the heavy selling seen across the world last week. China\u2019s authorities have pumped US$170bn into the financial system in order to try to head off the impact of investors wanting to offload shares. It\u2019s what my colleague Graeme Wearden calls a \u201creverse-repo\u201d operation. He explains it all here: The Chinese news outlet Tencent is reporting new figures on the virus inside China. The outlet, which as been very accurate during the outbreak, now lists deaths at 361 and confirmed infections in China at 17,238. I\u2019m trying to confirm those figures with the Chinese Health Commission, but its website tends to be quite hard to load, which I assume is due to the number of people trying to access it. While we\u2019re on the US, Donald Trump told Fox news the US has offered China \u201ctremendous help\u201d in dealing with the epidemic. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, in a separate interview, said China had been more open about the coronavirus than it has been in previous crises but had not yet accepted US offers of assistance. \u201cSo far the Chinese have been more transparent certainly than in past crises and we appreciate that,\u201d O\u2019Brien said in an interview with CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. He said Beijing has still not responded to US offers of help from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health professionals. \u201cWe\u2019ve got tremendous expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a worldwide concern. We want to help our Chinese colleagues if we can and we\u2019ve made the offer and we\u2019ll see if they accept the offer.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security increased measures to combat the coronavirus on Sunday, directing all flights from China and all passengers who have travelled to China within the last 14 days to be routed through one of eight US airports, effective as of 5pm eastern time in the US. \u201cThree additional airports will be added to the list of airports authorized to receive such flights beginning at various times on Monday, February 3, 2020,\u201d the department said. There will be enhanced screening procedures and the \u201ccapacity to carry quarantine passengers, if needed\u201d, the statement said. The move follows the US decision on 31 January to ban foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks. Meanwhile, Donald Trump appeared to downplay concerns about the impact in the United States of the flu-like virus that has killed 350 people in China and spread to more than two dozen countries, telling Fox television in an interview, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna see what happens, but we did shut it down, yes.\u201d Financial markets are in for a tough day today as the economic uncertainty generated by the virus deepens. Australian shares led the way with a 1.5% fall on the ASX200 in Sydney, while the Nikkei in Tokyo and Kospi in South Korea followed suit with losses of 1.2% and 1.35%. Investors again flocked to safe havens such as gold and government bonds, ditching oil which fell US$0.39 to $56.24 a barrel, the lowest since January 2019. You can read the full story here: New Zealand has closed its borders to any foreigners arriving from China \u2013 including those who have passed through the country in transit \u2013 and boosted its border screening in an attempt to prevent coronavirus arriving in the country. \u201cWe have been advised by health officials that while there are still a range of unknowns in the way the virus is being transmitted, we should take a precautionary approach and temporarily stop travel into New Zealand from mainland China,\u201d Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, told reporters. The ban will be in place for 14 days and reviewed every 48 hours. It follows similar measures taken by other countries, including Australia and the US. There have been no confirmed cases in New Zealand. You can read our full story below. The Qantas flight was scheduled to take off from Wuhan airport at 2am local time, but finally departed at 8.03am. It is estimated to arrive at Learmonth, 1,200km north of Perth, at around 3.30pm local time. Australian citizens onboard a Qantas plane have departed Wuhan. The flight chartered by the Australian government will take them into quarantine on Christmas Island, formerly used as a detention centre for refugees and asylum seekers arriving by boat. The Qantas flight left Wuhan airport around 10 minutes ago. The Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, said about 270 people were being evacuated with some health officials and 18 crew onboard. \u201cOf course it\u2019s pretty complex. The Wuhan airport had been closed for a while. So we expected that it might take longer on the ground, and we have planned for that,\u201d Joyce told ABC radio. The Qantas flight will go to an air force base in Western Australia, from where the government will fly the passengers to Christmas Island, 1,500km (900 miles) from the mainland. With the death toll climbing to 360, it has passed the fatalities recorded in China for the Sars epidemic (349). China\u2019s Global TV network published this graph showing the progression of infections in Hubei province and Wuhan. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. News just coming out of China is that the number of fatalities for the virus has now passed that of the Sars epidemic. Authorities announced a short time ago that 360 people are now known to have died in China, with confirmed cases standing at 16,615. One person is also known to have died in the Philippines \u2013 the first outside China. The person who died was a a 44-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan. There\u2019s anger in China over footage of government officials in Wuhan appearing to take face masks intended for health workers. New Zealand has announced it\u2019s closing its borders to foreign travellers from China, following in the footsteps of several other countries, including neighbouring Australia. More international evacuations are expected take place today, including of Australians from Wuhan. You can get in touch with me at alison.rourke@theguardian.com or on Twitter @AlisonRourke",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The outbreak was first detected by authorities in December, though they did not sound the alarm until more than a month later.

Those who fail to perform their duties \u201cwould be punished\u201d.</p> \n<p>In the meeting, Xi emphasised the importance of guiding public opinion \u201conline and offline, in small and large matters\u2026 to instil confidence and warm the public\u2019s heart.\u201d</p> \n<p>A government directive in January also called on townships and villages to \u201cstrengthen efforts to keep tabs on people\u201d by treating communities as grids and \u201cmonitoring \u2026 the people within them\u201d, according to the blog China Law Translate.</p> \n<p>In Beijing and other cities, neighbourhood committees go door to door asking if anyone has recently returned from Hubei province. Residents must submit to temperature checks and sign in when they enter and leave. In some compounds, they are asked to scan a QR code to log their details. Big data has been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-marshals-the-power-of-its-surveillance-state-in-fight-against-coronavirus-11580831633\">used to track people</a> infected with the virus, showing what public transportation they have used and who they might have infected. </p> \n<p>In the city of Guyuan, in the north-western province of Ningxia, authorities said on Sunday that all stores, markets, hotels and pharmacies must make sure there are no more than 25 people per 100 sq meters of space.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/01/interactive-coronavirus-tracker\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Two cities have gone beyond current restrictions on citizens in Wuhan and surrounding areas to restrict people\u2019s movements.

To get around restrictions, internet users have also created Github pages and post screenshots of censored articles or content on blocked websites.</p> \n<p>Increasingly, some of this criticism is being aimed at Xi, who said in January that he was \u201cpersonally commanding and deploying\u201d the management of the crisis. Internet users, noting that Xi has not visited the frontline of the outbreak in Hubei, have begun to use the term as a catchphrase for hypocritical behaviour.</p> \n<p>Drones have been used to supervise residents disobeying health advice in other parts of China. In Jiangsu province, a police officer used a drone to reprimand pedestrians without face masks.</p> \n<p>In one video clip, she flies the machine over surprised residents.

At a meeting on the virus for top leaders on Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said that all levels of the party and government \u201cmust firmly obey\u201d the central party committee in combatting the virus, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Those who fail to perform their duties \u201cwould be punished\u201d. In the meeting, Xi emphasised the importance of guiding public opinion \u201conline and offline, in small and large matters\u2026 to instil confidence and warm the public\u2019s heart.\u201d A government directive in January also called on townships and villages to \u201cstrengthen efforts to keep tabs on people\u201d by treating communities as grids and \u201cmonitoring \u2026 the people within them\u201d, according to the blog China Law Translate. In Beijing and other cities, neighbourhood committees go door to door asking if anyone has recently returned from Hubei province. Residents must submit to temperature checks and sign in when they enter and leave. In some compounds, they are asked to scan a QR code to log their details. Big data has been used to track people infected with the virus, showing what public transportation they have used and who they might have infected. In the city of Guyuan, in the north-western province of Ningxia, authorities said on Sunday that all stores, markets, hotels and pharmacies must make sure there are no more than 25 people per 100 sq meters of space. Two cities have gone beyond current restrictions on citizens in Wuhan and surrounding areas to restrict people\u2019s movements. In Wenzhou, in Zhejiang province, as well as Huanggang in Hubei province, only one member of each household is allowed to leave every two days to buy food and other necessities. Observers and human rights groups say authorities are going too far. \u201cViolating the rights of tens of millions of people in the effort to address the coronavirus outbreak will be counterproductive,\u201d Yaqiu Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement last week. \u201cTransparency and engaging civil society will be the far better approach.\u201d The advocacy group Chinese Human Rights Defenders has documented 254 cases of citizens being penalised by authorities for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d about the coronavirus between 22 and 28 January. Observers believe some of these controls could last beyond the current crisis, fitting the current trajectory under Xi, who has ramped up the party\u2019s control over the country while clamping down on civil society, academia and even moderate forms of dissent. \u201cTighter control over individuals, press controls, using hi-tech methods to keep track of people \u2013 these kinds of things will be exacerbated after the epidemic,\u201d Lam said. Citizens, frustrated at government officials, appear to be emboldened by the current crisis. To get around restrictions, internet users have also created Github pages and post screenshots of censored articles or content on blocked websites. Increasingly, some of this criticism is being aimed at Xi, who said in January that he was \u201cpersonally commanding and deploying\u201d the management of the crisis. Internet users, noting that Xi has not visited the frontline of the outbreak in Hubei, have begun to use the term as a catchphrase for hypocritical behaviour. Drones have been used to supervise residents disobeying health advice in other parts of China. In Jiangsu province, a police officer used a drone to reprimand pedestrians without face masks. In one video clip, she flies the machine over surprised residents. To one group she says: \u201cHey you pretty girls eating food and walking, please put on your masks. You can eat when you get home.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Chinese stock market suffered a 7.7% fall when it reopened today after the extended lunar new year break, while Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell by 1%. However, in Europe and the US markets traded higher after steep losses last week, as traders took some comfort from measures taken by Chinese authorities to contain the deadly coronavirus (even as its death toll rose further), alongside the People\u2019s Bank of China\u2019s injection of liquidity into money markets. FTSE 100 index in London up more than 50 points at 7337.30, a 0.7% gain Dax in Frankfurt up 20 points at 13,002, a 0.15% gain CAC 40 in Paris up 21 points at 5828, a 0.37% gain FTSE MiB in Milan up 174 points at 23413, a 0.76% gain On Wall Street: Dow Jones up 180 points at 28,436, a 0.64% gain S&amp;P 500 up 23 points at 3248, a 0.72% gain Nasdaq up 85 points at 9236, a 0.93% gain On currency markets, the pound fell sharply as Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, and Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, set out their negotiating positions ahead of trade talks next month. Johnson\u2019s comments revived fears of a no-deal Brexit. Sterling is down 1.3% against the dollar at $1.3028, and has lost 0.88% against the euro, at \u20ac1.1795. With this, we are saying good-bye. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Wilson has summarised the two positions. The EU position is as follows: Both the EU and UK must agree on level playing field. EU offer is conditional on open, fair competition \u2013 application of EU state aid rules. Disputes to be decided by European court. UK financial services will no longer have passporting rights. This is a big, big area for the UK to negotiate on. FTA would need to include deal on fisheries. Gibraltar not part of any deal. Britain\u2019s position is so at odds with the EU that even the basis for a deal has not been reached. The UK says there is no need to follow the EU\u2019s rules, no need to bind UK to agreement. UK needs full legal autonomy \u2013 i.e. not bound by EU court. Ready to consider fishing deal \u2013 proposes annual negotiations with EU fishing, which seems unlikely to wash with the EU. Negotiating on behalf of UK family, which includes Gibraltar. On the plus side, the EU believes it will not need individual approval from member state parliaments for whatever deal is struck. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, has looked at the Barnier-Johnson clash, which caused sterling to sell off. The pound is now down 1.3% against the dollar and 0.96% lower against the euro, as Brussels and London set out their negotiating positions ahead of trade talks next month. The way the two sides have come out, traders are starting to consider no-deal risks again. No deal is not the base case by any means but the EU and UK look in very different places right now at the start of talks. It\u2019s going to be a very long and rocky road to get there and the shape of the deal will hinge on some important concessions on both sides. The British government has come out swinging over the weekend with plenty of fighting talk, but they\u2019re up against a tough opponent. There are several sticking points we can see right now, some of the most obvious ones are outlined but can be summed up as simply that the EU wants the UK to adhere to its rules and its courts, which the UK won\u2019t do. So we are left at present at something of an impasse before the talks even begin. What we should remember is that, as in all negotiations, these views are the starting point, not the final destination. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has opened more than 60 points higher at 28,319, a 0.23% gain \u2013 not quite as buoyant as hoped. The S&amp;P 500 rose some 10 points, or 0.31%, to 3235 while the Nasdaq climbed almost 40 points, or 0.43%, to 9190. Meanwhile, Hong Kong\u2019s economy shrank by 1.2% last year, according to official figures, when months of pro-democracy protests and global trade wars pushed the city into its first annual recession since the height of the financial crisis in 2009. GDP declined at an annual rate of 2.9% in the fourth quarter, accelerating from the previous quarter\u2019s 2.8% fall. The coronavirus, which has infected at least 15 people in Hong Kong so far, will put further strain on the economy, after Hong Kong\u2019s authorities imposed restrictions on movement between the city and mainland China. On trade, the BBC has done a useful explainer of what a Canada-style free trade agreement is, as one of our readers points out. The CBI, which represents the UK\u2019s biggest businesses, has responded to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. CBI president John Allan said: Business optimism is returning. The right signals about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will turn confidence into investment. The prime minister\u2019s clear, vocal commitment to global free trade and maintaining high standards through a thriving relationship with the EU will help. The challenge is to ensure business confidence is not caught in the crossfire of a tough, public negotiation. Talk of a bare bones deal could pause investment. David Allen Green, a lawyer who is a columnist on law and policy for the Financial Times, has tweeted: However, the death toll from the Wuhan coronavirus has passed that of the 2002-03 Sars virus in mainland China, reaching 361 today. The number of infections also jumped, passing 17,200. On the markets, US stock index futures are pointing to a rebound when Wall Street opens in half an hour. On Friday, the Dow Jones and the S&amp;P 500 index recorded their worst weekly losses in at least five months as the deadly coronavirus spread. Today, Chinese stocks fell 7.7% when Chinese stock markets reopened following the extended lunar new year holiday, as they caught up with stocks around the world. But on Wall Street, the Dow Jones is expected to open nearly 140 points, or 0.5%, higher, as investors have taken some comfort from steps taken by Chinese authorities to mitigate the economic impact of the virus outbreak. The People\u2019s Bank of China cut interest rates and injected 1.2 trillion yuan ($173bn) into money markets through reverse bond repurchase agreements. You can watch Barnier\u2019s speech here: As a reminder, you can follow the latest on the Barnier-Johnson clash on our Brexit live blog. The UK prime minister later said he would walk away from the talks if the EU did not agree to the UK\u2019s demands. Triggering fresh fears of a no-deal Brexit, he said: There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. .... further evidence that next month\u2019s trade talks between London and Brussels are not going to be easy. Sterling is on the back foot today, sinking more than 1% against the dollar after Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator in the Brexit talks, set out their stalls. The pound is down 1.1% at $1.3054 and 0.84% lower against the euro, at \u20ac1.1799. Barnier reminded Johnson that he had already agreed last year in a \u201cvery important\u201d declaration to stay true to EU rules on subsidies and standards. Turning back to trade, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has said that she would be prepared to back changes to the EU\u2019s Lisbon Treaty, the bloc\u2019s legal cornerstone, to strengthen the EU\u2019s competitiveness. She said during a joint press conference with the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz in Berlin: I could well imagine treaty changes should this be necessary. We are required in view of Britain\u2019s exit to strengthen our competitiveness and to act more quickly. Britain\u2019s manufacturing sector showed signs of stabilising last month to emerge from the longest downturn since the financial crisis, according to the latest PMI survey, as reported earlier. Here is our full story: Opec is reportedly considering cutting oil output by around 500,000 barrels per day in order to boost the slump in crude prices, according to Reuters. Demand for oil has fallen amid the coronavirus outbreak, causing prices for benchmark Brent crude to fall by around $10 to $56.47. Reuters said Opec and allies including Russia are considering bringing a ministerial meeting forward from March to 14-15 of February. An Opec &amp; partners panel called the Joint Technical Committee (JTC) has already scheduled a meeting for 4-5 February in Vienna to assess the impact of the virus on demand, the wire service\u2019s sources explained. Reuters adds: The technical panel is likely to make a recommendation on any further action to support the market, the sources said. OPEC+ has been reducing oil supply to support prices, agreeing in December to cut output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March. Its next meeting is scheduled for March 5-6. At midday, sterling has fallen by as much as 1.1% against the US dollar, having briefly dropped below $1.305. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.34% at about 7,310 points. The FTSE 250 has dipped by 0.2%. The EU has published its draft negotiating guidelines for the Brexit trade talks, setting out its stall ahead of discussions starting in earnest. The latest update from Michel Barnier suggests the EU will be \u201cvery demanding\u201d in setting level playing field conditions for any trade deal. You can follow the Barnier\u2019s question and answer session on the politics live blog here: A quick update on UK stocks: there\u2019s not much happening on the blue-chip or mid-cap indices. The FTSE 100 has gained 0.4%, likely aided by sterling\u2019s weakness. The highest riser is Auto Trader, up by 2.8%. On the FTSE 250, up by 0.3%, tech-focused publisher Future (with titles like Tech Radar, What Hifi? and PC Gamer) is the top gainer, up by 8% after it said profits would be better than expected. Shares in Aston Martin have fallen back somewhat, down by 5%, after gaining strongly last week when it agreed a rescue deal. Phillip Inman, one of the The Guardian\u2019s economic writers, who wrote about the likely impact of the Coronavirus on the Chinese and global economies at the weekend, says some of the optimism among City analysts of a quick bounce back are beginning to evaporate. Diana Choyleva, a respected China expert who leads the consultancy Enodo Economics, says 2020 is going to be a bad year for China, however much credit it pumps into the economy to keep businesses and consumers borrowing. She says: The economic fallout from the Wuhan coronavirus, which is more contagious than SARS, is set to be severe. Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive growth rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Beijing will have no choice but to throw money at investment. Even so, the authorities are unlikely to be able to re-energise the economy as they did post-SARS in 2003. China\u2019s structural growth rate has slowed significantly since then, so the short-term hit could well translate into a technical recession. She says the authorities actions so far have been slow considering the speed at which the virus spreads, leading her to estimate that China\u2019s average GDP growth rate fell to 3.7% last year from 7.2% in 2018. From this weak position, and with mountains of historic bad corporate debts to clear, the country is in a weak position from which to recover. Help is also unlikely to come from outside China, she says. \u201cThe sluggish response of officials in Wuhan and the determination of a secretive regime to keep a tight grip on information about the coronavirus is bound to dampen foreign business enthusiasm towards China.\u201d You can read more detail here: The pound is now down by 1% to $1.307 against the US dollar, with tough talk from both sides of the Channel. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, has laid out some new red lines for a trade deal which appear to contradict Boris Johnson\u2019s positions. Kit Juckes, chief global forex strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, said: Brexiteer politicians are moving from celebrating the exit to sounding bold as the trade talk verbal jousts begin. The foreign exchange market is likely to be nervous and with positioning data still suggesting an excessively long speculative position in the market, sterling is vulnerable. The British manufacturing sector performed slightly better than initial figures suggested \u2013 the sector\u2019s output was steady rather than the decline seen in early data. The final reading of the UK manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) came in at 50.0 in December, compared to a flash figure of 49.8, according to IHS Markit. The 50 mark is the point where contraction turns to expansion. Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said: The start of 2020 saw the performance of the UK manufacturing sector stabilise, as receding levels of political uncertainty following the general election aided mild recoveries in new order intakes, employment and business confidence. Improvements were mostly seen via rising consumer demand and renewed input buying by businesses, suggesting that the reduction in uncertainty following the election has encouraged households and businesses to step up spending. In contrast, an ongoing downturn at investment goods producers suggests that the economic certainty required to achieve a full revival in capital spending may still be some way off, likely reflecting lingering uncertainty about the Brexit road-map in the coming year. Speaking of Brexit, Nissan is worth a mention this morning after the Financial Times (\u00a3) reported that the Japanese carmaker had drawn up plans to \u201cdouble down\u201d on the UK in the event of tariffs on car exports following the end of the transition deal. If Nissan were to pursue the plan it would represent positive news for the government, which has had a frosty relationship with the struggling British car industry since the Brexit vote. However, the plans were reportedly only one of several scenarios imagined by the carmaker, whose Sunderland plant is the biggest single car factory in the UK, and the usually reserved carmaker has made voluble warnings against tariffs. Indeed, Gianluca de Ficchy, the chairman of Nissan Europe, said in October that the imposition of a 10% tariff on exports under World Trade Organisation terms would threaten the entire business model in Europe. And the denial from Nissan is pretty emphatic, with worryingly clear implications for workers in Sunderland. Nissan\u2019s spokesman said: We deny such a contingency plan exists. We\u2019ve modeled every possible ramification of Brexit and the fact remains that our entire business both in the UK and in Europe is not sustainable in the event of WTO tariffs. We want our UK team of more than 7,000 people to have the best possible chance of future success, which is why we continue to urge UK and EU negotiators to work collaboratively towards an orderly balanced Brexit that will continue to encourage mutually beneficial trade. That sterling selloff is gaining momentum. The pound has now lost 0.7% against the US dollar and 0.5% against the euro. It is still well within the trading range set on Friday \u2013 but nevertheless it serves as a reminder that there is no end to Brexit uncertainty in sight in the near term. The government\u2019s majority may have allowed it to \u201cget Brexit done\u201d at the end of last week, but there appears to be little respite for anyone hoping the UK\u2019s exit from the EU will not define 2020 as well. Sterling has started the week on the back foot, down by 0.5% against the US dollar and 0.3% against the euro, with positioning around the Brexit trade deal thought to be one of the factors in play. Prime minister Boris Johnson will today lay out his stall in Brexit trade negotiations, refusing close alignment of rules and rejecting the jurisdiction of the European courts. The position will likely not be greeted by the EU, and it sets up a tricky start to a crucial period for determining whether Brexit is a success. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Britain won\u2019t align; the EU demands it. The scene is set for a showdown and a rocky path for negotiations that introduces new headline risk for the pound \u2013 think back to last year and the way GBP pairs were moving around wildly on any report about deal or no deal. Ryanair reported profit after tax of \u20ac88m euros (\u00a374m) for the three months to the end of December, the third quarter of its financial year. The Irish airline upgraded its profit expectations last month in a trading update thanks to higher-than-expected bookings over the festive period. Average fares for the latest quarter rose by 9% and revenue for optional extras like pre-booked seating increased by 21%. The positive financial news came despite the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max, which the company had expected to form a key part of its growth plans. Ryanair has already warned staff that it could be forced to cut jobs because of the delayed arrival of the new planes, which have been banned from the skies since March following two fatal crashes. Asked in a prerecorded video published on Monday about deliveries of the new Max planes, Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary said: What is likely is they will push out that delivery profile with Boeing by at least 12 months. At best that means we will have to roll forward our plans to fly 200m passengers per year ... by at least 12 months, possibly 24. Richard Flood, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said: This is a strong set of results in a seasonally weak part of the year for Ryanair. The reduction in seat capacity across the sector as a result of the failure of a number of airlines should enable Ryanair to maintain strong pricing into the key summer months. The European airline industry faces a large challenge should the coronavirus spread to Europe, and Ryanair would not be immune to such a development. In Europe, where traders have had some time to react to the coronavirus outbreak, shares have gained at the open. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.27%, Germany\u2019s Dax gained 0.3%, and France\u2019s Cac 40 rose by 0.15%. Chinese stock markets plunged on Monday in a delayed investor reaction to the coronavirus outbreak that has seen increasing numbers of confirmed cases. Shares on the Shanghai stock exchange composite index fell by 7.7% to a one-year low, while the CSI 300 index, which tracks the biggest shares in both Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell by 7.9%. Japan\u2019s Topix index fell by 0.7%. Markets had reopened after the extended lunar new year break that started on 23 January, accounting for the strength of the move. The fall was expected following weakening share prices in other countries, with economists expecting the outbreak unsurprisingly to weigh on economic activity. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer, UBS Global Wealth Management, said: While the severity of the onshore sell-off will dominate news headlines on Monday, the flat trade in offshore China equities (Hang Seng \u20130.1%) backs our thesis that today represents more of a catch-up. If anything, we think the magnitude of the sell-off appears less severe than market bear cases ahead of the open. The People\u2019s Bank of China was seen by economists as helping to prevent a deeper rout, after it responded to the outbreak over the weekend with measures to keep markets moving that included a \u00a3130bn stimulus package. The central bank also on Monday made unusual comments on the stock market, saying that it expected markets to return to a rational state in the long run. Ian Williams, an economist at Peel Hunt, the stock broker, said: China\u2019s authorities have demonstrated their determination to deal with the economic implications of the coronavirus by cutting the key reverse repo rates by 10 basis points [o.1 percentage points] as soon as markets have reopened after the New Year. The move may help sentiment but there is still no urgency to rebuild risk exposure as the virus continues to spread. There was further dispiriting news for economists fixed on China, as manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) data came in weaker than expected, with a reading of 51.1 points against an expectation of 51.3. However, the survey was carried out mostly before the extent of the coronavirus outbreak was known. Meanwhile, Ryanair on Monday said that the effects of the ongoing Boeing 737 Max crisis will continue to impact it for as long as two years. The Irish budget carrier is one of the biggest customers of the grounded jet. In a video message on Monday chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary suggested Boeing\u2019s delivery schedule could ultimately be up to two years late, meaning it may hit its long-term 200m passenger target by March 2026 rather than March 2024. The agenda 9:55am GMT: Germany manufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) (January) 10am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI (January) 10:30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI (January)",

      "bodyText": "The impact of the coronavirus combined with the ongoing bushfire across the eastern and southern states has clearly thrown the start of the year into economic turmoil. But does it mean a recession is coming, and if it means no budget surplus, does that really matter? One of the problems of being a relatively small economy compared with the US, China and the EU is that we are very much subject to the fortunes of economies abroad. When asked about the prospects of a surplus, Josh Frydenberg explained to David Speers on ABC\u2019s Insiders: \u201cWhat we do know is that these events outside of our control are going to have a significant impact on the Australian economy.\u201d Oddly, such an excuse has never been accepted by the LNP to explain why the budget went into deficit during the GFC. Times may change but hypocrisy never does when it comes to economic debate. It is clear that the chances of a surplus have taken a hit, but we should note that Frydenberg\u2019s attempt to suggest the government\u2019s spending on bushfire recovery is a big factor is complete tosh. Frydenberg told Speers that \u201cas for delivering the surplus, our first focus is on delivering the support to the people who need it most. That\u2019s why the prime minister in an unprecedented response announced a $2bn bushfire recovery\u201d. Except the current projected surplus for this financial year is $5bn, and of the $2bn bushfire recovery spending just $500m is projected to be spent this year. The budget won\u2019t stay in a deficit because of spending but revenue \u2013 and mostly a drop in projected company tax. We can see this from the share prices of BHP and Riot Tinto: The mining sector has taken a hit since the coronavirus really took hold around 10 days ago, due to a drop in China\u2019s output hitting the need for iron ore and as a result iron ore prices have fallen. Any such falls inevitably flow through to company taxes. But should the budget balance remain in deficit it would purely be a political issue rather than an economic one. And the reason it is a political issue is because the government stupidly has already taken credit for future events. Last March Scott Morrison defended his statement that the government had delivered a surplus, telling Leigh Sales on ABC\u2019s 730 that \u201cWe brought the budget back into surplus next year.\u201d Such a mangling of the tenses deserves to be mocked and is also a nice reminder that hubris is always a dangerous position for a politician to adopt. More important for us is the actual impact on the economy. On this aspect we have already heard talk of a recession. You can understand why, especially given the ban of non-Australian citizens and residents travelling from China for 14 days. It really could not be worse timing. Each year February is the biggest month for arrivals from China. Last year there were 206,300 Chinese arrivals to Australia in February \u2013 nearly 15% of all Chinese arrivals last year: The reason is not because Chinese think February is a great time to holiday in Australia, but because February is when the university and college years begin. China is the biggest market for international students coming to Australia. Last year some 260,500 Chinese were enrolled in education in Australia \u2013 more than a quarter of all international students: So right now universities around Australia are trying to work out how they are going to deal with this \u2013 especially if the ban goes for more than two weeks. The hit is not just to the education sector, but also the loss of rents for accommodation and retail trade that will take a hit at a time when it is already struggling due to the bushfires. The hit to education and mining will likely cause our exports to drop in the March and possibly the June quarter: In the September quarter last year, net exports accounted for 0.2% points of the 0.4% growth of GDP \u2013 effectively half of economic growth. Should we have a sudden fall in such exports, then our already meagre GDP growth will go perilously close to, if not into, negative territory. We saw this in 2003 when the Sars outbreak hit out net exports. Back then the contribution of net exports to GDP growth fell around 0.25% points. At that time it didn\u2019t matter too much because we had massive amounts of mining investment; now we don\u2019t: Certainly since the coronavirus outbreak the market has become much more sure that the Reserve Bank will need to cut interest rates to prop up the economy \u2013 there is now a better than 50% chance of two cuts in the cash rate by this time next year: So all in all, not good news. But I think we should pump the breaks a bit on talk of a recession. Of course whenever you hear that term in the media it is referring to two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth \u2013 the so-called \u201ctechnical recession\u201d (although there\u2019s nothing technical about it) . Two such negative quarters are certainly a real possibility given our reliance on exports to sustain overall growth. But I have long been loath to use such a simplistic definition. I prefer to also look at the impact on employment. For me you cannot have a recession with just negative GDP growth if unemployment is not also rising \u2013 and rising at least 1% point in a 12 month period. Right now there is little change in the unemployment rate, and while there are few signs of improvement, neither are there any great warning signs that unemployment is about to jump. The latest building approvals figures out on Monday showed a nice increase in the trend rate of private-sector approvals off the back of big rises in approvals for apartments: That is a very good sign for the construction sector and suggests that while the economy remains relatively tepid, it is not all gloom and doom. The bushfires and the coronavirus will almost certainly cause a hit to the economy and the budget balance. It will also most likely mean the Reserve Bank will need to cut rates again earlier than it otherwise might have wished. But talk of a recession is a bit premature. And even if a \u201ctechnical recession\u201d occurs, given the big hit will be on the mining sector, which is not a large employer, it is far too early to be starting to predict anywhere near the level of job losses usually associated with a recession. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

A source has called to say that Downing Street holds regular briefings twice a day that are open to all lobby journalists, but that it also reserves the right to \u201cbrief journalists exclusively or in different groups whenever we wish\u201d and that some briefings have been taking place on this basis for the last six months. He claimed that in the past people invited to \u201cinner lobby\u201d briefings had not complained, and that some of them said it was helpful to attend briefings in smaller groups. He said this was a system that allowed Downing Street to provide extra information for the more serious, heavyweight journalists.</p> <p>Political journalists object to this system because it seems like an attempt to punish the news organisations most critical of the government by cutting off their access to information. The source said he totally rejected that suggestion. He pointed out that the Guardian was invited to today\u2019s briefing, as well as the Times, the BBC, ITV and Sky. He also said that there were selective lobby briefings when Theresa May was prime minister.</p> <p>In fact, the practice goes back much further than that. Years ago I wrote <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Obscure-Scribblers-History-Parliamentary-Reporting/dp/1842750615/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=andrew+sparrow&amp;qid=1580744795&amp;sr=8-1\">a history of the lobby</a>, and this was happening in the 1960s, when the term \u201cwhite commonwealth\u201d was used to describe those journalists favoured by Harold Wilson who were given special access during his premiership.

But the outline story is relatively simple; Johnson and Barnier have set out their opening bids, and what they have said has made it clear that a deep disagreement on two issues could derail the talks.</p> <p>Those two issues are level playing field provisions, and fishing. Barnier identified them as the two key issues in his opening speech. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are ready to offer a highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership ...</p> <p>But because of our geographical proximity and economic interdependence, our draft mandate also makes clear that this exceptional offer is conditional on at least two things. </p> <p>First, we need to make sure competition is and remains open, and fair. We have already agreed with Prime Minister Johnson that our future partnership will prevent, and I quote, \u201cunfair competitive advantages\u201d. We must now agree on specific and effective guarantees to ensure a level playing field over the long term.</p> <p>That means mechanisms to uphold the high standards we have in social, environmental climate, tax and state aid matters today, and in their future developments.</p> <p>Second, our free trade agreement must include an agreement on fisheries. This agreement should provide for continued, reciprocal access to markets and to waters with stable quota shares. </p> <p>If you can agree on this, as well as on robust commitment towards a level playing field, and the necessary enforcement regime, because it in, we will achieve a very ambitious free and fair trade agreement.</p> </blockquote> <p>The concept of a \u201clevel playing field [LPF]\u201d is a broad one and it can encompass anything from non-regression (not going back on standards that currently apply) to dynamic alignment (promising to match new standards imposed by the EU). What was most significant about what Barnier had to say on this was that he seemed to be holding out for something at the dynamic alignment end of the spectrum; the LPF rules would have to apply \u201cover the long term\u201d, he said, and there would have to be a mechanism to uphold standards applying now \u201cand in their future developments\u201d. </p> <p>Johnson said he did not accept the need for these sorts of LPF provisions. In his speech he said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. </p> <p>The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas \u2013 better, in many respects, than those of the EU \u2013 without the compulsion of a treaty. </p> <p>And it is vital to say this now clearly because we have so often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or a free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, like the Canada deal. </p> <p>Well folks, I hope you\u2019ve got the message by now. We have made our choice: we want a comprehensive free trade agreement, similar to Canada\u2019s. </p> </blockquote> <p>It is worth pointing out that saying there is no need to accept alignment with EU rules (which is what Johnson said in the speech) is not the same as categorically ruling one out.

They are not all the same.</p> <p>He says an FTA is the objective. \u201cWhere there is a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d But the UK is constrained by the decision, \u201cif it is confirmed\u201d, to leave the customs union and single market by the end of the year.</p> <p>(It is interesting that Barnier still seems to think this is in doubt. Boris Johnson has been adamant that the UK is leaving the single market and the customs union.)</p> <p>He says every FTA model is different.</p> <p>He says there should be no surprise on the British side about the demand for level playing field conditions. The <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta-political/files/revised_political_declaration.pdf\">political declaration (pdf)</a> is quite clear about this, he says.</p> <p>Barnier refers to some of the language in paragraph 77. He does not read the whole thing out, but for the record this is what it says.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Given the Union and the United Kingdom\u2019s geographic proximity and economic interdependence, the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field. The precise nature of commitments should be commensurate with the scope and depth of the future relationship and the economic connectedness of the parties. These commitments should prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages. To that end, the Parties should uphold the common high standards applicable in the Union and the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters.</p> </blockquote> <p>He says the detail of the mechanism for a level playing field will be discussed in the negotiation.</p> <p>But the EU will be \u201cvery demanding\u201d in this area. He says a level playing field will be \u201cthe key\u201d to opening up the EU market.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T11:08:48.631Z\">at 11.08am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e37f92c8f08e1332473c0af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T10:43:27.286Z\">10.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Times\u2019s <strong>Steven Swinford</strong> has flagged up what the EU document says about fishing, which will probably be an early flashpoint in the talks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1224281918625189889\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s the EU&#39;s demand for access to Britain&#39;s fishing waters in black and white<br><br>&#39;The objective on fisheries should be to uphold Union fishing activities. <br><br>&#39;It should aim to avoid economic dislocation for Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in UK waters&#39; <a href=\"https://t.co/qbu4g6HKg0\">pic.twitter.com/qbu4g6HKg0</a></p>&mdash; Steven Swinford (@Steven_Swinford) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Steven_Swinford/status/1224281918625189889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 3, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T10:51:21.107Z\">at 10.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e37f8ca8f086a28115a4825\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T10:42:48.666Z\">10.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says he wants to negotiate in a spirit of mutual respect and professionalism.</p> <p>He is now introducing senior members of his team.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e37f8aa8f0811db2faf0528\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-03T10:41:10.619Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says he will continue a dialogue with national parliaments in the EU27.

On Friday night, as the UK was formally leaving the EU, <strong>Boris Johnson </strong>said he wanted this to be \u201cthe start of a new era of friendly cooperation\u201d between Britain and the EU. But less than 72 hours into our new existence as an \u201cindependent\u201d state (actually, for the next 11 months the UK is still paying into the EU\u2019s budget, and still bound by EU law, but with no say over what the EU does, so \u201cvassal state\u201d would be a more accurate description), Johnson is about to give a speech setting out conditions for the forthcoming trade talks that could potentially poleaxe the prospects of a wide-ranging deal from the start. As we report in our overnight story, he is going to rule out the UK committing to remaining aligned to EU rules - even though the EU says there will have to be a \u201clevel playing field\u201d if the UK wants zero tariff and zero quota access to its markets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/02/uk-refuse-close-alignment-eu-rules-boris-johnson-trade\">UK will refuse close alignment with EU rules, Johnson to say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson has ruled out extending the post-Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020 and so, if there is no trade deal, the UK will revert to trading with the EU on WTO terms. This would be much the same as the no-deal Brexit MPs were so alarmed about in the last parliament (although not exactly the same, because the withdrawal agreement has been passed, and so Northern Ireland and citizens\u2019 rights have been settled). But ministers are refusing to talk about the concept of a no-deal Brexit any more. In his speech today, Johnson will describe this prospect as akin to an Australian-style arrangement. (Australia does not have a free trade deal with the EU, but Britons have a positive view of Australia as a country, and so the concept does not sound as scary as \u201cno deal\u201d). And in an interview this morning on Sky News <strong>Rishi Sunak,</strong> the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that \u201cno deal\u201d was no longer a prospect. When asked if it was still on the table, he replied:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No. We have a deal, and we have now left the EU. So that is now just off the table.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sunak was referring to the withdrawal agreement deal.</p> <p>But Sunak also confirmed that the UK could leave the transition period without a trade deal with the EU. When the presenter, <strong>Kay Burley,</strong> put it to him that the UK needed to do a trade deal with the EU, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We don\u2019t need to. We have left ... There are lots of different ways that countries trade with each other. We trade with lots of countries around the world, the EU trades with lots of countries around the world. They trade with some countries as part of the customs union. They trade with other countries, like Canada, through a free trade agreement. And they trade with countries like Australia with specific little agreements here and there for sectors. So there are a range of options we can pursue.</p> <p>So either we will get a free trade agreement, that we have said that we would like. And that\u2019s what they have offered in the past, so I\u2019m hopeful that they make good on that. Or else we will trade on the basis of the terms that are already negotiated, like Australia and like many other countries. But either way I think people should feel very confident about our future.</p> </blockquote> <p>This contradicts what Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, was saying just after the general election. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/15/michael-gove-promises-brexit-trade-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-2020\">He said on 15 December he was certain there would be a trade deal</a>.</p> <p>Sunak also insisted that trade was not the only factor that would decide whether the UK economy prospered in the future. He told Burley:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Trade is important, of course it is. But it\u2019s only one part of what\u2019s going to drive our economy forward. All the other things we are doing to invest in infrastructure, R&amp;D, education, to unite and level up across the country, all those things are going to make a tangible difference to people\u2019s quality of life over the coming years as well. </p> </blockquote> <p>There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda.</p> <p><em>10am (UK time):</em> Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, holds a press conference to mark the publication of the EU\u2019s draft negotiating guidelines for the proposed UK-EU trade deal.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, have set out the extent of the gulf separating the two sides in the forthcoming UK-EU trade talks in rival speeches setting out their respective approaches. (See 12.38pm.) There is a summary of what Barnier said here, at 2.10pm, and a summary of what Johnson said here, at 4.15pm. The pound fell on Monday after Boris Johnson warned that Britain would not accept alignment with EU rules in any Brexit trade deal, while Brussels threatened to put tariffs on UK goods unless he complies. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, has told MPs that the government will introduce emergency legislation to end the automatic release of terrorist offenders after serving half their sentence in prison. Buckland is still speaking, and my colleague Haroon Siddique is covering what he is saying in the Streatham attack live blog. You can read it here. Political journalists have boycotted a briefing at No 10 Downing Street after one of Boris Johnson\u2019s aides banned selected reporters from attending. Nissan has reportedly drawn up contingency plans to pull out of manufacturing in mainland Europe in the event of a hard Brexit in favour of ramping up its production in the UK. NHS leaders have urged Boris Johnson\u2019s government to build 100 new hospitals and give the service an extra \u00a37bn a year for new facilities and equipment. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. And this is from Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture secretary, on the Downing Street walkout. She said: Press freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy and journalists must be able to hold the government to account. It is concerning that Boris Johnson seems to be resorting to tactics imported from Donald Trump to hide from scrutiny. The future trade agreement with the European Union is an issue of great public importance and interest. Those gaining access to such important information should not be cherry picked by Number 10. Back to the Downing Street lobby walkout, and these are from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, says Dominic Raab was unable to tell him in the Commons which minister will be in charge of the Brexit trade talks. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, has said that it was hypocritical of Boris Johnson to be declaring his support for free trade while at the same time making trade with the EU harder. (See 4.15pm.) Commenting on Johnson\u2019s speech, Davey said: Paying lip-service to free trade after taking us out of the largest free trade zone in the world is nothing short of hypocrisy. All it shows is that Johnson is happy to jeopardise our trade with the EU for political gain. Refusing to practically commit to a level playing field is simply not a serious negotiating strategy. Boris is gearing up for no-deal masqueraded as an Australian-style agreement, that will hollow out our trade. The Liberal Democrats will continue to oppose his dangerous plans and fight to maintain our most important trading relationship. In the Commons Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, used a statement earlier to say that the government\u2019s post-Brexit \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d policy would be based on the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of being a good ally, a defence of free trade and doing good in the world. Paul Blomfield, the shadow Brexit minister, said that the government\u2019s willingness to contemplate the UK exiting the post-Brexit transition without a trade deal with the EU (see 9.21am) showed that \u201cideology has trumped common sense\u201d. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has told MPs that Public Health England has launched an information campaign urging the public to \u201chelp by taking simple steps to minimise the risk to themselves and their families\u201d from Wuhan coronavirus. In a Commons statement, he said: This afternoon, health ministers from G7 countries spoke and we agreed to coordinate our evidence and response wherever possible. Currently the number of cases is doubling around every five days and it\u2019s clear that the virus will be with us for at least some months to come. This is a marathon, not a sprint. And here (a bit later than normal) are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s speech (full text here) and Q&amp;A. Boris Johnson said he did not see why the UK should agree to remain aligned with EU rules after Brexit. Addressing what may turn out to be the key faultline in the UK-EU trade talks, he said the UK would not be insisting on the EU remaining aligned to its rules. He went on: So I hope our friends will understand that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas \u2013 better, in many respects, than those of the EU \u2013 without the compulsion of a treaty. He mocked claims that the UK was only being \u201csaved from Dickensian squalor\u201d by EU regulations. Arguing that UK minimum standards on paid paternity leave, flexible working and paid maternity leave are better than the EU\u2019s, he said: I dispel the absurd caricature of Britain as a nation bent on the slash and burn of workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection, as if we are saved from Dickensian squalor only by enlightened EU regulation, as if it was only thanks to Brussels that we are not preparing to send children back up chimneys. In one field after another, Britain is far ahead. He said the UK would only negotiate EU access to British fishing waters after Brexit on an annual basis. (See 12.38pm.) He called for an end to \u201chysterical\u201d fears about US food coming to the UK as part of a post-Brexit trade deal. He also implicitly criticised the Trump administration when he said governments around the world were becoming increasingly hostile to the concept of free trade. He said: From Brussels to China to Washington tariffs are being waved around like cudgels even in debates on foreign policy where frankly they have no place - and there is an ever growing proliferation of non-tariff barriers and the resulting tensions are letting the air out of the tyres of the world economy. He refused to use the word Brexit in his speech, and claimed in the Q&amp;A (see 11.44am) that he did not need to use the word because Brexit was over. He said he wanted the UK to champion the case for free trade around the world. He said: We are re-emerging after decades of hibernation as a campaigner for global free trade. And frankly it is not a moment too soon because the argument for this fundamental liberty is now not being made. We in the global community are in danger of forgetting the key insight of those great Scottish thinkers, the invisible hand of Adam Smith, and of course David Ricardo\u2019s more subtle but indispensable principle of comparative advantage, which teaches that if countries learn to specialise and exchange then overall wealth will increase and productivity will increase, leading Cobden to conclude that free trade is God\u2019s diplomacy \u2013 the only certain way of uniting people in the bonds of peace since the more freely goods cross borders the less likely it is that troops will ever cross borders. Johnson made this argument despite the fact that the government now accepts that, as a result of Brexit, goods will no longer cross the border into the EU as freely as they used to. He said the government wanted to stop criminals currently in jail for terrorist offences getting automatic early release without proper screening. Stressing the need for new rules for those convicted of terrorist offences, he said: The difficulty is how to apply that retrospectively to the cohort of people who currently qualify. We do think it\u2019s time to take action to ensure that people, irrespective of the law we\u2019re bringing in, people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release, people convicted of terrorist offences. I hope people understand that the anomaly we need to clear up is the process by which some people are still coming out under automatic early release without any kind of scrutiny or parole system. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the former Guardian political editor. The existence of \u201cinner lobby\u201d (see 3.48pm) has come as something of a surprise to political journalists. I had never heard the term until this afternoon. And these are from Paul Waugh and Kevin Schofield from HuffPost and Politics Home respectively \u2013 two of the organisations excluded from the briefing called this afternoon. Colleagues can recall No 10 holding a selective briefing during the Conservative party conference, but it is not unusual for political parties to brief selectively. And there was a selective \u201cinner lobby\u201d briefing last week. In the Guardian office we can\u2019t think of any others \u2013 but maybe we weren\u2019t invited. No 10 says the meeting boycotted by political journalists earlier was part of a system called \u201cinner lobby\u201d that it has been operating since Boris Johnson became prime minister. A source has called to say that Downing Street holds regular briefings twice a day that are open to all lobby journalists, but that it also reserves the right to \u201cbrief journalists exclusively or in different groups whenever we wish\u201d and that some briefings have been taking place on this basis for the last six months. He claimed that in the past people invited to \u201cinner lobby\u201d briefings had not complained, and that some of them said it was helpful to attend briefings in smaller groups. He said this was a system that allowed Downing Street to provide extra information for the more serious, heavyweight journalists. Political journalists object to this system because it seems like an attempt to punish the news organisations most critical of the government by cutting off their access to information. The source said he totally rejected that suggestion. He pointed out that the Guardian was invited to today\u2019s briefing, as well as the Times, the BBC, ITV and Sky. He also said that there were selective lobby briefings when Theresa May was prime minister. In fact, the practice goes back much further than that. Years ago I wrote a history of the lobby, and this was happening in the 1960s, when the term \u201cwhite commonwealth\u201d was used to describe those journalists favoured by Harold Wilson who were given special access during his premiership. If my memory serves me right, that initiative eventually fizzled out after Wilson decided that it caused more trouble than it was worth. In response to my colleague Rowena Mason\u2019s report about political journalists boycotting a No 10 briefing after Downing Street tried to exclude certain news organisations (see 2.52pm), a senior No 10 source has been in touch to say that there was a normal briefing for all lobby journalists after the PM\u2019s speech but that the later one was a \u201csmaller, selected briefing for specialist senior journalists\u201d. The source said that \u201ca number of uninvited journalists barged into No 10 and demanded to be part of it\u201d but they were told they could not attend. This account implies that those who were invited to attend were specialists, and that those who were not invited did not have the same specialist background. In fact, all those involved \u2013 those invited, and those not invited \u2013 were regular political correspondents. Political journalists walked out of No 10 Downing Street this afternoon in protest at the government planning to give a briefing on the EU only to selected reporters \u2013 banning the Mirror, i, HuffPost, PoliticsHome, Independent and others from attending. Reporters on the invited list were asked to stand on one side of a rug in the foyer of No 10, while those not allowed in were asked by security to stand on the other side. After one of Boris Johnson\u2019s most senior advisers, Lee Cain, told the banned reporters they must leave the building, the rest of the journalists decided to walk out rather than allow Downing Street to choose who scrutinises and reports on the government. Among those who refused the briefing and walked out included the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and political journalists from the Daily Mail, Telegraph, Sun, Financial Times, and Guardian. The briefing was due to be given by government officials, who are meant to be neutral rather than political. The tactics from No 10 mirror those of Donald Trump in the US, who has been known to try to exclude journalists from reporting on his activities, and represents an escalation of Johnson\u2019s tensions with the media, which have been growing in recent weeks. These are from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby on Boris Johnson\u2019s speech. The CBI has said the government should not allow business to be \u201ccaught in the crossfire\u201d of UK-EU trade talks. Responding to Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, CBI president John Allan said: Business optimism is returning. The right signals about the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU will turn confidence into investment. The Prime Minister\u2019s clear, vocal commitment to global free trade and maintaining high standards through a thriving relationship with the EU will help. The challenge is to ensure business confidence is not caught in the crossfire of a tough, public negotiation. Talk of a bare bones deal could pause investment. Here are the main points from Michel Barnier\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A summary. Michel Barnier reminded Boris Johnson that he has already agreed in a \u201cvery important\u201d declaration to stay true to EU rules on subsidies and standards, as Brussels staked its opening negotiating position on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the bloc. Barnier said that the UK would have to meet EU concerns on the level playing field and on fishing if it wants to have an ambitious free trade deal. (See 12.38pm.) He said the EU would be \u201cvery demanding\u201d in relation to level playing field provisions. He said: We don\u2019t want that divergence [being followed by the UK] to become an instrument for unfair competition, whereby there would be disadvantages for EU industry. I can\u2019t get embroiled in the details of the mechanism - that will all be discussed in the negotiation - but we\u2019re going to be paying very close attention, and be very demanding, when it comes to the quality and the credibility of this level playing field mechanism. But he also claimed that the EU was not looking for \u201calignment\u201d from the UK. He said: We are not asking for alignment - I know it is a sort of red rag to the UK. I mention it sparingly if at all. What we are a looking for is consistency. As the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming points out, it was not clear who alignment differs from a level playing field, which the EU is insisting on. He said: UPDATE: The word \u201cconsistency\u201d is in the Press Association report of what Barnier said, but a reader who heard Barnier speak in French has been in touch to say that she thinks he used a different word. Barnier said getting a trade deal would be \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the UK and the EU reaching a deal on fishing. He said: It\u2019s clear that the agreement that we wish to have in the interests of UK fishermen and in the interests of European fishermen - I call that reciprocal access to our territorial waters and our markets - that agreement on fisheries will be inextricably linked to the trade agreement, as indeed will be ... the agreement on the level playing field agreed with Boris Johnson. He said the EU would insist on the European Court of Justice continuing to play a role in certain respects. Referring to security aspects of the negotiation, he said: The UK should commit itself to applying the European Convention on Human Rights. Secondly, the British government should set up adequate standards for data protection - this is an essential concern for the Europeans and this is something that the European parliament is paying a great deal of attention to. Thirdly, any co-operation should be subject to an effective dispute settlement mechanism. Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law, obviously the European Court of Justice should be able to continue its role in full. He said the main agreement being negotiated would not cover Gibraltar. He said: Territorial application of any agreement that we are negotiating will not include the territory of Gibraltar \u2026 The kingdom of Spain will have to be involved and give its agreement to a specific agreement on Gibraltar. At a briefing after Boris Johnson\u2019s speech Downing Street said the concept of a \u201clevel playing field\u201d was \u201cnot a generally accepted one\u201d. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters: Level playing field is an EU concept, it\u2019s not a generally accepted one. Some FTAs [free trade agreements] contain some light provisions on competition, subsidy, environment and the like. Only the EU seeks to export its own laws into these areas and police them itself. And our position is that there is no need to go further than the sort of provisions that the EU has agreed with countries such as Canada to reduce trade distortions. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has expressed reservations about Boris Johnson\u2019s hardline negotiating position. Speaking at a press conference in Cardiff, Drakeford said: The red line approach to negotiation has not served us well during the first phase of leaving the European Union. It doesn\u2019t help to create the flexibility and compromise that any negotiation is bound to involve. Drakeford said Wales would be working hard over the next weeks and months to strengthen its bonds with trading partners. This would include work around the Wales v Ireland rugby match in Dublin on Saturday and events in Berlin, Paris and Brussels in the spring. Drakeford said work was also being done to boost trade between Wales and Canada and the US. He said: We recognise that leaving the European Union means we have to work even harder to make sure that Wales is known, promoted and successful around the world. The pound has fallen sharply today in the light of Boris Johnson\u2019s speech, which has renewed fears of the UK leaving the transition period at the end of the year without a trade deal, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports on the business live blog. Traders clearly aren\u2019t impressed by the notion of an Australian deal, or by the argument that not having a deal is not the same has having no deal. (See 9.48am.) Here is the full text of Boris Johnson speech in Greenwich about the UK-US trade talks. The Times\u2019 Raphael Hogarth thinks the gap between the UK and the EU on alignment might not be as wide as some people think. Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian trade negotiator who now runs the Explain Trade blog, has written a thorough and detailed Twitter feed about the EU\u2019s draft negotiating guidelines for the UK-EU trade talks. It starts here. Downing Street has now published the written ministerial statement from Boris Johnson setting out the government\u2019s ambitions for the UK-EU trade talks. It is an ultra-condensed UK version of the document published by the EU earlier. (See 10.36am.) There are three oral statements in the Commons this afternoon. The first, from Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, will cover the UK-EU trade talks. There is a lot to unpack in the speeches from Boris Johnson and Michel Barnier this morning, and in the draft guidelines for the UK-EU trade negotiation (pdf) published by the EU. But the outline story is relatively simple; Johnson and Barnier have set out their opening bids, and what they have said has made it clear that a deep disagreement on two issues could derail the talks. Those two issues are level playing field provisions, and fishing. Barnier identified them as the two key issues in his opening speech. He said: We are ready to offer a highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership ... But because of our geographical proximity and economic interdependence, our draft mandate also makes clear that this exceptional offer is conditional on at least two things. First, we need to make sure competition is and remains open, and fair. We have already agreed with Prime Minister Johnson that our future partnership will prevent, and I quote, \u201cunfair competitive advantages\u201d. We must now agree on specific and effective guarantees to ensure a level playing field over the long term. That means mechanisms to uphold the high standards we have in social, environmental climate, tax and state aid matters today, and in their future developments. Second, our free trade agreement must include an agreement on fisheries. This agreement should provide for continued, reciprocal access to markets and to waters with stable quota shares. If you can agree on this, as well as on robust commitment towards a level playing field, and the necessary enforcement regime, because it in, we will achieve a very ambitious free and fair trade agreement. The concept of a \u201clevel playing field [LPF]\u201d is a broad one and it can encompass anything from non-regression (not going back on standards that currently apply) to dynamic alignment (promising to match new standards imposed by the EU). What was most significant about what Barnier had to say on this was that he seemed to be holding out for something at the dynamic alignment end of the spectrum; the LPF rules would have to apply \u201cover the long term\u201d, he said, and there would have to be a mechanism to uphold standards applying now \u201cand in their future developments\u201d. Johnson said he did not accept the need for these sorts of LPF provisions. In his speech he said: There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment, or anything similar any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas \u2013 better, in many respects, than those of the EU \u2013 without the compulsion of a treaty. And it is vital to say this now clearly because we have so often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts on the Norway model, or a free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, like the Canada deal. Well folks, I hope you\u2019ve got the message by now. We have made our choice: we want a comprehensive free trade agreement, similar to Canada\u2019s. It is worth pointing out that saying there is no need to accept alignment with EU rules (which is what Johnson said in the speech) is not the same as categorically ruling one out. But he implied very strongly that he would not be willing to sign up to the sort of mechanisms Barnier was proposing. And, on fishing, Johnson said that he would be willing to allow EU boats access to UK waters \u2013 but only on condition that such arrangements were reviewed annually. He said: We are ready to consider an agreement on fisheries, but it must reflect the fact that the UK will be an independent coastal state at the end of this year 2020, controlling our own waters. And under such an agreement, there would be annual negotiations with the EU, using the latest scientific data, ensuring that British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats. The EU want an agreement on fishing that is much more long term. That is what Barnier was referring to when he talked about \u201ccontinued\u201d, reciprocal access, and \u201cstable\u201d quota shares. Johnson says de-radicalising people is a very difficult thing to do. That\u2019s is why he no longer believes in automatic early release, he says. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve come to the end of my patience with the idea of automatic early release. The press conference is now over. I will post a summary soon. Johnson says Scott Morrison (he refers to him as Prime Minister ScoMo, Morrison\u2019s nickname) called him last week to say how important a trade deal with Australia was for him. Q: Will you ensure terrorists offenders are kept in jail until people can be sure they are safe? Johnson says reporters should wait for what Robert Buckland has to say. He says he does not want those offenders released without \u201csome process of scrutiny\u201d. That should involve experienced people being able to look them in the eyes and assess if they are a threat. Johnson suggests that terrorist offenders are going to be subject to new checks before being released. Q: Your speech did not use the word Brexit. Has it been banned? Johnson says it has not been banned. It is not banned, it is just over. It has happened. Q: Would you bring back control orders? Johnson says there has been a lot of talk about this. But he does not want to return to a system involving a lot of laborious surveillance, when a custodial option would have been better. Johnson rules out bringing back control orders. Johnson says he wants a smooth and unobtrusive mechanism for resolving disputes in a trade deal, without involving the European court of justice. Q: Can you tell us more about the \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d about standards that you referred to? (See 11.12am.) Johnson says he means the UK will be governed by science. But he was not dismissing concerns about chlorinated chicken. That is an animal welfare issue, he says. He says the US will have to follow UK animal welfare standards. He says he was referring to some \u201chysterical\u201d claims about US food. He does not think there is a problem with US food, he says. Americans look well nourished to him, he jokes. Q: Will you stand up for Gibraltar? Johnson says he will be negotiating on behalf of the whole UK family, including Gibraltar. Q: Do you accept Australian-style trade deal is a euphemism for no deal? And what is your response to Michel Barnier today saying you should not be surprised about what the EU is saying on a level playing field, because that was set out in the political declaration? Johnson says the political declaration talked about the need for high standards. Q: What will the government do about terrorists in jail? Johnson says there is a real problem here. Do you keep Islamist extremists in jail all together. Or do you isolate them? He says there are few successes here. Q: During the election you said there was no chance of the UK leaving the transition period without a deal. Now will you level with the public, and say that is a real option? Johnson says he is looking forward to getting trade deals with other countries. Before taking questions, Johnson says he wants to say a few words about the Streatham terror attack. He says people want to know why the attacker was out on automatic release. The difficulty is how to apply new rules retrospectively, he says. He says the government wants to stop people \u201cin the current stream\u201d from qualifying for automatic early release. Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, will say more about this shortly, he says. Johnson repeats a point he made during the general election about Wales being closer to Beijing than New Zealand. So it should be exporting more lamb to China, he says, than New Zealand does. (As when he made this point during the election, he ignores the fact that New Zealand is closer by sea, which is how many goods are exported.) Johnson says that, if you combine the government\u2019s commitment to free trade, with its commitment to levelling up the UK, he expects to see the UK exporting more ships, more bone china and more beef. He is complaining now about the US refusing to accept imports of haggis. He does not know how they manage, he says. Johnson says he wants a new relationship that goes beyond trade. For example, he says he wants a deal on aviation, so cheap flights can continue. And he wants a deal on fish, he says. But it must respect the fact that the UK is an independent coastal state, controlling its own waters. He says there will have to be annual negotiations on the EU fishing quotas, using latest scientific data, \u201censuring that British fishing waters are first and foremost for British boats\u201d. Johnson rules out offering EU long-term assurances on fishing access to UK waters. Johnson says the UK is not going to insist that the EU follows all its rules. For instance, it won\u2019t insist that the EU follows UK rules on the use of single-use plastics. It won\u2019t ban German cars or Italian wine unless those countries follow UK plastic rules. He says the EU must understand that \u201cwhat is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander\u201d. He says the UK should not be obliged to accept EU rules in key areas. This is the passage briefed in advance. See 9.48am. Johnson says the UK was also ahead of the EU in legislating to cut carbon emissions. Johnson turns to the EU. He says the UK does not intend to lower standards after it has left the EU. We will not engage in some cut-throat race to the bottom. We are not leaving the EU to undermine standards. We will not engage in dumping. He says France and Germany use state aid more than the UK. If the EU has worries about state aid, it should focus on them. He says in many areas the UK is ahead of the EU in standards, such as in relation to paternity leave, flexible working, and paid maternity leave. The UK has a higher minimum wage than all but three EU member states, he says. And on animal welfare it wants to go further than the EU. And it already has. It banned veal crates 16 years before the EU. And it has taken action on ivory imports to protect elephants. Johnson says he wants to negotiate trade deals with countries the UK turned its back on in the 1970s. And he has a message for the anti-Americans who are unhappy about the idea of a trade deal with the US: \u201cGrow up.\u201d He says conspiracy theorists should accept that the NHS will not be on the table in trade talks with the US. He says the UK will maintain food, hygiene and animal welfare standards. But he says what the UK does will be determined by science, not by \u201cmumbo jumbo\u201d. Johnson says the UK will have to start using muscles it has not used for decades to start negotiating free trade deals. He says Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, tells him she has enough trade negotiators. But if she doesn\u2019t, they will hire some more, he says. Johnson quotes Richard Cobden as saying free trade is \u201cGod\u2019s diplomacy\u201d. He says nothing else has done as much to guarantee prosperity. But this \u201cbeneficial magic\u201d is fading, he says. He says free trade is being choked. He says in Washington tariffs are being waved around like cudgels. And there is a proliferation of non-tariff barriers. Trade used to grow at twice the rate of GDP. But now it barely keeps pace, he says. He says we are starting to hear \u201csome bizarre, autarkic rhetoric\u201d. So the UK needs to make the case for free trade, he says. Michel Barnier is still speaking, but I\u2019m switching now to Boris Johnson, who has just started his speech on the proposed Brexit trade deal. He says this is a moment for the UK to re-emerge as a campaigner for free trade. Q: Do you think the British are acting in bad faith? Barnier says it is not for him to say what the UK will do. But he should not underestimate the scale of what will happen. He says the EU should continue to prepare for all options, including no deal. Barnier turns to Gibraltar. He says this deal will not cover Gibraltar. But that does not rule out parallel negotiations covering Gibraltar. This is what the guidelines say on Gibraltar. Barnier says he has a lot of respect for Boris Johnson. He has a frank relationship with him. He will not make a judgment about his intentions. (He is responding to a question about the possibility of the UK walking away from the talks.) He says Johnson and his team paid a lot of attention \u201cto every word and comma\u201d of the political declaration. That is relevant to what he said a moment ago about the level playing field, he says. (See 10.51am.) Q: Having the ECJ police any deal is a red line for the UK. Why is it so important for the EU for it to play a role? It is not in the Canada deal. Barnier says the deal the EU has in mind will not just be about trade. It will cover security too. If the EU works with the UK on security, there will have to be provisions for the exchange of data, often very personal data. He says the Pr\u00fcm system relates to DNA data. He says that is why the ECJ is so important. Q: Tony Blair talked in an interview about how divergence could be a good thing. Do you think the EU could benefit from the UK diverging? Barnier says he read the Blair interview. He always pays attention to what Blair says, he says. There may be some areas where the EU will allow divergence, he says. But given the concerns expressed by the public, and the anger, \u201cis this really the time to drive things down\u201d, to lower standards? Barnier says he does not think so. He says agriculture and fisheries products could enter the EU without tariffs under a deal. So the EU will want to ensure competition is fair. Barnier is now taking questions. Q: Can you say more about how you would like to see the UK remain aligned to EU rules. And is a Canada-style deal your goal? Barnier says this has never been before. Barnier says every FTA (free trade agreement) contains rights and obligations. They are not all the same. He says an FTA is the objective. \u201cWhere there is a will, there\u2019s a way.\u201d But the UK is constrained by the decision, \u201cif it is confirmed\u201d, to leave the customs union and single market by the end of the year. (It is interesting that Barnier still seems to think this is in doubt. Boris Johnson has been adamant that the UK is leaving the single market and the customs union.) He says every FTA model is different. He says there should be no surprise on the British side about the demand for level playing field conditions. The political declaration (pdf) is quite clear about this, he says. Barnier refers to some of the language in paragraph 77. He does not read the whole thing out, but for the record this is what it says. Given the Union and the United Kingdom\u2019s geographic proximity and economic interdependence, the future relationship must ensure open and fair competition, encompassing robust commitments to ensure a level playing field. The precise nature of commitments should be commensurate with the scope and depth of the future relationship and the economic connectedness of the parties. These commitments should prevent distortions of trade and unfair competitive advantages. To that end, the Parties should uphold the common high standards applicable in the Union and the United Kingdom at the end of the transition period in the areas of state aid, competition, social and employment standards, environment, climate change, and relevant tax matters. He says the detail of the mechanism for a level playing field will be discussed in the negotiation. But the EU will be \u201cvery demanding\u201d in this area. He says a level playing field will be \u201cthe key\u201d to opening up the EU market. The Times\u2019s Steven Swinford has flagged up what the EU document says about fishing, which will probably be an early flashpoint in the talks. Barnier says he wants to negotiate in a spirit of mutual respect and professionalism. He is now introducing senior members of his team. Barnier says he will continue a dialogue with national parliaments in the EU27. And he will continue to speak to other stakeholders, so that they are kept informed. Barnier says the EU will apply a high level of transparency in the process. The draft negotiating guidelines have now been published. Here is the press notice. And here are the draft negotiating directives (pdf). They run to 33 pages, and 167 clauses. Barnier is now turning to the second aspect of the guidelines \u2013 the security partnership. He offers solidarity in the light of the Streatham attack. He says security is not a bargaining chip. He says the EU would like a framework for the exchange of data, and also for cooperation in police matters. Barnier says the EU will consider whether there will be equivalence for financial services, and an adequacy ruling for data protection. Barnier says the EU must know whether the UK intends to diverge in the long run, or whether it intends to stay close to the EU. He says the depth of the deal will depend on the answer to this question. Barnier says there will be no mutual recognition of rules. That means there will be no passporting in the banking sector. Goods entering the EU will be subject to regulatory checks, he says. He says these are the automatic and mechanical consequences of the UK\u2019s choices. Business must adapt now to these conditions, he says. Barnier says exporters must prepare now for border checks. Barnier, who has been speaking in French, switches to English. He says the draft guidelines cover the economic partnership, the security partnership, and the institutional governance framework. On the economic partnership, he says the EU is willing to offer a zero tariff, zero quota deal on goods, and an ambitious deal on services. The EU would like to include digital services, intellectual property, and access to public sector markets. He says the UK would offer competition. Competition is normal, he says. But he says \u201cthis exceptional offer\u201d is conditional on two things. First, competition must be open and fair. There must be a level playing field \u201cover the long term\u201d. That means a mechanism for upholding high standards. Second, there must be a deal on fisheries, involving reciprocal access to waters. Barnier says the UK will no longer be able to benefit from the rights and advantages of EU membership. Barnier says the EU will seek an ambitious partnership with the UK. But it must be \u201cclear-headed\u201d at the same time, he says. The most ambitious partnership is the one that we had, because we were in the same union. He says being out of the EU means the terms for the UK will be \u201cless favourable\u201d. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking at his news conference now. He says the EU is about to publish its draft negotiating guidelines for the trade talks with the UK. They have only just been approved. He says the document will not contain any surprises. The Michel Barnier press conference was due to start at 10am UK time, but there seems to be a hold-up. Now that the UK has left the EU, some of its 73 seats in the European parliament have been redistributed. This chart shows where they have gone. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, said this morning that access to the single market always involves \u201ca mix of rights and obligations\u201d, ZDF\u2019s Stefan Leifert reports. My colleague John Crace, the Guardian\u2019s sketchwriter, is not being allowed to attend the PM\u2019s Brexit speech this morning. No 10 released some extracts from Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on the UK-EU trade talks overnight. Here are the key points. Johnson says the UK will not commit to remaining aligned to EU standards - even though it intends to voluntarily maintain high standards. He is expected to say: There is no need for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar, any more than the EU should be obliged to accept UK rules. The UK will maintain the highest standards in these areas \u2013 better, in many respects, than those of the EU \u2013 without the compulsion of a treaty and it is vital to stress this now. He says the UK wants a Canada-style free trade agreement with the EU, but that it is willing to manage without one. He is expected to say: We have often been told that we must choose between full access to the EU market, along with accepting its rules and courts, on the Norway model, or an ambitious free trade agreement, which opens up markets and avoids the full panoply of EU regulation, on the example of Canada. We have made our choice: we want a free trade agreement, similar to Canada\u2019s but in the very unlikely event that we do not succeed, then our trade will have to be based on our existing withdrawal agreement with the EU. He rejects claims that not having a trade deal amounts to \u201cno deal\u201d. He is expected to say: The choice is emphatically not \u2018deal or no-deal\u2019. The question is whether we agree a trading relationship with the EU comparable to Canada\u2019s \u2013 or more like Australia\u2019s. Here is Sir Ed Davey, the acting Liberal Democrat leader, on the suggestion from No 10 that not having a trade deal with the EU would be the equivalent of an Australian-style deal. (See 9.21am.) Davey said: A deal with the EU \u2018like Australia\u2019s\u2019 is no-deal in all but name. To deliberately hollow out our trade is nothing short of a scorched earth policy for Britain\u2019s economy. This isn\u2019t a vision \u2013 it\u2019s a nightmare. Good morning. On Friday night, as the UK was formally leaving the EU, Boris Johnson said he wanted this to be \u201cthe start of a new era of friendly cooperation\u201d between Britain and the EU. But less than 72 hours into our new existence as an \u201cindependent\u201d state (actually, for the next 11 months the UK is still paying into the EU\u2019s budget, and still bound by EU law, but with no say over what the EU does, so \u201cvassal state\u201d would be a more accurate description), Johnson is about to give a speech setting out conditions for the forthcoming trade talks that could potentially poleaxe the prospects of a wide-ranging deal from the start. As we report in our overnight story, he is going to rule out the UK committing to remaining aligned to EU rules - even though the EU says there will have to be a \u201clevel playing field\u201d if the UK wants zero tariff and zero quota access to its markets. Johnson has ruled out extending the post-Brexit transition beyond the end of 2020 and so, if there is no trade deal, the UK will revert to trading with the EU on WTO terms. This would be much the same as the no-deal Brexit MPs were so alarmed about in the last parliament (although not exactly the same, because the withdrawal agreement has been passed, and so Northern Ireland and citizens\u2019 rights have been settled). But ministers are refusing to talk about the concept of a no-deal Brexit any more. In his speech today, Johnson will describe this prospect as akin to an Australian-style arrangement. (Australia does not have a free trade deal with the EU, but Britons have a positive view of Australia as a country, and so the concept does not sound as scary as \u201cno deal\u201d). And in an interview this morning on Sky News Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, claimed that \u201cno deal\u201d was no longer a prospect. When asked if it was still on the table, he replied: No. We have a deal, and we have now left the EU. So that is now just off the table. Sunak was referring to the withdrawal agreement deal. But Sunak also confirmed that the UK could leave the transition period without a trade deal with the EU. When the presenter, Kay Burley, put it to him that the UK needed to do a trade deal with the EU, he replied: We don\u2019t need to. We have left ... There are lots of different ways that countries trade with each other. We trade with lots of countries around the world, the EU trades with lots of countries around the world. They trade with some countries as part of the customs union. They trade with other countries, like Canada, through a free trade agreement. And they trade with countries like Australia with specific little agreements here and there for sectors. So there are a range of options we can pursue. So either we will get a free trade agreement, that we have said that we would like. And that\u2019s what they have offered in the past, so I\u2019m hopeful that they make good on that. Or else we will trade on the basis of the terms that are already negotiated, like Australia and like many other countries. But either way I think people should feel very confident about our future. This contradicts what Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, was saying just after the general election. He said on 15 December he was certain there would be a trade deal. Sunak also insisted that trade was not the only factor that would decide whether the UK economy prospered in the future. He told Burley: Trade is important, of course it is. But it\u2019s only one part of what\u2019s going to drive our economy forward. All the other things we are doing to invest in infrastructure, R&amp;D, education, to unite and level up across the country, all those things are going to make a tangible difference to people\u2019s quality of life over the coming years as well. There will be a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda. 10am (UK time): Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, holds a press conference to mark the publication of the EU\u2019s draft negotiating guidelines for the proposed UK-EU trade deal. Originally this was supposed to happen at 11am, but Barnier seems to have brought the timing forward so it does not clash with Johnson\u2019s speech. 11am: Boris Johnson gives a speech on the UK\u2019s priorities for the proposed UK-EU trade deal. 1.30pm: Sir Keir Starmer, favourite in the Labour leadership contest, takes part in a webchat on Mumsnet. After 3.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, is expected to make a Commons statement on the government\u2019s response to the Streatham terror attack. After 4.30pm: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, is expected to make a Commons statement on the UK-EU trade talks. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on Brexit, and on the speeches from Johnson and Barnier. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. We are covering political reaction to the Streatham terror attack on a separate live blog. You can read it here. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The plane will first land in Hanoi, Vietnam, and then travel onwards to Wuhan.

Canada has said only citizens who entered China on Canadian passports will be permitted to board the plane, probably preventing permanent residents from leaving Wuhan.</p> \n<p>There is no indication the delay in evacuating citizens is tied to the chilled diplomatic relations between Beijing and Ottawa, stemming from the extradition proceedings of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/huawei-executive-meng-wanzhou-extradition-hearing-vancouver\">Chinese telecoms executive</a>.

After an extended non-trading period, this was the first opportunity investors had to respond to the health emergency and weigh the short-term economic impact. A plunge was inevitable, however much money the Chinese authorities pumped into the banking system to support liquidity.</p> <p>It is harder to understand, though, what we\u2019re meant to conclude from the many detailed studies by City economists and analysts of the behaviour of global stock markets during the Sars crisis of 2002-03. These analyses tend to start with the same observation: that equities initially fell after the outbreak of Sars, but then regained the lost ground within months. What, though, is this fact meant to show?</p> <p>The comparison is, presumably, intended to warn long-term investors against panic. Fair enough, not panicking is a reasonable default position in most market circumstances. But, just as one wouldn\u2019t expect stock market tips from an epidemiologist, so it\u2019s ridiculous for City pundits to push the thesis, however vaguely, that the spread of one viral outbreak might be a bit like another. One suspects the scientists apply more rigour.</p> <p>Second, China is a very different place now than it was in 2003.

      "bodyText": "Monday\u2019s 8% fall in the main Chinese share index was roughly the expected reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. After an extended non-trading period, this was the first opportunity investors had to respond to the health emergency and weigh the short-term economic impact. A plunge was inevitable, however much money the Chinese authorities pumped into the banking system to support liquidity. It is harder to understand, though, what we\u2019re meant to conclude from the many detailed studies by City economists and analysts of the behaviour of global stock markets during the Sars crisis of 2002-03. These analyses tend to start with the same observation: that equities initially fell after the outbreak of Sars, but then regained the lost ground within months. What, though, is this fact meant to show? The comparison is, presumably, intended to warn long-term investors against panic. Fair enough, not panicking is a reasonable default position in most market circumstances. But, just as one wouldn\u2019t expect stock market tips from an epidemiologist, so it\u2019s ridiculous for City pundits to push the thesis, however vaguely, that the spread of one viral outbreak might be a bit like another. One suspects the scientists apply more rigour. Second, China is a very different place now than it was in 2003. Its economy is far larger and more connected with the rest of the world, so economic shocks could be magnified.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 4 February.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Barnaby Joyce will challenge Michael McCormack for the leadership of the Nationals </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/03/matt-canavan-quits-cabinet-to-back-barnaby-joyce-for-national-party-leadership\">when a party room spill is called on Tuesday</a>, saying he has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/03/rural-women-warn-nationals-not-to-restore-barnaby-joyce-to-leadership\">learned from his past mistakes</a> and is the best person to lead the party to the next election. The former leader\u2019s tilt at a comeback won support from the cabinet minister Matt Canavan on Monday night, with the Queensland senator resigning his position to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/03/rural-women-warn-nationals-not-to-restore-barnaby-joyce-to-leadership\">back Joyce</a> in the leadership ballot. Joyce phoned McCormack on Monday afternoon to inform him that there would be a spill of the leader\u2019s position when MPs meet in Canberra for the first day of the parliamentary year, saying \u201cWe have to speak with our own voice, we have to drive agendas.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>US House impeachment managers made impassioned closing arguments before the Senate on Monday</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/03/trump-impeachment-trial-closing-arguments\">urging it to hold the president to account</a>. Almost every Republican in the audience held fast behind Donald Trump. Led by intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, the managers pleaded with Republicans to find Trump guilty of the charges in the two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A mostly party-line vote on Friday not to call witnesses in the trial signalled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/republican-joe-walsh-iowa-trump\">a lack of interest on the Republican side</a>. Trump maintains his conduct has been irreproachable, and all but a handful of the 53 senators in the majority have seamlessly agreed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/03/democratic-race-starts-in-earnest-with-iowa-caucuses-live-coverage\">Follow the latest on our liveblog</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Chinese state media reported 57 new coronavirus deaths on Monday, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-dozens-more-deaths-chinese-province-centre-outbreak-hubei\">all but one in Wuhan</a>, as the first Australians evacuated from the epicentre of the virus<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-qantas-evacuation-of-australians-in-wuhan-under-way\"> touched down on Christmas Island</a>. Seventy-two people were on board the first of four charter flights expected to take more than 240 evacuees from Western Australia to the island. After landing on Christmas Island the evacuees \u2013 who wore face masks and included men, women and children \u2013 were met by army and medics and taken to buses.

Top stories Barnaby Joyce will challenge Michael McCormack for the leadership of the Nationals when a party room spill is called on Tuesday, saying he has learned from his past mistakes and is the best person to lead the party to the next election. The former leader\u2019s tilt at a comeback won support from the cabinet minister Matt Canavan on Monday night, with the Queensland senator resigning his position to back Joyce in the leadership ballot. Joyce phoned McCormack on Monday afternoon to inform him that there would be a spill of the leader\u2019s position when MPs meet in Canberra for the first day of the parliamentary year, saying \u201cWe have to speak with our own voice, we have to drive agendas.\u201d US House impeachment managers made impassioned closing arguments before the Senate on Monday, urging it to hold the president to account. Almost every Republican in the audience held fast behind Donald Trump. Led by intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, the managers pleaded with Republicans to find Trump guilty of the charges in the two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A mostly party-line vote on Friday not to call witnesses in the trial signalled a lack of interest on the Republican side. Trump maintains his conduct has been irreproachable, and all but a handful of the 53 senators in the majority have seamlessly agreed. Follow the latest on our liveblog. Chinese state media reported 57 new coronavirus deaths on Monday, all but one in Wuhan, as the first Australians evacuated from the epicentre of the virus touched down on Christmas Island. Seventy-two people were on board the first of four charter flights expected to take more than 240 evacuees from Western Australia to the island. After landing on Christmas Island the evacuees \u2013 who wore face masks and included men, women and children \u2013 were met by army and medics and taken to buses. They are to remain on the island for at least 14 days. Meanwhile the parents of Australians have been separated from their families under the government\u2019s travel ban from China because they do not qualify as \u201cimmediate family\u201d. Qantas flight crew have raised concerns that the cabin crew responsible for bringing evacuated Australians out of Wuhan will return to work staffing commercial flights around the country without a period of quarantine. Australia Queensland Liberal MP Terry Young linked a $500,000 sports grant to \u201cgreat strategising\u201d that led to victory. In his first speech to parliament this year, Young, who was contesting the Labor-held marginal seat of Longman, referred to Scott Morrison\u2019s visit to a Caboolture sports club on the eve of the election where he announced a $500,000 grant. The biggest wheat farmer in Australia is again facing charges of illegal land clearing, this time in relation to a property in western New South Wales. Jacinda Ardern will face the anger of M\u0101ori leaders when she visits Waitangi this week after a report branded her government \u201cinhumane\u201d over its removal of children from Indigenous families. Anna Palmer gave $330,000 to the Nationals while her husband Clive was seeking to re-enter parliament with a preference deal between his United Australia party and the Liberal-National Coalition. Richard Di Natale has quit as leader of the Australian Greens and will leave politics by the middle of the year. All leadership positions have been spilled, and the Greens will determine their new leadership team on Tuesday. The world The Iowa caucuses take place on Monday in the US, kicking off the long process of nominating the Democratic presidential candidate who will eventually take on Donald Trump in November\u2019s US election. On the final day of campaigning, candidates blanketed the state, speaking to overcrowded rallies, overflow rooms and packed campaign offices in a final push to persuade the nearly 50% of caucus-goers who say they may still change their minds. Hundreds of thousands of Iowans are barred from the Iowa caucus because of physical and legal barriers. Political journalists have boycotted a briefing at No 10 Downing Street after one of Boris Johnson\u2019s aides banned selected reporters from attending. A second worker at Mexico\u2019s famed monarch butterfly sanctuary has been found murdered, sparking concerns that the defenders of one of Mexico\u2019s most emblematic species are being slain with impunity.

Wellington\u2019s rescue mission for its citizens has seen about 70 New Zealand citizens register to leave. The remaining seats on the aircraft will be filled with Australians, Samoans and Tongans who have correct travel and identity documents, and who pass health checks, NZ health minister David Clark said. Final timing of the flight and passenger details are still to be confirmed, in consultation with Chinese authorities, but there is growing expectation the aircraft will be given approval to land in Wuhan late Tuesday local time and to fly out again later that night. New Zealanders and Pacific Islanders evacuated from Wuhan will spend 14 days at a military base at Whangaparaoa, just north of Auckland. \u201cThe training camp has been chosen because of its size and facilities, as well as its location and secure nature.

The Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed negotiations were ongoing between the two governments. \u201cAustralia is working closely with New Zealand on a potential assisted departure of a further group of Australians on an Air New Zealand flight this week, subject to availability,\u201d a department spokesperson said. Wuhan, in China\u2019s central Hubei province, is the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak which has infected more than 17,400 people and killed 362. All but one of the deaths have been in China. Across the world\u2019s most populous country, more than 50 million people are on lockdown, unable to leave. Meanwhile, the first of 243 Australian citizens and permanent residents who flew out of Wuhan Monday morning have arrived on Christmas Island to begin a 14-day quarantine period. Qantas Flight 6032 touched down at Learmonth RAAF base in Western Australia shortly after 4pm local time. Evacuees were then moved to smaller aircraft and flown to Christmas Island, arriving overnight. While some passengers were transferred immediately to Christmas Island, others will take longer: transit accommodation and dining areas have been set up for some passengers. One passenger was taken to Perth from Exmouth, suffering an unrelated health condition that could not be treated on Christmas Island. On the island, a field hospital, screening and testing rooms have been set up to manage the arrivals. Generators, medical equipment and supplies have all been flown from the mainland. An Australian Medical Assistance (Ausmat) team, which includes doctors, nurses, paediatric specialists and logistics experts, arrived at the weekend in preparation. The 23-person medical crew will remain isolated with the passengers inside the detention centre for the duration of the quarantine period. The evacuees from China have been separated into families and small groups, and isolated from each other, so that any potential outbreaks of the virus are contained to as few people as possible. All passengers underwent health checks, screening for symptoms of the virus before boarding. Of the 243 passengers, 89 were aged under 16, including five infants. \u201cWe have prioritised vulnerable and isolated Australians,\u201d the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said. With Australia imposing a travel ban on all visitors who have left or transited through mainland China from 1 February, the federal education minister Dan Tehan met with the Universities Australia Board to discuss ways to minimise the coronavirus outbreak\u2019s impact on Australia\u2019s tertiary education system.

It comes as some Australian universities delay their semester return while others are offering special consideration for students unable to get back to Australia amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis. Universities have been scrambling to put in place policies and support for students and staff dealing with the coronavirus and the travel ban put in place by the federal government on Saturday. There has not been a coordinated response from universities, and their policies will largely depend on when each university is to begin the semester. The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said on Sunday that the focus was on the health and safety of people at university, and on minimising the disruption to their studies. Monash University in Melbourne announced on Friday it would delay the start of semester one by one week, now due to start 9 March, along with summer exams, due to concerns about the spread of coronavirus making it difficult for students to get back to Australia, or out of isolation after arriving from China. The University of Sydney announced on Saturday evening it would allow students to enrol up to two weeks after the start of semester (by 9 March), or let students defer their studies or have fees refunded. For the University of New South Wales, where one student tested positive for coronavirus, students can defer their study if affected, and the university will consider late enrolment until the end of February. The university has said it will also consider allowing students to take courses online. Queensland University of Technology has said returning students can seek a leave of absence if they cannot return by the end of week two, while new students unable to travel from China can defer their studies. The University of Tasmania has said it will offer online courses to the estimated 1,300 students affected by the travel ban. The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and University of Adelaide among others who have said classes will continue as normal, but have encouraged affected students to contact them directly. China represents the biggest market for Australia\u2019s international student trade, at $12.1bn out of the $37.3bn in the 2018-19 financial year, according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is not just the travel ban and isolation period that will affect students enrolling in Australian universities from China, after the country\u2019s national education examinations authority last week cancelled English language testing in February for students planning to study abroad. Given the changing response to coronavirus in global attempts to contain the spread, it is still difficult to quantify the economic impact it will have on the university sector. If the disruption to studying in the wake of the coronavirus continues throughout the first half of this year, it could cost between $6bn and $8bn, according to Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia . Last month the education minister Dan Tehan set up a global reputation taskforce chaired by Honeywood to determine the impact the bushfires would have on the international student market, and it has now had its remit expanded to cover the impact from the coronavirus. The taskforce met for the first time on Monday and it is expected to suggest to universities a more consistent response to the coronavirus outbreak. Honeywood said the taskforce\u2019s immediate focus would be to get care packages sent out to support those students in Australia who have had to isolate themselves for 14 days after returning from China. \u201cThere is a danger in all of this, and we haven\u2019t seen it so far, in racial profiling, and for Chinese students sitting alone in a four-metre square room wondering what life\u2019s like having to be by yourself for 14 days,\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to know that people are thinking of you and caring for you.\u201d",
