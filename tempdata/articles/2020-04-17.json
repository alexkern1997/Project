      "bodyText": "Although the national cabinet has agreed to a six-month moratorium on evictions, it has abandoned attempts to achieve a nationally consistent approach to financial support for residential landlords and tenants through the Covid-19 crisis. Since Scott Morrison announced residential tenancies would be a matter for the states and territories on 7 April, many have offered land tax cuts in a bid to incentivise rent reductions. So what support is available for residential landlords and tenants in each jurisdiction? New South Wales The government has offered a $440m package of land tax relief, split evenly between commercial tenancies and residential tenancies. Residential landlords are eligible for a land tax waiver or rebate of up to 25% of their 2020 tax liability if they pass the saving on to tenants in financial distress. The rest of the land tax can be deferred for a three-month period for landlords who claim the land tax concession. The government has introduced an interim 60-day stop on landlords seeking to evict tenants due to rental arrears if a person in the house has suffered financial hardship due to Covid-19, meaning a reduction of 25% or more in household income. Legislation will follow for a six-month restriction on rental arrears evictions. Landlords can apply to the NSW civil and administrative tribunal to seek eviction if they are in financial distress at any time, and after the 60-day stop \u201cif it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances of the specific case\u201d. Under the scheme, a landlord or managing agent must enter into negotiations with a tenant who is struggling to make rental payments, with dispute resolution by NSW Fair Trading. Unpaid rent accrues as arrears during this period, but tenants will not be blacklisted. Victoria The government has offered a $500m package comprised of $420m in land tax relief for commercial and residential tenancies and $80m for residential tenants in hardship. If a landlord provides tenants impacted by coronavirus with rent relief, they will be eligible for a 25% discount on their land tax, while any remaining land tax can be deferred until March 2021. Tenants who are unable to secure a rent reduction can enter a dispute resolution process overseen by Consumer Affairs Victoria, with binding mediation.

Queensland The government has provided a $400m land tax relief program for residential and commercial tenancies, allowing landlords to apply for a waiver of up to three months and a deferral of three months of land tax. To be eligible, landlords must \u201cprovide rent relief to the affected tenants of an amount at least commensurate with the land tax relief\u201d. The government will make one-off payments of up to four weeks rent (to a maximum of $2,000) for those affected by Covid-19 who do not have access to other financial assistance and meet eligibility criteria, including having $10,000 or less in cash and savings. Queensland will legislate a six-month moratorium on evictions due to rent arrears caused by Covid-19 and property owners will be prohibited from evicting a tenant if their lease expires during the public health crisis. Australian Capital Territory Landlords are entitled to a land tax rebate if they reduce tenants\u2019 rent by at least 25% for up to six months.

Residential tenants and landlords may reach an agreement to delay rental payments if a tenant is not earning income. Any outstanding rent during this period will be a debt owed to your landlord but is interest free for the six months of the moratorium period. Tasmania Tasmania has already legislated its moratorium on evictions. Any notice to vacate issued by an owner to a tenant is of no effect until 30 June 2020. This measure will be reviewed after 90 days and may be extended. The Tasmanian building and construction minister, Elise Archer, told Guardian Australia that residential landlords could contact the state revenue office if they are experiencing hardship and are unable to meet land tax payments. \u201cThe commissioner of state revenue will consider deferring any outstanding land tax until 30 June 2020 or may organise alternative payment arrangements,\u201d she said. \u201cNo interest will apply to any outstanding 2019-20 land tax debt.\u201d South Australia South Australia has already legislated a short-term moratorium on eviction for non-payment of rent due to severe financial distress, as well as banning rent increases. Tenants cannot be blacklisted as a result of circumstances caused by Covid-19. The South Australian government has cut land tax by $189m from July, and extended a $13m relief package to allow deferment of 2019-20 land tax bills by six months. The South Australian treasurer, Rob Lucas, has signalled further land tax relief measures will be announced. Western Australia The government has introduced legislation for a six-month moratorium on evictions, prohibition on rent increases during the emergency period, and providing that fixed term tenancies due to expire will continue as a periodic agreement.

      "bodyText": "A Tamil couple and their two Australian-born daughters from the regional Queensland town of Biloela have had yet another reprieve and will not be deported to Sri Lanka immediately, after a federal court ruled that the family was denied procedural fairness in the decision on whether to process their visa claim in 2019. Tamil asylum seekers Priya and Nades and their Australian-born daughters, Kopika and Tharunicaa, have been detained on Christmas Island since late last year, awaiting the hearing on the processing of a visa application for Tharunicaa. The case hinged on whether the home affair minister, Peter Dutton, considered lifting a bar under the Migration Act in 2017 that prevented Tharunicaa applying for a visa and, separately, whether the family had been given procedural fairness in the potential consideration of an application by the immigration minister, David Coleman, in May 2019. The rest of Tharunicaa\u2019s family had exhausted all avenues of appeal. Justice Mark Moshinsky ruled that while the bar had not been lifted back in 2017, and dismissed on the first ground, the case was upheld on the second ground. He found that the evidence showed a brief was prepared for Coleman by the Department of Home Affairs asking for him to intervene and lift the bar to allow Tharunicaa and the rest of her family to make an application in May 2019, despite Coleman never acting on that brief. \u201cIt is to be inferred that, in the days following 14 May 2019, the minister for immigration requested the department to prepare a full brief on the applicant\u2019s family, including the option that the minister exercise the powers to lift the applicable bars to enable them to apply for protection visas,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, the minister decided to consider exercising the power to lift the bar in respect of the applicant. \u201cI also conclude that the processes affected the applicant\u2019s interests, and so the rules of procedural fairness applied.

Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, called on the government to act in good faith with the family\u2019s lawyers over the orders to be made. \u201cLabor is relieved the family will not be deported from Australia whilst this is taking place \u2013 particularly given the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on all countries and people across the globe,\u201d Keneally said. \u201cAs has always been the case, home affairs minister Peter Dutton could bring this whole process to an end by using his discretion under the Migration Act and allow the family to return home to Biloela.\u201d",

Even if travel restrictions are eased by mid-2021, Hill said it would be next to impossible for her father to travel, given concerns for older people contracting Covid-19 and the difficulty the family had had in making arrangements for her mother to be looked after. \u201c[My mother] always dreamt of going to Disneyland, so she wanted to send the grandkids to Disneyland,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut she can\u2019t travel.\u201d \u201cHe would have to leave her, and who\u2019s meant to look after her?\u201d Flight Centre has asked Hill to provide medical advice confirming her mother\u2019s condition before it will consider the issue any further. It also said it was unable to process a refund of $7,000 for flights with Fiji Air, because the tickets are non-refundable and the airline isn\u2019t offering money back due to Covid-19. It has offered the family a credit voucher for the flights, but Hill is unsure whether the airline will even exist in 12 months\u2019 time. Hill\u2019s story is not unique. Customers have flocked to a Facebook page \u2013 \u201cFlight Centre. Give us our refunds!\u201d \u2013 to vent their frustration at the cancellation fees. Earlier this month, Flight Centre announced it had taken extraodinary steps to survive the Covid-19 crisis, which has plunged its business into turmoil. It negotiated a fully underwritten $700m capital raising, secured another $200m from its existing lenders, and closed about 40% of its Australian retail outlets. It aimed to cut its annual operating expenses by $1.9bn from July. A spokesman for Flight Centre said the cancellation fees were outlined in the standard terms and conditions and its position was \u201cnot unique and it is in line with many other travel companies in the present environment\u201d. \u201c[They] reflect the fact that our people have performed the service requested of them in booking products for customers and the significant time involved in processing and securing refunds from airlines and other suppliers.\u201d The spokesman said processing refunds was a \u201ctime-consuming \u2026 and intensive process\u201d that typically took up to 12 weeks in a normal trading environment. \u201cIn this current climate, and with airlines standing down staff and reducing services, this timeframe is being pushed out,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere we receive refunds earlier, we are actioning this.\u201d Hill independently approached the owner of the hotel where she had made her booking. The company indicated it was willing to pay the refund, but it needed to be processed through Flight Centre. Choice\u2019s travel expert, Jodi Bird, said in most cases it was acceptable to charge reasonable cancellation fees. \u201cBut the Flight Centre one is a good example where it\u2019s charged per person, per policy,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it quickly multiplies if you\u2019ve got a couple who have booked a flight and accommodation through Flight Centre, you\u2019ve suddenly got $1,200 in cancellation fees, which is a lot.\u201d The ACCC has issued guidance for the travel sector, saying customers should be treated fairly. \u201cIf your travel is cancelled the ACCC expects that you will receive a refund or other remedy, such as a credit note or voucher, in most circumstances,\u201d the advice said.",

They talk about something called herd immunity to bolster this idea, as if it was an easy way out rather than something horrifying that we want to avoid at all costs.</p> <p>Why is it so bad? Let me explain.</p> <p>Herd immunity is a simple epidemiological concept that describes the state where enough people are immune to a disease that it stops spreading in the population. Basically, if 80 people out of 100 can\u2019t get the disease, then the 20 people who can get it will be protected because they are never actually exposed. Any outbreaks of the infection would quickly die out in this scenario.</p> <p>All of this sounds rosy, but the problem with herd immunity is that it really hinges on vaccination. Without a vaccine, the only way to become immune to a disease is to get it and live through, which makes the strategy a whole lot more fatal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If we pursue herd immunity, the best-case scenario has between 43,000 and 100,000 people in Australia dying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To see how much more fatal, let\u2019s look at the numbers. Our initial estimates put the herd immunity threshold for Covid-19 \u2013 the proportion of people who need to be immune for the disease to stop spreading \u2013 at 60-70% of the population. So 60-70% of people need to be infected with Covid-19 for herd immunity to come into play at a minimum, although new data from the CDC indicates the number <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0282_article?deliveryName=USCDC_333-DM25287\">may be as high as 85%</a>. And it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t really pick and choose these people, because unless you reach that threshold in every part of the country you\u2019ll still see disease outbreaks. The idea that we can only infect young people is simply incorrect, firstly because that\u2019s not how society functions, but also because it\u2019ll create clusters of low immunity where the disease can still spread.</p> <p>In Australia, that would mean roughly 15-17 million coronavirus infections. Now, we also have a very good idea of the death rate from this disease \u2013 while the case-fatality rate is quite high, the true infection-fatality rate given a health system that is not overwhelmed <a href=\"https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/global-covid-19-case-fatality-rates/\">is likely</a> to be around <a href=\"http://eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.12.2000256\">0.3-0.6%</a>. In other words, including all the asymptomatic cases (people who get the disease but never experience symptoms), around three to six out of every thousand infected will die. Multiplying those numbers, we can see that, if we pursue herd immunity, the best-case scenario has between 43,000 and 100,000 people in Australia dying.</p> <p>That\u2019s really quite a lot.</p> <p>But remember, that\u2019s if the health system is not overwhelmed. As many have pointed out, letting the virus run free comes with costs, one of which is that hospitals simply cannot treat everyone who is sick at the same time. For example, Sweden, which initially chose a laissez-faire attitude towards Covid-19, is now reportedly <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/sweden-coronavirus-lockdown-doctor-death-certificates-latest-a9462796.html\">refusing ICU beds</a> in some hospitals to people over the age of 80 or even those under 80 with comorbid conditions due to the impossibility of caring for everyone. If we take a more pessimistic view of the fatality rate, where our hospital system is struggling, we could see as many as 250,000 people dead before we reached the herd immunity threshold of 60-70%.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/those-talking-about-a-fast-end-to-social-distancing-should-consider-the-cost-paid-in-human-lives\">Those talking about a fast end to social distancing should consider the cost paid in human lives | Matt Beard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And this is just deaths. We still do not know what the long-term complications of Covid-19 are, but it\u2019s fair to assume that there will be some. There\u2019s also a huge cost to having a large proportion of your population very sick at the same time, from the difficulties of providing essential services to the nightmare of entire families falling sick simultaneously.</p> <p>The simple fact is that herd immunity, without a vaccine, is not an easy way forward. Even if we do eventually reach that magical 60-70% threshold, it will have come at a staggering cost. Given the nature of the disease, the deaths and illness will be most focused on older and disadvantaged people, which is particularly worrying for anyone who cares about those over the age of 60.</p> <p>Ultimately, what we do next will be more a political than a scientific decision, and <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-16/national-cabinet-scott-morrison-coronavirus-restrictions/12153632\">Scott Morrison confirmed</a> on Thursday that herd immunity wasn\u2019t an approach Australia was following. But it\u2019s worth remembering that every way forward comes with a cost. To some, herd immunity may still sound idyllic, but it requires us to sacrifice the vulnerable on the altar of the economy in truly vast numbers. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but personally I\u2019d rather stay inside for a few more months and still see my parents next year.</p> <p>\u2022 Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease</p>",

So 60-70% of people need to be infected with Covid-19 for herd immunity to come into play at a minimum, although new data from the CDC indicates the number may be as high as 85%. And it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t really pick and choose these people, because unless you reach that threshold in every part of the country you\u2019ll still see disease outbreaks. The idea that we can only infect young people is simply incorrect, firstly because that\u2019s not how society functions, but also because it\u2019ll create clusters of low immunity where the disease can still spread. In Australia, that would mean roughly 15-17 million coronavirus infections. Now, we also have a very good idea of the death rate from this disease \u2013 while the case-fatality rate is quite high, the true infection-fatality rate given a health system that is not overwhelmed is likely to be around 0.3-0.6%. In other words, including all the asymptomatic cases (people who get the disease but never experience symptoms), around three to six out of every thousand infected will die. Multiplying those numbers, we can see that, if we pursue herd immunity, the best-case scenario has between 43,000 and 100,000 people in Australia dying. That\u2019s really quite a lot. But remember, that\u2019s if the health system is not overwhelmed. As many have pointed out, letting the virus run free comes with costs, one of which is that hospitals simply cannot treat everyone who is sick at the same time. For example, Sweden, which initially chose a laissez-faire attitude towards Covid-19, is now reportedly refusing ICU beds in some hospitals to people over the age of 80 or even those under 80 with comorbid conditions due to the impossibility of caring for everyone. If we take a more pessimistic view of the fatality rate, where our hospital system is struggling, we could see as many as 250,000 people dead before we reached the herd immunity threshold of 60-70%. And this is just deaths. We still do not know what the long-term complications of Covid-19 are, but it\u2019s fair to assume that there will be some. There\u2019s also a huge cost to having a large proportion of your population very sick at the same time, from the difficulties of providing essential services to the nightmare of entire families falling sick simultaneously. The simple fact is that herd immunity, without a vaccine, is not an easy way forward. Even if we do eventually reach that magical 60-70% threshold, it will have come at a staggering cost. Given the nature of the disease, the deaths and illness will be most focused on older and disadvantaged people, which is particularly worrying for anyone who cares about those over the age of 60. Ultimately, what we do next will be more a political than a scientific decision, and Scott Morrison confirmed on Thursday that herd immunity wasn\u2019t an approach Australia was following. But it\u2019s worth remembering that every way forward comes with a cost. To some, herd immunity may still sound idyllic, but it requires us to sacrifice the vulnerable on the altar of the economy in truly vast numbers. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but personally I\u2019d rather stay inside for a few more months and still see my parents next year. \u2022 Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz is an epidemiologist working in chronic disease",

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s book was supposed to be exclusively extracted by the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age this weekend but was sensationally leaked by the Australian on Thursday. As just a handful of printed copies was sent by publisher Hardie Grant to reviewers who signed non-disclosure agreements, it\u2019s unclear how the Oz national affairs editor, Simon Benson, got his hands on the book, A Bigger Picture. Hardie Grant fired off legal letters to the Oz but the threats appear to have fallen on deaf ears as the national broadsheet has just stepped up its production of unauthorised stories, which seem to immediately have been ripped off by the Daily Mail. The Herald and Guardian Australia published news stories based on authorised chapters they already had. \u201cWe agreed for those publications that had been acting in good faith that they shouldn\u2019t be disadvantaged and should be able to publish as agreed ahead of release,\u201d publisher Sandy Grant said. According to Benson\u2019s front-page story he didn\u2019t get a copy of the book as such but relied on the recollection of those who read the manuscripts. \u201cAccording to those who have read the manuscripts, Mr Turnbull describes Mr Dutton as a \u2018narcissist\u2019 and \u2018self-delusional\u2019 in his belief that he could become prime minister while revealing his personal anguish at what he believes was the ultimate betrayal at the hands of his finance minister, Senator Cormann,\u201d Benson wrote. The unnamed sources must have terrific memories as the articles include slabs of word-perfect quotes from the book. \u2018Colourful but unbalanced\u2019, says Paul Kelly By pre-empting the revelations of the former prime minister, the Australian tried to frame the narrative in a more flattering light to both the Murdoch empire and the paper\u2019s allies in the Coalition, namely Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison. Brushed to one side were the unflattering allegations by the paper\u2019s own journalists that the Oz and Sky News actively campaigned against the Turnbull government. Two of the people whose private conversations with Turnbull were revealed in the book were journalists from the Oz: editor at large Paul Kelly and the former national affairs editor David Crowe, who both said the paper was actively campaigning against him. Crowe told Weekly Beast the former PM\u2019s recollections about what he told him about working for Rupert were accurate. \u201cI hate being the subject of a story but it\u2019s true I wasn\u2019t happy at the Oz,\u201d Crowe said. \u201cThe account in the book seems right \u2014 but then I didn\u2019t take notes of my own remarks in that phone call. I\u2019m glad I left the Oz and I\u2019ve never regretted coming back to Fairfax and the Herald and the Age.\u201d For his part, Kelly tells us Turnbull\u2019s account is \u201ccolourful but unbalanced\u201d. \u201cI argued, in public and private, the primary political contest for media coverage must be government versus Labor, not Liberal progressives versus Liberal conservatives,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cBoth the paper and Sky gave free scope to my views when they did not necessarily agree with them.\u201d A Bigger Picture will give the public a rare insight into the deadly dance between politicians and journalists, pointing the finger at News Corp\u2019s alliance with Murdoch and the role of Benson and Holt St editors Paul Whittaker (now the boss at Sky News) and Chris Dore in forming public policy. Turnbull is scathing in his assessment of the Murdoch media, which he says is guilty of routinely exploiting and encouraging \u201cintolerance and racial and religious animosities\u201d but he\u2019s also very exercised about what he calls a debased media culture. \u201cTraditional curated media has seen its business model smashed by the internet; Google and Facebook in particular,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the crazy, fact-free rage of social media has now infested what\u2019s left of the traditional, but still very influential, media.\u201d The former communications minister also calls out the ABC for its standards on accuracy. \u201cWith the rest of the media, I had few complaints other than about poor journalism,\u201d Turnbull writes. \u201cI had no issues with the ABC for bias (as so many of my colleagues did) but I did complain about their failure on occasion to check facts in the most rudimentary way. Their news department needs an editor.\u201d Covid\u2019s economic cost The coronavirus continues to affect media companies\u2019 budgets, with most outlets cutting around the edges to compensate for the lack of revenue from advertising. Others, such as News Corp Australia and Antony Catalano\u2019s Australian Community Media, have suspended printing on local newspapers. ACM has refused to say how many of the company\u2019s 170 non-daily papers have been affected but sources say it is at least 100, with staff stood down from Monday without pay until 29 June. Four printing presses have also been shut down. In a worrying sign for the future of the bigger daily papers in the group, the Canberra Times, the Newcastle Herald and the Illawarra Mercury, the feature writers who file for the whole group have been stood down until the new financial year at least. This week the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age took the axe to its freelancers and casuals, including the foundation columnist for the Brisbane Times, John Birmingham. Birmo, a popular author who had his weekly column syndicated across the Nine papers for 11 years is planning on keeping it going on his own website. Birmo has been less than flattering about several comment pieces in the SMH and the Australian Financial Review advocating coronavirus restrictions be lifted to save the economy. Blair breached standards The Australian Press Council found Daily Telegraph blogger Tim Blair had breached standards with a post about asylum seekers who self-harm. \u201cThe council considers the mocking tone of the article trivialises the suicide attempts referred to in the article and was presented without sensitivity or moderation,\u201d the adjudication, which the paper had to publish, read. But Blair was not prepared to cop the judgement from the council, posting another blog post in contempt of the ruling. \u201cThe Australian Press Council is invited to suck it,\u201d he wrote before correcting the council\u2019s grammar. \u201cBy the way, the second sentence of that ruling should read \u2018to the federal election outcome\u2019, after which a comma is required.\u201d Sam Newman can\u2019t play golf Former Footy Show host Sam Newman might not be on TV anymore after his show was dumped a year ago, but he\u2019s still making a fool of himself. Newman was repeatedly criticised for sexist, racist and homophobic remarks on the Nine entertainment show and in 1999 he appeared in blackface after the Indigenous footballer Nicky Winmar refused to go on the show. On Thursday the former AFL player dressed up in golf gear, complete with a set of clubs, and staged a protest. \u201cVictorians, unlike their interstate counterparts, can\u2019t play golf,\u201d Newman said in a video filmed on Spring St in Melbourne. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to the seat of government, where Daniel Andrews might be in the house, and I\u2019m going to respectfully ask him why in God\u2019s name can\u2019t we go on to a golf course, social distance, and play golf? Not many people supported his protest on Twitter, except shock jock Steve Price, who called it a \u201cbrilliant protest\u201d. \u201cJust pleased Sam didn\u2019t take his driver out and launch one down Bourke St like he did off Uluru,\u201d Price said. AAP fate down to the wire More than six weeks after AAP staff were told the 85-year old wire service was closing because major shareholders Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia said it was unsustainable, they are still hoping for a reprieve. Management, which announced the death of AAP as a fait accompli in March, have spent weeks fielding offers from potential buyers who put their hands up at the 11th hour. Some staff were told to put their redundancies on hold. This week the AAP board met to consider two formal expressions of interest for the entire AAP operation but told staff one was not acceptable to the shareholders. \u201cThe other is still on the table,\u201d the note said. \u201cA third party has come forward in recent days, and we are still awaiting communication from an earlier expression of interest. Parties have until 5pm on Friday 17 April to make final offers. But wait there\u2019s more. The board is also considering an offer to buy part of the business, namely Medianet and Mediaverse, should the whole-of-business offers not proceed. \u201cI understand that all AAP employees are concerned about the future of the company, and that you want certainty as soon as possible,\u201d the note said. \u201cBut please be aware that this is a complex issue, and we are balancing the protection of staff entitlements, future jobs, and a number of potential scenarios.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Scott Morrison did not receive any advice from the Tasmanian public health director before he accused a healthcare worker of not telling the truth to the state\u2019s contact tracing team, earning the federal government another rebuke from Tasmanian authorities. Authorities learned on Thursday night the healthcare worker had worked at three nursing homes as well as two hospitals before testing positive to Covid-19, prompting the federal government to order the mass testing of all staff and patients at those nursing homes. Morrison told Hobart radio on Friday the health worker had previously not told the truth when asked about his movements. \u201cWe\u2019ve had someone down there not tell the truth to the contact tracers about where they\u2019d been and who they\u2019d been with and that means that a lot of people have been put at risk in north-west Tasmania,\u201d Morrison said. But the director of public health, Dr Mark Veitch, said there was no suggestion the health worker had not been open with contact tracers, only that he had realised, after his initial interview, that he may have been showing symptoms earlier, causing authorities to \u201cwiden the net\u201d. Veitch said no one from his office had briefed the prime minister on the case and that contact tracers \u201cmight not always pull out all the information that we need when we ask the questions the first time\u201d. It\u2019s the second time in a week that federal authorities have been publicly contradicted about the situation in Tasmania, after the national chief medical officer Brendan Murphy backtracked on a claim that the outbreak on Tasmania\u2019s north-west coast was linked to an \u201cillegal dinner party\u201d of healthcare workers. It comes as more than 150 staff at Mersey community hospital in Devonport, also in north-west Tasmania, wrote to the state government complaining of a \u201cbreakdown of trust\u201d after a senior emergency doctor was told not to speak to staff, raising concerns about the hospital\u2019s ability to manage a coronavirus outbreak in the region. The letter raised concerns about availability of personal protective equipment and called for stronger infection control protocols to be introduced. The staff also called on the health minister, Sarah Courtney, to \u201cremove the restriction on communication\u201d imposed on the director of the emergency departments at the Mersey and North West Regional hospitals, saying she was \u201crespected for standing up for staff and patient safety\u201d. The health department has been contacted for comment. Mersey community hospital has become the centre of the health response to a Covid-19 cluster on Tasmania\u2019s north-west coast, after the North West Regional and North West private hospitals in Burnie were closed by the premier, Peter Gutwein, on Sunday. Patients, including some with the disease, were transferred 60km along the coast to the Mersey on Monday. Courtney promised the hospital would have pre-positioned piles of PPE on hand and would be managed in accordance with advice from infection control experts. In the letter, hospital staff said that promise was \u201cnot delivered upon and has since had an enormous, snowballing effect on staff wellbeing and anxiety\u201d. They said the patient transfer had \u201ccaused major unrest and undue stress to staff\u201d and that safety for patients and staff had been \u201cbreached\u201d. The letter said patients and staff who had tested positive to Covid-19 had been identified as having been in coronavirus-free wards and requested the entire hospital be regarded as a coronavirus hotspot, which would mean stepping up infection control measures and staffing levels. \u201cOur staff, medical, nursing and clerical, across the North West are repeatedly raising numerous issues to management with no response,\u201d the letter said. Courtney told reporters on Friday she had spoken to the head of the Tasmanian health department and the state\u2019s chief medical officer immediately after receiving the letter that morning and asked them to investigate. Courtney said most of the issues raised by staff were already being addressed, and that according to her advice there were \u201cappropriate levels\u201d of pre-positioned PPE at the hospital. \u201cHowever if this number of my staff are obviously very concerned then I have asked for this to be investigated further,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to make sure that our staff not only are supported but are feeling supported \u2026 I want to make sure that we are taking all of the measures that we need to both practically in terms of the PPE we have deployed, but also working with our staff during a time of very high anxiety.\u201d She said the government had been taking advice from infection disease specialists on the set up of the wards at the Mersey, and that protecting staff and patients was an \u201cextraordinarily high priority of mine\u201d. Among the concerns raised is the reopening of the emergency department at the North West Regional hospital, which Gutwein said might happen as early as Friday afternoon. Courtney said the emergency department \u201cwill be open when it needs to be opened\u201d.",

There are the international award-winners such as Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke; there are the early masterpieces such as Laputa, Kiki\u2019s Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro and Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind; there are even the quieter, oft-overlooked movies such as Only Yesterday, Porco Rosso and Whisper of the Heart.

      "body": "<p>Precisely when political leaders of certain countries grasped how much of a threat coronavirus really would be is a debatable issue. But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qBEyjJu4B/\">announced</a> on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.) On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/13/trevor-noah-tom-hanks-daily-show-recap-coronavirus\">said</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us. Like prison rules: \u2018If I can get Hanks, I can get to anyone.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Plenty of famous people have since been diagnosed with coronavirus, from Idris Elba to Placido Domingo, yet only Hanks and Wilson made newspaper front pages. And whereas other celebrity diagnoses have prompted debate about why certain people have access to tests while the masses don\u2019t, the news about Hanks and Wilson, both 63, sparked only anxiety on their behalf. \u201cHow dare coronavirus hurt my father!\u201d was the general online reaction, reflecting Hanks\u2019s longstanding status as the United States\u2019 parental figure. Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre.</p> <p>And their normality is not a pose, judging from the several times I have spotted them out and about in Los Angeles. Once, during Oscars week, I was hanging out in a Beverly Hills hotel where designers had taken over several suites to dress celebrities. Every other person who came in and out of the hotel was a stylist, their heels sky high, their Botox impeccable. Except one: Wilson arrived and left quietly, sporting what looked a lot like a tracksuit and an endearing lack of makeup, never mind Botox. \u201cPicking up one\u2019s own Oscars outfit\u201d might be a very relative kind of normality, but in Hollywood \u201cthe real world\u201d exists on a sliding scale.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a5941e9f8867c1b1be5f68e1930b5c9a18547ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a5941e9f8867c1b1be5f68e1930b5c9a18547ef/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson and Hanks at the Oscars in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson and Hanks at the Oscars in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thankfully for Hanks and Wilson, but also the morale of mankind, they are now fully recovered from coronavirus and back home in Los Angeles, where they are \u201cstaying inside and watching a lot of old movies,\u201d Wilson tells me on the phone. \u201cLike <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050105/\">An Affair to Remember</a>?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking. Wilson has been acting since she was 14, but her most famous scene is probably in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/sleepless-in-seattle-review\">Sleepless in Seattle</a>, where her character <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77JrXbqqV0\">gushes</a> about the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr 1957 film. She has regained enough of her strength to just about suppress her weariness with the reference: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea, for sure!\u201d she says with only the faintest hint of rolled eyes.</p> <p>Wilson and Hanks first developed symptoms on 9 March, and were tested the following day. Doctors told them that they were probably exposed to the virus by the same person at the same time, but no one else they know has tested positive and it\u2019s still a mystery as to how they caught it. Wilson, in particular, had tried to be hyper-vigilant: \u201cIt was early March, so people weren\u2019t social distancing yet. But I was already doing no handshakes, no hugging, trying to take my own measures. Then on the plane to Australia, I was like Lady Macbeth \u2013 I couldn\u2019t clean everything enough! The flight attendants were like: \u2018What is with this lady?\u2019 I had wipes, sanitiser, I wiped down <em>everything</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Their symptoms were severe enough for them to be hospitalised: \u201cWe both had a high fever and were extremely achey. I lost my sense of taste and smell, had stomach issues and shivering like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Yeah, I was scared,\u201d she says. To try to bring her fever down, doctors gave her chloroquine \u2013 \u201cnot hydroxychloroquine,\u201d she stresses, referring to the unproven treatment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/hydroxychloroquine-trump-coronavirus-drug\">President Trump has been promoting</a>. Her temperature did come down, but the side-effects of the drug were \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cExtreme nausea, vertigo, my muscles felt like wet noodles, so I couldn\u2019t really stand,\u201d she says. They were unaware of the international reaction to their announcement because they hardly watched TV and stayed almost entirely offline, except to be in contact with close friends and family. \u201cWe were just trying to get through it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Back in 2015, Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At the time, she told her husband what she wanted him and their two sons, Chet and Truman, to do should she die: \u201cI said: \u2018I want you to be sad for a really long time,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I said: \u2018I want you all to throw me a party.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Did she and Hanks have those conversations again?</p> <p>\u201cNo, but we did have a different conversation before we were diagnosed. Before I had cancer, I would hear about other people having cancer. I said to him before all this: \u2018Once you\u2019ve had cancer you understand you <em>are</em> other people. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t get coronavirus \u2013 we could get it.\u2019 And we got it.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson and Hanks have been married for 32 years and famously have one of the most solid relationships in Hollywood. But going through all this, so far from home, and on their own, would have tested any couple. How did they not lose their minds?</p> <p>\u201cI think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you or understanding that the person at home needs a break. We were fortunate we were in a place where we understood what the other was going through.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76ced8444b96771d2d95e787bb2f13f16cfc03dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76ced8444b96771d2d95e787bb2f13f16cfc03dc/0_0_5632_3380/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me\u2019 \u2026 Wilson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me\u2019 \u2026 Wilson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Jordan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wilson was born and raised in Hollywood, the daughter of a Greek mother and Bulgarian father. She started acting as a teenager, appearing on The Brady Bunch and then other US TV shows throughout her 20s. In 1981, when she was 25, she appeared on <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/arts-entertainment/bosom-buddies-the-1980s-sitcom-that-faked-nyc-terribly\">Bosom Buddies</a>, a sitcom that barely lasted two seasons but launched the career of Hanks. He was married at the time, and has two children from that marriage, including the actor, Colin Hanks. But the two of them reconnected in 1985 when they were both cast in the film, Volunteers, and married in 1988. Since then, Wilson has made a name for herself as a successful producer (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mamma Mia!) and a reliable team player; it is always a pleasure to see her pop up in supporting roles in films such as Runaway Bride and Sleepless in Seattle, as well as classy TV shows including The Good Wife and Girls.</p> <p>Last year, she produced and appeared in the film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4310022/\">Boy Genius</a>, \u201cwhich probably people never saw,\u201d Wilson says, alas, accurately. But something from that film stuck in her mind during her recovery: in the movie, her character performs Naughty by Nature\u2019s legendary anthem, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz1Xn1vzOM4\">Hip Hop Hooray</a>. After a couple of days in hospital, she and Hanks were allowed to return to their hotel to recover, where they played card games, watched the ubiquitous Netflix documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Tiger King</a> (\u201cYeah, pretty crazy, ha ha!\u201d) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/29/ken-burns-tv-documentaries-america-baseball-vietnam-country-music\">Ken Burns\u2019s</a> documentary about country music. But Wilson still felt \u201ckind of foggy\u201d, so to get her brain back in shape, she decided to re-learn Hip Hop Hooray. She then <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-BqChYnY6F/\">videoed</a> herself performing it and posted it on Instagram from isolation in Australia, \u201cto let people back home know I was OK, and maybe they could get a smile out of it.\u201d </p> <p>The video took off and currently has 2m likes with adoring comments from Barack Obama (\u201cDrop the mic, Rita!\u201d) to Kim Kardashian (\u201cThe best video EVER!!!!!!\u201d). But the comment that thrilled Wilson the most came from Naughty by Nature themselves, who loved her version. Wilson and the group have now remixed the single and are releasing it to raise money for <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/musicares/get-help/musicares-coronavirus-relief-fund\">MusiCares Covid-19 Relief Fund</a>, to support members of the music community.</p> <p>\u201cOne of my fans inboxed me and was like: \u2018Hey Vin! Have you seen this?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018What the, oh my Gahhhd,\u2019\u201d says NbN\u2019s Vin Rock with, one suspects, some understatement.</p> <p>Vin Rock was, he says, \u201caware of [Wilson] from her movies, and definitely her husband, Tom Hanks\u201d. (His favourite Hanks movie, for the record, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/23/forrest-gump-film-makes-me-cry\">Forrest Gump</a>: \u201cThe way they put him in all those historic scenarios!\u201d)</p> <p>\u201cFor us to be able to take this song and this moment and turn it into something positive, I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>So he didn\u2019t mind one of his best-known songs being appropriated by an older, very wealthy white woman?</p> <p>\u201cNot at all! Hip-hop has always been inclusive. Rita\u2019s son Chet is a big hip-hop fan and he gets a lot of kickback from the hip-hop community who want to call him a poseur or culture vulture. But it\u2019s the multicultural people who participated in hip-hop who have made it the phenomenon it is today,\u201d he says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn7K1mlEBb4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rn7K1mlEBb4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Chet Hanks \u2013 or Chet Haze, to use his rap name \u2013 has indeed been accused of those things and worse. In the past, he <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/dear-white-rappers-stop-using-the-n-word-and-check-your-damn-privilege\">defended</a> his frequent use of the n-word, although he has since <a href=\"https://pagesix.com/2018/10/16/chet-haze-explains-why-he-used-the-n-word/\">put that down</a> to his problems with drug addiction. He is clean now, but the 29-year-old got in trouble again earlier this year when he accompanied his parents to the Golden Globes and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10689845/chet-hanks-drug-addiction-tom-hanks/\">spoke</a> in Jamaican patois on the red carpet. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Tom <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/movies/tom-hanks-mister-rogers.html\">said</a> of his children from his first marriage: \u201cThey remember when their dad was just a guy trying to, you know, make the rent. My other kids, they were born after I had established a beachhead in every way. And so their lives were just different.\u201d</p> <p>But Chet became a bit of a star during his parents\u2019 illness. He posted endearingly sensible video updates on their condition (\u201cThey\u2019re not tripping but they\u2019re going through the necessary precautions, obviously\u201d) and amusingly shot down the various conspiracy theories about Hanks being in the illuminati (\u201cIf somebody wrote it on the internet, you know it must be true\u201d). Instead of being mocked by the media, as he had been so often, Chet was now getting headlines <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/coronavirus-how-tom-hanks-and-rita-wilsons-son-chet-haze-became-a-soothing-voice-amid-covid-19\">such as</a> \u201cHow Tom Hanks\u2019 Son Chet Haze Became a Soothing Voice Amid Covid-19\u201d.</p> <p>That must have made Wilson proud, I say.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very sweet of him. Of course, our entire family was concerned about us,\u201d she says, maintaining a protective discretion about her children.</p> <p>I tell her that the last time I interviewed her husband, he did the rap that he and Dan Aykroyd <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gdBoo1anxY\">performed</a> in the 1987 film Dragnet for me. So now I imagine them as a hip-hop family, all rapping to one another in the evening.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, we make so much fun of that rap, that\u2019s hilarious! People say to me: \u2018Chet must have gotten his rapping from you.\u2019 But we were introduced to it more from our son rather than him being introduced to it from me,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wilson is an accomplished musician in her own right and, since 2012, has put out four albums, three of which feature songs she wrote herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be1bfaa13044c8eb60c8db69ea166919fe06294\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be1bfaa13044c8eb60c8db69ea166919fe06294/0_0_2775_1664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hanks and Wilson in Sleepless in Seattle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hanks and Wilson in Sleepless in Seattle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/TRISTAR PICTURES</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWriting and performing songs has become so much more satisfying, compared to what I was being offered in movies. How many times can you play the understanding, nurturing wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, best friend? I mean, I\u2019ve exhausted the canon of those roles,\u201d she says.</p> <p>I tell her that part of what I loved about her Hip Hop Hooray Instagram post wasn\u2019t how she sounded but how she looked \u2013 totally unstyled and un-tweaked. How has she avoided that pressure to look perfect and maintain the face of a 29-year-old while living such a high-profile life in Hollywood?</p> <p>\u201cPart of it is my mom rarely wore makeup and I loved seeing her face evolve over time with me. I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me. Everyone has their vanity but I \u2013 I \u2013 hmmm. How to put this? I \u2026 just \u2026 don\u2019t care that much!\u201d she finishes with a laugh.</p> <p>But did she ever feel the pressure?</p> <p>\u201cOh yeah! When I was making Runaway Bride I had Botox, because Botox was new and everyone was getting Botox, and I got it in my forehead. But then I saw this movie, and there\u2019s this emotional <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oErpqklNp48\">scene</a> where I\u2019m firing Richard Gere and my forehead didn\u2019t move. I thought: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not working!\u2019 I tried the lip-fillers around that same period of time, and one day I came home and my kids laughed at me, and I thought: \u2018OK, that\u2019s that!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Wilson has to go now \u2013 possibly to watch An Affair to Remember, probably not. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful to be back to normal again,\u201d she says. So be careful, OK?\u201d After all, as she knows better than most, we\u2019re all just other people now.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://lnk.to/RitaWilson_HipHopHooray\">Hip Hop Hooray (Remix) is available now</a>, with proceeds to the <a href=\"https://www.grammy.com/musicares/get-help/musicares-coronavirus-relief-fund\">MusiCares Foundation Covid-19 relief fund</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Precisely when political leaders of certain countries grasped how much of a threat coronavirus really would be is a debatable issue. But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks announced on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.) On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us. Like prison rules: \u2018If I can get Hanks, I can get to anyone.\u2019\u201d Plenty of famous people have since been diagnosed with coronavirus, from Idris Elba to Placido Domingo, yet only Hanks and Wilson made newspaper front pages. And whereas other celebrity diagnoses have prompted debate about why certain people have access to tests while the masses don\u2019t, the news about Hanks and Wilson, both 63, sparked only anxiety on their behalf. \u201cHow dare coronavirus hurt my father!\u201d was the general online reaction, reflecting Hanks\u2019s longstanding status as the United States\u2019 parental figure. Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre. And their normality is not a pose, judging from the several times I have spotted them out and about in Los Angeles. Once, during Oscars week, I was hanging out in a Beverly Hills hotel where designers had taken over several suites to dress celebrities. Every other person who came in and out of the hotel was a stylist, their heels sky high, their Botox impeccable. Except one: Wilson arrived and left quietly, sporting what looked a lot like a tracksuit and an endearing lack of makeup, never mind Botox. \u201cPicking up one\u2019s own Oscars outfit\u201d might be a very relative kind of normality, but in Hollywood \u201cthe real world\u201d exists on a sliding scale. Thankfully for Hanks and Wilson, but also the morale of mankind, they are now fully recovered from coronavirus and back home in Los Angeles, where they are \u201cstaying inside and watching a lot of old movies,\u201d Wilson tells me on the phone. \u201cLike An Affair to Remember?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking. Wilson has been acting since she was 14, but her most famous scene is probably in Sleepless in Seattle, where her character gushes about the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr 1957 film. She has regained enough of her strength to just about suppress her weariness with the reference: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea, for sure!\u201d she says with only the faintest hint of rolled eyes. Wilson and Hanks first developed symptoms on 9 March, and were tested the following day. Doctors told them that they were probably exposed to the virus by the same person at the same time, but no one else they know has tested positive and it\u2019s still a mystery as to how they caught it. Wilson, in particular, had tried to be hyper-vigilant: \u201cIt was early March, so people weren\u2019t social distancing yet. But I was already doing no handshakes, no hugging, trying to take my own measures. Then on the plane to Australia, I was like Lady Macbeth \u2013 I couldn\u2019t clean everything enough! The flight attendants were like: \u2018What is with this lady?\u2019 I had wipes, sanitiser, I wiped down everything.\u201d Their symptoms were severe enough for them to be hospitalised: \u201cWe both had a high fever and were extremely achey. I lost my sense of taste and smell, had stomach issues and shivering like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Yeah, I was scared,\u201d she says. To try to bring her fever down, doctors gave her chloroquine \u2013 \u201cnot hydroxychloroquine,\u201d she stresses, referring to the unproven treatment President Trump has been promoting. Her temperature did come down, but the side-effects of the drug were \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d. \u201cExtreme nausea, vertigo, my muscles felt like wet noodles, so I couldn\u2019t really stand,\u201d she says. They were unaware of the international reaction to their announcement because they hardly watched TV and stayed almost entirely offline, except to be in contact with close friends and family. \u201cWe were just trying to get through it,\u201d she says. Back in 2015, Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At the time, she told her husband what she wanted him and their two sons, Chet and Truman, to do should she die: \u201cI said: \u2018I want you to be sad for a really long time,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I said: \u2018I want you all to throw me a party.\u2019\u201d Did she and Hanks have those conversations again? \u201cNo, but we did have a different conversation before we were diagnosed. Before I had cancer, I would hear about other people having cancer. I said to him before all this: \u2018Once you\u2019ve had cancer you understand you are other people. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t get coronavirus \u2013 we could get it.\u2019 And we got it.\u201d Wilson and Hanks have been married for 32 years and famously have one of the most solid relationships in Hollywood. But going through all this, so far from home, and on their own, would have tested any couple. How did they not lose their minds? \u201cI think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you or understanding that the person at home needs a break.

But something from that film stuck in her mind during her recovery: in the movie, her character performs Naughty by Nature\u2019s legendary anthem, Hip Hop Hooray. After a couple of days in hospital, she and Hanks were allowed to return to their hotel to recover, where they played card games, watched the ubiquitous Netflix documentary Tiger King (\u201cYeah, pretty crazy, ha ha!\u201d) and Ken Burns\u2019s documentary about country music. But Wilson still felt \u201ckind of foggy\u201d, so to get her brain back in shape, she decided to re-learn Hip Hop Hooray.

But the comment that thrilled Wilson the most came from Naughty by Nature themselves, who loved her version. Wilson and the group have now remixed the single and are releasing it to raise money for MusiCares Covid-19 Relief Fund, to support members of the music community. \u201cOne of my fans inboxed me and was like: \u2018Hey Vin! Have you seen this?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018What the, oh my Gahhhd,\u2019\u201d says NbN\u2019s Vin Rock with, one suspects, some understatement. Vin Rock was, he says, \u201caware of [Wilson] from her movies, and definitely her husband, Tom Hanks\u201d. (His favourite Hanks movie, for the record, is Forrest Gump: \u201cThe way they put him in all those historic scenarios!\u201d) \u201cFor us to be able to take this song and this moment and turn it into something positive, I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d he says.

In the past, he defended his frequent use of the n-word, although he has since put that down to his problems with drug addiction. He is clean now, but the 29-year-old got in trouble again earlier this year when he accompanied his parents to the Golden Globes and spoke in Jamaican patois on the red carpet. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Tom said of his children from his first marriage: \u201cThey remember when their dad was just a guy trying to, you know, make the rent. My other kids, they were born after I had established a beachhead in every way. And so their lives were just different.\u201d But Chet became a bit of a star during his parents\u2019 illness. He posted endearingly sensible video updates on their condition (\u201cThey\u2019re not tripping but they\u2019re going through the necessary precautions, obviously\u201d) and amusingly shot down the various conspiracy theories about Hanks being in the illuminati (\u201cIf somebody wrote it on the internet, you know it must be true\u201d). Instead of being mocked by the media, as he had been so often, Chet was now getting headlines such as \u201cHow Tom Hanks\u2019 Son Chet Haze Became a Soothing Voice Amid Covid-19\u201d. That must have made Wilson proud, I say. \u201cIt was very sweet of him. Of course, our entire family was concerned about us,\u201d she says, maintaining a protective discretion about her children. I tell her that the last time I interviewed her husband, he did the rap that he and Dan Aykroyd performed in the 1987 film Dragnet for me. So now I imagine them as a hip-hop family, all rapping to one another in the evening. \u201cOh my God, we make so much fun of that rap, that\u2019s hilarious! People say to me: \u2018Chet must have gotten his rapping from you.\u2019 But we were introduced to it more from our son rather than him being introduced to it from me,\u201d she says. Wilson is an accomplished musician in her own right and, since 2012, has put out four albums, three of which feature songs she wrote herself. \u201cWriting and performing songs has become so much more satisfying, compared to what I was being offered in movies. How many times can you play the understanding, nurturing wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, best friend? I mean, I\u2019ve exhausted the canon of those roles,\u201d she says. I tell her that part of what I loved about her Hip Hop Hooray Instagram post wasn\u2019t how she sounded but how she looked \u2013 totally unstyled and un-tweaked. How has she avoided that pressure to look perfect and maintain the face of a 29-year-old while living such a high-profile life in Hollywood? \u201cPart of it is my mom rarely wore makeup and I loved seeing her face evolve over time with me. I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me. Everyone has their vanity but I \u2013 I \u2013 hmmm. How to put this? I \u2026 just \u2026 don\u2019t care that much!\u201d she finishes with a laugh. But did she ever feel the pressure? \u201cOh yeah! When I was making Runaway Bride I had Botox, because Botox was new and everyone was getting Botox, and I got it in my forehead. But then I saw this movie, and there\u2019s this emotional scene where I\u2019m firing Richard Gere and my forehead didn\u2019t move. I thought: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not working!\u2019 I tried the lip-fillers around that same period of time, and one day I came home and my kids laughed at me, and I thought: \u2018OK, that\u2019s that!\u2019\u201d Wilson has to go now \u2013 possibly to watch An Affair to Remember, probably not. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful to be back to normal again,\u201d she says. So be careful, OK?\u201d After all, as she knows better than most, we\u2019re all just other people now.

      "body": "<p>It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p> <p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <p>As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling<em>, \u201cVamonos, vamonos!\u201d</em> Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia\u2019s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: \u201cGod save me, God save me.\u201d When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.</p> <p>Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of <a href=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/27/chlorine-leak-tyson-plant-hospitalizes-several/?latest\" title=\"\">the disaster</a>. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.</p> <p>It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson\u2019s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.</p> <p>The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme \u2013 one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant \u2013 has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.</p> <p>However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-03/u-s-chicken-industry-accused-of-conspiring-to-keep-immigrant-wages-down\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.</p> <p>Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-12\" title=\"\">according to a 2017 report</a> by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency\u2019s severe violator enforcement program, which targets \u201crecalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation\u201d after a worker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region7/12172013\" title=\"\">hand was severed</a> by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker\u2019s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region6/08162016\" title=\"\">a dozen violations</a>, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alabama-carlos-lynn-decapitated-chicken-processing-plant-a9381426.html\" title=\"\">Tyson chicken plant in Alabama</a> was decapitated in an accident.</p> <p>After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/tyson-chemical-spill-worker-injury-plant-inspection-privatization-slaughter-line-speed-usda/\" title=\"\">were hospitalised</a> after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. \u201cA contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor\u2019s use,\u201d the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.</p> <p>While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. \u201cI\u2019m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.</p> <p>On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and must \u201cshow up and do their job\u201d. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Walker IV/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. \u201cI am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,\u201d she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to be, where I can feel safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn\u2019t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn\u2019t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers\u2019 rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to \u201censure that the employees had effective hazard communications training\u201d, and \u201cnot all employees understood the labelling system in the facility\u201d, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html\" title=\"\">request</a>). Although the failure was categorised as \u201cserious\u201d, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 \u2013 or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised. </p> <p>The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. \u201cThese stories changed me for life,\u201d Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.</p> <p>In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson\u2019s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of <a href=\"https://www.uusc.org/press/new-arkansas-poultry-industry-report/\" title=\"\">a damning report</a> based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state \u2013 a third of whom worked for Tyson \u2013 who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.</p> <p>The report offered a rare window into workers\u2019 experiences in one of the state\u2019s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. \u201cWe were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,\u201d Licolli recalled. \u201cTalking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump\u2019s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state\u2019s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having <a href=\"https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=645\" title=\"\">sent buses</a> to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"long read email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day after the report came out, the workers\u2019 campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson\u2019s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson\u2019s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. \u201cThey were really mad that we were taking these actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they were lecturing us.\u201d</p> <p>Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson\u2019s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. \u201cI felt like it was the beginning of something different,\u201d she said</p> <p>A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/poultry-workers-wear-diapers-work-bathroom-breaks\" title=\"\">which claimed</a> that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation \u2013 wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.</p> <p>The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson\u2019s website expressed concern about \u201cthese anonymous claims\u201d in the Oxfam report, saying that \u201cwhile we currently have no evidence they\u2019re true\u201d, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.</p> <p>For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. \u201cIt felt like a relief for them to have our back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were stronger in that moment than ever before.\u201d The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson\u2019s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson\u2019s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. \u201cThere was nothing explicit,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo \u2018we are going to do this by this time\u2019 \u2026 it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.\u201d Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.</p> <p>While Oxfam <a href=\"https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/a-big-win-for-poultry-workers/\" title=\"\">hailed the agreement</a> as a \u201cbig win\u201d on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers\u2019 delegates had been left out of the discussion. \u201cIt was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: \u2018Good for you, good for me, let\u2019s say you are a good company,\u2019\u201d Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam\u2019s request to issue a statement. \u201cI do think the company wants to change, but we\u2019re also very cautious,\u201d she <a href=\"https://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2017/04/the-new-agreement-for-poultry-workers-is-not-the-end-its-just-the-beginning/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: \u201cSince the beginning of Oxfam\u2019s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers \u2026 In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But Licolli\u2019s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 \u2013 the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688294.pdf\" title=\"\">risked injury and pain</a>, but chicken factories were <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">lobbying aggressively</a> to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster.</p> <p>In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. \u201cI had a voice for the first time,\u201d she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers\u2019 right groups, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/31/581956147/usda-denies-poultry-industrys-request-to-speed-up-the-slaughter-line\" title=\"\">turned down</a> the request to speed up chicken processing lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Villafuerte/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid \u2013 an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment \u2013 was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article-abstract/69/4/294/5420724\" title=\"\">irritations</a> to medical workers, as well as <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/49/2/49_2_155/_article/-char/ja/\" title=\"\">asthma</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/viewpoints/antibiotic-use\" title=\"\">Tyson</a> announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: \u201cThe industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city\u2019s chicken plants.</p> <p>\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOxfam sold us out.\u201d Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing.</p> <p>The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn\u2019t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more.</p> <p>The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation\u2019s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/in-florida-tomato-fields-a-penny-buys-progress.html?hpw&amp;rref=us#slideshow/100000002843921/100000002843938\" title=\"\">had transformed</a> the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson.</p> <p>The Florida campaign had put workers\u2019 voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, \u201cby alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods\u201d. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, they were rejected. \u201cI was called a radical. And it\u2019s not that I am an extremist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.\u201d</p> <p>The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women\u2019s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. \u201cBecause we are fighters,\u201d Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos \u2013 meaning \u201cwe will win\u201d. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising.</p> <p>A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers\u2019 movement has potential. \u201cDespite all the circumstances they\u2019ve had to confront,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.\u201d</p> <p>In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were \u201cinstructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given \u201cessential employee verification\u201d papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\" title=\"\">essential critical infrastructure</a>\u201d workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might \u201cprovide services essential to the production of food\u201d.</p> <p>Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day\u2019s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all standing close together all the time. I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.</p> <p>Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tyson-foods-demand-poultry-plants-to-provide-paid-sick-days-for-their-hourly-workers?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=73fcf380-f097-012f-fc86-4040aa777426\" title=\"\">an online petition</a> demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.</p> <p>On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn\u2019t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy\u2019s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don\u2019t have [health insurance] coverage.\u201d The company also said: \u201cIf a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers\u2019 temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.</p> <p>Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. \u201cIt only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">How much is an hour worth?

      "bodyText": "It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight. On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death. As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling, \u201cVamonos, vamonos!\u201d Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia\u2019s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: \u201cGod save me, God save me.\u201d When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement. Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of the disaster. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them. It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson\u2019s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals. The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme \u2013 one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant \u2013 has many local priests and preachers on its payroll. However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a lawsuit filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit. Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, according to a 2017 report by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency\u2019s severe violator enforcement program, which targets \u201crecalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation\u201d after a worker\u2019s hand was severed by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker\u2019s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than a dozen violations, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a Tyson chicken plant in Alabama was decapitated in an accident. After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers were hospitalised after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. \u201cA contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor\u2019s use,\u201d the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days. * * * Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape. While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. \u201cI\u2019m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,\u201d she told me. Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed. On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and must \u201cshow up and do their job\u201d. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift. Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. \u201cI am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,\u201d she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to be, where I can feel safe,\u201d she said. Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn\u2019t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn\u2019t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers\u2019 rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle. * * * After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to \u201censure that the employees had effective hazard communications training\u201d, and \u201cnot all employees understood the labelling system in the facility\u201d, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information request). Although the failure was categorised as \u201cserious\u201d, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 \u2013 or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised. The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. \u201cThese stories changed me for life,\u201d Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions. In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson\u2019s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of a damning report based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state \u2013 a third of whom worked for Tyson \u2013 who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line. The report offered a rare window into workers\u2019 experiences in one of the state\u2019s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. \u201cWe were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,\u201d Licolli recalled. \u201cTalking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.\u201d That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump\u2019s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state\u2019s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having sent buses to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries. The day after the report came out, the workers\u2019 campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson\u2019s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson\u2019s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. \u201cThey were really mad that we were taking these actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they were lecturing us.\u201d Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson\u2019s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. \u201cI felt like it was the beginning of something different,\u201d she said A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, which claimed that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation \u2013 wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind. The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson\u2019s website expressed concern about \u201cthese anonymous claims\u201d in the Oxfam report, saying that \u201cwhile we currently have no evidence they\u2019re true\u201d, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed. For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. \u201cIt felt like a relief for them to have our back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were stronger in that moment than ever before.\u201d The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson\u2019s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better.\u201d Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson\u2019s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. \u201cThere was nothing explicit,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo \u2018we are going to do this by this time\u2019 \u2026 it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.\u201d Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks. While Oxfam hailed the agreement as a \u201cbig win\u201d on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers\u2019 delegates had been left out of the discussion. \u201cIt was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: \u2018Good for you, good for me, let\u2019s say you are a good company,\u2019\u201d Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam\u2019s request to issue a statement. \u201cI do think the company wants to change, but we\u2019re also very cautious,\u201d she wrote. When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: \u201cSince the beginning of Oxfam\u2019s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers \u2026 In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.\u201d But Licolli\u2019s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health. * * * After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 \u2013 the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers risked injury and pain, but chicken factories were lobbying aggressively to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster. In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. \u201cI had a voice for the first time,\u201d she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers\u2019 right groups, and turned down the request to speed up chicken processing lines. But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid \u2013 an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment \u2013 was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose irritations to medical workers, as well as asthma. In 2017, Tyson announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: \u201cThe industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.\u201d * * * On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city\u2019s chicken plants. \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOxfam sold us out.\u201d Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing. The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn\u2019t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more. The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation\u2019s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement had transformed the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson. The Florida campaign had put workers\u2019 voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, \u201cby alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods\u201d. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, they were rejected. \u201cI was called a radical. And it\u2019s not that I am an extremist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.\u201d The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women\u2019s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. \u201cBecause we are fighters,\u201d Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos \u2013 meaning \u201cwe will win\u201d. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising. A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers\u2019 movement has potential. \u201cDespite all the circumstances they\u2019ve had to confront,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.\u201d In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were \u201cinstructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager\u201d. * * * In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given \u201cessential employee verification\u201d papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation\u2019s \u201cessential critical infrastructure\u201d workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might \u201cprovide services essential to the production of food\u201d. Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day\u2019s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant. \u201cWe are all standing close together all the time. I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.\u201d Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home. Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched an online petition demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures. On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn\u2019t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy\u2019s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don\u2019t have [health insurance] coverage.\u201d The company also said: \u201cIf a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they\u2019re out.\u201d On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers\u2019 temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines. Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. \u201cIt only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.\u201d In early April, two workers at a Tyson plant in Georgia died from the virus. Tyson closed a pork plant in Iowa at the start of April after around two dozen workers tested positive for Covid-19; 186 people have now tested positive, and two people have died, presumed to be from Covid-19. Meat processing workers across the US and Canada are staging walkouts. Licolli said the crisis was spurring what could soon become an unstoppable movement among workers. \u201cWe\u2019re in such a crucial moment right now,\u201d she told me this week. \u201cThere\u2019s an urgency among poultry workers to organise and to mobilise. We\u2019re building a stronger movement that has the potential to bring about change. For the future of the country, we must think deeply about the meaning of these workers in our daily lives and stand up for their human rights and dignity \u2013 because they\u2019ve always been essential, and if they don\u2019t survive, we won\u2019t survive.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

The projection comes after the organisation said economies in Asia will see zero growth this year for the first time in 60 years. Pandemic turning into a \u2018child-rights crisis\u2019, UN warns The social and economic impact is potentially catastrophic for millions of children, according to a UN report launched on Thursday. It said Covid-19 was turning into a broader child-rights crisis that could lead to hundreds of thousands additional child deaths in 2020, in effect reversing the past two to three years of progress Myanmar to release 25,000 prisoners amid virus fears More than a quarter of Myanmar\u2019s prison population is to be released, the president\u2019s office announced on Friday, as calls grow to ease pressure on overcrowded jails with coronavirus fears gripping the country. Third Japanese cabinet official tests positive Japan\u2019s cabinet said on Friday an official had tested positive, making him the third case among officials at the cabinet office. The case comes as Japan expanded a state of emergency to cover all regions. The move allows local municipalities to urge people to stay inside, but without punitive measures or legal force.",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Chinese economy shrinks 6.8%</h2> \n<p>Friday is here and I\u2019m Warren Murray, ready to lead you through what\u2019s on offer in terms of news.</p> \n<p>Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-economy-shrinks-record-wuhan-covid-19-death-toll-rises-50-percent\">revised the city\u2019s death toll upwards by 50%</a> from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>Britain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/400bn-paid-in-dividends-by-uk-companies-before-coronavirus-crisis\">left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash</a>, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly.</p> \n<p>After attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders</a>. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trumps-science-based-reopening-strategy-is-still-full-of-unanswered-questions\">fail to set out critical elements</a> like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries.</p> \n<p>Dominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">\u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d</a>. He set out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections but also pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said.

It puts the government close to its overall estimate of between 3.4 million and 3.8 million people who are eligible to stay. Monthly data shows a backlog of 320,000 applications and researchers at Oxford have warned that many citizens may \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d \u2013 such as those in children\u2019s homes, care homes or victims of domestic abuse who may be prevented from applying. The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline, with an extension possible if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Roger Stone retrial bid fails \u2013 </strong>A federal judge has denied an application by Roger Stone for a new trial. The judge said there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/roger-stone-trump-denied-new-trial\">\u201czero evidence of \u2018explicit bias\u2019 against Stone\u201d</a>, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Chinese economy shrinks 6.8% Friday is here and I\u2019m Warren Murray, ready to lead you through what\u2019s on offer in terms of news. Wuhan\u2019s prevention and control taskforce has revised the city\u2019s death toll upwards by 50% from 2,579 to 3,869. The updated figure comes after weeks of scepticism about the reported toll. Meanwhile in the last few hours the business world has begun absorbing the news that the Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020. The first such contraction on record for China comes after months of paralysis from the coronavirus lockdown. Britain\u2019s biggest companies handed out almost half a trillion pounds in dividends and share buybacks in the years before the coronavirus crisis, according to a report calling for tough conditions on any taxpayer-funded bailouts. Burgeoning dividend payouts left companies weak going into the Covid-19 crash, as well as fuelling inequality, says the Common Wealth thinktank. It says the government needs to take an equity stake in firms receiving financial support, while job security guarantees should be made, and ministers could also impose bans on dividends and share buybacks, insist on maximum pay caps for top executives, and get assurances that companies will pay their taxes fairly. After attempting to lord it over state governors, Donald Trump has unveiled guidelines for reopening the economy that ultimately defer to them on when and how restrictions should be eased within their borders. The first phase allows for work but only essential travel; the second would allow for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel; the third allows for schools and organised youth activities to open up as well as large venues under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d and bars on the basis of reduced occupancy. David Smith writes that the guidelines are supposedly science-based but fail to set out critical elements like a national testing strategy \u2013 something that has proven vital in other countries. Dominic Raab has warned the British public that lockdown measures could last into June and any relaxation now would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d. He set out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections but also pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said. You can catch up quickly on more news here and our live blog is the place to be for further coronavirus developments. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * More than 3m apply to settle \u2013 The Home Office has received 3.4m applications from European citizens for settled status in the UK after Brexit. It puts the government close to its overall estimate of between 3.4 million and 3.8 million people who are eligible to stay. Monthly data shows a backlog of 320,000 applications and researchers at Oxford have warned that many citizens may \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d \u2013 such as those in children\u2019s homes, care homes or victims of domestic abuse who may be prevented from applying. The Home Office said there was still more than a year left until the deadline, with an extension possible if someone had reasonable grounds for missing the deadline. * * * Roger Stone retrial bid fails \u2013 A federal judge has denied an application by Roger Stone for a new trial. The judge said there was \u201czero evidence of \u2018explicit bias\u2019 against Stone\u201d, Donald Trump\u2019s longtime friend and adviser. Next, Stone is expected to ask an appeals court to throw out his conviction. He has 14 days to do so. Stone was found guilty and jailed over his attempts to sabotage a congressional investigation that posed a political threat to the president. * * * Saudi princess in plea from jail \u2013 A senior Saudi royal and granddaughter of the country\u2019s founding monarch has revealed she is in prison and demanded the current ruler and her cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, release her and provide medical care. Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al-Saud says she is being detained without charge or explanation in Riyadh\u2019s al-Ha\u2019ir prison with one of her daughters. Basmah has campaigned for Saudi women\u2019s rights as well as calling for Saudi Arabia to change from absolute to constitutional monarchy. Human Rights Watch (HRW) says dissenters are being ruthlessly silenced by Mohammed, the heir to the Saudi throne. A string of royals have been among those arrested in a series of purges over the past two years. * * * Great shot \u2013 The World Press Photo Foundation has announced the results of the 63rd annual photography contest. Here is a selection of this year\u2019s celebrated images. Coronavirus Extra The leader of the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Minette Batters, says she is optimistic British workers will help rescue the country\u2019s harvest, citing a \u201creal swell of support from people to do this\u201d. But a big problem for UK farmers is that about half the food eaten in the UK usually goes to restaurants and catering \u2013 and now there is nowhere for it to go. The cancellation of Wimbledon means its strawberry supplier in Kent is faced with 33 tonnes of perishable soft fruit with no market. \u201cWe will find a home for them,\u201d said Marion Regan, of Hugh Lowe Farms in Kent. She was talking to food banks as well as commercial outlets. In Singapore it is feared vast dormitories that house thousands of migrant workers in cramped conditions pose the threat of a surge in coronavirus cases. Health authorities are rushing to test residents, clean up the facilities and find more spacious accommodation. Low-paid women in US poultry factories are leading the struggle for fair conditions and basic safety. As Covid-19 rips through plants across the country, they have a fight on their hands. Today in Focus podcast: Covid-19 in a care home Julie Roche is a manager of a Buckinghamshire care home that usually has 45 residents. In the past few weeks she has lost 13 patients to coronavirus. She discusses the devastating impact this has had on families, staff and her remaining residents. Lunchtime read: \u2018So ill I could hardly stand\u2019 Rita Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks\u2019 Covid-19 diagnosis underlined how pervasive the disease could be. Wilson talks about the grim side-effects of the drugs she took to combat it, including choloroquine \u2013 as well as her rap-aided recovery \u2013 to Hadley Freeman. Sport Premier League clubs are divided over the thorny issue of how to end a season halted by coronavirus as they gather today for another extraordinary meeting to try to staunch its impact. The Rugby Football Union could face further multimillion-pound losses after World Rugby revealed the worst-case scenario is that \u201cno international rugby is possible this year\u201d. Devi Sridhar, the chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh and also a key adviser to the Scottish government on the Covid-19 pandemic, has described the plan to stage the Tour de France in August as a \u201crecipe for disaster\u201d. Formula One teams have failed to reach an agreement to adopt a substantial cut to the budget cap set to be imposed in 2021. Fifpro, the global players\u2019 union, has warned that women\u2019s football is faced with an \u201cexistential threat\u201d as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And Magnus Carlsen\u2019s aura of invincibility was dented for the second time this month when the world champion was defeated 8.5-7.5 in the final of the $14,000 Banter Blitz Cup by the tactical skills of 16-year-old Alireza Firouzja. Business Shares have actually risen acrpss Asia because China\u2019s economic data, while bleak, was better than expected. The strong open followed an overnight rally on Wall Street powered by buying of Amazon, health care stocks and other areas that are making money from the coronavirus crisis. The pound is worth $.1249 and \u20ac1.149 while the FTSE is showing a 2.8% fillip at time of writing. The papers \u201cLockdown may last into June as pressure builds over exit strategy\u201d \u2013 the Guardian on the strain that national cabin fever is bringing to bear on government decision-making. \u201c3 more weeks \u2013 the lockdown goes on \u2026 and it\u2019s likely to last even longer than that\u201d concurs the Metro. Both the Express and the Times lead with Dominic Raab promising there is \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d. The Mirror keeps up the pressure, demanding to know, after \u201c3 more weeks in lockdown \u2026 What then?\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cNo end in sight for lockdown\u201d, also highlighting how the PM\u2019s stand-in did not provide clarity. Though the Sun says Raab has dangled the \u201cKeys to the lock\u201d in the form of \u201cfive tests\u201d Britain must pass before restrictions can be lifted \u2013 including keeping the NHS safe and a steady reduction in deaths. The i reports oncologists\u2019 fears that \u201cCancer treatment cutbacks could kill 60,000\u201d. \u201cWear a mask in the office\u201d \u2013 the Mail says a possible government edict would also require them on public transport. The FT has done a big number with the French president: \u201cMacron warns EU will unravel unless bloc embraces solidarity\u201d, in which he says stricken economies such as Italy must be supported as they recover.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s major powers have failed to make progress towards meeting their commitments on aid spending, according to new data, prompting calls for countries to step up in the face of the Covid-19 outbreak. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development\u2019s (OECD) update on spending in 2019, published on Thursday, showed aid contributions by its forum of the largest donors were less than half the targeted 0.7% of their gross national income. Only five countries, including the UK, met or surpassed the 0.7% spending goal. Development advocates are calling for donor countries to meet their aid commitments to poor countries in order to help them meet the challenges of Covid-19, which researchers have warned could overwhelm health systems and set back the fight against poverty by decades. \u201cIf we are not going to do it now, then when are we going to do it?\u201d said Jan Van de Poel, policy and advocacy manager at the European Network on Debt and Development. \u201cThis recession is going to hit developing countries particularly hard and risk erasing any progress we\u2019ve made in the past decade. This is the time for donors to step up and increase their efforts.\u201d He said the recent commitment to maintain spending levels made by the OECD\u2019s development assistance committee, a forum of 30 major aid providers, was not enough in the circumstances, since countries would need to strengthen health systems and public infrastructure. The OECD\u2019s secretary general, Angel Gurria, praised a 1.4% overall increase in spending as \u201can important first step, particularly as we now have an additional duty to step up support to those countries facing the harshest impacts of all from the coronavirus crisis\u201d. However, spending as a proportion of income actually fell in 2019, from 0.31% to 0.3%. Van de Poel welcomed Wednesday\u2019s announcement by the G20 that it would suspend debt repayments for low-income countries but warned that debt relief should not be included in any increase in aid contributions, because it will do little to improve developing countries\u2019 capacity to invest in critical infrastructure. He also said the required funding increases should be provided through grants rather than loans. Oxfam International last week called on the G20 to provide an international rescue package including $1tn (\u00a380bn) in funding to countries and another $1tn in debt relief. Van de Poel said it was important that funding for the global coronavirus response was not focused solely on the disease and did not pull resources away from other serious issues. The EU has been criticised for creating a $15bn package for the global pandemic response by reallocating existing funds for other purposes. \u201cWe find this insufficient in effectively tackling this crisis and meeting the immediate health and socio-economic needs of the most vulnerable countries and people globally,\u201d said Riccardo Roba of Concord Europe, a confederation of European civil society groups. Robba also highlighted debates about how aid is used, with coronavirus leading to calls for donors to move away from funding single-issue campaigns to focus more on fundamental improvements in sectors such as healthcare. \u201cDonors need to move towards a more comprehensive, coherent and integrated approach, which addresses the health, social and economic impacts of the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need broader and long-term system change that benefits everyone. We need a radical change of course: these unique circumstances offer an opportunity to fundamentally rethink our models in order to achieve a sustainable future for people and the planet.\u201d Spending rose in more than half of the development assistance committee countries though the largest donor, the US, spent 0.4% less because of a reduction in bilateral aid. Germany and Sweden were among several countries that also reduced spending, because of a reported reduction in costs for refugees living within their countries. Gurria said maintaining spending levels was now key because of the coronavirus pandemic, despite the domestic difficulties facing many donor countries. \u201cThe response of development providers in the weeks and months ahead will be a critical force in the global battle against Covid-19. Overseas Development Assistance has proved to be recession-proof in the past, including during the 2008 financial crisis, and I am confident it can be again.\u201d",

Most of the fish eaten in the UK is imported, while the vast majority of the British catch is sent overseas. With the closure of restaurants and few means of exporting fish, small boats in particular have been stricken financially. The price of fish has also fallen, by as much as 80% in some cases, meaning fishermen struggle to turn a profit even when they can make a sale. Scotland, where the majority of the UK\u2019s fleet is based, has already offered \u00a35m to fund seafood companies initially, with fishermen on vessels of 12 metres or under able to claim half of two months\u2019 average earnings. Northern Ireland is providing \u00a31.5m to its fleet, and Wales has made grants available. The EU is also providing support to its fishing industry under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. Some small fishermen were facing ruin as their markets collapsed. Their quota allocations and the fish they can catch are unchanged, making it hard for them to adapt to the upheavals caused by the Covid-19 crisis. English fishermen have been in \u201canguish and despair\u201d for weeks as they saw little sign that the government had recognised their plight, said Luke Pollard, the shadow environment secretary. \u201cLabour has consistently called for more support for fishing and this announcement represents a start of the support fishing deserved weeks ago. Ministers have waited too long to provide this support and there must not be any new delay in payments being made to fishers.\u201d He pointed to his constituency of Plymouth, where cuttlefish makes up a large portion of the catch. The vast majority is normally sent to Spain, Portugal and Italy, but it is rarely eaten in the UK. Fishermen are trying to expand the UK\u2019s home market, but consumers have been reluctant to move beyond established favourites of cod, haddock, salmon and tuna. Less popular fish such as red gurnard, for instance, is plentiful, cheap and tasty, but overlooked. Schemes to deliver fish directly to consumers have helped, but have made only a small contribution so far. \u201cWith our near neighbours backing their fishing industries with bolder financial measures, their fishers will emerge from the coronavirus crisis in a much better position than many in the British fleet,\u201d Pollard warned. The new support scheme will run for three months and will focus on helping fishers with their fixed costs such as insurance, equipment hire and port costs. George Eustice, environment secretary, said: \u201cThis scheme will provide a lifeline for more than 1,000 fishing businesses so they can continue to maintain and operate their boats during this challenging time, which has seen falling prices and lack of demand for fish from the restaurant industry. \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with the fishing and aquaculture industry to ensure that they are supported and can get back to their vital role of providing fish for the table while contributing to the economy of many of our coastal communities.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A database of racist incidents against Asian Australians has received 178 responses in two weeks, as Queensland police also condemned a rise in anti-Asian racism during the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey, launched by community group Asian Australian Alliance, has received 12 reports a day since 2 April, ranging from racial slurs to physical assault. The majority of racist incidents were committed against women (62%) and 86.5% of in-person racist incidents were committed by strangers, according to the survey. On Wednesday, Queensland police announced there had been 22 incidents of racially-motivated offences against Asian Australians in recent weeks \u2013 including robberies, assaults and verbal abuse. In one case, a 15-year-old girl was charged by police for allegedly punching a 26-year-old woman in the face in Brisbane\u2019s Queen Street Mall after she accused her of having Covid-19. Queensland police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, said the true level of racist offences were being underreported and she encouraged more people to come forward to police. Of those surveyed, 147 of the incidents were in-person, 18 were online and 13 were \u201cother\u201d. Just over 60% of the self-reported incidents included racial slurs, 21% included verbal threats and 15% included physical intimidation such as being punched or shoved. Over a third occurred on a public street, 23% occurred in supermarkets, 15% on public transport, 12% in shopping centres and 11% in public parks and community areas. Erin Wen Ai Chew, the national convener of the Asian Australian Alliance, said the results of the database were \u201cextremely concerning\u201d. Only 5.6% of those surveyed reported their incidents to police. \u201cWhat our tracker shows is how under-reported incidence of racism is,\u201d she said. \u201cEven those which were described as physical racist altercations were not reported to the police, and this is extremely concerning.\u201d Victoria police are also investigating an incident on Thursday in which two female international students in Melbourne alleged a group of women attacked them and said \u201cwe\u2019re going to kill you\u201d over coronavirus fears. Video footage showed the pair being punched and kicked in the alleged racist attack. Last week, NSW police charged a 55-year old man who allegedly harassed and threatened people with a whip outside the Chinese consulate in Sydney. Of those who reported a racist incident in the survey, 81% said they believed it was related to the Covid-19 pandemic and 3% said it wasn\u2019t, with 7% saying maybe and 9% \u201cother\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. A quarter of incidents were said to be \u201cmade out as a joke\u201d. Chew called on politicians, public figures and media to make more public statements against prejudice. \u201cThe only way to combat this racism is to speak up and to be united against this hate,\u201d she said. \u201cThis Covid-19 racism is a symptom of the bigger issue of racism in Australia, and how this pandemic has been reported in tabloid media and by world leaders like Trump only encourages and enables this hate. \u201cOur Covid-19 racism tracker is a mechanism to create long-term campaigns to fight against this racism and to push our country\u2019s leaders and institutions to take this more seriously.\u201d Earlier in April, a group of 16 prominent Asian Australians created a petition calling for \u201cnational unity\u201d and an end to anti-Asian racism during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has condemned anti-Asian and anti-Chinese racism. \u201cIt was the Chinese Australian community that actually protected Australia so early on in this virus outbreak around the world,\u201d he told SBS. \u201cThe virus started in Wuhan, in China, that\u2019s what happened, that\u2019s just a fact.

      "bodyText": "\u2018Scott is a control freak\u2019: what Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new book tells us about his relationship with Morrison \u2018Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir is a sweeping account of events from his early childhood to being forced out of the prime ministership in 2018. Given Turnbull\u2019s tumultuous exit from public life, and the history wars that have followed, many readers will be interested in the former prime minister\u2019s reflections on Scott Morrison, the man who replaced him. Here are some of the standout passages.\u2019 Turnbull on sex and trust: \u2018How could I confirm the deputy PM lied to the prime minister?\u2019 \u2018Some of his past associates will not appreciate their appearances in this book, and there will be claims of confidences betrayed. But Turnbull clearly believes he dispenses trust too readily and that some of his political acquaintances and co-workers didn\u2019t deserve it.\u2019 Turnbull: News Corp is like a political party with the Murdochs encouraging intolerance \u2018News Corp operates like a political party, working closely with rightwing politicians to influence policy and elections and to destroy politicians who won\u2019t agree to a partnership with the Murdochs, the former Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says.\u2019 Prickles the sheep home at last after fleeing 2013 Tasmanian bushfires \u2018A Tasmanian family has been united with a long lost sheep seven years after they were separated by devastating bushfires that also burned down their farm. Prickles, as she is now known, was a little lamb when she became trapped in a 200-acre bush block at the back of the massive property during the bushfires of 2013.\u2019 Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot review \u2013 the question of Scottish independence \u2018His book is never better than when it attacks Scottish ideas of English oppression. Where it fails is its refusal to recognise that England has changed \u2013 from a stable and predictable neighbour into a volatile, abrasive and rather friendless country going who-knows-where.\u2019 6. Every Stephen Frears film \u2013 ranked! The director\u2019s last two projects \u2013 Quiz and A Very English Scandal \u2013 have been big hits on the small screen. So where should you start with his movies? Film critic Peter Bradshaw rates his favourites. 7. Guardian Australia owes Malcolm Turnbull thanks \u2013 but not favours \u2018In a revelation that may confound those who take a hyper-partisan view of politics, Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s new memoir outlines the part he played in the establishment of Guardian Australia. As Turnbull writes, in the seven years we have been operating, Guardian Australia has only rarely endorsed his or his government\u2019s policies.\u2019 8. I\u2019ve never seen \u2026 Top Gun \u2018Make no mistake: there is no gay subtext to Top Gun. It\u2019s more the case that gayness is the very text itself, the only possible reading available.\u2019 9. My favourite game: Barcelona v Real Madrid, La Liga 2010 \u2018Cristiano Ronaldo pushed Pep Guardiola. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho looked bewildered on the bench. And Sergio Ramos\u2019s brutal, vengeful hack left Spain teammates at each other\u2019s throats four months after they won the World Cup together. Pain was etched across Lionel Messi\u2019s face but it was Real Madrid who had been brought to their knees.\u2019 10. Can Marvel help Spider-Man\u2019s Sam Raimi escape from Hollywood purgatory? \u2018Thirteen years ago, as Sam Raimi wrapped production on Spider-Man 3, few would have imagined that it would not be until 2020 that the director of The Evil Dead stepped behind the cameras on another superhero movie.\u2019",

Emma Theofelus, 23, was appointed Namibia\u2019s information, communication and technology deputy minister a week after coronavirus hit Namibian shores. \u201cI have literally been learning on the job so far,\u201d she says. Part of Theofelus\u2019s role is to help lead communication to the public on preventative steps against the pandemic. The former youth activist and justice ministry legal officer was having a quiet Saturday at home when the surprise call came from State House. \u201cI have been put in a position, regardless of what limitations I might have, to show up and do the best that I can do,\u201d says Theofelus, who has had to learn very quickly how to navigate governance and political issues. So far Namibia has seen \u201ctremendous results\u201d in giving real-time information about coronavirus to the media and the public while thwarting fake news, she says. The appointment of younger leaders to high office is not entirely new in Africa.

Instead of advancing youth interests, the appointment of young people as ministers in Zimbabwe \u201chas been done over the years expediently and selectively\u201d, says Harare-based Ibbo Mandaza, director of the Sapes Trust thinktank. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly done half-heartedly, because the older generation doesn\u2019t want to give up power,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s also done as a way of co-opting and buying off the opposition.\u201d Mandaza says Coventry was appointed to woo white Zimbabweans. \u201cThere has not been a pattern of a systematic attempt for generational change in the region.\u201d Some heads of state have made young appointments to compete favourably with the opposition. For example, MDC leader Nelson Chamisa is 42, while in South Africa Julius Malema turns 39 this year. The 2018 Gates Foundation report, which focused on youth population growth, said investment in the booming youth population could be good for African economies because if young people are healthy, educated and productive, they could \u201cdo the kind of innovative work that stimulates rapid growth\u201d. Theofelus says she genuinely believes President Hage Geingob has good intentions. \u201cThe first time I met him I was 17, and from what I\u2019ve observed he\u2019s always been surrounded with young people,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was perhaps him walking the talk that young people are the leaders of tomorrow and we have to prepare them today.\u201d This does put a lot of pressure on her as a representative of young people, she says. Melanie Verwoerd, a Cape Town-based political columnist who in 1994, aged 27, became an ANC MP and the youngest woman in South Africa\u2019s first democratic parliament, says that while she believes it is important to have young public representatives, and while younger people have enormous energy, on a personal level age would have made her a better politician. \u201cAs a young MP I had enormous energy, so I was working myself to the ground,\u201d says Verwoerd. \u201cBut I was incredibly productive.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cthere is a sense and balance that comes with age and experience. I think I would be wiser, I would certainly be a lot less hot-headed.\u201d Being young in high office also brings frustrations. Aged 34 she became ambassador to Ireland, where her youth meant many colleagues in the diplomatic corps didn\u2019t take her seriously. \u201cThey would look me up and down and the ambassadors would say: \u2018You look hopelessly too young to be an ambassador.\u2019 And I had a standard refrain to say: \u2018Ja, they tried the old men, and that didn\u2019t work out so well, and now they\u2019re giving the younger women a try.\u2019\u201d Youth per se is not necessarily an important quality for leadership. \u201cIf it\u2019s the right person for the job and the right responsibility, I think age makes no difference. It\u2019s just important that, in particular for young people, there are mentors, there are people who guide them through the process,\u201d says Verwoerd. \u201cMaybe it becomes a little more important than for experienced, older people.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In a basement gallery in a French provincial chateau stands the perfect artwork for our chilling times. The Apocalypse Tapestry is by turns grotesque and daunting. It is also mesmerising in its beauty and intricacy. Yet few people know about it, even in France; fewer still have visited it.</p> <p>Commissioned by Louis I, the Duke of Anjou, in the late 14th century, the 90 different scenes tell the story of the Book of Revelation, the Bible\u2019s last gasp of horror, retribution and redemption. It hangs in the city of Angers, in a dimly lit modern gallery at the foot of the castle. The story of how it got there, and how it has survived, is almost as dramatic as the visions it depicts.</p> <p>In 1373, at the height of the hundred years war and not long after the Black Death, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_I_of_Anjou\">Louis</a> instructed <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennequin_de_Bruges\">Hennequin de Bruges</a>, a Flemish painter to the court of King Charles V, to draw a group of miniatures from the final book of the Bible. His designs were then woven into 100 separate tapestries by the workshops of Nicolas Bataille and Robert Poincon using vivid red, blue and gold woollen thread. This epic work \u2013 the largest known medieval tapestry in the world \u2013 took nine years to complete but was kept in a chest and rarely shown. However, it was brought out, mounted on six wooden pedestals, for special occasions such as the marriage of Louis\u2019s son, Louis II of Anjou, to Yolande of Aragon at Arles in 1400.</p> <p>Revelation was written by Saint John the Divine, who had been banished by the Romans to the Aegean island of Patmos (apparently after being plunged into boiling oil in Rome and suffering no injuries). It marks the final battle between good and evil: Satan as a dragon and Christ as a lamb. The tapestry tells the story of the book through the eyes of John, who is present in almost all of the panels. It depicts the seven seals, seven golden candlesticks, seven angels and seven trumpets \u2013 and, of course, the four horsemen, who are released by the opening of the first four seals. One of the most beautiful images, after all the blood and fury, is of John on the point of walking up the river of life into the new Jerusalem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fcbc3ab4f4c9a2ce822a4de39453b81755873c6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fcbc3ab4f4c9a2ce822a4de39453b81755873c6a/0_0_1300_882/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Apocalypse Tapestry in situ.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"678\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Apocalypse Tapestry in situ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jaubert French Collection/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The present day was also woven into the tapestry. The house of Anjou is promoted through its heraldry; the fleur-de-lys symbolises a resurgent France in its battles with the English. Images of suffering abound. Europe had lost tens of millions in the plague. For Louis, the tapestry was \u201cprimarily a status symbol, a sign of wealth and power\u201d says Dr Natasha O\u2019Hear, whose book, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25883731-picturing-the-apocalypse\">Picturing the Apocalypse</a>, is a study of two millennia of art inspired by the Book of Revelation. \u201cPeople turned to Revelation in difficult times, as they are attracted by its deterministic world view and its black-and-white certainty,\u201d adds O\u2019Hear.</p> <p>So what does Revelation \u2013 and what might the tapestry \u2013 tell us about our responses to Covid-19? Where better to turn than Fox News? On 18 March, as the pandemic was beginning to affect the United States, the TV station asked viewers: \u201cAre we witnessing the end of the world?\u201d It turned to a man called Tom Meyer, whom it described as \u201ca Bible professor who has the Book of Revelation memorised\u201d. Not quite yet, Meyer declared. \u201cWe should think of the current outbreak as a preview of things to come, the slightest taste of what life will be like during the great tribulation.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past few weeks, as people have had more time to reflect, discussions about human behaviour and causality have adopted a more urgent tone. To put it another way: is this pandemic a dress rehearsal for trials to come, a final warning perhaps?</p> <p>When I visited the tapestry in February, none of this was on my mind, even as coronavirus was spreading across China and into South Korea. I was awed by the beauty and horror of the work. Now, in seeking to relate it to our present predicament, I spent a day of isolation reading Revelation.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke ... and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth ... those which have not the seal of God in their foreheads should be tormented five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man. And in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>Jesus returns to Earth. Believers are raptured to heaven, and those left behind suffer seven (more) years of torment before the second death arrives for \u201cthe fearful and unbelieving, the abominable and murderers, and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a story for all times,\u201d says Alistair Tresidder, vicar of St Luke\u2019s church in north west London. \u201cIt has a happy ending, if you get through all the other bits. Revelation has seized the imagination of the artist down the ages.\u201d </p> <p>After Louis I\u2019s tapestry, the accounts of Philip the Bold, Louis\u2019s younger brother, record the commissioning of another set of six tapestries in 1386 from Poincon. Reformation, revolution, rebellions \u2013 the more dangerous the world, the more art fell back on Revelation. Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s cycle of 15 woodcuts at the end of the 15th century came at a time of pestilence and peasants\u2019 revolts. The works of William Blake and James Gillray reflected fears that the upheaval of the French Revolution would arrive on British shores.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t just bloodshed that caused artists to turn to Revelation. One of the great works of this genre is <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/john-martin-the-great-day-of-his-wrath-r1105619\">John Martin\u2019s The Great Day of </a><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime/john-martin-the-great-day-of-his-wrath-r1105619\">His Wrath, painted in 1853</a>. The Bible describes how \u201cthe sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/08/john-martin-painting-the-apocalypse\">Martin </a>depicts a pile of rocks collapsing, sending people falling into an abyss. Some eight million people saw Martin\u2019s works, a third of the British population at the time. According to William Feaver, art historian and author of a seminal work on Martin, the artist was reflecting a fear of machines, of lives torn asunder by rapid industrialisation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0136875812562c102278253e68597af07d819981\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0136875812562c102278253e68597af07d819981/0_140_2808_1685/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Day of His Wrath, by John Martin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Great Day of His Wrath, by John Martin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This appropriation of apocalyptic language and imagery has continued into the contemporary era. Hollywood\u2019s many blockbuster disaster movies have reflected dystopia from nuclear attack to financial meltdown to the climate emergency. O\u2019Hear points out that some are more directly based in Revelation than others. She cites as example the video game Darksiders, released in 2010, which draws on the four horseman of the apocalypse and the evil angel <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaddon_in_popular_culture\">Abaddon</a> for some of its characters.</p> <p>But she insists that nowhere is the story more vividly told than on the tapestry in Angers. For those who don\u2019t know the Revelation text, \u201cno better introduction could be imagined\u201d, she says. The sheer scale of the work \u2013 each panel is around two metres high \u2013 draws you in. You feel as if you are walking alongside John\u2019s visions, becoming absorbed and overpowered at the same time.</p> <p>It is remarkable that the tapestry still exists, given that during the French Revolution it was looted, cut into pieces and used as floor mats and blankets for horses. The pieces were gathered back by a canon of the cathedral and all but 16 were found and restored.</p> <p>It has been at its present site since the 1950s. \u201cWhen you come you are overwhelmed by it,\u201d says Emma Fonteneau, education officer at the castle. Last year the Chateau registered 261,000 visitors, which is a fairly small total given the importance of the work. She admits: \u201cSome people don\u2019t know it\u2019s here, even some in the town.\u201d French school pupils study the more famous tapestry at Bayeux, depicting the Norman conquest of England.</p> <p>The castle is planning to build a new interpretation centre within its grounds. It was scheduled to open in June, but now who knows when? It is also involved in a series of partnerships with Google to digitise the work. Last year, it launched a successful Night of the Apocalypse, coinciding with European Museum Night. For the most part, however, visitors still have to rely on group tour guides for explanation.</p> <p>I, for one, will be back in Angers as soon as I can. The tapestry tells you all you need to know about fear \u2013 and hope. O\u2019Hear suggests that audiences from the middle ages to Victorian times might have been less alarmed by works such as this, such was the near-universal belief in the Revelation story. \u201cThe difference between then and now is that then they had an unshakeable belief in the new Jerusalem. It was a happy ending. In a way, for them it was serene.\u201d</p>",

It has been at its present site since the 1950s. \u201cWhen you come you are overwhelmed by it,\u201d says Emma Fonteneau, education officer at the castle. Last year the Chateau registered 261,000 visitors, which is a fairly small total given the importance of the work. She admits: \u201cSome people don\u2019t know it\u2019s here, even some in the town.\u201d French school pupils study the more famous tapestry at Bayeux, depicting the Norman conquest of England. The castle is planning to build a new interpretation centre within its grounds. It was scheduled to open in June, but now who knows when? It is also involved in a series of partnerships with Google to digitise the work. Last year, it launched a successful Night of the Apocalypse, coinciding with European Museum Night. For the most part, however, visitors still have to rely on group tour guides for explanation. I, for one, will be back in Angers as soon as I can. The tapestry tells you all you need to know about fear \u2013 and hope. O\u2019Hear suggests that audiences from the middle ages to Victorian times might have been less alarmed by works such as this, such was the near-universal belief in the Revelation story. \u201cThe difference between then and now is that then they had an unshakeable belief in the new Jerusalem. It was a happy ending. In a way, for them it was serene.\u201d",

He wanted a house where he could entertain friends and family and display his outstanding collection of art. During Ferdinand\u2019s lifetime, it was used for summer \"Saturday to Monday\" house parties, which were legendary for their luxury and hospitality. Guests included Queen Victoria, the Prince of Wales, politicians and literary and artistic figures. Image: Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild (1839\u20131898), c.1880, British (English) School, National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 2:D - English 18th-century portraiture was a Rothschild family passion \u2013 their activities transformed the market in this field from the mid-19th century. Ferdinand assembled an important collection at Waddesdon and in his London house, including three boys in Van Dyck dress. Dressing up in 17th-century costume was popular from the 1730s for masquerades and portraits. Gainsborough was said to have kept one in his studio for the purpose. Image: The Pink Boy (possibly Francis Nicholls, b.1774), 1782, Thomas Gainsborough (1727\u20131788), National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 3:C - Martine-Gabrielle-Yoland de Polastron (1745\u20131793) is captured singing, by a piano with sheet music in her hand. One of the Queen\u2019s closest friends, she was governess to the royal children. The artist, also part of the royal circle, painted her in the fashionably informal dress popularised by Marie-Antoinette. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was one of only 15 women admitted to the prestigious French Acad\u00e9mie Royale, entering in 1783, the year this portrait was painted. Image: Martine-Gabrielle-Yoland de Polastron (1745\u20131793), Duchesse de Polignac, 1783, \u00c9lisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun (1755\u20131842), National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 4:D - The slanted corners of this canvas, one of three with similar subjects, indicate that it is an overdoor, made to be set into panelling. The dog is probably a type of King Charles Spaniel, a breed which became fashionable in the 17th century at the courts of Charles I and II. This rich chestnut and white variety was called a Blenheim, after the first Duke of Marlborough, who first bred them. Image: Overdoor with a Spaniel, Parrot, Flowers and Fruit, c.1730\u20131750, attributed to the Flemish School, National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 5:A - Lady Anne, a young widow, scandalously eloped with the King\u2019s brother, the Duke of Cumberland, enraging the King who introduced legislation requiring the royal family to seek the monarch\u2019s approval before marrying, still in place today. The antiquarian and politician Horace Walpole said she was \"as artful as Cleopatra\" with \"the most amorous eyes in the world, and eyelashes a yard long\". She never paid for her portrait, which was still in Reynold\u2019s studio when he died. Image: Lady Anne Luttrell (1743\u20131809), Duchess of Cumberland, 1772\u20131773, Joshua Reynolds (1723\u20131792), National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 6:B - Made between 1670 and 1690, this painting depicts the Herengracht, one of the four major concentric canals that ring the centre of Amsterdam. It is still a recognisable scene \u2013 house numbers 168 and 170-171 are visible. Van der Heyden was working in Amsterdam from around 1660, and lived in a house on this street. Netherlandish painting was much admired by the Rothschild family and this is one of a significant group at Waddesdon. Image: Amsterdam, Houses on the Herengracht, c.1670\u20131690, Jan van der Heyden (1637\u20131712), National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 7:C - Bakst (1866\u20131924) is best known as a stage designer, who helped found the Ballet Russes. He was commissioned by James de Rothschild in 1913 to paint a set of panels illustrating the Sleeping Beauty for his London house, using family members, their staff and family pets as models. It took nine years to complete, delayed by other projects and the outbreak of the first world war, much to James\u2019s frustration. Image: Sleeping Beauty: The Princess Pricks Her Finger on a Spinning Wheel, 1913\u20131922, Le\u0301on Bakst (1866\u20131924), National Trust, Waddesdon Manor, 8:B - The Lawn at Goodwood was painted around 1886 by Lowes Cato Dickinson, an artist specialising in giant, detailed canvases of large gatherings. Their real purpose was portraiture, and the only hint that this is a race meeting is the shadows of horses and jockeys in the foreground. Many people from the Rothschild\u2019s circle are depicted, several of whom visited Waddesdon, including the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII).

A <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/matt-hancock-criticised-for-giving-care-home-workers-a-badge-amid-fears-of-mounting-deaths\">tin badge for care workers</a>?</p> <p>When the lockdown is finally lifted, the world we will finally emerge into looks dark. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned of a staggering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/uk-economy-could-shrink-by-35-with-2m-job-losses-warns-obr\">35% plunge in GDP</a> this spring. Businesses are collapsing all around us, and according to the OBR\u2019s forecast, unemployment may reach an unthinkable 10%.</p> <p>The most obvious victims of the virus are older people, dying in multitudes in hospitals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-death-toll-in-englands-care-homes-reaches-1400\">care homes</a> and in their own homes. Often they die alone, gasping for air and many, it\u2019s feared, without sedation and morphine. Heartrending stories of nurses, doctors and others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/nhs-nurse-dies-coronavirus-hospital-where-she-worked-areema-nasreen-walsall\">dying too young</a> are the ones that grab our attention, but they are distant outliers on the graphs. The overwhelming number of deaths are among older people. <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26\">According to figures from the ONS</a>, 87% of those who have died from coronavirus are over 65. </p> <p>The lockdown is primarily in place to protect the vulnerable \u2013 mainly the old but other frail people, too. It\u2019s also there to protect the NHS from a surge that would have sunk it: the government was far slower than other European countries in its response, and as a result <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-could-have-europes-worst-coronavirus-death-rate-says-pandemic-expert\">Britain may top European </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/uk-could-have-europes-worst-coronavirus-death-rate-says-pandemic-expert\">death rates</a>. But, however reluctant at first, it became politically and morally impossible for the government to imagine a pile-up of some 500,000 coffins, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51979654\">worst case warning</a> of Imperial College epidemiologists. Sweden, refusing a shutdown, is now seeing its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/sweden-coronavirus-death-toll-reaches-1000\">death rate soar</a> above that of its locked-in neighbours. Will that be socially or politically sustainable?</p> <p>The blighted lives of the young are also a tragedy. This year\u2019s students, who are already heavily indebted, are emerging into a deep recession. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/recruitment-is-on-hold-the-students-graduating-into-the-covid-19-recession\">Graduate recruitment is grinding to a halt</a> and 68% of firms are cancelling work experience. Before, in the austerity years, graduates often had to work in service jobs \u2013 baristas, waiting staff, caterers, call-centre operators. Will these jobs still exist to fall back on this time around? No one knows if or how far the hospitality, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/20/over-one-hour-everything-cancelled-coronavirus-impact-film\">entertainment</a>, arts and events sectors will recover. And if graduates are knocked back, those without degrees will be hit even harder.</p> <p>Stand back and look at the context. My lucky <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/29/millennials-struggling-is-it-fault-of-baby-boomers-intergenerational-fairness\">postwar gilded generation</a> is the one being protected at the cost of everything else. Born into a brand new NHS, gifted free university education and jobs in a hugely expanding white-collar sector, we benefited from fine pensions and the mighty windfall of outrageously inflating property values for homes bought originally for a modest price.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/15/second-homes-now-worth-nearly-1tn-to-britons\">Around one in six people</a> born in the 1950s now owns a second home or buy-to-let property. No one intended to do down younger generations, but those in their 30s are already worse off than their parents were at their age, and less likely to own a home \u2013 ever. No home, no pension, university debt, no savings; no one designed this great betrayal, but no one stopped it happening either. Meanwhile, my generation overwhelmingly voted in Conservatives who rewarded them with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/scrap-triple-lock-uk-pensions-coronavirus-crisis\">triple-locked old age pension</a> rising above stagnant wages year after year: the old now are least likely to be poor.</p> <p>That\u2019s why, when this is all over, a huge redress is due to the young. A <a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/press-release-scrap-pensions-triple-lock-coronavirus/\">Social Market Foundation </a><a href=\"http://www.smf.co.uk/press-release-scrap-pensions-triple-lock-coronavirus/\">report</a> this week argued that the burden of paying the enormous cost of the crisis should not fall on those of working age alone: \u00a320bn could be saved over five years by abandoning the pension triple lock.

      "bodyText": "Lockdown in the UK has been extended \u2013 inevitable as the virus rages on \u2013 and there is no light yet at the end of this tunnel. Matt Hancock\u2019s abysmal performance in Tuesday\u2019s press conference was discouraging, with yet another iteration of his promises and plans on testing unmet. A tin badge for care workers? When the lockdown is finally lifted, the world we will finally emerge into looks dark. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned of a staggering 35% plunge in GDP this spring. Businesses are collapsing all around us, and according to the OBR\u2019s forecast, unemployment may reach an unthinkable 10%. The most obvious victims of the virus are older people, dying in multitudes in hospitals, care homes and in their own homes. Often they die alone, gasping for air and many, it\u2019s feared, without sedation and morphine. Heartrending stories of nurses, doctors and others dying too young are the ones that grab our attention, but they are distant outliers on the graphs. The overwhelming number of deaths are among older people. According to figures from the ONS, 87% of those who have died from coronavirus are over 65. The lockdown is primarily in place to protect the vulnerable \u2013 mainly the old but other frail people, too. It\u2019s also there to protect the NHS from a surge that would have sunk it: the government was far slower than other European countries in its response, and as a result Britain may top European death rates. But, however reluctant at first, it became politically and morally impossible for the government to imagine a pile-up of some 500,000 coffins, the worst case warning of Imperial College epidemiologists. Sweden, refusing a shutdown, is now seeing its death rate soar above that of its locked-in neighbours. Will that be socially or politically sustainable? The blighted lives of the young are also a tragedy. This year\u2019s students, who are already heavily indebted, are emerging into a deep recession. Graduate recruitment is grinding to a halt and 68% of firms are cancelling work experience. Before, in the austerity years, graduates often had to work in service jobs \u2013 baristas, waiting staff, caterers, call-centre operators. Will these jobs still exist to fall back on this time around? No one knows if or how far the hospitality, entertainment, arts and events sectors will recover. And if graduates are knocked back, those without degrees will be hit even harder. Stand back and look at the context. My lucky postwar gilded generation is the one being protected at the cost of everything else. Born into a brand new NHS, gifted free university education and jobs in a hugely expanding white-collar sector, we benefited from fine pensions and the mighty windfall of outrageously inflating property values for homes bought originally for a modest price. Around one in six people born in the 1950s now owns a second home or buy-to-let property. No one intended to do down younger generations, but those in their 30s are already worse off than their parents were at their age, and less likely to own a home \u2013 ever. No home, no pension, university debt, no savings; no one designed this great betrayal, but no one stopped it happening either. Meanwhile, my generation overwhelmingly voted in Conservatives who rewarded them with a triple-locked old age pension rising above stagnant wages year after year: the old now are least likely to be poor. That\u2019s why, when this is all over, a huge redress is due to the young. A Social Market Foundation report this week argued that the burden of paying the enormous cost of the crisis should not fall on those of working age alone: \u00a320bn could be saved over five years by abandoning the pension triple lock. In the FT yesterday, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, called for \u201ca new social contract\u201d with a more progressive tax system. Surely that will have to mean more justice between generations, and between earned and unearned income. Any social care reforms to raise standards must be paid for from the property assets of older people themselves. Because we live and love in families, this generational divide seems emotionally abstract, with no conflict between grandparents and grandchildren. The young have admirably supported a lock-in to defend the old. They have not protested at how their patrimony will be stolen by the pensioners. Nor have they complained enough at how older people have thrust Brexit and the Conservatives on to them by sheer weight of numbers. The young are very nice, too nice for their own good, perhaps. But when this is over, it will be payback time for them. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "A wave of planned anti-lockdown demonstrations that have broken out around the country to protest against the efforts of state governments to combat the coronavirus pandemic with business closures and stay-at-home orders have included far-right groups as well as more mainstream Republicans. While protesters in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and other states claim to speak for ordinary citizens, many are also supported by street-fighting rightwing groups like the Proud Boys, conservative armed militia groups, religious fundamentalists, anti-vaccination groups and other elements of the radical right. On Wednesday in Lansing, Michigan, a protest put together by two Republican-connected not-for-profits was explicitly devised to cause gridlock in the city, and for a time blocked the entrance to a local hospital. It was organized by the Michigan Conservative Coalition, which Michigan state corporate filings show has also operated under the name of Michigan Trump Republicans. It was also heavily promoted by the Michigan Freedom Fund, a group linked to the Trump cabinet member Betsy DeVos. But the protest also attracted far-right protest groups who have been present at pro-Trump and gun rights rallies in Michigan throughout the Trump presidency. Placards identified the Michigan Proud Boys as participants in the vehicle convoy. Near the state house, local radio interviewed a man who identified himself as \u201cPhil Odinson\u201d. In fact the man is Phil Robinson, the prime mover in a group called the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page features pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front. The pattern of rightwing not-for-profits promoting public protests while still more radical groups use lockdown resistance as a platform for extreme rightwing causes looks set to continue in events advertised in other states over coming days. In Idaho on Friday, protesters plan to gather at the capitol building in Boise to protest anti-virus restrictions put in place by the Republican governor, Brad Little. The protest has been heavily promoted by the Idaho Freedom Foundation (IFF), which counts among its donors \u201cdark money\u201d funds linked to the Koch brothers such as Donors Capital Fund, and Castle Rock, a foundation seeded with part of the fortune of Adolph Coors, the rightwing beer magnate. IFF have added their slogan for the event, \u201cDisobey Idaho\u201d, to stickers which they plan to distribute among the crowd. The event is also being promoted on a website dedicated to attacking Little for his response to Covid-19. That website was set up by the Idaho businessman, pastor and one-time Republican state senate candidate, Diego Rodriguez. Rodriguez launched the website at an Easter service held in defiance of the governor\u2019s orders on Easter Sunday, which was also addressed by Ammon Bundy, the leader of the militia occupation of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016 that become a rallying point for the anti-government right in the US. Bundy has been holding similar gatherings for weeks in Emmett, Idaho, where he now lives. On Sunday, he repeated his opposition to the Idaho orders, writing on Facebook: \u201cWe all have a duty to defend what is right and to make sure, that what God has given, man does not take away. Especially that great gift of agency, YES freedom!\u201d Ada county, Idaho, where the capital, Boise, is located, has so far suffered 541 cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, in a state which has a far worse outbreak than neighboring Oregon, which is 2.4 times more populous. Nevertheless, the ad for the rally on Rodriguez\u2019s website advises, \u201cWe feel that wearing face masks and gloves is counterproductive to the movement, and should be avoided.\u201d In Washington state, meanwhile, which for now has brought one of the worst outbreaks in the country under a measure of control, a Republican state committeeman, Tyler Miller, has organized a protest at the state capitol on Saturday. Miller, who is active in the Kitsap county Republican party, was involved in passing a resolution in January in support of representative Matt Shea, who was excluded from the state house\u2019s GOP caucus after a report commissioned by house found that he had participated in domestic terrorism. Hundreds of Facebook users have indicated that they will be attending his \u201cHazardous Liberty\u201d rally, and a parallel event in Richland, Washington. Included in that number are members of the 3% of Washington, a group which has held a series of open-carry rallies in Seattle, featuring speeches from the far-right protest leader, Joey Gibson. As for Shea, he is speaking on Saturday at an online \u201cSaving America\u201d conference which will discuss an alleged erosion of rights \u201cthat\u2019s been ramped up in unprecedented ways during this Covid-19 crisis\u201d. He is scheduled to appear alongside the likes of close ally Pastor Ken Peters, who has been holding monthly services outside Spokane\u2019s planned parenthood clinic; the actor, Maga personality and congressional candidate Mindy Robinson; and the New Zealand-based anti-communist speaker and author Trevor Loudon. Other similar events have been advertised for Saturday by an anti-vaccination activist in Oregon, and for Friday by a Boston group with alt-right connections.",

      "body": "<p>In Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises, Mike Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d he replies. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201d</p> <p>Mike is Scottish, which is something else we have in common.</p> <p>The other thing? His way with words. Of course. And then there\u2019s his way with money.</p> <p>I am not bankrupt \u2013 not yet \u2013 but on top of everything else that the coronavirus pandemic has brought me, there is the almost complete ruin of my finances which are now, to use a technical term, completely screwed. In the words of the brilliant country singer Brandy Clark: <em>If we had a penny we sure couldn\u2019t spare it / Sitting on the porch drinking generic Coke / We\u2019re broke.</em></p> <p>I am in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/millions-having-to-choose-between-paying-landlord-or-eating-research-suggests-coronavirus\">rent arrears</a> for the first time in my life. I owe thousands of pounds to family and friends. My <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/covid-19-pay-freezes-on-uk-loans-and-credit-cards-start-today\">credit card</a> is maxed out as I\u2019ve missed too many minimum payments. Direct debits bounce from my bank account like an orgy on a trampoline. Every time I go to the supermarket, which is not as often as it should be, I prepare my \u201cbemused and slightly irate\u201d face in the event of my card being declined. When the card isn\u2019t declined, I conceal my teary relief behind a mask of nonchalance. After All This is over, I\u2019ll have a credit score worse than Venezuela\u2019s.</p> <p>As much as I am grateful for the revival of the lost art of the telephone call, the renewed connection with old friends, the opportunity to make amends and put past enmities behind me, and the discovery of my heretofore unexplored talent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jan/28/20-best-egg-recipes-part-1-simon-hopkinson-elizabeth-david-omelette-tortilla\">cook eggs</a> eight ways, I nevertheless find myself sceptical of the cost-benefit analysis. After marvelling that I\u2019ve found eggs to cook with, I mean.</p> <p>My finances BC (before Covid-19) were already something of a fragile ecosystem. I left a career in journalism \u2013 or perhaps it left me, it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 to become a scriptwriter. It was going OK: after three years as a storyliner on Coronation Street and Emmerdale, I got my first script commission in 2017. Since then, I\u2019ve been beavering away on various projects, and scraping a living. But that was the deal. I knew that from the get-go. I accepted that, at least for a while, I\u2019d have a lemonade lifestyle on a lemonade wage.</p> <p>I was almost, nearly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/08/just-about-managing-austerity-brexit-public-spending-cuts\">just about managing</a> \u2013 not least because there was hope. Hope that a show I\u2019ve written \u2013 about the teenage children of the super-rich, ironically enough \u2013 might get a green light. Hope that other ideas might get put into development somewhere. Hope that I might get into a writers\u2019 room on someone else\u2019s show. Hope that a play I\u2019ve written might catch the eye of a theatre. Now though, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-support-loophole-uk-film-tv-staff-without-pay-mps\">TV production</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/covid-19-prompts-more-cultural-institutions-to-shut-doors\">theatre</a> are in short supply. Hope is in short supply. They say that it\u2019s the hope that kills you in the end. I\u2019d say that despair is also pretty lethal. Just when you\u2019re making ends meet, someone moves the ends.</p> <p>These are not unfamiliar circumstances for me. I grew up in the 1980s in a single-parent household with very little money.

      "bodyText": "In Ernest Hemingway\u2019s The Sun Also Rises, Mike Campbell is asked how he went bankrupt. \u201cTwo ways,\u201d he replies. \u201cGradually and then suddenly.\u201d Mike is Scottish, which is something else we have in common. The other thing? His way with words. Of course. And then there\u2019s his way with money. I am not bankrupt \u2013 not yet \u2013 but on top of everything else that the coronavirus pandemic has brought me, there is the almost complete ruin of my finances which are now, to use a technical term, completely screwed. In the words of the brilliant country singer Brandy Clark: If we had a penny we sure couldn\u2019t spare it / Sitting on the porch drinking generic Coke / We\u2019re broke. I am in rent arrears for the first time in my life. I owe thousands of pounds to family and friends. My credit card is maxed out as I\u2019ve missed too many minimum payments. Direct debits bounce from my bank account like an orgy on a trampoline. Every time I go to the supermarket, which is not as often as it should be, I prepare my \u201cbemused and slightly irate\u201d face in the event of my card being declined. When the card isn\u2019t declined, I conceal my teary relief behind a mask of nonchalance. After All This is over, I\u2019ll have a credit score worse than Venezuela\u2019s. As much as I am grateful for the revival of the lost art of the telephone call, the renewed connection with old friends, the opportunity to make amends and put past enmities behind me, and the discovery of my heretofore unexplored talent to cook eggs eight ways, I nevertheless find myself sceptical of the cost-benefit analysis. After marvelling that I\u2019ve found eggs to cook with, I mean. My finances BC (before Covid-19) were already something of a fragile ecosystem. I left a career in journalism \u2013 or perhaps it left me, it\u2019s hard to say \u2013 to become a scriptwriter. It was going OK: after three years as a storyliner on Coronation Street and Emmerdale, I got my first script commission in 2017. Since then, I\u2019ve been beavering away on various projects, and scraping a living. But that was the deal. I knew that from the get-go. I accepted that, at least for a while, I\u2019d have a lemonade lifestyle on a lemonade wage. I was almost, nearly, just about managing \u2013 not least because there was hope. Hope that a show I\u2019ve written \u2013 about the teenage children of the super-rich, ironically enough \u2013 might get a green light. Hope that other ideas might get put into development somewhere. Hope that I might get into a writers\u2019 room on someone else\u2019s show. Hope that a play I\u2019ve written might catch the eye of a theatre. Now though, TV production and theatre are in short supply. Hope is in short supply. They say that it\u2019s the hope that kills you in the end. I\u2019d say that despair is also pretty lethal. Just when you\u2019re making ends meet, someone moves the ends. These are not unfamiliar circumstances for me. I grew up in the 1980s in a single-parent household with very little money. One of my most vivid childhood memories is of my mum having to choose what to buy with what was left of her family allowance (as it was then). A pint of milk or a loaf of bread? My feelings now are similar to my feelings then when I knew that my friends were much better off than we were. Embarrassment, envy, anger and sadness. Having no money is humiliating, frustrating, infantilising. It erodes your self-worth in a very particular way. It is stealthy and vicious. I feel pathetic and I feel ashamed. And it makes me feel sick \u2013 actually physically nauseous \u2013 writing all this down. But shame is why I\u2019m writing this. (That and the fee I\u2019ll get for it, because I don\u2019t want to borrow, I want to earn.) Shame thrives in silence, in secrecy. So I am trying to own the shame lest the shame own me.

It said the \u201cthe minimum standard should be fit-checking by a suitably trained person\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Anzca president, Dr Rodney Mitchell, said there was no question that fit-testing would be done in every instance in an ideal world, but that the rapid evolution of the crisis meant it wasn\u2019t always possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe recognise that the gold-standard is a formal fit-test. We recognise that we have to minimise risk, and that\u2019s why we wash our hands all the time, we\u2019re wearing long-sleeve gowns, the masks, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing all these things,\u201d Mitchell said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlong the way we are having to accept a certain amount of risk.

      "bodyText": "Peak medical groups say hospitals should be protecting frontline staff from Covid-19 by a more rigorous testing regime for face mask fit. The pandemic has caused a significant loss of life among frontline medical staff in the United Kingdom, where Guardian estimates put the number of reported dead at more than 50. Doctors there have sounded the alarm on the lack of fit-testing being conducted on masks, saying it was like \u201cplaying Russian roulette with doctors\u2019 lives\u201d. Fit-testing is a roughly 30-minute process to ensure the masks healthcare workers are wearing do not leak. The test is often performed by spraying substances at the wearer to check if they can be tasted, or through the use of dye and particle measurement. In Australia, fit-testing is recommended in most jurisdictions, but not mandated. Fit-checking, a rudimentary check for gaps between the mask and the skin, is far more common. Anaesthetists are some of the most at risk medical practitioners to Covid-19, and can be highly exposed during intubation. The Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists (Anzca) issued advice last week saying that fit-testing was recommended, but may not be \u201cattainable or practical in all situations and organisations\u201d. It said the \u201cthe minimum standard should be fit-checking by a suitably trained person\u201d. The Anzca president, Dr Rodney Mitchell, said there was no question that fit-testing would be done in every instance in an ideal world, but that the rapid evolution of the crisis meant it wasn\u2019t always possible. \u201cWe recognise that the gold-standard is a formal fit-test. We recognise that we have to minimise risk, and that\u2019s why we wash our hands all the time, we\u2019re wearing long-sleeve gowns, the masks, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing all these things,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAlong the way we are having to accept a certain amount of risk. For example, we do not wear the full protective equipment for every single patient, because we know that the degree of community transmission in Australia does not require it. \u201cIt becomes a question of what\u2019s acceptable.\u201d Dr Andrew Miller, the Australian Medical Association\u2019s West Australian president, said about one-third of those who underwent fit-testing failed, showing the importance of the test in protecting workers and ensuring they had the right mask. \u201cSo if you\u2019re not doing this sort of checking people will go into a situation where they are exposed to Covid and they have no idea whether or not the mask is going to protect them,\u201d Miller told the Guardian. Many doctors are also calling for a fundamental rethink of Australia\u2019s approach to ensuring the safety of healthcare workers. Miller, in his personal capacity, has co-written a paper and submitted it to WA Health, questioning the current approach to PPE. The paper argues PPE use should be guided by a precautionary principle, which recognises that much is still unknown about Covid-19, including the nature of its transmissibility, and therefore staff should be provided with maximum protection until further evidence emerges. The chief aim should be to ensure not a single medical worker dies in Australia, the paper argues. Such an approach would upgrade the level of PPE on offer and strengthen infection control systems. It also urged the state to allow healthcare workers to use their own PPE. \u201cWhen the science is uncertain, and the workplace is going to be messy and disorganised, and suddenly ramping up to deal with disease we\u2019ve never treated before, those are all reasons why you go more conservative on your safety, not less,\u201d he said. The Australian Society of Anaesthetists said fit-testing was a \u201ccritical part\u201d of preparing for Covid-19, which was \u201cbest implemented prior to a pandemic\u201d. The ASA contacted the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, early on when Covid-19 appeared in Australia, expressing concerns that there may not be sufficient time to train and prepare. \u201cWe were pleased to see the suspension of non-urgent elective surgery to allow time for this preparation and to reduce the risk of infection amongst healthcare workers,\u201d Dr Suzi Nou, the ASA president, told the Guardian. Like Anzca, Nou said the ASA encouraged fit-testing wherever possible but also understood that it \u201cmay not be practical to implement in all health services\u201d. \u201cWe commend the many health services that have undertaken fit-testing and all other endeavours in the initial phase of this pandemic to reduce transmission to patients, healthcare workers and the community.\u201d",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHome care is the forgotten cousin of the already second-class social care sector, both in terms of lack of attention and understanding from government,\u201d he said. </p> \n<p>About 97% of the UK\u2019s home care is provided by independent providers.

But we are already working on extremely tight margins and, with a lack of funding and sky-high costs of PPE, there will be providers who go bust.</p> \n<p>\u201cOvernight, local authorities will have the responsibility of picking up care for bankrupt providers but will not have resources to do so. It could well mean people left without care and, in the worst-case scenarios, falling through the cracks and dying alone at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>Self-isolation and staff sickness means that home care providers are also having to rely on expensive agency staff during the crisis. At the same time, many have had clients cancelling their contracts because they are scared of infection.</p> \n<p>Gill Heppell, the founder of the Nottingham-based home care provider PerCurra, said the cost of PPE was exorbitant while supply was short.</p> \n<p>\u201cMasks now cost \u00a311.95 each \u2013 and you have to buy 1,000. I am never going to need 1,000, and I hope I won\u2019t need them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually buy two five-litre tubs of hand sanitiser for \u00a330. One tub now costs \u00a3100. Gloves usually cost \u00a31.90 for 100. Now they are \u00a320.</p> \n<p>\u201cMost of these are single-use items. One care worker can get through dozens of pairs of gloves a day.

At the same time, we\u2019re getting reports from some providers that they\u2019re not going to be able to pay their staff in the next payroll.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are going to be a number of home care providers who will go to the wall in the next month or two because of the exponential increase in costs and an increase in the number of visits cancelled by councils and by people who fund their own care. That\u2019s the fear we\u2019re hearing now in the sector.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIf there are a number of closures of providers in the same area, the local authority might well fail to identify everyone in need quickly enough to step in in time.

But we are already working on extremely tight margins and, with a lack of funding and sky-high costs of PPE, there will be providers who go bust. \u201cOvernight, local authorities will have the responsibility of picking up care for bankrupt providers but will not have resources to do so. It could well mean people left without care and, in the worst-case scenarios, falling through the cracks and dying alone at home.\u201d Self-isolation and staff sickness means that home care providers are also having to rely on expensive agency staff during the crisis. At the same time, many have had clients cancelling their contracts because they are scared of infection. Gill Heppell, the founder of the Nottingham-based home care provider PerCurra, said the cost of PPE was exorbitant while supply was short. \u201cMasks now cost \u00a311.95 each \u2013 and you have to buy 1,000. I am never going to need 1,000, and I hope I won\u2019t need them at all,\u201d she said. \u201cWe usually buy two five-litre tubs of hand sanitiser for \u00a330. One tub now costs \u00a3100. Gloves usually cost \u00a31.90 for 100. Now they are \u00a320. \u201cMost of these are single-use items. One care worker can get through dozens of pairs of gloves a day. Home care providers won\u2019t survive in this environment. I have real concerns what will happen if government doesn\u2019t get this right.\u201d Angel said the lack of oversight increased the risk that if a small or medium-sized home care provider were forced to close, the people it cared for would not be picked up by the local authority in time. \u201cHome care providers suffer a number of problems, the most important being financial,\u201d he said. \u201cMost councils in England have not yet paid out any of the \u00a31.6bn that government has made available to them. At the same time, we\u2019re getting reports from some providers that they\u2019re not going to be able to pay their staff in the next payroll. \u201cThere are going to be a number of home care providers who will go to the wall in the next month or two because of the exponential increase in costs and an increase in the number of visits cancelled by councils and by people who fund their own care. That\u2019s the fear we\u2019re hearing now in the sector.\u201d He added: \u201cIf there are a number of closures of providers in the same area, the local authority might well fail to identify everyone in need quickly enough to step in in time. Vulnerable people will fall through the cracks and not get the care they need.\u201d Ian Hudspeth, the chair of the Local Government Association\u2019s community wellbeing board, said: \u201cThere are many and growing calls on the \u00a31.6bn funding and additional resources will be needed to allow councils to continue to support social care and other services.\u201d A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cOur adult social care action plan sets out how we are protecting workers by ramping up testing across the system for care workers and their families and we\u2019re ensuring millions of additional PPE items reach those on the frontline with local resilience forums identifying those most in need of more. \u201cThe secretary of state has written to local authorities, outlining how the \u00a31.6bn funding for local authorities should support adult social care providers and workers. To ensure this additional funding is making a difference, we are asking local authorities to provide information about the distribution of this funding to providers.\u201d Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

The government also announced that NBN Co will give $150m in financial relief to internet providers, with $50m of that to assisting low-income families with school-aged children access online learning. Rise in domestic violence incidents in NSW The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, said there has been an \u201cincrease in the reports of domestic and family violence incidents, which means police are responding to more calls\u201d. However, he said reports of domestic and family violence assaults were down, and other assaults were down as people stay inside. Tasmania considers stricter north-west lockdown The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said he would renew the lockdown in the state\u2019s north-west, and would \u201cif necessary\u201d strengthen it. IR changes will be reversed if employers abuse them, ACTU says The head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, has promised to reverse workplace law changes if employers are found to be abusing them. Yesterday, Porter announced that workers will only have 24 hours to consider changes made by their employers to their enterprise bargaining agreements. Previously that had been seven days. \u201c[Porter] said that if it\u2019s true, what we\u2019re saying, and if employers do abuse this, that he is prepared to reverse the regulation,\u201d McManus said.

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m at home in California but my brother is in hospital in New York with coronavirus, and his situation is very serious. So this is a very difficult time, very trying. It\u2019s springtime here, outside everything is beautiful and the flowers are popping out \u2013 yet many of my friends have died. There\u2019s been about four people from a club I worked at in Harlem, St Nick\u2019s Pub; I was on a cruise with Wallace Roney recently [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/01/wallace-roney-us-jazz-trumpeter-dies-aged-59-from-coronavirus\">the trumpeter died of coronavirus, aged 59</a>]. It\u2019s right in your face. So musically, this is not the time for anything mean, aggressive or negatively confrontational.

I need the intimacy of that music. He has a knack, and it could be because of his faith, of taking you to a very spiritual, non-denominational place. I was floating above the water while I was floating in the water, while listening to his music.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXwWvH5QVRM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AXwWvH5QVRM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>My son is seven and he likes Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. He\u2019s less into Marshmello these days and more into Deadmau5, so we\u2019re dancing around. It has been very sweet to be with him, and when I go into his world I\u2019m less stressed, my neck is less stiff. Me and my wife are involved in his education in a big way now \u2013 we are the teachers, the cafeteria workers and his playmates, as he hasn\u2019t seen another child in three weeks. His level of play, of freedom, is a beautiful thing to watch. He\u2019s like: let me play to exhaustion, let me love so hard it hurts. These are things we all need to reaffirm. So I\u2019m musically reaffirming and emotionally reaffirming, just by watching him. I\u2019m thinking of the Bible passage: become as little children.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=god7hAPv8f0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/god7hAPv8f0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is going to sound strange but I\u2019ve been listening to my own music too, just reaffirming the things I believe. When I sing No Love Dying, or even songs that people think are dance songs, such as Liquid Spirit, I\u2019m actually talking with my mother, and listening to those songs is a way for me to find reassurance. There\u2019s a song on my new album called Real Truth, about how life and death is the ultimate truth, whether you will or won\u2019t breathe \u2013 so this is coming to me in a new way. Another song, Thank You, I released early because I wanted to say thank you to all these healthcare workers that are working around the world, putting their lives in danger. We\u2019re all distancing ourselves, running away from the fire, and they\u2019re running into it. The people who do that are extraordinary and I want to say thank you with that song.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yRZK43gfyE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3yRZK43gfyE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>What I put out into the universe is positive; I\u2019m proud of the way that I haven\u2019t deviated from that, and that I\u2019m still optimistic. And so, in a trying time like this, made even more trying by the sickness of my brother, I lean on the things that I\u2019ve said and hope it reaffirms my belief in them. A magnificent comforter \u2013 a thing that I feel is a gift \u2013 is all of this music, man. I\u2019m so thankful to have this music.</p> <p>\u2022 Thank You by Gregory Porter is out now. A new album, <a href=\"http://www.bluenote.com/artist/gregory-porter/\">All Rise</a>, will be released on 28 August on Decca/Blue Note.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jair Bolsonaro is leading Brazilians \u201cto the slaughterhouse\u201d with his irresponsible handling of coronavirus, the country\u2019s former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has said. In an impassioned interview with the Guardian \u2013 which came as Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll hit 1,924 \u2013 Lula said that by undermining social distancing and defenestrating his own health minister, Brazil\u2019s \u201ctroglodyte\u201d leader risked repeating the devastating scenes playing out in Ecuador where families have had to dump their loved ones\u2019 corpses in the streets. \u201cUnfortunately I fear Brazil is going to suffer a great deal because of Bolsonaro\u2019s recklessness \u2026 I fear that if this grows Brazil could see some cases like those horrific, monstrous images we saw in Guayaquil,\u201d said the 74-year-old leftist. \u201cWe can\u2019t just want to topple a president because we don\u2019t like him,\u201d Lula admitted. \u201c[But] if Bolsonaro continues to commit crimes of responsibility \u2026 [and] trying to lead society to the slaughterhouse \u2013 which is what he is doing \u2013 I think the institutions will need to find a way of sorting Bolsonaro out. And that will mean you\u2019ll need to have an impeachment.\u201d Bolsonaro \u2013 a proudly homophobic former army captain already despised by progressive Brazilians for his hostility to the environment, indigenous rights and the arts, as well as his alleged links to Rio\u2019s mafia \u2013 has alienated millions more with his dismissive stance towards the coronavirus, which he belittles as media \u201chysteria\u201d and a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d. Since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on 11 March, Brazil\u2019s president has repeatedly thumbed his nose at social distancing, first by egging on and attending pro-Bolsonaro protests and then with a series of provocative visits to bakeries, supermarkets and pharmacies. During one unnecessary outing Bolsonaro declared: \u201cNo one will hinder my right to come and go.\u201d In March the rightwing populist even suggested Brazilians need not worry about Covid-19 since they could bathe in excrement \u201cand nothing happens\u201d. Such moves put Bolsonaro at loggerheads with his own health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, a doctor-turned-politician who was fired on Thursday after challenging the president\u2019s behaviour. Meanwhile Bolsonaro\u2019s politician son, Eduardo, has taken the wrecking ball to ties with Brazil\u2019s most important trade partner, China, by accusing its Communist party leaders of being to blame for the coronavirus crisis. Bolsonaro\u2019s actions have sparked nightly pot-banging protests in cities up and down the country and drawn scorn from across the political spectrum. \u201cCoronavirus must be laughing its head off,\u201d Eliane Cantanh\u00eade, a columnist for the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, wrote of Bolsonaro\u2019s antics this week. The rightwing governor of Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, has declared the country at war with both the coronavirus and the \u201cBolsonaro-virus\u201d. Lula, who governed from 2003 until 2010, claimed that Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cgrotesque\u201d actions were endangering lives by ignoring distancing guidelines put in place by Brazil\u2019s own health ministry. \u201cIt\u2019s natural that a portion of society doesn\u2019t understand the need to stay at home or how serious this is \u2013 especially when the president of the republic is a troglodyte who says it\u2019s just a little flu,\u201d Lula said by video call from the Brazilian city of S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, where he is in self-isolation after returning from a tour of Europe. \u201cThe truth is Bolsonaro doesn\u2019t think about the impact his destructive acts have on society. He\u2019s reckless.\u201d Bolsonaro says his opposition to distancing stems from his desire to protect Brazil\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and their jobs. After sacking his health minister, Bolsonaro claimed to be fighting for \u201cthe long-suffering Brazilian people\u201d and warned coronavirus threatened to become \u201ca veritable meat grinder of jobs\u201d. \u201cAt no point has the government abandoned the neediest \u2026 The impoverished masses cannot stay stuck up at home,\u201d Bolsonaro said. \u201cI know \u2026 life is priceless. But the economy and jobs must return to normal.\u201d Lula, who was born into rural poverty and won international plaudits for his fight against hunger, scoffed at the idea Bolsonaro was a champion of the poor. \u201cBolsonaro is only interested in himself, his kids, some pretty conservative generals and his paramilitary friends,\u201d he claimed, in reference to longstanding allegations over the Brazilian president\u2019s family ties to the Rio de Janeiro mafia. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t speak to society. Bolsonaro doesn\u2019t have ears to listen. He just has a mouth to talk nonsense.\u201d While Brazil\u2019s former president claimed impeachment was an option, he conceded there was not currently support for that in the country\u2019s congress, as there was when his leftwing successor Dilma Rousseff was removed from office in 2016. He said many rightwing politicians thought it wiser to allow Bolsonaro to continue sabotaging his chances of re-election in 2022 through his own incompetence \u2013 before electing another president from the right. Lula, who was sidelined from 2018\u2019s election after being jailed on disputed corruption charges, signalled he would not be the leftwing candidate in that contest. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my political rights so I\u2019m not talking about myself,\u201d said Lula, who was released in November 2019 from 580 days in prison after a supreme court ruling. \u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you something, you can be certain the left will be governing Brazil again after 2022. We don\u2019t need to talk about who the candidate is right now. But we will vote for someone who is committed to human rights and respects them, who respects environmental protection, who respects the Amazon \u2026 who respects blacks and the indigenous. We\u2019re going to elect someone who is committed to the poor of this country.\u201d Observers of Brazilian politics are less sure Bolsonaro is totally finished \u2013 or that the left is well positioned to replace him. Some believe Bolsonaro \u2013 one of just four world leaders still downplaying coronavirus alongside the authoritarian presidents of Nicaragua, Belarus and Turkmenistan \u2013 has obliterated his chances of a second term with his response to the crisis. But Thomas Traumann, a political commentator and communications minister under Rousseff, said such certainty was premature: \u201cThere are two centuries to go until 2022.\u201d Traumann said it was clear Bolsonaro had severely weakened himself \u2013 but so far rightwing politicians such as the governors of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo appeared to be capitalising on Bolsonaro\u2019s blunders the most. And ultimately Brazil was hurtling into such an unpredictable and potentially tumultuous few weeks that it was impossible to know what the political fallout might be. \u201cWe know Bolsonaro will come out of this weaker. We know his mistakes will not be forgiven,\u201d Traumann said. How the political chips would fall after that was anyone\u2019s guess, Traumman added, likening Brazil\u2019s predicament to the start of a rollercoaster ride. \u201cAll we know is that many loops lie ahead \u2026 We are moving into an unknown world \u2026 We are sailing in the darkness.\u201d Lula said he was certain of one thing: that at a moment of national crisis, Brazil needed a leader capable of uniting its 211 million citizens. \u201cA president should be like the conductor of an orchestra,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is that our conductor knows nothing about music, can\u2019t read a score and doesn\u2019t even know how the batons work. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to play classical music with the instruments you use to play samba. He\u2019s turned his orchestra into a madness \u2013 a Tower of Babel,\u201d Lula said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing in the presidential palace \u2026 Not even Trump takes him seriously.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>At 57, I had never been camping nor had any desire to. But late last year I was taking part in a televised walk from Belgrade to Istanbul with other showbiz types. We were on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/why-a-pilgrimage-was-good-practice-for-lockdown\" title=\"\">Sultan\u2019s trail</a>, mirroring a journey made by Suleiman the Magnificent, the longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, who ruled at the same time as Henry VIII. The group included Adrian Chiles, Dom Joly and Edwina Currie. One night we fetched up in a Bulgarian field; it was getting dark and we had to make camp for the night, which is how I came to share a very small tent on a hillside with former Olympic javelin champion Fatima Whitbread.</p> <p>At 4am, Fatima nudged me awake to say, \u201cI think someone is trying to get into the tent.\u201d At first I thought it was a prank. I popped on a headlamp and lifted the tent flap to see my canvas bag disappearing into the pitch-black darkness. With the fuzzy logic and stern will of a sleep-deprived woman, I gave chase to the thief: a fox.</p> <p>It was as astonished as I was, to find itself in an unseemly tussle over what it now considered to be <em>its</em> bag. This element of surprise was the only reason I caught up with it, because it was a faster mover than me. We tugged the bag to and fro, the fox getting ever more furious that anyone would deny it such a prize (at the time I couldn\u2019t understand why, but I later found a handful of almonds and half a chocolate bar at the bottom of the bag). It all happened very quickly, but when it wasn\u2019t getting its way, the fox bit me: a good, sharp nip on the ankle. In doing so, it gave up the struggle and I raced back to the tent clutching the bag.</p> <p>Although Fatima later declared she\u2019d rushed to my aid, she had the presence of mind to grab a phone and take two rather blurry photographs of the scene. No one else stirred \u2013 all we could hear was Dom snoring nearby. We got back into our tent, with the shredded bag, and zipped ourselves in. I thought the ordeal was over, but suddenly the fox returned, launching some very impressive four-footed attacks on the canvas. They were forceful and vicious, like the footage you see of a fox <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2SoGHFM18I\" title=\"\">jumping through snow</a> to get at its prey. With no joy, and no bag, it eventually gave up and went on its way.</p> <p>Later that morning, I was sent to get medical attention. The chances of contracting rabies from a rabid fox are not zero. But because the walk couldn\u2019t stop, I had to have jabs at hospitals in three different countries. In Bulgaria, a grizzled, ancient doctor attended to me with much laughter, telling me the good news that \u201cat least it wasn\u2019t a bear\u201d. He located the dainty, double puncture wound above my left ankle, simply applied iodine and a plaster, and sent me onwards to Plovdiv, the last city before we crossed the Turkish border.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/nov/21/experience-my-horse-saved-me-from-raging-cow\">Experience: my horse saved me from a raging cow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There, more iodine was administered and a different doctor laughed that \u201cat least it wasn\u2019t a bear\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Polluting industries around the world are using the coronavirus pandemic to gain billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken and delay environmental protections. The moves have been described as dangerous and irresponsible by senior figures. They say the unprecedented sums of money being committed to the global recovery are a historic opportunity to tackle the climate crisis, but such action has not been taken to date. Fossil fuels The fossil fuel industry, which already benefits from a $5tn-a-year subsidy, according to the IMF, has had the biggest wins during the coronavirus pandemic in the US and Canada. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US got the go-ahead, with $5bn in financial support from the Alberta government. US president Donald Trump called the move \u201cGREAT news\u201d. Other pipelines continued construction despite the lockdown. To \u201calleviate financial hardship\u201d to the US fossil fuel industry, Trump directed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to be filled to its maximum capacity. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws, three days after a request from the American Petroleum Institute, and extended the period that the more polluting winter gasoline can be sold. Three US states passed laws criminalising fossil fuel protests \u2013 South Dakota, Kentucky and West Virginia. Republican senators asked the US federal government to \u201creduce, delay or suspend\u201d taxes due on oil, gas and coal, while the National Mining Association lobbied to cut $220m in taxes intended to support coal miners affected by black lung disease. In China, as the worst impacts of the virus outbreak passed, there was a surge in permits for new coal-fired power plants. From 1 to 18 March, more coal-fired capacity was approved than in the whole of 2019. In South Korea, the major coal plant builder Doosan Heavy Industries got a $825m government bailout; green groups say the company was in deep financial trouble before the pandemic. In Australia, lobbyists welcomed the South Australia government\u2019s move to defer taxes and other commitments to oil and gas explorers. Renewable energy In the US, assistance for the green energy sector was not included in the $2tn support package on 26 March, three days after 24 rightwing thinktanks, including the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said they were \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by possibility of funding for \u201cunreliable \u2018green\u2019 energy programs\u201d. However, New York state did pass new laws to speed up clean energy projects. In Brazil, the energy regulator has indefinitely postponed green power auctions scheduled for 2020 and in South Africa, the state-owned power giant Eskom, which relies heavily on coal, said it will cut the wind power it had committed to buy. Motor industry In the US, the EPA finalised its rollback of Obama-era rules that made cars less polluting. In the EU, lobby groups argued for a delay in emissions reduction laws, although VW, BMW and Daimler say they are aiming to comply regardless of the virus crisis. Aviation A leaked letter from the International Air Transport Association describes its \u201caggressive\u201d lobbying approach and includes a call for relief from corporate taxes, sales taxes, employer-paid payroll taxes and passenger ticket taxes. In the US, aviation got a $60bn bailout package and the suspension of many taxes. In the UK, major carrier easyJet got a \u00a3600m soft loan, weeks after its biggest shareholder received almost \u00a360m in dividends. Farming In the EU, the farmers\u2019 association Copa-Cogeca called for a further postponement of the \u201cfarm to fork\u201d strategy, which is aimed at making agriculture less polluting. The call is backed by the rightwing EPP bloc, the largest group in the European parliament. In Germany, its farming lobby pushed for an easing of environmental standards, particularly those restricting fertiliser use, which are intended to reduce pollution. In the US, the American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association lobbied heavily and won a $23.5bn bailout package. Agricultural pollution is the cause of a huge \u201cdead zone\u201d in the Gulf of Mexico. Plastics and chemicals In the US, the plastic industry lobbied to remove bans on single-use plastic bags, citing hygiene concerns, and saw bans lifted in Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon and Massachusetts. The EPA also weakened the Toxic Substances Control Act for many chemical and petrochemical manufacturers. In the EU, plastic industry lobbyists asked the European commission to postpone implementation of the single-use plastic directive, intended to cut plastic pollution. However, the commission rejected this call. In England, a ban on plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds that was due in April has been postponed. Timber In Indonesia, the trade ministry revoked rules requiring basic certification that wood exports were legally produced in response to lobbying from the furniture and logging industries, according to campaign group Mighty Earth. Green shoots The Covid-19 crisis has seen some backing for a sustainable recovery and rejections of polluter lobbying. G20 finance ministers committed to an \u201cenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive recovery\u201d and EU leaders backed \u201cmeasures necessary to get back to a normal functioning of our societies and economies and to sustainable growth\u201d. The European commission has not delayed its consultation on a new green finance strategy and is now considering imposing new requirements on firms to reduce the risk of biodiversity loss and pandemics. This is despite coal-heavy states including Poland and the Czech Republic urging the bloc to abandon its Green Deal plan and emissions trading scheme. In France, the government has approved 288 wind and solar energy projects and has relaxed deadlines and cancelled a planned withdrawal of rooftop solar subsidies. Germany rejected calls to ease the planned shutdown of its coal industry, while in Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau rejected the call from Albertan companies to postpone an increase in the federal carbon tax. The fallout from the pandemic is also delaying a number of big fossil fuel projects, from LNG terminals in Australia to coal plants in Indonesia.",

Across the US, not-for-profit groups are buying truckloads of increasingly expensive food to cope with the sharp increase in the \u201cnew needy\u201d \u2013 and the dramatic decline in donations from supermarkets left empty by panic shoppers. The pressures are widespread and growing, according to more than 20 food banks and pantries across 15 states consulted by the Guardian. For example, in Pennsylvania, food banks are spending an extra $1m a week and yet still turning hungry families away. In Alabama, one pantry looks set to go $3.6m over budget by August as food purchases and running costs \u2013 electricity, cleaning materials, boxes and overtime \u2013 have tripled: \u201cWe\u2019re applying for grants as fast as we can,\u201d said Jenny Waltman from Grace Klein pantry in Birmingham. The recent rise in public donations is unlikely to offset projected shortfalls. \u201cWe have enough food for the next month,\u201d warned Lisa Scales, president of Pittsburgh food bank where the money spent buying food has tripled. \u201cWith so many businesses shutting, we\u2019re concerned community donations won\u2019t sustain this level.\u201d The economic fallout of the global health crisis has seen record numbers of first-timers \u2013 people who have never previously needed food aid \u2013 flocking to new drive-thru distribution centres, which have been created to comply with social distancing rules. Queues up to six miles long have become common at these pop-up collection points as far afield as San Antonio, Las Vegas, and Cleveland, where thousands of recently furloughed and unemployed people wait hours for grocery boxes. As demand escalates, the price of non-perishable staples such as peanut butter, eggs, canned vegetables, beans, pasta, rice and jam is soaring, while supplies are running low with four- to eight-week delays and bottlenecks reported across the supply chain. The wholesale cost of rice has almost tripled and won\u2019t be delivered until June, according to one Pennsylvania-based distributor that supplies more than 40 food banks. \u201cCanned fruit and veg are very hard to get, rice and pasta is challenging, and costs have gone crazy as manufacturers pay more for labor, food and transport,\u201d said Mike Fellinger. \u201cIf you find rice it\u2019s like gold,\u201d added Ron Mizutani, president of the Hawaii food bank. In response, innovative schemes have emerged to take advantage of an abundance of perishable produce such as tomatoes, apples and milk which would otherwise be dumped or left rotting in fields. An estimated 30-40% of the US food supply is wasted, which is the equivalent to throwing out $161bn of produce annually. However, in one plan, Feeding Florida is paying local farmers to continue harvesting thousands of acres of crops, some of which is turned into freezable soups, sauces and ready meals by a network of idle restaurateurs. \u2018Crisis mode\u2019 The unfolding public health crisis has triggered the worst economic crisis in almost a century, exposing the precarious state of millions of working Americans thanks to weak labor rights, eroded government safety nets and low wages. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to see so many \u2018new needy\u2019, when even before the pandemic, millions of working Americans were already living on the edge of poverty, making tough choices between food and rent and bills every month,\u201d said Ellen Vollinger, legal director at the Washington-based Food Research and Action Centre (Frac). In 2019, about 40 million Americans received free meals or groceries through a network of 200 food banks and 60,000 pantries, schools, soup kitchens and shelters, according to Feeding America. The working poor, elderly and disabled and infirm accounted for the vast majority of recipients. Even before the pandemic, half of American adults had either no emergency savings or not enough to cover three months of living expenses, according to Bankrate\u2019s 2019 financial security index. Since then, more than 22 million people have filed for unemployment benefits, though the true number of layoffs is probably significantly higher. Unsurprisingly, the demand for food aid has risen exponentially, and is mostly driven by first-timers, according to groups in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, Louisiana, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Texas and Washington. For instance, at pantries in Silicon Valley, demand is increasing about 50% each week, with first-timers such as security and cafeteria staff furloughed by tech companies, teachers and restaurant workers accounting for more than half of those needing food. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising. We already knew a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Leslie Bacho, chief executive of Second Harvest food bank, which spent $250,000 on cleaning supplies in March.

In Las Vegas, drivers of luxury vehicles queued for food boxes. \u201cWhen you see a Lexus in line at 4am prepared to wait six hours, you know there\u2019s real need,\u201d said Larry Scott from Nevada\u2019s Three Square food bank. In Seattle, Washington, the Northwest Harvest food bank expects expenditure to increase eightfold to $8.4m a month through September. Feeding Alabama expects to spend $1.71m purchasing food by July \u2013 compared to $1.1m during 2018, and $543,443 in 2019 when food banks benefited from a commodities surplus created by Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars. In Louisiana, at least one in three people are at risk of hunger, compared with one in five before this crisis, according to Natalie Jayroe, president of South Harvest food bank. \u201cWe think it will conservatively cost us $15m for six months \u2026 In south Louisiana, we\u2019ve been through our share of disasters but this is different.\u201d The Greater Cleveland food bank could go $4.9m \u2013 or 26% \u2013 over budget by September. They have stopped buying peanut butter, a high-protein grocery box staple, since the price rose $10 a case. Last week in San Antonio, Texas, an unprecedented 10,000 people showed up in their cars for a pop-up distribution centre \u2013 a drive-thru service which typically attracted 400 before the layoffs. That day, 25 semi-trucks of food were handed out, much of it to newly laid off hospitality staff whose last paycheck was already gone, according to Eric Cooper, president of the food bank. As demand rises, Cooper warns that supplies will run short: \u201cThe only thing we can do is ration and give families less \u2026 I would challenge our federal government to put systems in place that allow for wasted food to go to families we are feeding. It\u2019s unconscionable.\u201d As the coronavirus economic hurt intensifies, federal aid is slowly starting to trickle down to ordinary people, including the $1,200 stimulus payment for those with bank accounts. The rescue packages did expand the food stamps programme (Snap), but the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has so far refused to fully extend eligibility using available disaster powers. \u201cThis would help tackle hunger and stimulate the economy, but for some reason the USDA isn\u2019t using all the tools in its box,\u201d said Vollinger from Frac. It\u2019s unclear when or how the country will return to some semblance of normal, meanwhile America\u2019s hunger crisis is likely to last months \u2013 or longer. Kristin Warzocha of Greater Cleveland said: \u201cI already fear we\u2019re not reaching everyone who needs help, and we haven\u2019t seen anything yet! We will do everything in our power, but philanthropy is not going to fix this crisis.\u201d",

After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years.</p> \n<p>The second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient.</p> \n<p>Horby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: how have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola.

After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years. The second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient. Horby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d He holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola. That\u2019s much nastier,\u201d he said. \u201cVery surprisingly, the monoclonal antibodies that were trialled in eastern DRC did work. Those are the ones we will be waiting for with a bit of bated breath to put into the trial when they become available.\u201d",

I have to stay here. I have to fight. If not, I will be homeless and pregnant. I already fear this stress is going to cause me to lose my baby.\u201d</p> <p>McMorris worked for six years for FPI Management, a real estate corporation, as an on-site property manager, a job which included her apartment. After the pandemic was declared last month, FPI terminated her position and told her she had 30 days to move out, despite the eviction moratorium and regional shelter-in-place orders. When McMorris asked the company to allow her to stay until the Covid-19 emergency had passed, telling her boss she was pregnant, the company responded that she \u201cdoes not have rights\u201d and that it could have forced her out in three days, but instead gave her until 17 April.</p> <p>\u201cIf she fails to vacate by that deadline, we will take immediate legal action to regain possession of the unit as soon as legally possible,\u201d Brandi Hutchinson, FPI senior director, wrote to McMorris\u2019s attorney, adding that she would now owe $3,030 a month.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no housing, no employment.

But after the father of her children lost most of his income at a restaurant due to Covid-19, the family ran out of money to pay rent.

Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a precarious situation, and you don\u2019t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.\u201d</p> <p>The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts.<strong> </strong>In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters\u2019 rights.</p> <p>The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: \u201cI panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.\u201d </p> <p>Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a \u201cscare tactic\u201d to get her to install a window screen: \u201cI\u2019m not taking her to court knowing I\u2019m not going to win.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"522199100b49a32e4cca78a29b676cc3d0679c9c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/522199100b49a32e4cca78a29b676cc3d0679c9c/0_683_2730_3413/800.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez lost his job during the coronavirus pandemic.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez lost his job during the coronavirus pandemic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He added that he hadn\u2019t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: \u201cI could\u2019ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out.

      "bodyText": "When Covid-19 halted California\u2019s economy, state officials promised to prevent evictions and defend tenants\u2019 rights. But a dozen renters and their attorneys told the Guardian that some landlords are proceeding to expel them from their homes despite the new regulations, indicating there are significant gaps in the protections. Those tenants include a pregnant woman, a cancer patient, an elderly woman, a mother of six, several newly unemployed low-wage workers and others vulnerable to Covid-19. Unable to pay rent in April, they have faced eviction notices on their doors, police officers attempting to remove them, pressure from property owners to immediately vacate and written demands from landlords spreading falsehoods about the emergency laws. Some tenants said they were moving out as a result, becoming homeless amid a pandemic. \u201cWe want to pay, but we don\u2019t have the money,\u201d said Virginia G\u00f3mez, a 51-year-old Los Angeles woman threatened with eviction from her home of three years.

But the accounts and records from tenants across the state indicate those regulations ultimately fail to provide relief for those who are most in need, and are not being properly enforced. In some cases, the confusing patchwork of local ordinances has allowed landlords to continue targeting tenants in a state that had a severe housing crisis before coronavirus. Roughly 2.7 million people have filed unemployment claims in California since residents were ordered to stay home. Across the US, an estimated one-third of renters didn\u2019t pay April rent. Though the courts are not currently processing evictions, some landlords are still starting the process, or unlawfully attempting to remove tenants. It\u2019s difficult to know how many tenants across the state are threatened with eviction, but advocates in LA, the Bay Area, and parts of the Central Valley say they have anecdotally heard of a handful of cases in which owners have launched evictions. They are hearing more frequently about tenants facing misinformation and misleading threats from landlords.

Reese responded: \u201cYou failed to provide documentation and you failed to pay your rent; therefore this method will be utilized.\u201d Bina said she has struggled at times to understand her rights, adding, \u201cIf there\u2019s such severe repercussions for a tenant not paying rent, there should be severe repercussions for a landlord abusing the law at this point.\u201d Reese did not respond to inquiries. Chris Tyler\u2019s landlord in LA asked that he sign an agreement saying he would immediately report his \u201cstimulus payments, unemployment benefits, payments related to paid family leave, disability insurance payments and Covid-19 related loans\u201d so the owner can \u2018\u201caccelerate amounts due\u201d. Tyler, who works with the LA Tenants Union and lost his job at a bar, said he knew not to agree to the contract, but worries about others: \u201cWhen you\u2019re in a precarious situation, and you don\u2019t know your rights, you obviously feel compelled to sign.\u201d The LA Tenants Union has urged people to withhold rent and has called for lawmakers to freeze rent and mortgage payments during the crisis. If the state passed a rent forgiveness law, it would ensure tenants avoid insurmountable debts. In the meantime, advocates said, cities should proactively enforce the protections in place and hold landlords accountable when they violate renters\u2019 rights. The tenants union is also assisting 70-year-old Pamela Fairbanks. She paid her rent, but her landlord, Steve Kaali, showed up at her door this week with an eviction notice, alleging she had too many cats. Fairbanks, who has lived in her apartment for 25 years, said she has long owned three cats. She said she has also been in quarantine for weeks while recovering from bacterial pneumonia: \u201cI panicked. I was shaking. I could barely breathe through the tears.\u201d Reached by phone, Kaali said the cats were an ongoing issue because they go in and out of the apartment, and his eviction notice was meant to be a \u201cscare tactic\u201d to get her to install a window screen: \u201cI\u2019m not taking her to court knowing I\u2019m not going to win.\u201d He added that he hadn\u2019t tried to remove her from her rent-controlled apartment and bring in a higher-paying tenant: \u201cI could\u2019ve been a slumlord scumbag who kicks everyone out. I did not.\u201d The ones who move out: \u2018Let\u2019s just cut our losses\u2019 Jonathan Ca\u00f1ez and Tamiaya Moore, roommates who live in Bakersfield in the Central Valley, both lost their longtime jobs at a local hotel due to Covid-19. When they told their landlord they couldn\u2019t pay rent, the manager told them they would owe the full amount and should move out if they can\u2019t afford it. \u201cWe decided it\u2019s better to just cut our losses,\u201d said Ca\u00f1ez, 25, who is moving in with his brother. They didn\u2019t know how they would ever be able to pay back the rent: \u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard to have this place to call my own, a safe space. To have that shift away from me has been very hard and humiliating.\u201d Moore, 26, is going to sleep on an air mattress at a friend\u2019s house for now. She\u2019s been applying to jobs at grocery stores, but is also afraid of working there due to her asthma and the reality that essential workers are dying on the job. \u201cI\u2019m emotional because I was just getting my life together. Now it\u2019s going to be rough for awhile.\u201d",

The NUJ is calling for an immediate windfall tax on tech companies to help support the journalism industry through the crisis, with the money provided on the condition that large publishers rethink how how the industry operates. Michelle Stanistreet told the Guardian: \u201cMany, many local titles and some national titles will go to the wall if nothing is done. I think we will see national newspaper titles being casualties.\u201d \u201cThis sector plays a unique role in our communities and underpins our democracy \u2013 it can\u2019t be treated like any other business. What this crisis demonstrates very very clearly is the vital need for trustworthy news. We need to find a way of reimagining this industry.\u201d Media analysts at Enders Analysis have warned of widespread destruction of the British news industry, with the loss of thousands of journalists\u2019 jobs, as a result of the pandemic and expected economic convulsions that will follow. Thousands of staff at big publishers have already been furloughed, while the advertising market has collapsed. As a result, the NUJ is calling for a 6% tax on the revenues of tech companies such as Google and Facebook, with the proceeds used to rescue and reimagine the journalism industry. The NUJ is also calling for tax credits and interest-free loans to support journalists\u2019 jobs and investment in hyperlocal outlets \u2013 plus a ban on public money for media firms making redundancies, cutting pay, giving executive bonuses or blocking trade union organisation. In the medium term, the union is also asking for the government to confer \u201casset of community value\u201d status on local newspapers \u2013 in the same manner as pubs \u2013 ensuring that financially stricken local newspapers are preserved for potential community ownership, rather than closed completely. Ministers are holding weekly meetings with representatives of the journalism industry, with the government upping its spending on public information advertising to support local outlets. Stanistreet said new funding should be provided to news organisations on the condition that they change how they operate, especially at local newspaper groups where low wages and understaffing are common. \u201cWe don\u2019t want those businesses to be allowed to carry on as normal with the same inadequate practices which sacrifice journalistic content and the people who make it for shareholder self-interest.\u201d She said she was not seeking handouts or compensation to maintain the status quo but wants funding to ensure it survives to be rebuilt in a new manner. Stanistreet added: \u201cI absolutely think there\u2019s a need for a profound rethinking of the society we live in. In that mix of essential public services is journalism, information, and news that the public depend upon for something that\u2019s trustworthy, accurate, and ethically produced.\u201d",

Only once these issues have been addressed should we consider performing elective surgery that cannot be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAn additional measure that will ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients would see a defined perioperative quarantine period of 14 days prior to surgery. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public have made a concerted effort to socially isolate and reduce transmission of Covid-19 in our community and in our healthcare system.

The man was a national of the Philippines and a crew member on the Artania cruise ship. He died in Perth. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has suggested a tracking app for coronavirus could be mandatory but \u201cPlan A\u201d is for it to be voluntary. Western Australia has said it will start reopening schools on 29 April. A database that reports racist incidents against Asian Australians has received 178 responses in just two weeks since it launched \u2013 roughly 12 incidents a day. South Australia said it recorded just one new coronavirus case overnight, which its chief public health officer said was \u201creally excellent news\u201d. The federal government announced it would spent $165m to underwrite Qantas and Virgin Australia to conduct domestic flights for at least eight weeks. The number of people who have contracted Covid-19 in the Anglicare Newmarch aged care home in western Sydney rose to 20 residents and 10 staff. Tasmania\u2019s premier, Peter Gutwein, said he is considering strengthening lockdown measures in the state\u2019s north-west. Stay safe and we will be back with you tomorrow. The Department of Home Affairs has provided a brief response to questions from Guardian Australia about the Ruby Princess inquiry that will be led by Bret Walker. \u201cThe Department of Home Affairs will cooperate with the NSW Special Commission of Inquiry into the Ruby Princess where appropriate and will not be providing further comment at this time,\u201d a spokesperson said. From AAP, here is the latest snapshot of Covid-19 cases nationally: More than 6,500 Australians have caught the virus and about 58% of them have recovered. Australian deaths: 65 (26 in New South Wales, 14 in Victoria, four in Queensland, seven in Western Australia, seven in Tasmania, three in the Australian Capital Territory and four in South Australia). Nineteen were passengers on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. 29 people connected to Anglicare\u2019s Newmarch House in NSW have tested positive after a worker attended the facility for six days with a sore throat. Half of all 4,884 virus tests carried out nationwide during the past 24 hours were conducted in Queensland. I\u2019ll now be handing over the blog to my colleague Lisa Cox, who will keep you updated for the rest of the evening. Thanks for following along, and stay safe. The board that regulates Australia\u2019s doctors has told patients to report instances of racist treatment from their doctors during the Covid-19 pandemic, after three instances of discrimination against Indigenous Australians. The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency today said there was \u201cno place for racism in healthcare\u201d. The Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association revealed there were three cases in rural New South Wales and Western Australia where doctors refused to treat Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients over \u201cracist stereotypes [about] not practising self-hygiene\u201d. Ahpra is encouraging Indigenous people who have experienced racist or \u201cculturally unsafe incidents of care\u201d to submit a complaint to the agency. Teachers in WA have criticised unclear aspects of the premier\u2019s announcement today that schools will effectively be open to all students who wish to attend within 12 days. The president of the State School Teachers\u2019 Union of WA, Pat Byrne, told AAP there should be limits on classroom numbers. \u201cSchools will have no idea how many students will attend, how many will need online materials or how many will need hard copy packages,\u201d she said. \u201cPlanning will be extremely difficult.\u201d New restrictions were announced today for schools when they return, such as no excursions, and staggered start times so there are fewer students in contact with each other. In more media news, there are three confirmed parties interested in buying the Australian Associated Press newswire, and the final bids are due in a week. Some media outlets are jumping the gun, using confusing language to say that rural areas are \u201cCovid-free\u201d and could end lockdown restrictions. To be clear, that is not the case. Also earlier today, South Australia announced it had bought 10 new machines that can deliver rapid coronavirus test results in 45 minutes. The state has invested $600,000 in the machines, and hopes to test 300 people a week, SA Pathology boss Tom Dodd said. Traditional Covid-19 testing takes about 16 hours to provide a result, AAP reports. In more cruise news, a ship off the coast of Darwin has agreed to leave, according to AAP. The Caledonian Sky cruise ship earlier took the government to court after it directed all foreign ships to leave. The ship\u2019s operator, Australia Pacific Touring, took legal action in the federal court saying this was in contravention of treaties on safety of life at sea. However, the parties settled the matter out of court, with an agreement that the Caledonian Sky leave Australian territory by Tuesday. The Bahamas-flagged ship is carrying 68 crew members but no passengers. A crew member from the Artania cruise ship has died in Perth, becoming the youngest person to die from Covid-19 in Australia. The 42-year-old man was a national of the Philippines and died on Thursday at Royal Perth Hospital. WA health minister Roger Cook announced the death on Friday. \u201cHis family have been notified and were put in contact with that crew member via translators and the shipping company, and they were able to reach out to him in his dying days,\u201d he said. The Artania is docked in Fremantle but is expected to leave on Saturday. A database that reports racist incidents against Asian Australians has received 178 responses in only two weeks since it launched \u2013 roughly 12 incidents a day. And Queensland police say there have been 22 incidents of racially motivated offences against Asian Australians in recent weeks. In one case, a 15-year-old girl was charged with allegedly punching a 26-year-old woman in the face in Brisbane\u2019s Queen Street Mall after she accused her of having Covid-19. Victoria police are also investigating video footage of two international students who were punched and kicked on Thursday, allegedly after being threatened over coronavirus fears. According to the self-reporting survey, the majority of the 178 racist incidents were committed against women (62%) and 86.5% of in-person racist incidents were committed by strangers. The Queensland police commissioner said racist offences were being underreported to police. Read the full story here: The share market has closed higher today, narrowly missing a one-month high. The ASX200 finished up 71.2 points, or 1.31%, at 5,487.5 \u2013 just 0.6 points shy of the one-month closing high set on Tuesday, AAP reports. However, McManus said Porter has promised to reverse the changes if employers are found to be abusing them. \u201cWe talk most days,\u201d McManus says. \u201c[Today] he listened to that and said that if it\u2019s true, what we\u2019re saying, and if employers do abuse this, that he is prepared to reverse the regulation.\u201d She also said workers should just vote \u2018no\u2019 on any changes they are given under the new 24-hour deadline. \u201cIf you\u2019re presented with changes and you are given 24 hours\u2019 notice of it, and then to vote, and you haven\u2019t got time to look through it, to seek advice, vote no. You would be crazy to vote yes. \u201cYou would basically be voting to change your conditions totally blind without the benefit of advice from experts, without probably even the ability to talk to your employer properly, let alone your fellow colleagues.\u201d McManus said employers could still give workers more time \u2013 beyond 24 hours \u2013 if they did need to make changes. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d she said. \u201cOn one hand, big business is saying, \u2018We need to cut the time from seven days to 24 hours\u2019, and on the other hand this pandemic, the big economic consequences for business have been happening for three whole weeks. What have those businesses been doing for the last three weeks? They could have already consulted their workers.\u201d Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, has said that industrial relations minister Christian Porter did not consult unions before announcing yesterday\u2019s big employment law changes. Earlier in this coronavirus pandemic, Porter and McManus achieved an unprecedented level of cooperation. \u201cI think he [Porter] even described you to The Australian as his new BFF,\u201d says host Patricia Karvelas on the ABC. \u201cIs that relationship now broken?\u201d \u201cIt has been tested,\u201d McManus says. \u201cHe made a really bad decision yesterday to make those changes. That\u2019s likely to affect a whole lot of workers in a negative way and we\u2019ve told him that directly. Not only was the decision bad \u2013 he didn\u2019t consult us about it.\u201d Yesterday Porter\u2019s announcement meant that workers would only have 24 hours to decide whether to accept or reject changes to their enterprise bargaining agreements, if their employers tried to change them. Previously, they had seven days. SA chief public health officer, Dr Nicola Spurrier, says there has been only one new case of Covid-19 overnight. That brings the state total to 435 people, but 76% (331 people) \u201chave recovered fully\u201d. She says this is \u201creally excellent news\u201d. The state now has 104 active cases. The new case was a person in their 50s and Spurrier said they were confident they picked it up through overseas travel. Here\u2019s an infographic from the premier\u2019s office. That plan will be reviewed after three weeks. There will be new measures in schools. Cleaners will \u201cwork continuously throughout the day, including cleaning and disinfecting all high contact items regularly including school play equipment,\u201d McGowan said. School swimming pools will be closed, excursions will be banned, and schools will use staggered start times and lunch times to limit contact between students. WA premier Mark McGowan has announced what he calls \u201ca soft school opening\u201d effective from Wednesday 29 April. All students whose parents want them to attend school in person will be able to. Those who do not can still keep their children at home. \u201cOn Tuesday, April 28, staff will return to school to finalise learning arrangements for term two,\u201d McGowan says. \u201cThis will be a pupil free day for students. \u201cOn Wednesday, April 29 schools will be open for all children to go to school and be taught. All parents and carers can choose to send their children to school. If parents don\u2019t feel comfortable sending their kids to school for whatever reason they will not be obligated to do so. However year 11 and 12 students are strongly encouraged to attend.\u201d He says the reopening will be combined with more intense cleaning at schools, and stricter physical distancing. For example, parents can drop children at the school gate but can\u2019t enter the school grounds. The deputy chief medical officer has criticised the World Health Organisation for being too slow to declare a pandemic, but said countries should still provide it with funding during the coronavirus crisis. Kelly said a financially robust WHO was \u201ccrucial\u201d. But he offered some clear criticism. \u201cThe WHO has had a chequered history in some issues in the past and was criticised early on in relation to its closeness perhaps with China,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd its reluctance to call it a pandemic when it clearly was. \u201c[But] they definitely need funding and they need to be accountable for those funds ... they cannot do that work particularly in middle-income countries who are likely to be severely affected [without funds].\u201d Kelly says that national cabinet will next week consider the issue of restarting some elective surgeries. As for other restrictions he says: \u201cI would imagine that starting small and building up would be the general principle that would be taken.\u201d He flags a potential lifting of the 4 square metres per person rule, if the infection rate continues to slow. \u201cAgain it is a government decision, but if we look at what is happening in Europe at the moment and proposals in North America, they are sensing they are coming out of their much bigger and much more frightening epidemic then we have so fa experienced in Australia and they are the sort of approaches being done.\u201d Kelly also said the app would be \u201cbased on what was used in Singapore\u201d. \u201cWhat the app adds to [contact tracing], would be totally a consent-based process. They would have to download it. That phone would through Bluetooth technology would be able to identify other phones who have gone through that consent process, who have been in close proximity with someone who becomes a case. \u201cAgain, with the consent process, that information could be uploaded immediately to the public health unit, where the person who normally would have asked those questions, sometimes taken several hours to ask that question.\u201d Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, has just said that the downloading of a potential coronavirus tracking app would be \u201ctotally consent-based\u201d. Earlier today, prime minister Scott Morrison did not rule out making it mandatory, but said his \u201cpreference\u201d was for people to do so voluntarily. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a believer in the Australian people making the right decision so I think the voluntary approach at first is the way to go,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe have work to do to make sure this is as good andsafe and cover of privacy concerns and so forth. We will start with voluntary and see where it goes.\u201d He also said that the app was just the technological extension of what is \u201cstandard practice for public health practitioners\u201d already. He says we have contact tracing doctors \u2013 \u201cdisease detectives\u201d \u2013 in \u201cevery public health unit in every state and territory\u201d. Deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is speaking now. \u201cWe continue to be having less cases per day than in previous weeks,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had the peak of the epidemic towards the end of last month\u201d But he says the advice from the APPHC is \u201cstill to stay the course\u201d when it comes to restrictions. \u201cThis is not the time for us to decrease the things that we have done so far to successfully flatten that curve,\u201d he says. \u201cThe next four weeks gives us some time to increase the capacity we have to cope with this disease.\u201d Hi all, Naaman Zhou here with the blog. Thanks to Amy Remeikis, as always, for her hard work. AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan has spoken today to radio station 3AW about a potential \u201chub plan\u201d to restart the league. That plan would split the league up into three groups, where teams are isolated in different states but can play each other. McLachlan said: \u201cI don\u2019t know where we\u2019ll land on [hubs], there are a range of options.\u201d AAP reports that McLachlan did attempt to dispel misconceptions about the potential plan. \u201cBut I do feel that hubs mean different things to different people and it can be applied differently,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have thoughts of remote islands and different stuff but in its simplest form it\u2019s enhanced quarantine measures for if and when we get back on the park.\u201d It\u2019s been a slower day than we have seen this week, with Australia well into the suppression stage of its response. Cases may be dropping, but we have seen how quickly flare ups can happen \u2013 such as the Newmarch Anglicare house in western Sydney, and north-west Tasmania. I\u2019ll hand you over to Naaman Zhou, who will take you through the afternoon briefing from Paul Kelly, who will give the national update in about 15 minutes. I\u2019ll be back next week. Thank you again for joining me this week. Take care of you. WA is still running its trial of offering empty hotel rooms to the homeless and vulnerable. Now it looks like NSW has a similar program underway. From AAP: Women and children fleeing domestic violence and those sleeping rough in NSW during the COVID-19 outbreak will now have greater access to temporary accommodation. Hotels can now register available rooms through a centralised online forum launched by Homelessness NSW, Y Foundations and Domestic Violence NSW. It comes as support services and frontline workers warn the COVID-19 restrictions will result in a rise of domestic violence. Domestic Violence NSW said it received an overwhelming response from hotels offering accommodation. \u201cMore resources and therapeutic supports have moved online, whilst refuges are safe, have vacancies and are providing intensive levels of wrap-around support,\u201d spokeswoman Renata Field said in a statement on Friday. Ms Field said the additional accommodation would help relieve pressure points while helping refuges and shelters that need more rooms to meet social distancing and self-isolation requirements. Anyone seeking temporary accommodation who is not already in contact with a support service worker is advised to contact Link2Home, who will have access to the database of available rooms. The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay says the NSW government has a humanitarian responsibility to ensure that all members of the Ruby Princess crew are well, before the cruise ship is ordered to leave NSW waters. Tasmanian man\u2019s death brings national toll to 64. Yet another awful reminder of why Tasmania is going so hard with restrictions in its north-west coast, where a Covid-19 outbreak has the community under lockdown. Australia is not entertaining the \u201cherd immunity\u201d option. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some people commenting on it, or wishing for it. Perhaps they should read this, written by, as our opinion editor Bridie Jabour says, someone who actually has expertise on herd immunity (and if that is not enough, take a look at what is occurring in Sweden): Tony Burke has weighed in on the fair work regulation change Christian Porter announced yesterday, which the ACTU is also against, despite the unlikely working friendship which has developed between Porter and Sally McManus. The regulation means employers just have to give employees one day\u2019s notice of a change to enterprise bargaining agreements, instead of a week, before a vote occurs. Burke says it\u2019s not necessary. While the government insists its new regulation will expire after six months \u2013 the changes made to EBAs under that regulation during that time will not. The new regulation slashes the consultation period for EBA changes from one week to one day. That means employers will be able to tell their workers about proposed changes to pay and conditions one day, and then force them to vote on those changes the very next day. That means workers will be required to vote on often complex changes without time to properly consider what effect they might have \u2013 or time to consult with their colleagues or their union. Some employers will no doubt insist those changes \u2013 which will include cuts to pay and conditions \u2013 are necessary to keep people employed during the coronavirus crisis. But once the business emerges from the crisis any changes made will persist until there\u2019s another vote. Just last month Christian Porter insisted he would not allow employer bodies or unions to use this crisis to push their agendas for permanent changes to our industrial relations system. But by caving to this business body demand he has given employers the power to embed permanent changes that will leave workers worse off. There has been tremendous goodwill between unions and employer bodies during this crisis. Why is the government trying to undermine that goodwill with this terrible decision? Just a few weeks ago the government was insisting there were no unions and employers anymore \u2013 that we were all on Team Australia. Decisions like this suggest that was just empty rhetoric. Researchers from the Royal Women\u2019s hospital in Melbourne and Monash Health have created a national registry of pregnant women in Australia diagnosed with Covid-19. The registry includes 28 hospitals across Australia and will give health workers insight into how mothers and babies are impacted by this virus. Clinicians at each participating hospital are collecting data on women who test positive in their care and entering it into a secure database. Researchers will seek follow up data on each woman\u2019s pregnancy and baby outcomes and report on the impact of the virus on the mother\u2019s health, as well as any risks to the baby in the womb or after birth. Dr Clare Whitehead from the Women\u2019s said there was limited evidence on the impact of the novel coronavirus on mothers and babies. \u201cWe currently do not have a national platform that can collect information on pregnant women and report the information back to clinicians in a timely manner to help improve the management of pregnant women and their babies,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to very quickly set this research up to capture as many pregnant women as possible during this pandemic.\u201d As part of the update yesterday, Scott Morrison and Brendan Murphy said that next week the national cabinet and medical expert panel will look at whether or not the elective surgery restrictions can be lifted (which would include IVF treatments). The Australian Society of Anaesthetists (ASA) has urged that a return to non-urgent elective surgery proceeds with caution, in a statement it released today. The ASA president, Dr Suzi Nou, says the group has spoken to the chief medical officer\u2019s office about the concerns: \u201cAll of the efforts to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 in Australia are to be commended and have allowed healthcare workers much-needed time to more adequately prepare for the Covid-19 pandemic in our hospitals. Five weeks ago, the ASA called for a cessation of non-urgent surgery but as more health services have been able to undertake planning for the pandemic, we would like to see a relaxation of the restrictions and a safe return to elective surgery. \u201cWe understand that people will be keen to have surgery and do not want to prolong any unnecessary delays but we do want surgery to proceed safely for individuals, their families and for healthcare workers. \u201cWe do not encourage elective surgery be performed unless the health service has completed scenario planning for Covid-19 patients and that all relevant staff have adequate supply of PPE and are proficient in its use. Only once these issues have been addressed should we consider performing elective surgery that cannot be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. \u201cAn additional measure that will ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients would see a defined perioperative quarantine period of 14 days prior to surgery. \u201cThe public have made a concerted effort to socially isolate and reduce transmission of Covid-19 in our community and in our healthcare system. We would hope that patients planning to undergo elective surgery would continue to protect themselves, their families and the healthcare workers looking after them with a period of quarantine before their surgery.\u201d NBN Co is now publishing weekly updates on how the network is handling the additional load of so many people working and studying at home, before going to another room to stream content until the screaming in our minds can\u2019t be heard (we are all Clarice now). You\u2019ll find those updates, here. On the main NBN wholesale service: Weekly upload throughput peak of 1.06 Terabits per second (Tbps) recorded on Friday 10 April during the Evening Busy Hours. Weekly download throughput peak of 13.8Tbps recorded on Wednesday 8 April during the Evening Busy Hours. Download throughput peak of 11.6Tbps on 8 April recorded during the daytime business hours surpassed pre-Covid-19 baseline evening peak for the first time. Ninety-nine per cent of new NBN retail orders in the past week based on wholesale speed tier plans of 25Mbps or faster. The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, will give today\u2019s national update on the Covid situation. That will happen at 3.15. The Loki Foundation, which describes itself as Australia\u2019s first privacy tech not for profit, has written an open letter on the issue of the tracing app the government wants people to download (and may, depending on download rates, make mandatory \u2013 something Scott Morrison did not rule out today, saying only it was \u201cnot my preference\u201d). The foundation doesn\u2019t have a problem with the model Apple and Google are working on. Public and private hospitals in the NT and SA will now be able to work together, under a new interim authorisation granted by the consumer watchdog this afternoon: Private hospitals and health agencies in the Northern Territory and South Australia respectively will be able to cooperate in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, following separate interim authorisations granted by the ACCC today. Today\u2019s interim authorisations granted to each of the Northern Territory and the state of South Australia follow similar authorisations granted to Victoria and Queensland earlier this month. State and territory governments are seeking to increase the capacity of their health systems during the pandemic by integrating the operations of public and private hospitals. This has also ensured private hospitals are funded and remain viable after most non-urgent elective surgery was suspended last month. The ACCC\u2019s interim authorisations granted today will allow public and private hospital operators in each jurisdiction to work with each other and relevant health agencies during the current health crisis by, for example, discussing expected capacity and demand for services, jointly procuring and distributing medical equipment and supplies, and sharing staff. You may remember from yesterday that the NZ deputy prime minister, Winston Peters, is keen to restart trans-Tasman travel, once both countries begin loosening restrictions. He is still keen. But Australian authorities are a bit more cool on it, and say it won\u2019t be on the agenda for the foreseeable future. AAP has an update on New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 situation: Two elderly New Zealanders have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the country\u2019s overall death tally to 11. A South Island woman in her 80s became the seventh person to die linked to the Rosewood rest home in Christchurch. A man in his 90s died at Waikato hospital in Hamilton. His case was linked to a cluster at Matamata, where a local pub held a St Patrick\u2019s Day celebration on March 17. \u201cThe fact we knew we would lose some New Zealanders to Covid-19 doesn\u2019t lessen the shock or sadness when it happens,\u201d finance minister Grant Robertson said. Another possible death linked to coronavirus, of an Invercargill man in his 70s who died at home, is being investigated by health officials. New Zealand recorded its lowest daily increase in a month on Friday, with just eight new cases. The country\u2019s overall case count is 1,409. Bret Walker just spoke to the ABC about the NSW commission of inquiry he has been asked to head, looking at what happened with the Ruby Princess. He was asked about his jurisdiction to compel witnesses internationally, which is going to be an element of the inquiry, given the ship itself is registered in Bermuda. Walker answers: Well, a cat may look at a king - I can make inquiries from anybody I like. It\u2019s whether they can be compelled to answer, is the real question. My jurisdictional power doesn\u2019t extend outside Australia. But you\u2019re right - it may well involve making requests for information and hoping that there will be a degree of cooperation. This is about the change in fair work regulations announced yesterday, where employers only have to give employees one days notice, instead of seven, about changes to enterprise bargaining agreements. Anthony Albanese was asked during his press conference about his thoughts on whether or not the tracing app the government wants people to download, once it is available, should be mandatory. Scott Morrison, when speaking to Hobart radio Triple M said it was \u201cnot his preference\u201d to make the app or carrying your phone mandatory, so he would see how \u201cPlan A\u201d \u2013 people doing it voluntarily \u2013 would go. Albanese said it was concerning to hear a mandatory download was not ruled out: One of the things that would occur, if that was the government response, would be people would simply stop taking their phone to places,\u201d he said. It\u2019s up to the government, frankly, to explain exactly what it has in mind with this app and to be very clear with the Australian public about whether it is going to be voluntary or whether it is going to be some level of compulsion involved. Scott Morrison wants you to know that he is really, really not interested in anything in Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s book. This was the exchange on the Ten Network today: Host: We\u2019ve all learned so many new technical terms during this time. I\u2019ll tell you what. Now, I\u2019ve got to ask, how do you feel about Malcolm Turnbull releasing his memoir, attacking you in the middle of this crisis? Morrison: Not interested. Host: Not even, he released a personal message that you\u2019d given him? You know, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in there when, when the nation really is focussed on other stuff? Morrison: Yeah, I don\u2019t care. Host: Prime Minister it\u2019s your birthday next month, if someone gave you a copy of the book \u2026 Morrison: Cheers! Host: Would you regift it? Or would you read it? Morrison: I wouldn\u2019t notice it. Host: Return to sender hey. I think you\u2019ve made yourself pretty clear on that one. Morrison: I think so. The man is dealing with a global pandemic. But it is nice to see a bit of usual Australian politics injected back into things. That Ai Group statement comes after the government, following reports, including from Mayo MP Rebekha Sharkie, that some employers were asking their employees to hand back some of the wage subsidy payment, in exchange for their registering for jobkeeper. The Ai Group have put out this statement on the government\u2019s wage subsidy \u2018jobkeeper\u2019 scheme: Some employees appear to have a misguided view that they can choose not to come to work if their employer is accessing the jobkeeper scheme. If the employee is not stood down or on approved or authorised leave, the employee must comply with any lawful and reasonable direction given by their employer. This includes any reasonable and safe direction to carry out work,\u201d Innes Willox, Chief Executive of the national employer association Ai Group, said. In addition, employees are only entitled to take personal/carer\u2019s leave if they are sick or if they are caring for a member of their immediate family or household who is sick or injured, or due to an unexpected emergency. The employer can insist that an employee provide evidence if the employer is not convinced that a claim for personal/carer\u2019s leave is genuine. Given the necessary speed with which the jobkeeper scheme has been implemented, it is not surprising that employers and employees may not fully understand their rights and obligations at this early stage. However, the notion that an employee can simply choose not to come to work and still get paid is not correct, and not in anyone\u2019s interests. Virgin Australia chief operating officer Stuart Aggs has also been speaking at today\u2019s industry roundtable. \u201cWe are clearly in crisis mode,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are an airline and an industry under significant scrutiny, almost on an hourly basis.\u201d He said that after the collapse of Ansett it took 20 years for Virgin Blue, as it then was, to build itself into a true competitor to Qantas - and even then it held only 30% of the market. \u201cIs the government prepared to wait 20 years for that experience to be built back up from a competitive point of view? \u201cI suspect not.\u201d The roundtable also heard from one of the industry superannuation industry\u2019s pioneers, IFM Investors founder Garry Weaven, who addressed the idea that Virgin Australia\u2019s existing shareholders might bail out the airline. He said Virgin Australia was 90% owned by big foreign investors, including the government of Abu Dhabi through its state airline, Etihad. \u201cIf they\u2019re not in a position to recapitalise the company ... then who is?\u201d he asked. \u201cReally, the answer is that only the government is in a position to do that.\u201d He said he was \u201ca little bit surprised\u201d by prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s comments on TV last night suggesting industry super funds could buy Virgin Australia. Fund trustees that did so would probably be attacked by members of Morrison\u2019s own government for failing to put returns to members first, as required by the super law, he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a bit of a furphy, that question,\u201d he said. And we also got an answer about whether anyone from Qantas was invited to the confab, courtesy of a question to ACTU president Michele O\u2019Neil from the federal secretary of the union representing licensed aircraft engineers, Steve Purvinas. \u201cYes, Qantas was invited, Alan Joyce specifically,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. \u201cThey decided for their own reasons not to [accept].\u201d Asked what would happen if venture capitalists bought Virgin in order to break it up, Michael McCormack says: There is no reason that they cannot come out of Covid-19 and get more assets. We don\u2019t want to see the cutback of services for Virgin. They were well provided prior to the virus and, certainly for regional areas, they have provided competition. They have provided competition on the domestic and international markets. We want to see that but they\u2019ve also ensured that for some of those regional routes that there were services available that perhaps would not have been made available. I want to see a solution. I want to see both airlines come through Covid-19. We will be monitoring the situation and I will be continuing to talk, as I have done on a daily basis, with the key airline executives. I want to make sure that they both get through this and that is why we have put more than $1 billion on the table. And Virgin have been assisted by the measures that we have announced so far. Certainly, they are benefiting from today\u2019s announcement. Michael McCormack: You know that there was the announcement on March 18 where we made sure that there was the waiving of fuel excise fees, the waving of air services Australia fees, the waiving indeed of regional security and other security fees that are imposed normally by government. [They] were waived and backdated to the 1 February, and so what that meant was the fact that there was immediate cash flow for the airlines, and particularly for Virgin and Qantas, they were able to engage in that. And of course, 10 days later I announced the regional subsidisation of funds, to the tune of $198 million, for those 138 centres which are reliant on aviation; that they were able to partake in that and we underwrite the airlines to the tune of $100 million. Today\u2019s $165 million announcement is going to make the world of difference for those commuters who have come in from overseas, done their 14 days of quarantine. Let me tell you, if they landed in Sydney and are required to get back to Perth with very limited services available, it is a long drive in a hire car, so that is going to make a difference for them. More on that press conference earlier today on the Ruby Princess. NSW police say that the physical investigation of the ship is complete and there is \u201cnothing from an investigative point of view\u201d stopping it from leaving Australia on Sunday. Earlier in the week, police commissioner Mick Fuller said he was \u201chopeful\u201d the virus-stricken ship would leave on Sunday. But there was no definite guarantee today that that is still the case. As previously mentioned, they also announced that all passengers on both of the Ruby Princess\u2019s voyages will be sent a questionnaire. \u201cThe questionnaire will let us zero in on elements of the cruise we are interested in,\u201d police said. \u201cObviously that goes hand in hand with the forensic investigation of the telemetry box on the ship.\u201d The University of Melbourne has been taking a regular \u201cpulse of the nation\u201d with surveys. It\u2019s latest one has found 60% of respondents are happy with how the government is handling the covid-19 pandemic Michael McCormack has muddled his way through a press conference on the $165m underwriting package the government has put forward to keep the domestic aviation industry together during the Covid crisis. Asked about the future of Virgin, he said: We want to see a market resolution and a market solution for Virgin. Yes, Virgin were not going as well as Qantas prior to Covid-19 hitting. Qantas\u2019s balance sheets were quite healthy. Of course, we will remember back in 2013-14 that when Qantas were struggling, they wanted some assistance. Fortunately, they were able to get that capital and were able to re-energise and through good management led by Alan Joyce, they were able to get their books back in the black and very healthy. We want to see that situation for Virgin too. But I know and am confident there is a market solution for Virgin. We\u2019ll cross that bridge when we come to it but that is a bit hypothetical. Let\u2019s see what happens. I know, if you read reports today, that there are some people who are interested in capitalising Virgin and we hope that comes off. TWU national secretary Michael Kaine has described as \u201cbizarre\u201d prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s suggestion that the super fund affiliated with his union buy stricken airline Virgin Australia. Speaking on ABC TV last night, Morrison said that the government didn\u2019t want to \u201cget in the way of a commercial solution, like the TWU super fund. I mean, the industry super funds in this country have got $3 trillion dollars worth of assets [and] here we\u2019ve got a company that needs capital\u201d. But appearing this morning at an aviation industry round table organised by the union movement, Kaine said such a move would be contrary to all prudential standards. He also again slammed Qantas for campaigning against a Virgin Australia bailout. \u201cQantas wants no intervention because it wants to see Virgin go down,\u201d he said. Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah again repeated his call for an industry-wide solution, saying 600,000 people in the tourism sector needed a competitive airline sector. \u201cWe should put rivalry aside to make sure we get through this together,\u201d he said. But while Scurrah and the chief executive of air services company dnata, Hiranjan Aloysius, were prepared to stand virtual shoulder-to-shoulder with union leaders at today\u2019s video hookup, Qantas boss Alan Joyce has been conspicuous by his absence. Anthony Albanese was asked about Scott Morrison\u2019s suggestion that industry superfunds step in and bail Virgin out, and said (sarcastically) that he \u201cliked the fact the government has spent a fair bit of time attacking the transport workers union and attacking industry superannuation and now feels as though they are in a position to dictate to those organisation what they do with their investment\u201d. What the government is trying to do is to shake its responsibility. It has a responsibility because of the imposition, quite rightly, of constraints that are supported across the country, that is why there are particular circumstances for the airline industry. It is a direct result of the coronavirus and the constraints that have been put on. So industry super funds will make decisions based upon their members, but the prime minister shouldn\u2019t abrogate the government\u2019s responsibility there. [cont from previous post] Anthony Albanese: That is one of the reasons why you don\u2019t say in five years\u2019 time tax cuts will occur, without knowing what the economy looks like at that point in time, and without having an economic reform agenda, there\u2019s been no economic reform under this government, they have given up on productivity, we know that wages have been not keeping up with where they should be, and the Reserve Bank was warning for the whole of last year that wages being lower was a real issue. If the government\u2019s response post this crisis is to further undermine our unions and to attack wages and conditions of working people, then that will not help the recovery, it will not help growth. Anthony Albanese: What we don\u2019t want, is when we get through this crisis, is for the government to just return to its old ideological position of attacking the rights of working people. That is what we don\u2019t want. This government didn\u2019t have a large economic agenda or a reform agenda prior to the bushfires and the coronavirus crisis. This government had presided over a doubling of the debt, and it presided over productivity going backwards for two quarters in a row. Consumer demand flatlining. Circumstances whereby the Reserve Bank had intervened to cut interest rates on multiple occasions, and an economy that was really going nowhere, and the government has been involved in a victory lap since May 2019, since they won the election. There haven\u2019t been many changes at all. And you would recall that during the tax debate, Labor warned that it was premature and a triumphant of hope over experience to say that the government could know what the economy look like in 2023- 2024 and to legislate tax cuts then. That was an extraordinary position that the government took and it was unwise, it certainly wasn\u2019t prudent, and I think that Labor\u2019s comments at that time have stood the test of time, unlike the government. Anthony Albanese is asked about Scott Morrison\u2019s comments yesterday, in his press conference, that acknowledged, for what seemed the first time, that yes, economically, it will not be business as usual on the other side of the Covid restrictions (yes, it seems obvious, but publicly at least, the government was sticking to the \u201csnap back\u201d we will be sticking to our election commitments lines. This is what Scott Morrison said yesterday: They [RBA, Grattan Institute] also highlighted, though, the need to ensure that on the other side of the virus, as we make our road out, that any sense of business-as-usual when it comes to the policy frameworks that we had prior to the election will need to be reconsidered on the other side to ensure that we can achieve the growth that will be necessary in our economy to get people back into work, to get our economy back on track. It will be a different world on the other side of the virus and there\u2019ll be many challenges. Throwing this in again, for the people who missed it this morning. Angela Merkel has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, and worked as a research scientist. Which may explain why she has been able to offer the best explanation we have seen of why any easing of restrictions has to be controlled. She gets numbers. She understands the science. And she knows how to explain it. Kristina Keneally has responded to the Biloela family federal court judgement: Labor respects the federal court\u2019s decision in regard to the Tamil family from Biloela. It is now incumbent on the government and the minister for home affairs to respect the decision, deal in good faith with the family\u2019s lawyers over the next seven days and give effect to the federal court\u2019s judgment. Labor is relieved the family will not be deported from Australia whilst this is taking place \u2013 particularly given the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on all countries and people across the globe. Nades, Priya and their two children have built a life in Biloela in regional Queensland \u2013 they\u2019ve worked hard, paid taxes, contributed to their community and have been supported by their friends and neighbours, even after callously being moved to Christmas Island. As has always been the case, home affairs minister Peter Dutton could bring this whole process to an end by using his discretion under the Migration Act and allow the family to return home to Biloela.\u201d NSW police minister David Elliott says NSW will be working with international agencies in the Ruby Princess investigation, in order to interview international passengers. It is sending out a survey to the Ruby Princess passengers as a way of gathering information about who knew what, when. \u201cThis is no rule book when it comes to these sorts of inquiries, it is unusual for something this large, covering so many jurisdictions to be put in the lap of one person.\u201d The NSW police investigation has 30 investigators attached to Strikeforce Bast. Scott Morrison has been asked by everyone: In between coronavirus, government ministers have been asked about Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s book, which is out next week. Greg Hunt was asked about his portrayal, by Michael Rowland: MR: He is making lots of interesting remarks to senior government figures. Greg Hunt, he said all too often you used abusive and vulgar language toward others. Did you? GH: Look, none of us are perfect. I\u2019m focused on the coronavirus. I\u2019m absolutely focused on that. I haven\u2019t had the chance to read any of the books written about the last election or the last couple of years. I suspect that I\u2019m not going to have much time to do that. So my job, really my job is to focus on saving lives and protecting lives. All the things that have led Australia to where we are. I suspect that that\u2019s not something I\u2019m going to have a chance to get to. MR: He has every right to publish this, he obviously feels, by the way he was treated by what he describes as the rightwing terrorists within the Liberal party? GH: Well, it is not a term that has been applied to me previously before, as far as I can tell. Anyway, it is a free country and people are absolutely entitled to write what they want. For me, my genuine focus, my deep focus in the midst of what has been the most significant health crisis since World War II in Australia, has been on getting the numbers down and the fact that we are doing that, that\u2019s what really matters to me. That\u2019s what I think matters to the vast majority of Australians, and I will say at the end of what\u2019s been a difficult month since these restrictions came into being, Australians have done a magnificent job and that\u2019s the good news for Australians. It gives us a pathway to the future. Australia has been invited to sit on a special \u201cG20 energy ministers\u2019 focus group\u201d, which will look at the globe\u2019s energy security during the coronavirus pandemic. Angus Taylor is chuffed: Affordable energy and an uninterrupted supply is crucial to ensure essential services such as health and food supplies, and a stable and secure market will also help nations as they emerge from the economic impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. I look forward to Australia making a solid contribution to the G20 Energy Ministers Focus Group. The Courier Mail\u2019s tireless health reporter, Janelle Miles, reports the Cairns hospital pathology lab has had to close, after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19. Contact tracing is under way, but at this point, it looks like the employee was infected from another known case. The lab\u2019s staff have been put into a 14-day quarantine. Daniel Andrews gave Victoria\u2019s update just a few moments ago: There were 2,700 tests that were completed over the last 24 hours with just one positive result. That, I think, gives you a really clear indication that this strategy is working. We\u2019re seeing some stability, significant stability, to these numbers and that is the product of some tough rules and the fact that the vast majority of Victorians are following those rules, and I thank them - each and every one of them - for the part they\u2019re playing in protecting our health system and saving lives. Now, for those small number of Victorians who are doing the wrong thing, I can report that 540 spot-checks were undertaken yesterday and some 67 fines were issued. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, announced more cases had been diagnosed in the western Sydney aged care home this morning (you\u2019ll find her quotes a little further down). Anglicare have now confirmed that 20 residents and 10 staff have tested positive for Covid-19: The NSW Public Health Unit are investigating the source of these cases. As a precaution, residents who tested negative are being re-tested again. We have contacted all relatives of our residents infected. Our staff that have tested positive are self-isolating at home on full pay. Anglicare has deployed a specially trained team of staff assigned to care for the residents who have tested positive. This team is wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE), follow strict infection control procedures and care solely for these residents. We continue to closely monitor all our residents and staff at Newmarch. We are grateful to the support provided to us by NSW Health and Australian Health Departments. Since the outbreak at Newmarch House was first confirmed to us at 10.40pm on Saturday 11 April, Anglicare has been working closely with NSW Health as well as auditing and reassessing our procedures that have been in place since the beginning of March 2020. The safety, health and wellbeing of our residents, staff and volunteers is our number one priority during this challenging time. Asked in that same interview whether or not he would make downloading the tracing app, and traveling with phones, mandatory, Scott Morrison says: My preference is not to do that, my preference is to give Australians the go of getting it right. ... I don\u2019t want to be drawn on that [making it mandatory], I want to give Australians the opportunity to get it right. That is my objective, that is my Plan A and I really want Plan A to work. I will be calling on Australians to do it, frankly, as a matter of national service, to do it in the same way that people used to buy war bonds back in the war times, to come together to support the effort. I know this would be something they might not normally do in an ordinary time, but this is not an ordinary time. If you download this app, you\u2019ll be helping to save someone\u2019s life and I think Australians will respond to that. Asked about privacy concerns, Morrison says they will be dealt with, but says: Here is the simple deal. If people download the app, and more people have got it, the sooner we can start easing of some of these restrictions. Further to that press conference from Peter Gutwein, Scott Morrison spoke to Hobart radio Triple M this morning and spoke about a health worker in the north-west, using it as an example of why the tracking app was necessary: The case in north-west Tasmania is a classic case of why we need this. We\u2019ve had someone down there not tell the truth to the contact tracers about where they\u2019d been and who they\u2019d been with and that means that a lot of people have been put at risk in north-west Tasmania. ... They have been working in the health system more broadly, in the aged-care system, so this has been very unhelpful. Morrison said it had nothing to do with the rumours of what chief medical officer Brendan Murphy referred to as an \u201cillegal dinner party\u201d (for which there is no evidence). The Tasmanian parliament will resume from the 27 April \u2013 but with a reduced weekly schedule. Peter Gutwein on the north-west localised restrictions: Yesterday, and I\u2019ll just make this point and, again, it beggars belief, overnight I\u2019ve been notified of people that were shopping at Spotlight in Launceston from the north west coast. People shopping at Bunnings. Please be sensible about this. The rules that we\u2019re putting in place are there to protect you. The rules that we\u2019re putting in place are there to protect your family. The rules that we\u2019re putting in place are there to protect your community. I understand that this is tough. I understand that this is hard. But at the end of the day, the virus travels with people and it\u2019s important that we all limit our movements. The simplest way that you can help us to get on top of this is to limit your movements if you live on the north west coast, allowed us to increase our testing, allow us to do our contract tracing and allow us to get on top of this and crush it. I would ask that you work with us to do that and Tasmanian Police will be doing everything they can to make sure the rules are abided. The #hometobilo case has been decided in the federal court today. Josh Taylor is covering it Peter Gutwein says Tasmania may strengthen its stay at home order for the north-west of the state: Today, the stay at home order, unless you are leaving for work, essential supplies or medical services, or to exercise will be strictly policed. In terms of the north-west coast, the current orders are very clear but I\u2019ve asked for them to be reviewed this morning and, if necessary, they will be strengthened to ensure that we can contain this virus and this outbreak to the north-west coast. I want to be clear if you\u2019re traveling on the north-west coast today, you should expect to be stopped and questioned about the purpose of your trip. Don\u2019t be surprised if there is a roadblock or a checkpoint which is being used. Tasmania Police will ask you the purposes of your trip and if it\u2019s not for essential purposes, then you\u2019ll be asked to return home. The most sensible thing that people on the north-west coast can do right now is to stay home, work with us, and help us to save lives. The news out of north-west Tasmania continues to be worrying. Peter Gutwein has confirmed a health worker who tested positive, who worked in the two closed hospitals, also worked at three aged care homes. There is currently one resident displaying mild respiratory symptoms. I know this is very concerning news for families, friends and the loved ones of those being cared for in these facilities and it\u2019s important that we do everything that we can to get on top of this and provide clarity as soon as we can. All residents and staffs in these three homes will be tested today with the assistance and support of the federal government. Enhanced testing over and above what is available in the north-west will be implemented across the coast today with the support of the Federal Government Melbourne\u2019s La Trobe university plans to let go all \u201cnon essential\u201d casual staff from the start of next month as it braces for \u201csevere\u201d financial difficulties. In an email to staff, the vice chancellor Prof John Dewar also asked staff to consider donating part of the pay back to the university or handing back time-off-in-lieu entitlements. Although he stressed that staff should not \u201cfeel any compulsion to take part\u201d, Dewar warned the university expected a $120m and $150m decline in revenue in 2020 and that further measures such as forced redundancies could still be in the pipeline. \u201cTo put that in perspective, our budgeted operating surplus for the year was $30m,\u201d Dewar said. \u201cThat is a very big hit indeed,\u201d he added. It comes as the tertiary education union faces a revolt over a confidential plan to negotiate with university management on staff pay cuts during the Covid-19 crisis. Dewar said the university would introduce a range of cost saving measures, which included letting go non-essential casual staff from 1 May. These employees will only be retained if they are signed off by senior staff as \u201cessential\u201d, but some were frustrated no further details were given as to how this would be defined. Dewar also floated a range of voluntary measures, such as asking staff to donate between 5-20% of their base salary back to the university. Dewar said he could not guarantee the voluntary measures would be \u201cenough to prevent the need for workforce changes, including stand down or even forced redundancies at some stage\u201d. \u201cNo-one should feel any compulsion to take part,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that many of you are simply not able to help now, and I completely understand that. For those of you that can help, I strongly encourage you to think about these options.\u201d Senior executives have agreed to a voluntary 20% salary cut. Given we are going to be hearing A LOT about this app in the coming month, you might find this helpful. On top of the $165m to underwrite domestic flight trunk routes, the government is also providing $150m to internet providers. If that wasn\u2019t blunt enough, Peter Dutton followed those comments up with this: I think people who have a relative who\u2019s died \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve got over 60 Australians who have died \u2013 people say that\u2019s a low number, every one of those cases involves a tragedy of somebody very close to you being lost. Hundreds of people obviously very gravely ill as a result in our country \u2013 look at the loss overseas. All of those families would demand answers and transparency. And, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask. It would certainly be demanded of us, if Australia was at the epicentre of this virus making its way into society. So I think it is incumbent upon China to answer those questions and provide the information, so that people can have clarity about exactly what happened because we don\u2019t want it to be repeated. And, we know that this is not the first instance of a virus being spread from the wildlife wet markets and we need to be honest about that. Peter Dutton also had some things to say about China, while on the Nine Network today: Well, the US is saying they\u2019ve got documentation which demonstrates that the virus had a particular path or origin. I think they\u2019ll detail all of that information. But, look, I do think there will be a reset about the way in which the world interacts with China. We do want more transparency. China can have their economy grow, lift people out of poverty and that\u2019s a wonderful thing, but when you\u2019ve got a Communist party that doesn\u2019t have the transparency that other comparable economies have, then that is a problem. And, when you see their involvement in foreign interference, when you see their involvement in cyber, all of these aspects need to, I think, be looked at again. And, I think it is a good thing that there\u2019s transparency and hopefully you can have China answering these questions, that are reasonably put and people can have more confidence. Things are so dire in punting land, one of the major betting agencies is now hosting wagers on the colour of Scott Morrison\u2019s tie. Maybe just have another cup of tea and stare at a wall like the rest of us are doing. Scott Morrison has done the morning radio rounds this morning. Anthony Albanese will hold his press conference at 10.40. And the Ruby Princess is still docked in NSW. Mick Fuller says police are still working towards a Sunday departure date: In terms of the Ruby I am waiting for a health report some time today to give me an idea whether Sunday is still a realistic target for the Ruby Princess to leave Port Kembla. If the health advice is I need to wait another couple of days then no doubt Border Force and New South Wales police will honour that. We will continue to work with the ship and Carnival to make sure that anyone who can come off and be repatriated can be but, obviously, the safety of the crew is still paramount to us. Scott Morrison announced yesterday that, all things continuing as they are, parliament will be called back for a normal sitting as a \u201ctrial\u201d next month. Jim Chalmers responded this morning and said it was an opportunity to talk to Australians about where their budget was at: While we acknowledge and accept the difficulties of handing down a full budget in the current circumstances, for weeks now Labor has been calling on the government to bring forward updated figures on the budget position and economic forecasts. Australians should not have to wait 10 months from last December\u2019s update to a budget in October without the government being upfront with them about the impact of this virus, and their response to it, on the economy. In the same week that the International Monetary Fund published sobering forecasts for the Australian economy and echoed Labor\u2019s calls for greater transparency in economic planning, it has been disappointing that the Liberals and Nationals continue to withhold a comprehensive update. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, gave his update this morning: We are seeing an increase in the reports of domestic and family violence incidents, which means police are responding to more calls. However, reports of DV assaults are actually down. Alcohol-related crime is still down, street crime is still down. So in terms of our side of isolation is that we are going very well as a state. Can I say one road message, one concerning statistic we are seeing a significant increase in speeding, particularly over 30km and over 45km an hour. Speeds of over 45km an hour have increased over 40% on the same time last year. Because there are less cars on the road it doesn\u2019t give you the opportunity to drive recklessly and put other people\u2019s lives in danger. It is a time where we need to protect our health system and that sort of driving behaviour will not be tolerated. Please call 1800RESPECT if you feel unsafe, or need to talk. Good to see Peter V\u2019Landys continuing to win friends and influence people. Meanwhile, Sam Newman marched to the Victorian parliament to protest because he can\u2019t play golf \u2013 but at least he isn\u2019t in charge of anything any more. The NRL chairman, Peter V\u2019Landys, has also been on RN Breakfast this morning insisting the league will push ahead with its plan to resume playing by 28 May. Despite the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, saying earlier that the code had not been given the green light to resume playing, V\u2019Landys continues to insist the NRL could resume tomorrow if it wanted to because the state\u2019s public health orders provide exemptions for sports. He said the league would demonstrate it could resume safely through the self-isolation of players, temperature checking and biosecurity at venues: Not one player has tested positive to the virus, all our players have been following our self-isolation rules and not interacting with the community. [Our] social distancing measures have certainly helped. We\u2019ve got six weeks, as I say, to see how the infection rate is going. If the infection rate spikes, well, naturally, we will [choose] another date. The western Sydney nursing home which has been hit by a Covid outbreak has seen positive cases increase from 15 to 29 in the last 24 hours. An employee who was not displaying any symptoms inadvertently caused the outbreak. After learning she had been in contact with a positive case, she was tested and returned a positive test herself. Tests have been increased at the Anglicare Newmarch House centre. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has urged all aged care workers to get tested: Obviously there has been extensive testing in that aged care facility and we may see new cases be reported. A strong focus on anyone who works with vulnerable people, aged care worker, health care workers, even with minimal symptoms ... please come forward to testing. There is a nice dose of social guilt being applied to how the government sells the tracing app it wants people to download. Greg Hunt delivered a masterclass in it while speaking to the ABC this morning about the privacy concerns surrounding the technology: I do think this is a very important question but what we are doing is making sure that there are very strong privacy protections. It\u2019s about making \u2013 giving all of us the capacity to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. It is voluntary. We want to encourage as many people as possible \u2013 I will be downloading the app \u2013 but encourage as many people as possible to do that but we respect absolutely that this is an individual choice but as part of the community we want to encourage it. It enhances our capacity to protect each other, to make sure that if I\u2019ve been in contact with somebody unknowingly who had the virus, I would want to know that. I think of it that way. I would want to know that so I could not just protect myself but in particular my family, my 88-year-old Italian mother-in-law who lives with us, she is in an absolutely vulnerable age group and for me to know I have been in contact with somebody, even though I might not know them personally, but I have been in a room, spent time, that\u2019s really important information that can help save lives and protect lives. Having experienced the virus first hand, Peter Dutton is not chomping at the bit to have all the restrictions lifted: No, and if you look at cases around the world, but Singapore I think is the most recent, where they\u2019re now experiencing the second wave and if you\u2019re getting 10% growth day on day where it was next to zero before, or we see what\u2019s happened in the United Kingdom and parts of the United States, Italy, etc, that\u2019s the fine balancing act the prime minister and premiers are trying to find now. People are desperate to get back out \u2013 we want the economy to restart, reboot. We want kids back at school andwe want a normal environment to prevail but if we do it too quickly we will see the sort of horror scenario we\u2019ve seen overseas. It is about trying to get the balance right and this is unprecedented. There is no textbook on this. We\u2019ve got to take the advice of not just the chief medical officers from the commonwealth and states but also the chief economists from the Reserve Bank, etc. about how it is we can get people back because we don\u2019t want to end up in a very severe recession and want to make sure people are healthy. Peter Dutton was on the Nine Network\u2019s Today program this morning, explaining why the second week of having the virus is the one to watch: That second week, people have got to be careful about that. I felt on top of the world after about five days and day seven or eight it really hit me and I was really short of breath, almost to the point where I went back to hospital. Anyway, I\u2019ve got over it and was eventually released by Queensland Health. They did a great job so I\u2019m very grateful. Dutton is back at work after a month recovering from the virus. Stuart Robert was sent out this morning to talk about the tracing app the government wants people to download as part of its conditions for loosening physical restrictions. There are privacy concerns. Robert told the Seven Network it was \u201cabout peace of mind\u201d. The government won\u2019t have information regarding you. Let\u2019s say you have on your phone and as you went through your life and over a course rolling 21 days you were within close proximity, 1.5 metres for 15 minutes, with five people those numbers will be on your phone, nowhere else, encrypted \u2013 you can\u2019t access them, no one else can. And if you tested positive the authorities would ask you to consent and that would be uploaded to a secure server where health authorities would call those people. That\u2019s it. No one has access to your data, no one is tracking you, there\u2019s no surveillance. This is simply a digital way of a current manual process and it makes it quicker, and frankly, it will give you a peace of mind when you\u2019re out and about if someone with the virus is close to you, health authorities will call you. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has told RN Breakfast that classrooms will \u201ccertainly not be full\u201d when schools begin operating next term, saying students will return to schools via rosters. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has been pushing for classroom lessons to resume across Australia once school holidays ended. Berejiklian has flagged that students in NSW would begin returning in the third week of term two on 11 May. On Friday she told the ABC taht the government wouldn\u2019t allow all students to return at once, saying students would likely be invited back through a \u201csome type of roster\u201d. \u201cIt is fair to say NSW is looking at some type of roster,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want any teachers, parents or students for that matter to be concerned [we] do not mean full classrooms and that won\u2019t happen for a fair time to come, unfortunately.\u201d Berejiklian was also asked about the potential resumption of the NRL at the end of May. She said the \u201cshort answer\u201d was that the league had not been granted approval to resume but that it would have the opportunity show it could operate within health guidelines. So, because it still seems that some people are still confused, when it comes to schools, listen to your state or territory leader. Each jurisdiction has slightly different rules. In general, schools are open for essential workers (anyone with a job) and parents who have no other choice. If you can keep your kids at home, you should. Schools are run by the states and territories. So if you\u2019re in Queensland, it doesn\u2019t matter to you what Gladys Berejiklian says. So far we know: Victoria \u2013 schools are pupil-free. Keep your kids at home if you can. Laptops and sim cards can be loaned out. Queensland \u2013 schools are pupil-free until at least 22 May. Keep your kids at home if you can. Laptops and sim cards can be borrowed. Speak to your school principal if you are unsure of whether or not you should send your child to school. NSW \u2013 schools are pupil-free. Keep your kids at home if you can. Tools can be borrowed. A roster system is being considered, to increase face-to-face time, but full school attendance is not being considered until term three. NT \u2013 schools are open. If you want to keep your child at home, and can, you may. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, says among the 29 new cases of Covid-19, was an infant boy: We\u2019ve had a seven-week-old baby boy who has tested Covid-positive and the baby is a close contact of known cases. The source of that infection for that family cluster is not known but the patient was admitted to hospital and assessed but was actually not admitted . Gladys Berejiklian says while NSW is looking at increasing face-to-face time between teachers and students this term, that does not mean a return to normal. As we reported yesterday, anything resembling normal won\u2019t be in place until at least term three. But with students (and some of their parents) struggling with isolation, and teachers trying to keep everything connected through a screen, NSW is looking at a rotation system to keep numbers on-site low but to ensure that all students, parents and teachers are getting some face-to-face time. What it does mean is that New South Wales is considering a roster system to provide at least some aspect of face-to-face for each student. Can I stress we aren\u2019t proposing and supporting at that stage, full classrooms and every single student going back at the same time. We are considering our options around a rostering system which will have some students go back on a particular day to increase that level of face-to-face because the alternative is that unfortunately students could face up to a year or longer at home and we don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate. So we do need to take these initial steps on how we can introduce face-to-face teaching at some level in term two and we are having those discussions as we speak with all of our stakeholder, our school communities to make sure we get that right. But I wanted to assure everybody going back to face-to-face reaching in week 3 of term 3 does not mean full classrooms. It does not mean back to normal. It\u2019s Gladys Berejiklian o\u2019clock. Twenty-nine people were diagnosed with Covid-19 in NSW in the last 24 hours. Last night, when asked about what to do with Virgin, Scott Morrison told Leigh Sales that a government bailout was not on the cards \u2013 suggesting industry super funds step up: But what\u2019s very important is that we don\u2019t get in the way of a commercial solution, like the TWU super fund, I mean, the industry super funds in this country have got $3tn dollars worth of assets here \u2013 we\u2019ve got a company that needs capital. Its own workers have been paying in to industry funds and there are funds out there, in these super funds that could be investing in a number of companies. Now, I appreciate that comes in a different risk premium, but this is their own contributors that are involved here. And I\u2019d like to see the industry and broader superannuation fund playing a more active role in dealing with the economic issues that we\u2019re dealing with at the moment. I mean, the government, the taxpayer, is not the only economic actor in this event. There are many others. Michael McCormack followed that up this morning on ABC radio by suggesting the airline\u2019s employees look at their own super: We want to see a market resolution for this and if Virgin can\u2019t raise the capital through its shareholders ... then let\u2019s see what happens. We want to see two airlines out the back of the Covid-19 and I think we can and we will. It took until the end of the week, but Virgin and Qantas got their underwriting for trunk routes. $165m for domestic routes, as the nation sits through at least four more weeks of physical restrictions. After the four weeks, we know the government is looking at moving out of these restrictions, as it works towards an aggressive \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d system as the pathway out. Why does it have to be done so carefully? Angela Merkel manages to explain it perfectly: Everyone is doing interviews at once this morning. We\u2019ll bring you that, and everything else, as the day rolls on. You have Amy Remeikis with you for what I think is a Friday. Who knows. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

Still, Louisiana is one of the worst-hit states, and the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the stark health disparities there.

He has also communicated effectively with his constituents, providing even-keeled updates, while also showing emotion and empathy.

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s governors are playing an outsized role in day-to-day life across the country, and have emerged on the frontlines of efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. At times they are the voices offering the starkest contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s wildly inconsistent statements, at other times they have been the most popular targets of criticism for how they are responding to the virus. Who is state governor has been one of the most important factors in how each state has responded to the pandemic: moving quickly to shutdowns and stay-at-home orders, or not moving at all: with high-stakes consequences. \u201cThis is a defining moment for every governor in America because this isn\u2019t a moment where you just cast a vote and go home,\u201d the veteran Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who has advised governors and gubernatorial candidates, said. \u201cGovernors are in charge of making these life and death decisions right now.\u201d Strategist Mike DuHaime, a veteran consultant to Republican governors and gubernatorial candidates, said the coronavirus pandemic was a rare crisis in which every governor has to respond. \u201cYou\u2019re not looking at two or three governors dealing with a crisis, you\u2019re looking at all 50,\u201d DuHaime said. Below is a list of 10 of the most visible governors during the pandemic: John Bel Edwards, Louisiana Critics blame Edwards, a Democrat, for allowing Mardi Gras festivities to go ahead, which epidemiologists say may have accelerated the spread of disease. But Edwards has earned praise for his bipartisan efforts \u2013 uniting bitter political rivals in the state legislature \u2013 to enforce social distancing and secure medical supplies. Still, Louisiana is one of the worst-hit states, and the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the stark health disparities there. At the other end of this crisis, Edwards will have to brace for blame and well as credit from voters. Charlie Baker, Massachusetts The signature aspect of Baker\u2019s time as governor has been how he has distanced himself from the president without sparking the ire of his party. Baker, a moderate Republican, has at times loudly disagreed with Trump \u2013 bluntly shooting down the president\u2019s suggestion to reopen the country for business by Easter. He has also communicated effectively with his constituents, providing even-keeled updates, while also showing emotion and empathy. Baker has also launched a statewide relief fund for households and workers affected by the coronavirus pandemic. His pragmatism and persistence in response to the crisis have won him bipartisan praise, and reinforced his image as a moderate foil to Trump. Mike Parson, Missouri Parson finally issued a shelter-in-place order for Missouri on 6 April, after resisting the move for weeks. Even then, the Republican left loopholes that allow even non-essential businesses to remain open, and undermined his own policy, calling it a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d. His obstinacy, even as medical experts and local leaders within his state pleaded with him to take action as the number of cases rose, triggered the non-partisan Cook Political Report to downgrade his chances of winning re-election in the gubernatorial election in November. Ron DeSantis, Florida Republican DeSantis has received a wave of criticism for his response to the coronavirus in Florida. His shelter-in-place order contains notable exceptions \u2013 it doesn\u2019t bar churches from holding services, in a state where megachurches have held packed, risky services for hundreds of parishioners. DeSantis has defended himself by insisting that public health decisions should be left to local officials. Still, he has stayed in Trump\u2019s good graces.

      "bodyText": "The United States has announced it will give $5m to the Palestinians to help them fight the coronavirus epidemic, roughly 1% of the amount Washington provided a year before Donald Trump cut almost all aid. The US ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, a former Trump bankruptcy lawyer, announced the aid package on Twitter, saying he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d the US would provide money for Palestinian hospitals and households. \u201cThe USA, as the world\u2019s top humanitarian aid donor, is committed to assisting the Palestinian people, &amp; others worldwide, in this crisis,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Never has the slogan \u201ca day at a time\u201d that I learned at my first Narcotics Anonymous meeting well over 33 years ago \u2013 yes, I am still counting the days \u2013 seemed more apposite. On a day-by-day basis I can just about muddle through the coronavirus pandemic. I still wake up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/digested-week-fear-loathing-coronavirus-lockdown\">gripped by anxiety</a> and it can still take a couple of hours for me to feel brave enough to get out of bed, but for the rest of the day I can more or less function. Work provides both a distraction and an outlet for my feelings of powerlessness, pedalling up and down the same hill 10 times on my wife\u2019s (much too small) bicycle replaces cortisol with endorphins and our small back garden has been a haven in the good weather. So I am more than aware that I am so much more fortunate than many others in the current situation. It\u2019s when I start to think about the future that things rather fall apart. When will I next see my daughter in Minneapolis? We were due to fly over in August but, even if the flights are operational, would it be a good idea to go to the US with health insurance that is certain to exclude Covid-19? When will I next see my son in Brighton? When will I next see my mother? Her care home went into lockdown three weeks ago and has now reported its first suspected coronavirus case. So, she is lonely and frightened, confined to her room, seeing almost no one. These are the thoughts that dominate my subconscious and to which there are no clear answers. Which is presumably why I wake up in a complete state every morning.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I can\u2019t help feeling that government ministers must be secretly wishing they had never agreed to give a daily Downing Street press conference. Obviously, given the gravity of the situation, they didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter but, having now watched every single one of them, it\u2019s now clear their main underlying purpose is to show just how little command of the situation ministers actually have and how policy is being made up day by day. Rishi Sunak has already delivered at least six new budgets since his first one on 11 March and looks set to hit double figures by the end of the month. Matt Hancock has managed to forget his first promise to deliver 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April \u2013 we\u2019re currently at about 16,000 \u2013 and has instead committed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/britain-on-target-for-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day-says-no-10\">100,000 tests daily</a> by the end of the month. He has also rather belatedly remembered he is secretary of state for social care as well as health, though care workers would probably more appreciate personal protective equipment and testing than his offer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\">shiny green </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\"> \u201cCARE</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\">\u201d badges</a>. And Sunak and Hancock are two of the more able cabinet ministers. After many complaints that the government was treating the coronavirus as man\u2019s work, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was sent out last Saturday to face the media. An experiment unlikely to be repeated. First Patel managed to imply that NHS workers were deliberately wasting PPE and then insisted that the government had so far carried out <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/priti-patel-300-034-974-000-tests-carried-out-2149924/\">300,034 974,000 tests</a>. Which by my reckoning means that every person must have already been tested 4,615 times each. Her performance was so poor it almost made me wish that I worked on a Saturday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4e6bb57f9584db33cd55985680c7ca4c3fc595c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4e6bb57f9584db33cd55985680c7ca4c3fc595c/0_63_3500_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Raab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raab: \u2018Try to look on the bright side \u2013 you could have got Michael Gove as stand-in PM.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>One of the main problems with the daily press conference is that ministers have to pretend that they have some important news to divulge even when they almost invariably don\u2019t. In the absence of Boris they don\u2019t even dare to suggest what criteria might govern their thinking in any relaxation of the lockdown, which gives each briefing a sense of deja vu. One of the most annoying parts of every ministerial statement is the constant reiteration of the mantra that \u201cthe government\u2019s actions have at all times been driven by the science\u201d. Mostly because that merely serves to underline just how little the government actually understands the nature of science. The whole point of science \u2013 especially in regard to a disease as new as the coronavirus \u2013 is that there is no overall consensus. Disagreement and pressure-testing each other\u2019s arguments are precisely what makes scientists and other academics tick. So there is no uniformity and the government is having to make judgment calls on which scientists are the most trustworthy. Donald Trump is clearly doing that, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">rubbished the World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/g7-backing-for-who-leaves-trump-isolated-at-virtual-summit\">zation</a> for having less of a grip on the science than a couple of his close mates. And yes, the UK government has been too craven to call the Donald out on this. Nor does the UK\u2019s insistence on scientific evidence quite explain why the government did a complete U-turn nearly four weeks ago. On the Friday, it had been fine for 80,000 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/10/cheltenham-festival-key-event-in-racing-calendar-goes-ahead-despite-coronavirus\">to go to the Cheltenham races</a>; by the following Monday the country was being put in near total lockdown. I don\u2019t remember anyone saying the science had changed over the weekend.</p> <h2><strong>Thursday</strong></h2> <p>My concentration levels are still hopeless. I have done slightly better this week, having now made it to page 10 of Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light and I can report the extra six pages are every bit as good as the first four that I had already read several times. It\u2019s immensely frustrating as there\u2019s nothing more I would like than to be immersed in someone else\u2019s world, but my mind won\u2019t allow me to settle. I\u2019m reluctant to temporarily give up as I hate the idea of abandoning a book I have waited the best part of eight years to read, but I fear this is the way I\u2019m heading. After all, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not spoiled for choice as I have Hadley Freeman\u2019s House of Glass, Adam Macqueen\u2019s Beneath the Streets and Svenja O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Inge\u2019s War piled up beside my bed. I did also have Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet but my wife has already pinched that and has advised me not to read it at present. It\u2019s set against the background of plague and she is worried about the effect it might have on my mental health. I\u2019ve also been struggling to dip in and out of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/08/wisden-2020-offers-plenty-scope-cricket-loving-self-isolators-ben-stokes\">this year\u2019s Wisden</a> because, although the pieces are an ideal length, the print is just too small. My eyesight is fighting a losing battle with the almanack and I fear that next year I may have to order the large print edition. In the meantime, I have come up with a reasonable compromise by downloading it as an audible book. It calls itself the Shorter Wisden \u2013 mainly because it doesn\u2019t give you the scores of every game \u2013 but still comes in at over 20 hours. And at \u00a310, I reckon 50p an hour is a bargain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>Apparently it\u2019s Friday, though it\u2019s hard to be too certain as the days all tend to merge into one another with little to differentiate them. Same feelings, same activities, much the same TV. Weirdly it\u2019s the weekends I now find trickiest as they have even less structure than the weekdays. I have to struggle more to find a sense of purpose and retain my fragments of identity. But when this lockdown started I made a commitment to try to end every week on a positive note, so here are my notes of love among the ruins. I would rather I didn\u2019t have to look at myself during online calls \u2013 do I really look that bad? \u2013 but FaceTime and Zoom chats both with family and friends have proved to be a lifeline. Although they are reminders of the closeness that has been lost, they do give me a sense of connection. And I\u2019ve been genuinely touched by the number of readers who have emailed in to check up on me, to share their own thoughts and send me photos; I\u2019m also happy to report that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/21/weirdos-misfits-and-why-i-had-to-check-my-dogs-horoscope\">Herbert Hound</a> has now adjusted to the new normal. Initially he was rather put out to find that Jill and I were around 24/7 and he would self-isolate in our daughter\u2019s bedroom. But now he seems to need less \u201cme time\u201d and has come back to sleep in our room. I have finally finished cataloguing my book collection and am about to start on the ceramics: a far trickier enterprise as it involves including pictures and my tech skills are rudimentary at best. I will report back. Incidentally, I have taken to talking to my pots ... I fear I may be turning into Prince Charles. Also huge kudos to the Spurs\u2019 players and the supporters trust who persuaded the club to reverse its decision to furlough and lay off non-playing staff. It made me feel proud to be a fan again. And finally, do watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/harry-birrell-presents-films-of-love-and-war-review-second-world-war-documentary\">Harry Birrell Presents Films of Love and War</a> on iPlayer. It\u2019s an astonishingly moving and intimate collection of homemade movies collected into a feature length film. I cried. But then I tend to do that a lot these days.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"781f8fb6c93c14f8d2b9999b293598d4bd928e03\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/781f8fb6c93c14f8d2b9999b293598d4bd928e03/0_119_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Phone box food drop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Do you have an online delivery service?\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Barlow/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Digested week, digested:</strong> Same as it ever was</p>",

      "body": "<p>The University and College Union (UCU) has condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The union\u2019s general secretary Jo Grady called on the university to halt proposals to cut \u201clive\u201d teaching by 25% as part of a radical shift towards providing online learning, which she described as \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201can attack on staff\u201d.</p> <p>The radical redesign of the university\u2019s curriculum, revealed by <a href=\"https://www.palatinate.org.uk/exclusive-university-proposes-online-only-degrees-as-part-of-radical-restructuring/\">student newspaper Palatinate</a>, would \u201cinvert Durham\u2019s traditional educational model\u201d, based on residential study, with one that places \u201conline resources at the core enabling us to provide education at a distance\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/09/symptom-trackers-and-doctor-dorms-how-universities-are-fighting-covid-19\">Symptom-trackers and doctor dorms: how universities are fighting Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The proposals, drawn up by deputy vice-chancellor Antony Long and vice-provost for education Alan Houston, warned that Durham has been slow to develop online education compared to its competitors, which posed \u201ca very significant financial and reputational risk\u201d to the university.</p> <p>Under the plans, seen by the Guardian, some students would only study online, some would be taught on campus, and others would do both. The proposals, drawn up without consulting staff or students, would reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, with the goal of providing at least 500 of them completely online by the summer of 2021.</p> <p>An anthropology and archaeology student said she feared the plans would devalue her degree. She added: \u201cThis is clearly to increase the number of students on the books paying full fees, whilst maintaining existing staff levels.

      "bodyText": "The University and College Union (UCU) has condemned plans by Durham University to provide online-only degrees and significantly reduce face-to-face lecturing in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The union\u2019s general secretary Jo Grady called on the university to halt proposals to cut \u201clive\u201d teaching by 25% as part of a radical shift towards providing online learning, which she described as \u201cdestructive\u201d and \u201can attack on staff\u201d. The radical redesign of the university\u2019s curriculum, revealed by student newspaper Palatinate, would \u201cinvert Durham\u2019s traditional educational model\u201d, based on residential study, with one that places \u201conline resources at the core enabling us to provide education at a distance\u201d. The proposals, drawn up by deputy vice-chancellor Antony Long and vice-provost for education Alan Houston, warned that Durham has been slow to develop online education compared to its competitors, which posed \u201ca very significant financial and reputational risk\u201d to the university. Under the plans, seen by the Guardian, some students would only study online, some would be taught on campus, and others would do both. The proposals, drawn up without consulting staff or students, would reduce the number of modules taught in person by a quarter in the next academic year, with the goal of providing at least 500 of them completely online by the summer of 2021. An anthropology and archaeology student said she feared the plans would devalue her degree. She added: \u201cThis is clearly to increase the number of students on the books paying full fees, whilst maintaining existing staff levels. I feel like [a] cash cow and fear more strike action while I\u2019m out of pocket and have very little to show for it in terms of education.\u201d The document, due to be considered by the university\u2019s senate later this month, also proposes contracting a private education firm, Cambridge Education Group Digital, to develop a business case to implement the plans. The UCU said that universities \u201cshould not see the global pandemic as an opportunity to try and drastically alter their different business models\u201d, and urged Durham to consult properly with staff and students over any changes. Grady added: \u201cThis looks like an attack on the livelihoods and the professional expertise of hard-working staff \u2013 all to line the pockets of private providers who don\u2019t have the same track record of providing high standards of education. \u201cDurham needs to halt these plans. The fact there has been no consultation with staff or students is unacceptable and we will continue to defend the quality of education staff provide and our members\u2019 jobs. \u201cChanges to our higher education system should be led by staff from the ground up, whether they are necessitated by Covid-19 or not. We will do everything we can to challenge this and any other similarly destructive proposals.\u201d The Durham plans revealed that a third of its undergraduate and half of postgraduate modules currently lack any online learning, noting: \u201cIn the short-term, we risk being unable to provide even a basic \u2018minimum viable product\u2019 online for our [academic year] 2020/21 intake.\u201d The university aims to provide its key postgraduate and first-year undergraduate degrees online by October 2020, with a focus on delivering those with the most \u201cinternational market potential\u201d. Durham UCU branch held a virtual emergency general meeting this week where members \u201cvoted to firmly oppose rushed long-term changes taken without proper consultation\u201d. More than 300 Durham academics have also signed a letter to vice-chancellor Stuart Corbridge, describing the proposals as \u201chighly concerning \u2026 cynical and reckless\u201d. Prof Antony Long, the university\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor, said: \u201cNone of us yet know what the 2020-21 academic year will look like, but we must plan now so that when we do, we have options properly developed and ready to implement. \u201cAnticipating that some and perhaps a significant number of students will not be able to travel to and live in Durham [then], we are preparing an online, distance learning programme that is both inclusive and high-quality.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It is beyond cynical. Almost every business in Britain is in lockdown. Shops are shut, factories padlocked, firms bankrupted, millions pushed into short- or long-term unemployment. They are told by the cabinet, \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d</p> <p>No we are not. Somewhere contractors are popping the champagne and consultants carting their fees to the bank. These are not medical suppliers, care home operators or testing centres. They are not the broken-backed small businesses to whose half-hearted aid the Treasury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/covid-19-bailout-loans-issued-uk-firms-banks\">still fails to come</a>. The lucky ones are the backers of Boris Johnson\u2019s beloved HS2.</p> <p>On Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/high-speed-2-notice-to-proceed-issued/56265.article\">notices to proceed</a> were posted in the industry press to Costain, Balfour Beatty, McAlpine and others. They should all get back to work, subject only to \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Work at the closed Euston site should resume next week. The \u201cminister for HS2\u201d, Andrew Stephenson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/15/construction-on-hs2-can-begin-government-says\">said</a> he wanted to offer those working on the project \u201ccertainty at a time when they need it\u201d. If worried about lockdown, they shouldn\u2019t be. The poor dears should resume their works. Rome might burn, but Nero did not want his Colosseum to run late.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/15/construction-on-hs2-can-begin-government-says\">Construction on HS2 can begin, government says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Countless megaprojects \u2013 in housing, distribution, retail and construction generally \u2013 would dearly love such reassurance. This is not only because, alone in Europe, the British government refuses to give details of how it intends to end lockdown, so that businesses might at least plan. There is worry also over the wider impact of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s warning of an astonishing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/rishi-sunak-deeply-troubled-by-obr-warning-of-35-fall-in-uk-gdp\">35%</a> drop in the economy, certain to afflict all public spending, capital and current.</p> <p>Even the most insensitive politician could tell you that a new high-speed train from Birmingham to London, not due for over a decade, is hardly a priority. Every other service and project must pass through the valley of the shadow of death. Why on earth not HS2? In such circumstances, some sense of priorities should surely prevail. Hence the frantic desire of HS2, its suppliers and lobbyists to maintain momentum and put their project beyond all further doubt. </p> <p>In an effort to explain his decision, Stephenson grasped at the nearest cliche and declared he \u201ccannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country\u201d. But London to Birmingham covers the most prosperous counties in Britain. It is nothing to do with levelling anywhere, and certainly not the north. If he meant it, he should build an urgently needed railway from Yorkshire to Lancashire, or boost Manchester\u2019s dire commuter services. Or if this is about vital infrastructure, why is Stephenson ignoring London\u2019s Crossrail?

      "bodyText": "It is beyond cynical. Almost every business in Britain is in lockdown. Shops are shut, factories padlocked, firms bankrupted, millions pushed into short- or long-term unemployment. They are told by the cabinet, \u201cWe are all in this together.\u201d No we are not. Somewhere contractors are popping the champagne and consultants carting their fees to the bank. These are not medical suppliers, care home operators or testing centres. They are not the broken-backed small businesses to whose half-hearted aid the Treasury still fails to come. The lucky ones are the backers of Boris Johnson\u2019s beloved HS2. On Wednesday notices to proceed were posted in the industry press to Costain, Balfour Beatty, McAlpine and others. They should all get back to work, subject only to \u201csocial distancing\u201d. Work at the closed Euston site should resume next week. The \u201cminister for HS2\u201d, Andrew Stephenson, said he wanted to offer those working on the project \u201ccertainty at a time when they need it\u201d. If worried about lockdown, they shouldn\u2019t be. The poor dears should resume their works. Rome might burn, but Nero did not want his Colosseum to run late. Countless megaprojects \u2013 in housing, distribution, retail and construction generally \u2013 would dearly love such reassurance. This is not only because, alone in Europe, the British government refuses to give details of how it intends to end lockdown, so that businesses might at least plan. There is worry also over the wider impact of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s warning of an astonishing 35% drop in the economy, certain to afflict all public spending, capital and current. Even the most insensitive politician could tell you that a new high-speed train from Birmingham to London, not due for over a decade, is hardly a priority. Every other service and project must pass through the valley of the shadow of death. Why on earth not HS2? In such circumstances, some sense of priorities should surely prevail. Hence the frantic desire of HS2, its suppliers and lobbyists to maintain momentum and put their project beyond all further doubt. In an effort to explain his decision, Stephenson grasped at the nearest cliche and declared he \u201ccannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country\u201d. But London to Birmingham covers the most prosperous counties in Britain. It is nothing to do with levelling anywhere, and certainly not the north. If he meant it, he should build an urgently needed railway from Yorkshire to Lancashire, or boost Manchester\u2019s dire commuter services. Or if this is about vital infrastructure, why is Stephenson ignoring London\u2019s Crossrail? It is surely more crucial for London\u2019s recovery. Stephenson\u2019s decision is nothing to do with levelling. It has to do with the extraordinary power that lobbies continue to exert over ministers, even in time of crisis. HS2 has been feasting on billions of government pounds, now possibly at risk. There was a time when Johnson would have favoured Crossrail as London\u2019s mayor. When he arrived at Downing Street, he clearly sought a new love. As his eye roamed the Treasury harem it lighted on a more voluptuous project, HS2. Poor Crossrail.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Donald Trump claimed he had \u201ctotal authority\u201d when it came to reopening the US for business. But on Thursday he handed that supposed authority back to state governors, as he laid out his administration\u2019s guidelines for a gradual return to something like normalcy. The federal plan calls for three distinct phases in lifting the lockdown, but while the president described them as \u201cscience-based\u201d, the guidelines remain full of ambiguities, says David Smith. In a virtual meeting of the G7 on Thursday, Trump was left isolated as other western leaders voiced their support for the World Health Organization. The White House has ordered a hold on US funding for the global body over claims it is too \u201cChina-centric\u201d, yet diplomats say it is unclear what specific reforms the president is demanding. Governors\u2019 coronavirus performance \u2026 ranked! The responses of different states to Covid-19 have varied wildly. Daniel Strauss and Maanvi Singh assess which governors have performed best and worst in the crisis. Ivanka doesn\u2019t stay at home. The president\u2019s daughter and her family flouted federal social distancing guidelines and traveled to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey to celebrate Passover. The White House defended the trip, saying Ms Trump considers the club \u201ca family home\u201d. China\u2019s economy shrank, but the Wuhan death count rose Now that it is apparently through the worst of the disease itself, China is reeling from the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The country\u2019s economy shrank by 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020 \u2013 the first such contraction in its history. Meanwhile, the death toll in Wuhan, the city where the virus originated, has been revised up by 50%, from 2,579 to 3,869. Officials said the discrepancy was the result of patients who died at home before reaching hospital, as well as late and inaccurate reporting. Elsewhere in the world \u2026 Bolsonaro is leading Brazil \u2018to the slaughterhouse\u2019 with his non-response to the pandemic, his predecessor Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva tells Tom Phillips, saying the president ought to be removed from office. Singapore\u2019s overlooked infection risk. Praised for its early pandemic response, the city-state is now facing a surge in transmission among migrant workers living in cramped accommodation. Belarus crowdfunds its coronavirus response. The country\u2019s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, has dismissed the pandemic as a \u201cpsychosis\u201d, leaving volunteers to prop up its fragile healthcare system. \u2018Coronavirus profiteers\u2019 are getting billions in bailouts Environmental leaders have suggested the current crisis could present an opportunity to tackle the climate crisis and create a more sustainable world. But so far it is polluters who seem to be benefiting, with the fossil fuel, motor, aviation, farming, plastic and timber industries using the pandemic to get billions of dollars in bailouts and to weaken or delay environmental protections, as the Guardian\u2019s environment editor, Damian Carrington, reports. Empty planes. Though more than eight in 10 flights have been canceled, US airlines are still flying near-empty planes across the country, in what one expert describes as a \u201chuge environmental waste\u201d. More from the Guardian\u2019s Covid-19 coverage: Ten nurses were suspended in Santa Monica, California, after refusing to care for Covid-19 patients without the crucial N-95 masks that the hospital had failed to provide. Far-right groups took part in an anti-lockdown protest in Michigan on Wednesday, and are organising similar protests against the stay-at-home measures in several other states. US food banks are facing budget shortfalls of millions of dollars as they struggle to keep up with demand from those affected by the tidal wave of lockdown layoffs. In other news\u2026 Roger Stone won\u2019t get a new trial. The longtime Trump adviser and self-described dirty trickster had accused the jury forewoman in his case of being tainted by anti-Trump political bias, but a judge said there was \u201czero evidence\u201d for his claim. Netflix is now worth more than ExxonMobil. The streaming giant\u2019s share price surpassed that of Disney on Wednesday and grew by another 5% on Thursday, taking its market value to $196bn. ExxonMobil, once the world\u2019s most valuable company, is now worth a mere $166bn. A Saudi princess was jailed without charge in Riyadh. Princess Basmah, an outspoken human rights advocate and cousin of Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, claimed on Twitter that she has been detained at al-Ha\u2019ir prison since March 2019, and that her health was now \u201cvery critical\u201d.

Opinion: coronavirus discriminates, just like people Those most vulnerable to coronavirus suffer from pre-existing conditions that are not just medical, but social, political and economic.

Havers and Patricia Hodge will play the formerly married couple Elyot and Amanda who are horrified to re-encounter each other on honeymoon with their new partners.</p> <p>Surprisingly, it is Havers\u2019s debut in a Coward play on stage. He has previous starred in a TV adaptation of Bon Voyage and recorded a BBC radio version of Brief Encounter, which Coward based on his play Still Life.</p> <p>The Private Lives tour is produced by David Pugh, who says his suggestion last year that Havers form a theatre company was met \u201cwith a wry smile\u201d by the actor. \u201cBut he warmed to the idea and finally agreed that he would take 18 weeks out each year to tour a play.\u201d He said Havers agreed, \u201cas long as the play is entertaining and, most importantly, ticket prices are accessible to as many people as possible\u201d.</p> <p>Theatres around the UK are currently closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pugh said that when they reopen, \u201cwe have to realise theatre can no longer be the luxury item it so often is. Theatre should be able to be seen by and be for everybody. Ticket pricing and ticketing charges have become ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Private Lives will be directed by Christopher Luscombe.

      "bodyText": "The actor Nigel Havers has launched a touring theatre company and plans to open its inaugural production of No\u00ebl Coward\u2019s 1930 comedy Private Lives this autumn. Havers and Patricia Hodge will play the formerly married couple Elyot and Amanda who are horrified to re-encounter each other on honeymoon with their new partners. Surprisingly, it is Havers\u2019s debut in a Coward play on stage. He has previous starred in a TV adaptation of Bon Voyage and recorded a BBC radio version of Brief Encounter, which Coward based on his play Still Life. The Private Lives tour is produced by David Pugh, who says his suggestion last year that Havers form a theatre company was met \u201cwith a wry smile\u201d by the actor. \u201cBut he warmed to the idea and finally agreed that he would take 18 weeks out each year to tour a play.\u201d He said Havers agreed, \u201cas long as the play is entertaining and, most importantly, ticket prices are accessible to as many people as possible\u201d. Theatres around the UK are currently closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Pugh said that when they reopen, \u201cwe have to realise theatre can no longer be the luxury item it so often is. Theatre should be able to be seen by and be for everybody. Ticket pricing and ticketing charges have become ridiculous.\u201d Private Lives will be directed by Christopher Luscombe. The tour is scheduled to open at Theatre Royal Bath on 1 October and will tour to venues including Norwich Theatre Royal, Newcastle Theatre Royal and the Grand in Leeds.",

Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company\u2019s early days, and it\u2019s now deeply woven into the firm\u2019s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607065/always-day-one-by-alex-kantrowitz/\">writes</a>, \u201cday one\u201d means \u201cinventing like a startup\u201d \u2013 a call for continual improvement and innovation.

For Bezos, \u201cday two\u201d is another name for<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders\"> death</a>.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon\u2019s growth, it\u2019s reasonable to think that its \u201cday one\u201d mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/15/amazon-jeff-bezos-gains-24bn-coronavirus-pandemic\">Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos grows fortune by $24bn amid coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And the Covid-19 outbreak hasn\u2019t slowed Amazon down. Quite the opposite: even as other businesses have downsized or shuttered, Amazon has proved remarkably well-placed to capitalise on these new circumstances, with customers spending a reported $11,000 (\u00a38,845) a second on its products and services. As lockdown orders have trapped people indoors, many are turning to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/12/amazon-to-take-almost-50-percent-of-us-e-commerce-market-by-years-end.html\">home</a> deliveries via Amazon, bolstering the importance of a company that has already captured nearly 50% of the US e-commerce market. To keep up with increased customer demand, the company plans to<a href=\"https://blog.aboutamazon.com/operations/amazon-opening-100000-new-roles\"> hire</a> 100,000 new workers. Despite being a commercial entity, Amazon increasingly looks like a public utility. It has even partnered with the<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-cornavirus-canada-amazon/canada-signs-agreement-with-amazon-canada-to-distribute-medical-equipment-idUSKBN21L2MO\"> Canadian</a> government to distribute medical equipment, and with the<a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/coronavirus-home-test-delivery/\"> UK</a> government to deliver at-home testing kits. Indeed, it may be one of the few retailers to<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/4/10/21215953/amazon-fresh-walmart-grocery-delivery-coronavirus-retail-store-closures\"> emerge</a> from this pandemic stronger than before.</p> <p>But despite the outward success, Amazon\u2019s embrace of ceaseless invention has come at a cost. In the absence of a strong ethical code, the ruthlessness that makes Amazon so successful for its shareholders can become indistinguishable from cruelty toward those who are not counted in its success metrics. Amazon itself may be flourishing during the coronavirus pandemic, but not all Amazonians are benefiting equally.</p> <p>As customers turn to delivery services such as Amazon out of fear of contracting the virus, the risks appear to have merely been shifted on to workers. A warehouse worker in New York state organised a walkout last month to protest what he alleged were the company\u2019s inadequate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">safety</a> measures, including its lack of paid sick leave, and was fired; a leaked<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\"> memo</a> indicated that Amazon\u2019s general counsel wanted to depict him as \u201cnot smart or articulate\u201d in their PR strategy (the executive who made this remark later published a statement that read \u201cI let my emotions draft my words and get the better of me\u201d).</p> <p>Amazon\u2019s poor treatment of its frontline workers \u2013 both during this crisis and beforehand \u2013 illustrates the dark side of the \u201cday one\u201d mentality.

For Amazon, collateral damage appears irrelevant as long as there\u2019s a steady flow of workers walking through the doors every morning.</p> <p>That Amazon is evidently not accountable to its workers should raise the question of who Amazon <em>is </em>accountable to.

Of the shares held by employees, ownership is heavily concentrated among early employees in executive roles.

Imagine instead, if that \u201cday one\u201d spirit were directed toward the socioeconomic system that subordinated these workers in the first place, such that the fruits of their labour were shared more equitably. Day two might not be that terrifying after all. Wendy Liu is a former computer programmer based in San Francisco. Her first book, Abolish Silicon Valley, is out now",

He did indeed have a fever. Left unmentioned, however, was his persistent cough: an unmistakeable splutter. During cabinet video conferences the prime minister\u2019s symptoms were painfully evident. They confirmed the growing seriousness of his condition. One source suggested the prime minister was coughing up blood. Not true, Downing Street said.</p> \n<p>Covid-19 can take different forms. Many people who catch it scarcely notice. Others grow critically ill. Those with even moderate symptoms can experience chest pains, headaches, cold spasms and extreme fatigue. The disease is novel. Clinical experts agree that the most dangerous phase is week two. Then patients generally start to recover. But some precipitously crash, as the virus attacks the lungs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e8a5d369-ef41-4b4a-adf8-f34313e47e32\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Symptoms are defined by the NHS as either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you've started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should&nbsp;<b>stay at home for at least 7 days</b>.<br></p>\n    <p>If you live with other people,&nbsp;<b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p>After 14 days, anyone you live with who does not have symptoms can return to their normal routine.

St Thomas\u2019 hospital \u2013 just across the Thames from Downing Street \u2013 began making preparations to admit the prime minister.</p> \n<p>According to one source, staff were told his condition was significantly worse than had been publicly admitted \u2013 really bad, in fact. And that he was likely to need oxygen support.</p> \n<p>Inside Downing Street, Johnson was in contact with his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and his GP. Many of his usual advisers were themselves off sick, with Dominic Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/dominic-cummings-self-isolates-after-experiencing-coronavirus-symptoms\">at home </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/dominic-cummings-self-isolates-after-experiencing-coronavirus-symptoms\">self-isolating</a> and the director of communications, Lee Cain, away. As Johnson\u2019s condition steadily worsened, phone calls were cut down, government papers trimmed. His approach to his illness was characteristically upbeat: he would vanquish it.</p> \n<p>Stories of Johnson\u2019s decline were now circulating among Tory backbenchers and journalists. Downing Street insisted these whispers were wrong. In hindsight, this guidance seems misleading.</p> \n<p>The rumours were loosely right: the prime minister was seriously unwell, more than admitted. Perhaps Johnson was minimising how bad he was feeling, even to those in his inner circle? </p> \n<p>At 8pm that evening the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/pots-pans-passion-britons-clap-their-support-for-nhs-workers-again\">prime minister emerged on the steps of No 11</a>, to clap for NHS workers. He looked terrible.</p> \n<p>The next day, Friday 3 April, Johnson recorded a video in which he urged the public to stay at home during the forthcoming sunny weekend. He said he still had a temperature and was staying in isolation. It was day eight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a01fe6-79ff-49a8-89ef-f39231b8bcc6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Q6jmZ7RLDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In fact, Johnson was sinking in classic Covid-19 fashion.</p> \n<p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n<p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n<p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n<p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b11b0cb6-8ac7-43ab-b509-0911c14f49ad\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbpphDSk9kw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)</p> \n<p>On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">got significantly worse</a>. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n<p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>. His aides were knocked over, distraught.</p> \n<p>Typically, Covid-19 patients in ICU are put on ventilators. This is an invasive and traumatic process. Some hospitals prefer to treat severe cases with a continuous positive airway pressure ventilator (Cpap). St Thomas\u2019, however, favours full ventilation, believing this is how you save people, specialists say.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82b4fa31802d47dc1a9acbceff43bf6ff0e06e3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82b4fa31802d47dc1a9acbceff43bf6ff0e06e3b/0_228_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign of support for Johnson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign of support for Johnson.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One source inside the hospital said Johnson was \u201cvery sick\u201d when taken into ICU. \u201cIt was touch and go whether he would be put on a ventilator,\u201d the source said.</p> \n<p>The same source, however, wonders whether the prime minister really should have been in intensive care.</p> \n<p>About 130 other patients were in critical care at the time, the vast majority hooked up to ventilators. At no point was Johnson on a ventilator. Nor did he receive Cpap, a less invasive form of treatment.</p> \n<p>The source said: \u201cBefore the coronavirus crisis you could be in ICU without being on a ventilator but pretty much every bed is now taken by a coronavirus patient with a ventilator. I know people who work in ICU and I know the technicians who prepare all the equipment and they all say he was not put on a ventilator. He was taking up an ICU bed when he didn\u2019t need it. The idea that you would put a patient who didn\u2019t need a ventilator on an ICU bed is nonsense.\u201d</p> \n<p>Weighed against this was the fact that Johnson \u2013 who is 55 \u2013 fitted the pattern of other serious male cases. As a second source put it bluntly: \u201cThey have a very low threshold for people of his profile (over 50, fat). If they don\u2019t get a tube in early it makes it much harder to do later on, if he deteriorates further.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98cb05e90baf8ebd27cd4d48f4452ff85f8735f1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98cb05e90baf8ebd27cd4d48f4452ff85f8735f1/0_281_4211_2526/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Johnson spent seven nights in St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back in Whitehall, a new protocol for briefing on the prime minister\u2019s health was set up. Only limited updates from St Thomas\u2019 would be passed on. Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-not-on-a-ventilator-in-intensive-care-says-gove\">stable and being monitored</a>, No 10 said.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday 8 April there was tentative good news. Johnson was still not on a ventilator. \u201cIf they don\u2019t go on one in the first 48 hours of being in ICU it\u2019s usually a good sign,\u201d the second source said. At the daily briefing the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed the prime minister was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/boris-johnson-improving-sitting-up-bed-chancellor-says-coronavirus\">sitting up and engaging positively</a>. According to hospital insiders, he was reverting to his old self. \u201cHe\u2019s charming all the nurses, insisting they call him \u2018Boris\u2019,\u201d one reported.</p> \n<p>After three days in intensive care he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">moved </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/09/boris-johnson-moved-from-intensive-care-but-stays-in-hospital\">on to a general ward</a>. Downing Street said he was in extremely good spirits and \u201cenormously grateful\u201d for the care he\u2019d received.</p> \n<p>Symonds tweeted a painting of a rainbow with 26 clapping emojis. There were grim questions still, such as how long would his recuperation last and had the virus caused long-term damage to his health and lung capacity?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/carriesymonds/status/1248324820653260800\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f <a href=\"https://t.co/83HkS1Vjhx\">pic.twitter.com/83HkS1Vjhx</a></p>\u2014 Carrie Symonds (@carriesymonds) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carriesymonds/status/1248324820653260800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>By Easter weekend Johnson was keen to go home. His medical team counselled caution. According to one source they advised him to stay in a little longer, until 14 April. Johnson prevailed.</p> \n<p>At midday on Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">he was discharged</a>, following seven nights in hospital, three of them in intensive care.</p> \n<p>Hours later, Johnson appeared in a video message sent from Chequers, his prime ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire. It was vintage Johnson.

He looked pale but well enough to go for a stroll. Most ICU patients leave hospital in a wheelchair. They suffer from exhaustion, muscle wastage and other chronic problems.

Clinical experts agree that the most dangerous phase is week two. Then patients generally start to recover. But some precipitously crash, as the virus attacks the lungs. By 2 April, doctors were worried that in Johnson\u2019s case, the infection was taking this second, ominous path. St Thomas\u2019 hospital \u2013 just across the Thames from Downing Street \u2013 began making preparations to admit the prime minister. According to one source, staff were told his condition was significantly worse than had been publicly admitted \u2013 really bad, in fact. And that he was likely to need oxygen support. Inside Downing Street, Johnson was in contact with his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and his GP. Many of his usual advisers were themselves off sick, with Dominic Cummings at home self-isolating and the director of communications, Lee Cain, away. As Johnson\u2019s condition steadily worsened, phone calls were cut down, government papers trimmed. His approach to his illness was characteristically upbeat: he would vanquish it. Stories of Johnson\u2019s decline were now circulating among Tory backbenchers and journalists. Downing Street insisted these whispers were wrong. In hindsight, this guidance seems misleading. The rumours were loosely right: the prime minister was seriously unwell, more than admitted. Perhaps Johnson was minimising how bad he was feeling, even to those in his inner circle? At 8pm that evening the prime minister emerged on the steps of No 11, to clap for NHS workers. He looked terrible. The next day, Friday 3 April, Johnson recorded a video in which he urged the public to stay at home during the forthcoming sunny weekend. He said he still had a temperature and was staying in isolation. It was day eight. In fact, Johnson was sinking in classic Covid-19 fashion. By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant and self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d. In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert. The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes. At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday. It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.) On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition got significantly worse. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street. At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians sent him good wishes. His aides were knocked over, distraught. Typically, Covid-19 patients in ICU are put on ventilators. This is an invasive and traumatic process. Some hospitals prefer to treat severe cases with a continuous positive airway pressure ventilator (Cpap). St Thomas\u2019, however, favours full ventilation, believing this is how you save people, specialists say. One source inside the hospital said Johnson was \u201cvery sick\u201d when taken into ICU. \u201cIt was touch and go whether he would be put on a ventilator,\u201d the source said. The same source, however, wonders whether the prime minister really should have been in intensive care. About 130 other patients were in critical care at the time, the vast majority hooked up to ventilators. At no point was Johnson on a ventilator. Nor did he receive Cpap, a less invasive form of treatment. The source said: \u201cBefore the coronavirus crisis you could be in ICU without being on a ventilator but pretty much every bed is now taken by a coronavirus patient with a ventilator. I know people who work in ICU and I know the technicians who prepare all the equipment and they all say he was not put on a ventilator. He was taking up an ICU bed when he didn\u2019t need it. The idea that you would put a patient who didn\u2019t need a ventilator on an ICU bed is nonsense.\u201d Weighed against this was the fact that Johnson \u2013 who is 55 \u2013 fitted the pattern of other serious male cases. As a second source put it bluntly: \u201cThey have a very low threshold for people of his profile (over 50, fat). If they don\u2019t get a tube in early it makes it much harder to do later on, if he deteriorates further.\u201d Back in Whitehall, a new protocol for briefing on the prime minister\u2019s health was set up. Only limited updates from St Thomas\u2019 would be passed on. Johnson was stable and being monitored, No 10 said. On Wednesday 8 April there was tentative good news. Johnson was still not on a ventilator. \u201cIf they don\u2019t go on one in the first 48 hours of being in ICU it\u2019s usually a good sign,\u201d the second source said. At the daily briefing the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed the prime minister was sitting up and engaging positively. According to hospital insiders, he was reverting to his old self. \u201cHe\u2019s charming all the nurses, insisting they call him \u2018Boris\u2019,\u201d one reported. After three days in intensive care he was moved on to a general ward. Downing Street said he was in extremely good spirits and \u201cenormously grateful\u201d for the care he\u2019d received. Symonds tweeted a painting of a rainbow with 26 clapping emojis. There were grim questions still, such as how long would his recuperation last and had the virus caused long-term damage to his health and lung capacity? By Easter weekend Johnson was keen to go home. His medical team counselled caution. According to one source they advised him to stay in a little longer, until 14 April. Johnson prevailed. At midday on Sunday, he was discharged, following seven nights in hospital, three of them in intensive care. Hours later, Johnson appeared in a video message sent from Chequers, his prime ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire. It was vintage Johnson. Dressed in a suit and tie, he declared the NHS had saved his life \u201cno question\u201d. He paid tribute to two nurses who had watched over him for 48 hours in intensive care when \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d \u2013 Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal. He said their care was \u201cthe reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen\u201d. Johnson had experienced a scare, no doubt about that. One specialist said he thought the prime minister had gilded the lily a bit \u2013 \u201cI suspect there\u2019s been an element of poetic licence there\u201d \u2013 but at the same time stressed that he did need oxygen, albeit through a face mask rather than Cpap or full mechanical ventilation. The specialist did not begrudge Johnson being put into ICU, reasoning \u201che\u2019s the prime minister\u201d, and \u201cwithout that oxygen he would not have got better\u201d. The saga had a curious footnote. Photographs taken from a public footpath showed Johnson and Symonds walking with their dog in the grounds of Chequers, the prime minister bundled up in a duffel coat and gloves. He looked pale but well enough to go for a stroll. Most ICU patients leave hospital in a wheelchair. They suffer from exhaustion, muscle wastage and other chronic problems. The prime minister appears to be in much better shape. Johnson won the 2016 EU referendum by combining support for the NHS \u2013 the UK\u2019s unofficial religion \u2013 with soft nationalism and Brexit. Whatever mistakes have been made over the pandemic, Johnson now has another winning political formula to silence his critics: without the NHS I wouldn\u2019t be here.",

This is a world where carers are going to work without protective equipment, the government has only just announced widespread <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-death-toll-in-englands-care-homes-reaches-1400\">testing for care home residents</a>, and care home deaths in England are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/care-homes-coronavirus-why-we-dont-know-true-uk-death-toll\">not even included</a> in the official count.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As soon as someone needs help to live, the expectation of what it means for them to live a good life drops dramatically</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the hardest-to-hear stories of this pandemic are emerging from the care sector. There\u2019s been so much coverage of the awful decisions that doctors may have to face in rationing scarce intensive care beds. But over in social care, managers and staff have been grappling with impossible moral dilemmas for weeks with scant guidance. How do you prevent coronavirus spreading to those whom it\u2019s most likely to kill when you are sending staff without protective equipment from home to home to assist more than a dozen people a day with intimate tasks such as washing and eating? Do you allow relatives into a care home <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/how-care-homes-are-helping-loved-ones-say-goodbye-coronavirus\">to say goodbye</a> to their loved one or is the risk to other residents too great? What do you tell those at the local hospital who want to discharge patients into your care who haven\u2019t been tested, potentially jeopardising the lives of the people who already live there?</p> <p>It is a welcome development to see the care sector thrust into the spotlight for once, dominating the recent Downing Street press conferences. Here\u2019s hoping that it leads to decades-old calls for social care to be properly funded and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-social-care-crisis-andy-burnham-nhs\">integrated into the NHS</a> finally getting some traction. But rather than pretending this is just a case of an urgently needed policy fix unaccountably languishing at the bottom of to-do lists, we need to confront that it is a symptom of something deeply wrong with the way we think about ageing.</p> <p>This pandemic is lifting the carpet on some hard societal truths long swept out of sight. One of the most brilliant scientific advances of the last century has been the stretching of human lifespans; one of the least edifying aspects of collective human behaviour has been our failure to adapt to its downside: people contending with longer spells of physical and mental decline in the last years of their lives.</p> <p>Just because you have dementia does not mean you cannot feel joy and love; just because you need help to wash and dress does not make you incapable of richly stimulating conversation. But the way we talk about, think about and organise older care has become utterly dominated by the management of decline. As soon as someone needs help to live, the expectation of what it means for them to live a good life drops dramatically. We adopt a primitive baseline against which to judge whether we are meeting our societal obligation to our elders, and then we fail even at that: an estimated <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-press/articles/2019/november/the-number-of-older-people-with-some-unmet-need-for-care-now-stands-at-1.5-million/\">1.5 million older people</a> are doing without the help they need with everyday tasks such as washing and dressing.</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to grow old in a world where it\u2019s considered to be enough if I\u2019m free from physical harm in my last few years.

      "bodyText": "\u201cHave a badge.\u201d The latest initiative of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to boost the status of care workers has been widely mocked, not because it\u2019s an innately bad idea \u2013 care workers report being turned away from shopping slots reserved for health and emergency staff \u2013 but because it seems like such an utterly incidental gesture. This is a world where carers are going to work without protective equipment, the government has only just announced widespread testing for care home residents, and care home deaths in England are not even included in the official count. Some of the hardest-to-hear stories of this pandemic are emerging from the care sector. There\u2019s been so much coverage of the awful decisions that doctors may have to face in rationing scarce intensive care beds. But over in social care, managers and staff have been grappling with impossible moral dilemmas for weeks with scant guidance. How do you prevent coronavirus spreading to those whom it\u2019s most likely to kill when you are sending staff without protective equipment from home to home to assist more than a dozen people a day with intimate tasks such as washing and eating? Do you allow relatives into a care home to say goodbye to their loved one or is the risk to other residents too great? What do you tell those at the local hospital who want to discharge patients into your care who haven\u2019t been tested, potentially jeopardising the lives of the people who already live there? It is a welcome development to see the care sector thrust into the spotlight for once, dominating the recent Downing Street press conferences. Here\u2019s hoping that it leads to decades-old calls for social care to be properly funded and integrated into the NHS finally getting some traction. But rather than pretending this is just a case of an urgently needed policy fix unaccountably languishing at the bottom of to-do lists, we need to confront that it is a symptom of something deeply wrong with the way we think about ageing. This pandemic is lifting the carpet on some hard societal truths long swept out of sight. One of the most brilliant scientific advances of the last century has been the stretching of human lifespans; one of the least edifying aspects of collective human behaviour has been our failure to adapt to its downside: people contending with longer spells of physical and mental decline in the last years of their lives. Just because you have dementia does not mean you cannot feel joy and love; just because you need help to wash and dress does not make you incapable of richly stimulating conversation. But the way we talk about, think about and organise older care has become utterly dominated by the management of decline. As soon as someone needs help to live, the expectation of what it means for them to live a good life drops dramatically. We adopt a primitive baseline against which to judge whether we are meeting our societal obligation to our elders, and then we fail even at that: an estimated 1.5 million older people are doing without the help they need with everyday tasks such as washing and dressing. I don\u2019t want to grow old in a world where it\u2019s considered to be enough if I\u2019m free from physical harm in my last few years. But this cultural more will be stubborn to shift because it is a function of the pervasive ageism that runs through society. Like all prejudice, ageism is inculcated from a young age. But what distinguishes ageism from other prejudices is that what we seem to recoil at, what we ultimately are all fearful of, is what we will all one day \u2013 if we\u2019re lucky \u2013 become. Its consequences are ruinous: partly because there is growing evidence that as we take our own ageism with us into older age, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; researchers believe older people who themselves buy into negative stereotypes about ageing are more likely to suffer ill health, for example. But also because that fear and prejudice runs through every aspect of how we care for older people. Caring is mischaracterised as low-skilled work \u2013 a misnomer, as anyone who has ever observed a carer at work will know \u2013 partly because it is feminised labour. But also because it is so often conceived of as a series of physical tasks rather than the emotionally tough but potentially incredibly rewarding job it is. The psychoanalyst Isabel Menzies Lyth observed in the 1950s that hospitals organised nursing the sick and dying as a series of fragmented physical tasks, the same task repetitively performed for many patients, each patient cared for by several different nurses, in order to protect the nurses from the emotional stress of death and loss.

Too much of this ill-conceived approach lingers in how we conceive of care 70 years later. In a world where pitifully paid care workers are expected to zip in and out of homes in short slots that force them to choose between washing and feeding, it is a miracle that they have not evolved into an army of emotionally dead robots in the interests of self-preservation. That\u2019s the tragedy of the badge. It gently hints at a cultural revolution we so desperately need: to see care work as enabling people to live a life filled with joy and love, and to compensate and value that work accordingly.

      "bodyText": "Welcome to our weekly roundup of developments in the coronavirus pandemic that continues to have shattering consequences around the world. As the pandemic exceeded the grim milestone of 2 million confirmed cases, new diplomatic rows broke out, economic activity has slumped and as some countries move tentatively to relax restrictions others are seeing resurgences in case numbers. US overtakes Italy as country with most deaths The US has suffered more confirmed coronavirus deaths than any other country, and on Friday had reached nearly 35,000 fatalities, with Italy being the second worst affected country with 22,000. China revised the death toll in Wuhan, the hardest hit city in the country where the virus first emerged, up by 50%, to 3,869 from 2,579, citing the addition of patients who had died at home and the late or inaccurate reporting of some hospital deaths. Globally, the number of confirmed cases has doubled in 13 days. The actual number of cases is assumed to be far higher than the official figures suggest, with countries varying in how extensively they are testing and a growing awareness that many people may experience few or no symptoms. Trump halts World Health Organization funding Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the US would freeze payments to the World Health Organization (WHO) for 60 to 90 days over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He accused the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat, even though it declared a public health emergency on 30 January \u2013 after which Trump continued to hold rallies and compared the coronavirus to seasonal flu. Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary general, criticised the move, saying now was \u201cnot the time to reduce the resources for the operations of the World Health Organization or any other humanitarian organisation in the fight against the virus\u201d, in a statement echoed by leading public health figures around the world. However, some said that, while the cut in funding was not justified, the WHO could have done more to scrutinise China\u2019s initial response to the outbreak. Sir John Sawers, former chief of the UK intelligence service, told the BBC that Beijing was not honest when the disease first surfaced and faced \u201canger\u201d from the international community. Pharma giants join forces to work on coronavirus vaccine GSK and Sanofi are two of the world\u2019s biggest vaccine companies \u2013 between them they probably have the largest vaccine manufacturing capability in the world. This week they announced an unprecedented move to join forces to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. Two companies of this size teaming up rather than competing is almost unheard of, but we are not living in normal times and the eventual market for a vaccine is essentially the entire global population. Both are bringing tried and tested vaccine technology to the table \u2013 Sanofi is contributing a protein-based vaccine that it already uses for seasonal flu and GSK is providing a so-called adjuvant, which can be added into a vaccine to boost the immune system\u2019s response. The effort is unlikely to be the first to get a vaccine approved \u2013 some teams already have candidates in phase 1 trials \u2013 but they are unique in having existing capacity to scale up to manufacture the hundreds of millions of doses that are likely to be required worldwide. Countries relax lockdowns, but experts say some form of social distancing may need to continue until 2022 Countries around the world are grappling with how to lift social distancing restrictions while avoiding an overwhelming surge in case numbers. In Europe, Denmark, among the first European countries to impose a lockdown in early March, has became the first to re-open schools this week. Austria has reopened thousands of smaller shops and said it will allow outdoor sport such as tennis, golf and athletics from May, Spain has allowed non-essential workers to go back to work and Italy has allowed bookshops and clothing stores to reopen. In the US, Donald Trump unveiled an 18-page plan for \u201cOpening Up America Again\u201d identifying the circumstances necessary for areas of the country to allow employees to start returning to work. However, scientists who have modelled how the pandemic might play out beyond the next few months have concluded that intermittent social distancing may be required until 2022. The paper, published in the journal Science, found that a one-time lockdown was unlikely to be sufficient to bring the pandemic under control and that secondary peaks could be larger than the current one without continued restrictions. The analysis said that additional measures such as a vaccine or treatments could reduce the need for lockdowns, but raised the prospect of resurgences of cases \u2013 and the potential need for intermittent cycles of social distancing until 2022. \u201cPredicting the end of the pandemic in the summer [of 2020] is not consistent with what we know about the spread of infections,\u201d said Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard and co-author of the study.",

On Friday, it reported 26 new confirmed cases, the lowest daily total in two weeks.</p> \n<p>Overall China has reported more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections from the coronavirus. Even as Chinese authorities over the past month have pushed to restart the economy, fears of new infections have forced some parts of the country to enact new restrictions. China has closed its borders to almost all foreigners arriving from abroad and limited international flights.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a3e9ca6-9c27-4eed-ba07-63828dd45a49\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1ELwVTWTnfc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Depressed demand from overseas is likely to hit the Chinese economy further. China\u2019s first-quarter contraction follows declines in 2019, when the Chinese economy expanded at its slowest pace in almost 30 years \u2013 the result of slowing consumption, a pullback on debt-fuelled growth and a protracted trade war with the US.</p> \n<p>Analysts polled by Reuters estimate China\u2019s yearly growth for 2020 will slow to 2.5% from 6.1% last year, the weakest pace since the last year of the Cultural Revolution.</p> \n<p>Friday\u2019s data showed that industrial output fell by 1.1% in March, a better-than- expected drop. Retail sales, a measure of consumption, fell 15.8%, steeper than predicted, while fixed asset investment, a gauge of spending on infrastructure projects, equipment and property, fell 16% in line with expectations.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Germany\u2019s health minister said the spread of the virus had become \u201ccontrollable\u201d as the number of infections sank to a new low, while Malaysia also reported its lowest daily increase since March, of 69 new cases. In Spain, the daily death toll was 585 on Friday, down from previous peaks of more than 900 in a day. Denmark said it would allow more businesses to open next week as restrictions are lifted, while the US announced a plan to reopen US states in phases.</p> \n<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday described the pandemic as a \u201cprofound anthropological shock\u201d. He told the Financial Times: \u201cWe have stopped half the planet to save lives, there are no precedents for that in our history. But it will change the nature of globalisation, with which we have lived for the past 40 years.\u201d</p> \n<p>Other developments in the coronavirus pandemic included:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Donald Trump unveiled a set of guidelines for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">reopening the US economy</a>, comprising of three phases but ultimately deferred to governors on when and how to return the states to normal.</p></li> \n <li><p>New Zealand recorded its lowest ever number of coronavirus cases, with only eight people found to be infected.</p></li> \n <li><p>The UN warned the pandemic risked turning into a child rights crisis.</p></li> \n <li><p>A third Japanese cabinet official tested positive for the virus, after the country expanded its state of emergency.</p></li> \n <li><p>India banned the use of the Zoom video conferencing app in government meetings, amid concerns about security.</p></li> \n</ul>",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s economy shrank 6.8% in the first three months of 2020, the country\u2019s first such contraction on record and a stark sign of the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The news came as Chinese authorities revised the death toll in Wuhan, the hardest-hit city and where the virus first emerged, up by 50%, to 3,869 from 2,579. The economic contraction, reported by China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics on Friday, comes after months of paralysis as the country went into lockdown to contain the virus, which emerged in central Hubei province in December. It has infected more than 2 million people globally and killed more than 140,000. While much of the rest of the world grapples with the virus, China appears to have overcome the worst of it. On Friday, it reported 26 new confirmed cases, the lowest daily total in two weeks. Overall China has reported more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections from the coronavirus. Even as Chinese authorities over the past month have pushed to restart the economy, fears of new infections have forced some parts of the country to enact new restrictions. China has closed its borders to almost all foreigners arriving from abroad and limited international flights. Depressed demand from overseas is likely to hit the Chinese economy further. China\u2019s first-quarter contraction follows declines in 2019, when the Chinese economy expanded at its slowest pace in almost 30 years \u2013 the result of slowing consumption, a pullback on debt-fuelled growth and a protracted trade war with the US. Analysts polled by Reuters estimate China\u2019s yearly growth for 2020 will slow to 2.5% from 6.1% last year, the weakest pace since the last year of the Cultural Revolution. Friday\u2019s data showed that industrial output fell by 1.1% in March, a better-than- expected drop. Retail sales, a measure of consumption, fell 15.8%, steeper than predicted, while fixed asset investment, a gauge of spending on infrastructure projects, equipment and property, fell 16% in line with expectations. On Friday, Germany\u2019s health minister said the spread of the virus had become \u201ccontrollable\u201d as the number of infections sank to a new low, while Malaysia also reported its lowest daily increase since March, of 69 new cases. In Spain, the daily death toll was 585 on Friday, down from previous peaks of more than 900 in a day. Denmark said it would allow more businesses to open next week as restrictions are lifted, while the US announced a plan to reopen US states in phases. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Thursday described the pandemic as a \u201cprofound anthropological shock\u201d. He told the Financial Times: \u201cWe have stopped half the planet to save lives, there are no precedents for that in our history. But it will change the nature of globalisation, with which we have lived for the past 40 years.\u201d Other developments in the coronavirus pandemic included: Donald Trump unveiled a set of guidelines for reopening the US economy, comprising of three phases but ultimately deferred to governors on when and how to return the states to normal. New Zealand recorded its lowest ever number of coronavirus cases, with only eight people found to be infected. The UN warned the pandemic risked turning into a child rights crisis. A third Japanese cabinet official tested positive for the virus, after the country expanded its state of emergency. India banned the use of the Zoom video conferencing app in government meetings, amid concerns about security.",

However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus.

People may have to wait up to four weeks [for a funeral], or use a crematorium in another area.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some cemeteries were considering digging graves in unused spaces, she said. \u201cHard decisions may have to be made.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eight out of 10 people who die in the UK are cremated, with 20% opting for burial. But some faith groups \u2013 notably Muslims and Jews \u2013 choose burial, creating additional pressure in areas where there are concentrations of those religions.</p> \n<p>Gardens of Peace, which runs two private Muslim cemeteries on the edge of east London, posted a notice on its website on 1 April saying there was already a backlog of burials and warning that \u201cwe may also have to undertake multiple burials in a grave\u201d.</p> \n<p>A paper on pandemic planning, published last month by the University of Huddersfield, warned that death and bereavement services were likely to be overwhelmed.

      "bodyText": "Backlogs at crematoria are building up in coronavirus hotspots, with some families facing a wait of several weeks before funerals can take place and pressure mounting on mortuary space. With pressure on the funeral services sector set to increase over the next two weeks as the death toll from Covid-19 reaches a peak, dozens of emergency mortuaries across the UK are starting to take delivery of bodies for storage until cremations or burials can take place. A temporary morgue with capacity for 12,000 bodies at Birmingham airport is due to be operational by the end of this week, and another is to open at Southampton airport. A facility at a warehouse on the Hillington industrial estate in Glasgow will be in use by Monday, and a morgue on the site of the former RAF Cottishall near Norwich will be operational in the next few days. \u201cBody handlers\u201d started work at a temporary mortuary in east London this week. The number of dead in London in the first week of April was up 160% on the average for previous years; in Birmingham, the number of deaths in the first two weeks of this month exceeded the total for April 2019. Julie Dunk of the Institute of Cemetery and Crematorium Management said the situation was \u201calready challenging\u201d in some areas. \u201cAll crematoria are looking to see how they can increase capacity, with longer working days and services at weekends. People may have to wait up to four weeks [for a funeral], or use a crematorium in another area.\u201d Some cemeteries were considering digging graves in unused spaces, she said. \u201cHard decisions may have to be made.\u201d Eight out of 10 people who die in the UK are cremated, with 20% opting for burial. But some faith groups \u2013 notably Muslims and Jews \u2013 choose burial, creating additional pressure in areas where there are concentrations of those religions. Gardens of Peace, which runs two private Muslim cemeteries on the edge of east London, posted a notice on its website on 1 April saying there was already a backlog of burials and warning that \u201cwe may also have to undertake multiple burials in a grave\u201d. A paper on pandemic planning, published last month by the University of Huddersfield, warned that death and bereavement services were likely to be overwhelmed. Based on research carried out last year, the paper listed among key challenges: delays in issuing death certificates; lack of equipment such as coffins, body bags and cremator ovens; a shortage of body storage space if funeral parlours, hospitals and mortuaries reach capacity; and a lack of cemetery space. It said that, with a 2.5% mortality rate, \u201cauthorities will struggle to maintain death registrations and disposals that will potentially have serious consequences. It suggested that \u201ccommon burials or \u2018mass graves\u2019 \u2026 may become necessary during a crisis\u201d, acknowledging \u201cpublic acceptance could not be guaranteed\u201d for such a move. Last week, it emerged that a mass grave had been dug in New York, which was being used for the burial of people with no known next of kin or whose families could not afford a funeral. Julia Meaton, one of the paper\u2019s authors, said mass graves in the UK were unlikely if temporary mortuaries were used to slow the pace of funerals to a manageable rate. \u201cI think as a nation we have enough capacity, but everything is devolved [to local authorities]. There is no national approach, no national strategy.\u201d The Deceased Management Advisory Group, an umbrella organisation for the death and bereavement services sector, is liaising with the government and local resilience forums, set up under the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004, which include emergency services, local authorities, the NHS, environment agency and others.

We need to ensure we need to keep the public\u2019s minds focused on staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.\u201d Johnson left St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London five days ago following treatment for coronavirus, which included 48 hours in intensive care, and has since been at Chequers. He has been walking in the grounds, and joined Thursday evening\u2019s mass applause for NHS and care staff. The spokesman said while Johnson had spoken once to Raab by phone, he was not receiving any official papers or talking to other world leaders: \u201cHe is continuing his recovery at Chequers, and he is not doing government work.\u201d Asked if the government should set out further details on how and when the lockdown could be eased, the spokesman stressed the need to continue to focus on social distancing. \u201cWe have set out the five tests which we believe need to be met in order for us to be able to consider relaxing some of the social distancing measures that are in place,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are at a critical point in our response to this pandemic and we do want people to remain focused upon that core message of needing to stay at home to reduce the transmission of this disease, and to save lives.\u201d A plan did exist, he insisted: \u201cWork is taking place across different parts of Whitehall in readiness for the point where we are able to relax the social distancing measures which we have in place.\u201d Raab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any change in policy: allow the NHS to cope; a sustained fall in the death rate; reduced wider rates of infection; a wider rollout of testing and protective medical equipment and sufficient evidence that reducing distancing measures would not cause a new virus peak. Johnson\u2019s spokesman said it would be up to the government\u2019s Sage scientific committee to advise when these points had been reached. However, he appeared to endorse the warning earlier on Friday from Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, that people should be wary of booking summer holidays. \u201cWhile we are making progress in the fight against coronavirus, we are not able to say with certainty the point at which the social distancing measures can be relaxed,\u201d he said, noting that travel within the UK for holidays was still not allowed.. \u201cAs of today it is a fact that both the guidelines and the official Foreign Office advice do not allow for people going on holidays,\u201d he said.",

That is worse than economists expected, with a Reuters poll having forecasted a contraction of -6.5%. </p> <p>But markets aren\u2019t fazed. Stocks in Asia shrugged off the news, with the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.7%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 3.1% and Australia\u2019s ASX up 1.8%. Europe is also called higher. </p> <p>Some investors seem more intrigued that American biotech firm Gilead may have found a potential drug to treat coronavirus. Others seem to be taking the view that the data could have been much, much worse. </p> <p>However, there is the age-old concern that the figures may not be telling the whole story, and many economists still question the reliability of China\u2019s data - especially when you drill down into indicators like retail sales, which were hammered after shops were ordered to close during the worst of the outbreak. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1251021593356222464\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/China?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#China</a> GDP declined 6.8% YoY in Q1 2020.

Thanks very much for reading. We\u2019ll be back on Monday. Stay safe and have a good weekend. -KM Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has held a virtual press conference with journalists today, where he called on UK banks to pick up the pace in getting state-backed loans to companies struggling through the coronavirus crisis. Reuters reports that Bailey said banks had to address the \u201cserious strain\u201d on their capacity to deal with a surge in demand for loans, and suggested risk assessments were too slow. He told reporters: Notwithstanding the stress that we\u2019re all operating under in terms of the current working environment, they have got to put their backs into it and get on with it, frankly. Commenting on the decision to extend the furlough scheme, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity. It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery. The Treasury has announced the extension of the UK\u2019s job furlough scheme, which will now run an extra month until the end of June to \u201creflect continuing social distancing measures\u201d The scheme, which allows firms to keep employees on the payroll with the government paying cash grants covering 80% of their wages up to \u00a32,500, was originally set for a three month period between March and the end of May. The Treasury said the Chancellor would \u201ckeep the scheme under review and extend it if necessary.\u201d Shares in Gilead Sciences are also pushing ahead, rising 10% or nearly $8 to $84.88 each. Wall Street is open for trading. Here\u2019s how major indexes are looking at the open: Dow is up +2.53% S&amp;P 500 is up +2.18% Nasdaq is up +1.58% NEWSFLASH: The competition watchdog has provisionally cleared Amazon\u2019s investment in food delivery company Deliveroo, which said its business would be at risk of collapse without the US retail giant\u2019s financial support. Amazon was the lead investor in a $575m (\u00a3442m) funding round, last year, which reportedly gave it a 16% stake in Deliveroo. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was originally concerned that the deal would threaten competition, by discouraging Amazon from entering the market on its own. But the watchdog said it had become clear that the pandemic and resulting lockdown were having a significant impact on the business, and that Deliveroo still relied on continued investment to operate: Deliveroo recently informed the CMA that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its business meant that it would fail financially and exit the market without the Amazon investment. Deliveroo\u2019s submission was supported by evidence from the company\u2019s financial advisers. The CMA said it was unlikely that other backers would be able to come to Deliveroo\u2019s rescue in the current climate, and concluded that the company\u2019s failure would be worse for the market than letting the Amazon investment go ahead. The watchdog is now consulting on its provisional ruling and is expected to make a final decision in June. More details about the Gilead Sciences trial that is boosting stock markets, from my colleague Rob Davies. Optimism surrounding a potential new treatment for Covid-19 has boosted the FTSE100 stock index, amid claims that a drug called remdesivir has spurred rapid recovery in 113 patients. A University of Chicago hospital participating in a study of the antiviral medication, made by US firm Gilead Sciences, reportedly found that nearly all patients suffering fever and respiratory symptoms were discharged within a week. The report, by healthcare publication Stat News, spurred hopes among investors that lockdowns around the world could be eased. The University of Chicago recruited 125 people into a clinical trial, according to the report, 113 of whom tested positive for Covid-19, with all of them receiving daily remdesivir doses. Two patients died but most of the rest have already been discharged after their symptoms eased significantly. In a video obtained by Stat News, Kathleen Mullane, the infectious disease specialist overseeing the study, said it was hard to draw conclusions because remdesivir is not being compared against results from a group taking a placebo drug. But certainly when we start [the] drug, we see fever curves falling. We have seen people come off ventilators a day after starting therapy. So, in that realm, overall our patients have done very well. Most of our patients are severe and most of them are leaving at six days, so that tells us duration of therapy doesn\u2019t have to be 10 days. We have very few that went out to 10 days, maybe three. You can read the full story here: NEWSFLASH (at least for the economic obsessives among us): The Office for National Statistics has said it will delay the release of GDP and retail sales data during the Covid-19 outbreak. The May release of GDP data will be delayed by one day, the June data by two days, according to Reuters. The ONS has said that the disruption caused by the pandemic mean they need a little extra time for quality assurance of some of their data before publication. European stocks have extended their gains amid optimism over the Gilead Sciences trials. The FTSE 100, which started the day up around 2.5% is now trading higher by around 3.5% The US drug company said to be developing a medicine that could help battle the coronavirus outbreak is set to open higher this afternoon. Gilead Sciences is up 12.5% in pre-market trading at around $86.38 per share, after reports suggested that its investigational drug remdesivir may be effective against Covid-19. But Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, has warned against getting too hopeful about its prospects: The report that set off the gains said that early data on Gilead\u2019s coronavirus medicine Remdesivir is \u2018very encouraging\u2019. The early data referred to is a clinical trial of 125 patients at the University of Chicago with coronavirus who were all given Remdesivir and have nearly all survived with a speedy recovery within a week. If we\u2019re playing devil\u2019s advocate to the bullish reaction \u2013 an important word here \u2018is \u2018early\u2019. It was a small trial and there was no control group so there\u2019s plenty of room for error. ITN, the producer of news for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, has furloughed staff, frozen senior manager and cut salaries for top bosses by 20% to manage costs during the coronavirus lockdown. Plans to furlough a \u201csmall number\u201d of staff will mainly impact the sport and commercial production departments, while some staff have been asked to work part-time. A company email to staff said: These talented and hardworking teams have been hardest hit simply because of the economic downturn in the sectors in which they work. Top management, including chief executive Anna Mallett and the ITN board, are to reduce their salaries by a fifth for the period of the government lockdown \u201cto help with the financial challenge\u201d. The cost saving measures also include a recruitment \u201cpause\u201d and halting investment in some projects. The appointment of BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investor, to carry out a study on potential new environmental rules for banks by the European Commission, faces scrutiny from members of the European Parliament. Three MEPs have written to the commission asking it how it intends to avoid a conflict of interest, given that BlackRock holds huge stakes in both fossil fuel companies and the banks. It comes after the Guardian reported that environmental campaigners were concerned about the potential conflict of interest. Urgewald said the appointment was \u201clike letting the fox guard the henhouse\u201d. The MEPs from the Greens/European Free Alliance \u2013 Rasmus Andresen, Monika Vana and Jutta Palus \u2013 asked the commission to also consider how BlackRock\u2019s control of stakes in power plant operators fitted with plans to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. BlackRock had $7.43tn (\u00a35.97tn) in assets under management on 31 December (before the coronavirus pandemic caused asset values to fall). The majority of those assets are in products that track equity and bond indices, meaning the company by default controls large stakes in many of the world\u2019s biggest companies. BlackRock previously told the Guardian that it was honoured to be selected by the commission. China\u2019s economy will do well to grow at all in 2020. That\u2019s the stark warning from Yue Su, an economist focusing on China at The Economist Intelligence Unit. She says China will continue to struggle this year as its trading partners around the world grapple with their own Covid-19 recessions. Su says: The GDP contraction in January-March will translate into permanent income losses, reflected in bankruptcies across small companies and job losses. In addition, the international spread of the pandemic will push the country\u2019s major trading partners into recession, leading to a slump in exports in the second quarter and knock-on impacts on domestic investment and employment. China\u2019s economy will do well to grow at all in 2020 as a whole. The stock market rally is set to continue stateside, with futures pointing to gains on Wall Street: Dow futures are up +2.7% S&amp;P 500 futures are up +2.4% Nasdaq futures are up +1.8% There\u2019s a growing expectation that China will cut its benchmark lending rate as early as Monday, following the 6.8% contraction in first quarter growth. A Reuters survey shows that all 52 traders and analysts polled are expecting a cut to China\u2019s Loan Prime Rate on Monday in order to reduce financing costs for companies that are struggling to get back on their feet after the pandemic. If their hunch is right, it would be the second cut to the benchmark so far this year. Jacqueline Rong, a senior China economist at BNP Paribas in Beijing, said: Judging from high frequency economic data and progress of work resumption in April, we believe the central bank will continue its easing stance for the time being despite some signs of loose liquidity in the banking system. Estate agency chain Foxtons has announced plans to raise \u00a322m through the creation of new shares to shore up its finances while the coronavirus crisis continues. The company, which has most of its branches in London, says the money will pay off existing credit and give it liquidity to weather a long lockdown followed by a slow recovery in the housing market. Soon after the lockdown began ministers said that people should not be buying and selling homes as usual, causing the market to almost grind to a halt. Agents are offering virtual property tours, but uncertainty over the economy is likely to deter potential buyers for some time to come. Foxtons said that in \u201ca reasonable worst case scenario period of lockdown restrictions in London until the end of August 2020\u201d revenues would be 78% lower than in the same period last year. The agency has taken steps to cut costs, including furloughing 750 employees and cutting salaries for those earning above \u00a340,000. It says 80% of those asked to take a cut had agreed. It has also told HMRC that it will delay paying February\u2019s tax and national insurance contributions on staff earnings for at least a month. DATA FLASH: Eurozone inflation slowed in March to 0.7% year-on-year, confirming earlier estimates. That compares to a 1.2% rise in February, and the European Central Bank\u2019s target of below but close to 2%. Time to catch up on Europe\u2019s car market and the news isn\u2019t pretty. Passenger car sales across the 27 EU states plunged 55.1% in March to to 567,308 vehicles, after the vast majority of European dealerships shuttered in the second half of the month as the coronavirus spread across the continent. That\u2019s according to data from the European Auto Industry Association (ACEA). Of the 27 EU markets, Italy was the hardest hit, with registrations falling by 85.4%. But demand also tumbled in France and Spain, falling 72.2% and 69.3%, respectively. The combined figure rises to 853,077 vehicles when you combine the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) together. In the UK alone, car sales tumbled 44.4% to 254,684 last month. The European stock rally is holding firm. Even on the FTSE 100 just six stocks are trading in negative territory, and the worst decline is no more than 2%. We\u2019ll see how long this keeps up... China\u2019s economic trajectory post-Covid-19 is being watched closely, with some hoping it can serve as a example of what to expect in the months ahead. But Hugh Briscoe, a global fixed income portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, says China is unlikely to be the best model for western nations who have taken a very different approach to handling the coronavirus outbreak. He says: Investors are focused on the pace at which economic activity will return to normal given China\u2019s prominence in the global economy; it is the world\u2019s largest trading partner. China\u2019s recovery is also being closely watched given its potential to serve as a template for growth paths elsewhere. However, there are several reasons to be wary of drawing parallels. First, China\u2019s covid-19 outbreak and in turn activity restrictions were largely confined to Wuhan. By contrast, mitigation measures in key advanced economies have been country-wide. Second, China\u2019s restrictions were more onerous; this influenced the progression of its virus outbreak and in turn the duration for which activity was curbed. Third, risks of a second wave of infections remain, with reported cases in China in recent weeks largely being imported. Nonetheless, epidemiological and economic developments in China are useful to monitor, even if their magnitudes differ from what we will likely observe in core markets such as the US, Euro area and UK. China has reported more than 3,000 deaths and 80,000 infections from the coronavirus. Even as Chinese authorities over the past month have pushed to restart the economy, fears of new infections have forced some parts of the country to enact new restrictions. China has closed its borders to almost all foreigners arriving from abroad and limited international flights. Depressed demand from overseas is likely to hit the Chinese economy further. China\u2019s first quarter contraction follows declines in 2019, which saw the Chinese economy expand at its slowest pace in almost 30 years, the result of slowing consumption, a pull back on debt-fuelled growth, and a protracted trade war with the US. Analysts polled by Reuters estimate China\u2019s yearly growth for 2020 will slow to 2.5% from 6.1% last year, the weakest pace since the last year of the Cultural Revolution. You can read Lily Kuo\u2019s full story here: But not every market is on the rise, with US crude futures falling to their lowest level since 2002 at $18.87. While some economies like Germany and Spain are testing the waters in sending citizens back to school or work, there seems to be some pessimism about how long the road will be for the US economy as a whole (as well as how effective the Opec+ production cut deal will be in the interim). And with over 22 million US residents now jobless, there are fears over the trajectory for US domestic demand. Despite initial excitement after Donald Trump released guidelines for how the US would re-open the economy, there were some important caveats that mean the president would ultimately defer to state governors on when and how to return their states to normal. Stephen Inness, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp says: Oil markets found baseline support from President Trump\u2019s US reopening plan. But with NYMEX crude prices closing ominously below the psychological WTI $20 per barrel for the second day running; it\u2019s suggesting downside risk remains the dominant factor. If oil producers fail to address the medium-term structural oversupply situation adequately, oil prices could stay volatile, with risks skewed to the downside for the next few months. Here we go: Germany\u2019s DAX opens higher by +2.9% And we\u2019re off! European indexes are trading higher across the board. We\u2019re still waiting for a print from the German DAX, but here\u2019s how we\u2019re looking so far: FTSE 100 is up +2.5% France\u2019s CAC 40 is up +1.5% Spain\u2019s IBEX is up +2.6% Get ready for a rally at the market open: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Europe has woken up to news that China\u2019s economy shrunk for the first time on record following the coronavirus outbreak. Data showed that Chinese GDP for the first quarter - covering the three months from January-March - came in at -6.8%, which is the first contraction since records began. That is worse than economists expected, with a Reuters poll having forecasted a contraction of -6.5%. But markets aren\u2019t fazed. Stocks in Asia shrugged off the news, with the Shanghai Composite closed up 0.7%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rising 3.1% and Australia\u2019s ASX up 1.8%. Europe is also called higher. Some investors seem more intrigued that American biotech firm Gilead may have found a potential drug to treat coronavirus. Others seem to be taking the view that the data could have been much, much worse. However, there is the age-old concern that the figures may not be telling the whole story, and many economists still question the reliability of China\u2019s data - especially when you drill down into indicators like retail sales, which were hammered after shops were ordered to close during the worst of the outbreak. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank, explains: Now, of course, if we compare this number with the expectation of over 30% slump in developed economies following a similar shutdown and confinement period, it is possible that there may have been some adjustment on data, and the data doesn\u2019t reflect the real extent of the economic calamity - Other data showed that the slump in Chinese retail sales didn\u2019t improve as much as expected in March, down from -20.5% to -15.8% versus -10% penciled; the fixed asset investment fell 16.1% y-o-y against -15.0% forecasted by analysts and -24.5% printed a month earlier. But, the contraction in the industrial production was only 1.1% in March, versus-7.3% expected by analysts and -13.5% printed month earlier, meaning that the Chinese production picked up at a better-than-expected speed, which is little surprising for Xi\u2019s ambitious economy.

      "body": "<p>The news that flights are being chartered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\">to bring seasonal workers over for the UK\u2019s farming industry</a> comes as no surprise to those of us with experience in the sector, and as things stand, it won\u2019t be the last year that this happens.</p> <p>With extra pressure being placed on the agriculture sector by the dual effects of Brexit and Covid-19, there have been calls to use the large numbers of people who have either been furloughed, or lost their jobs, to fill the gaps left by the decrease in seasonal workers. Even as a temporary solution to make sure this year\u2019s harvest doesn\u2019t go unpicked, this is unlikely to work, because contrary to what many might think, this is not an \u201cunskilled\u201d job. And looking beyond this very strange year, this is going to be a problem that only becomes more severe from 2021, when post-Brexit immigration rules come into force.</p> <p>There have been a lot of people inquiring about doing this work in recent months, with large job sites reporting increased interest in fruit-picking jobs, farm labouring, and so on, and no doubt some of the 70,000 seasonal workers we need will come from this. The majority of this interest goes no further thanthe inquiry stage, though, and there are many reasons for this.</p> <p>To point out the obvious, it\u2019s an incredibly physical job. Having worked as a fruit-picker for years, I can tell you that it\u2019s certainly not (as some television ads imply) wandering calmly through a field or orchard, casually selecting an apple or a cauliflower. You have to work quickly, carrying heavy bags of apples, or bent over picking strawberries, and, other than lunchtime, without the luxury of the familiar coffee break or chat in the kitchen with a colleague.</p> <p>Every person has a quota, and in many places you\u2019re only paid by how much work you get done. There\u2019s a minimum wage, true, but if you don\u2019t hit the targets repeatedly you\u2019re likely to lose your job, and to meet those targets you have to work at full speed, all day. Even as a 19-year-old, by the time it got to Thursday afternoon the thought of having to do it all again the next day was difficult. The idea that these jobs could be filled by people who\u2019ve spent most of their lives working in offices is not realistic, and many would be asked to leave fairly quickly.</p> <p>There\u2019s also a lot to think about while you\u2019re harvesting fruit, it\u2019s not as simple as walking along and collecting everything in your path. When picking apples, you need to consider the size, the colour, whether they\u2019re damaged, how firm they are (different for each variety) \u2013 and making sure that you don\u2019t accidentally pick the pollinator tree with a different variety on it, thereby ruining the entire box of fruit. Pick poor-quality fruit, and it won\u2019t count towards your pay.</p> <p>The issue isn\u2019t just money, though. These jobs simply wouldn\u2019t work for many people. They\u2019re located in specific regions, generally far from major towns and transport links. For those who don\u2019t drive or live in those areas, that means finding accommodation. Some farms provide this for seasonal workers, but it would need serious adaptation for social-distancing rules, and not everyone would be happy with the conditions. It\u2019s also not free, so people already paying rent or a mortgage on their home would be paying twice.</p> <p>Work starts early in the morning, which equally won\u2019t suit many. This is not about British workers being lazy, as some commentators are fond of implying. If you have to take your children to school for 8:30am, then a job that starts at 7am isn\u2019t practical. The seasonal nature of the work would also be a problem for many people. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/06/brexit-food-farms-agriculture-supermarkets-small-producers\">How to prevent a Brexit food crisis? Dig deep for fair pay on farms | Felicity Lawrence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For these reasons, and many others, we are always going to need seasonal workers in this country, many of them from abroad.

      "bodyText": "The news that flights are being chartered to bring seasonal workers over for the UK\u2019s farming industry comes as no surprise to those of us with experience in the sector, and as things stand, it won\u2019t be the last year that this happens. With extra pressure being placed on the agriculture sector by the dual effects of Brexit and Covid-19, there have been calls to use the large numbers of people who have either been furloughed, or lost their jobs, to fill the gaps left by the decrease in seasonal workers. Even as a temporary solution to make sure this year\u2019s harvest doesn\u2019t go unpicked, this is unlikely to work, because contrary to what many might think, this is not an \u201cunskilled\u201d job. And looking beyond this very strange year, this is going to be a problem that only becomes more severe from 2021, when post-Brexit immigration rules come into force. There have been a lot of people inquiring about doing this work in recent months, with large job sites reporting increased interest in fruit-picking jobs, farm labouring, and so on, and no doubt some of the 70,000 seasonal workers we need will come from this. The majority of this interest goes no further thanthe inquiry stage, though, and there are many reasons for this. To point out the obvious, it\u2019s an incredibly physical job. Having worked as a fruit-picker for years, I can tell you that it\u2019s certainly not (as some television ads imply) wandering calmly through a field or orchard, casually selecting an apple or a cauliflower. You have to work quickly, carrying heavy bags of apples, or bent over picking strawberries, and, other than lunchtime, without the luxury of the familiar coffee break or chat in the kitchen with a colleague. Every person has a quota, and in many places you\u2019re only paid by how much work you get done. There\u2019s a minimum wage, true, but if you don\u2019t hit the targets repeatedly you\u2019re likely to lose your job, and to meet those targets you have to work at full speed, all day. Even as a 19-year-old, by the time it got to Thursday afternoon the thought of having to do it all again the next day was difficult. The idea that these jobs could be filled by people who\u2019ve spent most of their lives working in offices is not realistic, and many would be asked to leave fairly quickly. There\u2019s also a lot to think about while you\u2019re harvesting fruit, it\u2019s not as simple as walking along and collecting everything in your path. When picking apples, you need to consider the size, the colour, whether they\u2019re damaged, how firm they are (different for each variety) \u2013 and making sure that you don\u2019t accidentally pick the pollinator tree with a different variety on it, thereby ruining the entire box of fruit. Pick poor-quality fruit, and it won\u2019t count towards your pay. The issue isn\u2019t just money, though. These jobs simply wouldn\u2019t work for many people. They\u2019re located in specific regions, generally far from major towns and transport links. For those who don\u2019t drive or live in those areas, that means finding accommodation. Some farms provide this for seasonal workers, but it would need serious adaptation for social-distancing rules, and not everyone would be happy with the conditions. It\u2019s also not free, so people already paying rent or a mortgage on their home would be paying twice. Work starts early in the morning, which equally won\u2019t suit many. This is not about British workers being lazy, as some commentators are fond of implying. If you have to take your children to school for 8:30am, then a job that starts at 7am isn\u2019t practical. The seasonal nature of the work would also be a problem for many people. For these reasons, and many others, we are always going to need seasonal workers in this country, many of them from abroad. They should be welcomed, and valued, as specialised key workers without whom we would be paying far more for our fresh produce. The path we are on with our immigration system risks not only making it impossible for these workers to fill these jobs, but also a resurgence of problems the industry has seen in the past. No one wants to see the return of rogue gangmasters \u2013 and the employment and human rights abuses many seasonal workers suffered at their hands. What we\u2019re seeing this year should serve as both a wake-up call that our post-Brexit immigration system will need to be changed and an opportunity to change the way we view those who fill these key jobs, in agriculture and many other industries. If you can, \u201cpick for Britain\u201d \u2013 but please value those who come here from abroad to do this too.

Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think.

A bit like that of regimental goat, or England football captain. (The Italians, of course, just give the armband to the oldest guy on the pitch. Then again, the past couple of months have arguably shown that we don\u2019t care to learn anything much from the Italians.) Perhaps the best thing that can be said at the moment is that at least we\u2019re not the United States. At the time of the Antonine plague, the Roman empire was ruled by Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher-statesman whose Meditations still racks up healthy sales a full 1,840 years after his death. At the time of the coronavirus, the US is ruled by Donald Trump, a realtor whose The Art of the Deal \u2026 probably won\u2019t do. Pressed repeatedly on Thursday to tell his supporters who are flouting the lockdown to stay at home, Trump said: \u201cThey seem to be protesters that like me and respect my opinion.\u201d So, unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. Having actively contributed to the loss of lives, Trump is going to have to get very creative in citing any that he\u2019s saved. That said, last month was the first March without a school shooting since 2002, so maybe he could credit himself with the new approach to the US school shootings problem currently being trialled. Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think. Do expect to see the National Rifle Association unveil a new slogan in the coming months: Guns don\u2019t kill people; schools do. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020. Text was added to describe the sinking of the USS Indianapolis as coming after \u201cone of the worst\u201d naval attacks of the second world war, rather than the worst.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, the health secretary has said, reverting to a policy recommended by the World Health Organization but abandoned by the UK as the numbers of cases and deaths began to rise in early March. Matt Hancock told the health select committee on Friday that police, fire, prison and Department of Work and Pensions staff would now be eligible for coronavirus testing, amid growing concerns that the country will miss its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April. A former director of the WHO told the hearing that contact tracing, testing and isolation could have continued for longer across the UK and would have enabled the government to lock down London while leaving other areas of the country with fewer restrictions. Prof Anthony Costello, the head of the Institute for Global Health at University College London, pointed out that Yorkshire had fewer than 10 cases identified in 300,000-400,000 people around the time that contact tracing and community testing were halted and, as such, could have avoided a complete lockdown. Critics have said the UK was too quick to stop the universal testing of people with symptoms, and following up with their recent contacts, who could then be asked to self-isolate. The WHO has repeatedly urged governments to pursue the strategy, which has been key to stopping epidemics around the world in modern times. \u201cTracing every contact must be the backbone of the response in every country,\u201d the director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in March. Other countries such as Singapore and South Korea, have successfully used it to contain their outbreaks, while Germany, which has a far lower case and death rate than the UK, has also worked hard on contact tracing. But on 12 March, Boris Johnson announced that the UK epidemic could no longer be contained that way. Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March. Hancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy. His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. \u201cPublic Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?\u201d he asked. Hancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate. \u201cThat brings together teams from NHSX, who are leading on the app, with a huge array of partners that are working within that, [and] from Public Health England, who are the experts on what we refer to as external contact tracing,\u201d he told the committee. \u201cThe app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist individuals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.\u201d Testing, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working \u201cincredibly hard\u201d on the WHO-recommended strategy. \u201cWe do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we\u2019re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we\u2019re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we\u2019re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.\u201d Earlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.

It sticks in the memory for two reasons: an Oxford fan was thrown out for chanting during the pre-match minute\u2019s silence to respect the death of the Queen Mother; and in the week prior to the game, York\u2019s owner (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/apr/09/sport.comment\">self-confessed corporate asset\u2013str1pper</a> John Batchelor) had been refused permission by the FA to play \u2013 during the game \u2013 a recording of fans singing to boost the atmosphere. A crowd of 3,290 watched <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/1899042.stm\">a dull game</a> in near silence, save for the away fans singing: \u2018Can you hear the Tannoy sing? No-oo, no-oo\u2019\u201d \u2013 Howard Roberts.</p> \n<p>\u201cA reporter was doing a live segment from Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s King\u2019s Road restaurant where he, Dennis Wise, Dan Petrescu, Gus Poyet and others were eating. He asked Gustavo how he was settling in; he replied he was enjoying himself in the dressing room and Wise was helping him with his English and had even taught him a song. The reporter could not resist asking, so the TV audience got to hear Gustavo\u2019s innocent rendition of \u2018Who the Eff are Man United\u2019 while Wise fell off his chair laughing. Oddly, Sky have never repeated that interview\u201d \u2013 Dave Newsome.</p> \n<p>\u201cCan I just point out to Mike Fichtner (yesterday\u2019s letters) that Neither Rochester nor Syracuse are anywhere near I-95 (which connects Boston, New York and beyond). He must mean I-90 which connects Boston to Buffalo (and beyond).

Cohen is currently locked up at FCI Otisville in New York after pleading guilty to numerous charges, including campaign finance fraud and lying to Congress. Cohen began serving his sentence last May and was scheduled to be released from prison in November 2021. He will remain under quarantine for 14 days before he is released. Federal statistics show 14 inmates and seven staff members at the prison have tested positive for the coronavirus. After he is released, Cohen will serve the remainder of his sentence at home, according to multiple US media reports citing Cohen\u2019s lawyer, Roger Adler. Cohen\u2019s release comes as prison advocates and congressional leaders have been pressing the justice department for weeks to release at-risk inmates ahead of a potential outbreak, arguing that the public health guidance to stay 6ft (1.8 meters) away from other people is nearly impossible behind bars. The attorney general, William Barr, ordered the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) earlier this month to increase the use of home confinement and expedite the release of eligible high-risk inmates, beginning at three prisons identified as coronavirus hotspots. Otisville is not one of those facilities. As of Thursday, 473 federal inmates and 279 Bureau of Prisons staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus at facilities across the US.

But the Bureau of Prisons can take action to move him to home confinement without a judicial order. Other high-profile inmates have also been released as the number of coronavirus cases soars. Last week, a judge ordered Michael Avenatti \u2013 the attorney who rose to fame representing porn star Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump \u2013 to be temporarily freed from a federal jail in New York City and stay at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles. Avenatti had said he was at high risk of getting the coronavirus because he had recently had pneumonia and his cellmate at the Metropolitan correctional center in Manhattan was removed due to flu-like symptoms. The former New York state senate leader Dean Skelos, 72, who was also serving a sentence at Otisville, is also expected to be released soon from prison to home confinement after testing positive for the coronavirus, prosecutors told a judge on Wednesday. CNN first reported Cohen was being released to home confinement. A spokesman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan declined to comment. The Associated Press contributed to this report",

Smaller shops in Germany are due to reopen from Monday with some pupils set to return to school on 4 May, although other restrictions will remain in place including bans on gatherings of more than two people in public and on large public events. The Robert Koch Institute for disease control released data showing that Germany\u2019s person-to-person infection rate had dropped to 0.7, meaning that each person carrying the virus was now infecting less than one other person on average. The infection rate is a key indicator for politicians as they grapple with the question of when and how far to reopen society, juggling the urgent necessity of unfreezing stalled economies with the need to prevent a second coronavirus wave that would force them to reinstate draconian lockdowns. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Covid-19 has so far infected nearly 900,000 people and killed almost 90,000 across the continent, well over half the worldwide total of just over 146,000. Spahn said Germany, which has recorded 138,000 cases and nearly 4,100 deaths, would be producing up to 50m face masks a week by August, which the public would be \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d to wear, adding that a contact-tracing app would be available for download within three to four weeks.

Costa has portrayed him in a fittingly clinical way, warts and all, coolly detailing the blemishes and marks of time and care on his face. Doctors 500 years ago didn\u2019t know much about anything we\u2019d call medicine, but they cared for the sick nonetheless. The profession of doctor originates in ancient Greece and Rome. Fiera would have relied largely on classical nostrums for his cures.

Costa has portrayed him in a fittingly clinical way, warts and all, coolly detailing the blemishes and marks of time and care on his face. Doctors 500 years ago didn\u2019t know much about anything we\u2019d call medicine, but they cared for the sick nonetheless. The profession of doctor originates in ancient Greece and Rome. Fiera would have relied largely on classical nostrums for his cures. But he may have got results nonetheless: it\u2019s been claimed Costa gave him this portrait as payment for curing his syphilis. \u2022 National Gallery, London.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes you\u2019re just asking the wrong question. On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-government-has-no-exit-plan-for-covid-19-lockdown-say-sources\">when will the lockdown end</a>? But that\u2019s the wrong question.</p> <p>Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they\u2019re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn\u2019t simply be asking \u201cWhen?\u201d They would be asking \u201cWhen will it be <em>safe</em>?\u201d which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn\u2019t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won\u2019t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we\u2019ve ventured out?</p> <p>We should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It\u2019s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/food-bank-run-out-stock-before-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\">food on the table</a>; there are people whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/psychiatric-hospital-coping-lockdown-mental-health\">mental health</a> is faltering; there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/abusive-partner-lockdown-domestic-abuse-charities-women-home\">domestic abuser</a>. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. </p> <p>So of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It\u2019s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that\u2019s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.</p> <p>But essential though it was and is, lockdown could only ever be a first step. It enjoys remarkable support \u2013 still backed by 91% of Britons, according to a <a href=\"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/coronavirus-updates-live-uk-pandemic-21856696?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=sharebar\">YouGov poll</a> \u2013 but it was always going to be dropped the moment a better option became available. The ideal would be a vaccine, equivalent to removing the bear\u2019s claws and teeth, but that, we are warned, is 18 months away at best. So what\u2019s the other route out of hiding?</p> <p>Read the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment\">expert </a><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215494/coronavirus-plans-social-distancing-economy-recession-depression-unemployment\">plans</a>, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.</p> <p>And yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248712889705410560\">Paul Romer</a> \u2013 admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology \u2013 has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift; the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn\u2019t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It\u2019s the \u201casymptomatic spreaders\u201d you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/world/middleeast/coronavirus-antibody-test-uk.html\">\u201cYou can\u2019t lift the lockdown as long as you are not testing massively.\u201d</a></p> <p>Do the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there\u2019s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. </p> <p>The obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248718121311092736?s=20\">saliva tests instead</a>. Shortage of the key chemicals known as \u201creagents\u201d? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world\u2019s manufacturers could do it; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/1248716918925725699?s=20\">it just requires the political will</a>. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.</p> <p>If that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing \u2013 though not on the same scale \u2013 followed by contact tracing: finding all those who\u2019d been in close proximity to someone who\u2019d tested positive and isolating them. \u201cTest, trace, isolate\u201d also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It\u2019s thought <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/10/contact-tracing-coronavirus-strategy/\">one contact-tracer is </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/04/10/contact-tracing-coronavirus-strategy/\"> required for every four cases of infection</a>.</p> <p>That means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top \u2013 on Thursday Donald Trump effectively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/trump-coronavirus-reopening-us-economy-guidelines-governors\">announced</a> that the buck stops with the 50 states \u2013 the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. <a href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-builds-contact-tracing-team-to-notify-people-of-exposure-to-coronavirus/\">San Francisco</a> is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week\u2019s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/mass-electronic-surveillance-uk-app-lockdown-download\">surveillance</a> is obvious.</p> <p>What specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what\u2019s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.</p> <p>This demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn\u2019t even <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1250326413460140033\">testing people </a>coming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It\u2019s not enough to flatten the curve; we have to get ahead of it. It\u2019s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it\u2019s safe \u2013 and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical giant Roche has devised a new coronavirus antibody test, which it is aiming to launch in the UK next month. Antibody testing, which has already been utilised in Germany, South Korea and Finland, is seen as a way for countries to exit lockdown by showing who has already had Covid-19 and could therefore have a degree of immunity. Roche, which has its headquarters in Switzerland, says it will be able to produce its tests in the order of the high tens of millions by June and will then scale up production \u201cas fast as possible\u201d. Geoff Twist, managing director of Roche Diagnostics UK and Ireland, said: \u201cRoche Diagnostics has been working around the clock to develop a high-quality antibody test. We are now collaborating with public health bodies to validate the new antibody test and our aim is to commence a phased rollout across the UK from mid-May. \u201cMore than ever it is critical that industry works collaboratively with the NHS to help alleviate pressures and provide solutions \u2013 and once again this has enabled us to move extremely quickly.\u201d The UK government has previously cited antibody tests as a possible route to relaxing restrictions on movement and social distancing but has yet to identify any that are sufficiently accurate. It ordered 3.5m last month but they proved to be unusable because they were unreliable. Experts at Oxford University leading the UK\u2019s testing effort say the best ones spotted immune cells only 70% of the time, whereas accuracy would have to be nearer 95% for them to pass muster. Last month, Prof Sharon Peacock, director of infections at Public Health England, told MPs that millions of home-testing kits would be available within days, only for the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, to quash the idea hours later, citing concerns about accuracy. Announcing its plans on Friday, Roche did not specify the accuracy of its Elecsys serology test but a spokesperson said it was \u201ccomfortable with the high performance data that we are seeing and will share the specifics closer to the time of launch\u201d. It said it would be available to countries accepting the CE mark, which signifies that products sold in the European Economic Area meet the requisite standards, and it is also working with the US Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorisation. Roche joins US-based Abbott Laboratories and Becton Dickinson and Co alongside Italy\u2019s DiaSorin in a race to produce an antibody test for coronavirus that is sufficiently accurate. The clamour for such a test has grown despite the fact that, because it is a new virus, no one knows how long immunity will last. If the test is sufficiently accurate, it is likely it will be rolled out to frontline healthcare workers first, to enable them to return quicker from isolation, assess their suitability for working in high-risk environments and their need for personal protective equipment, which has been in short supply.

They live predominately in Rakhine state, where they have co-existed uneasily alongside Buddhists for decades.</p>\n    <p>Rohingya people say they are descendants of Muslims, perhaps Persian and Arab traders, who came to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/myanmar\">Myanmar</a>&nbsp;generations ago. Unlike the Buddhist community, they speak a language similar to the Bengali dialect of Chittagong in Bangladesh.</p>\n    <p>The Rohingya are reviled by many in Myanmar as illegal immigrants and suffer from systematic discrimination. The Myanmar government treats them as stateless people, denying them citizenship. Stringent restrictions have been placed on Rohingya people\u2019s freedom of movement, access to medical assistance, education and other basic services.</p>\n    <p>Violence broke out in northern Rakhine state in August 2017, when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/25/rohingya-militants-blamed-as-attack-on-myanmar-border-kills-12\">militants attacked government forces</a>. In response, security forces supported by Buddhist militia launched a \u201cclearance operation\u201d&nbsp;that&nbsp; ultimately killed at least 1,000 people and forced more than 600,000 to flee their homes. The UN\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/un-myanmars-treatment-of-rohingya-textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing\">top human rights official</a>&nbsp;said the military\u2019s response was \"clearly disproportionate\u201d to insurgent attacks and warned that Myanmar\u2019s treatment of its Rohingya minority appears to be a \"textbook example\u201d of ethnic cleansing.</p>\n    <p>When Aung San Suu Kyi rose to power there were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/aung-san-suu-kyi-myanmars-great-hope-fails-to-live-up-to-expectations\">high hopes</a>&nbsp;that the Nobel peace prize winner would help heal Myanmar's entrenched ethnic divides. But she has been accused of standing by while violence is committed against the Rohingya.</p>\n    <p>In 2019, judges at the international criminal court authorised a full-scale investigation into the allegations of mass persecution and crimes against humanity. On 10 December 2019, the international court of justice in The Hague opened a case alleging genocide brought by the Gambia.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rebecca-ratcliffe\"><b>Rebecca Ratcliffe</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The developments are reminiscent of a 2015 crisis when many Rohingya died at sea after south-east Asian nations refused entry, prompting the UN to warn that people were being left stranded on \u201cfloating coffins\u201d.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/bangladesh-rescues-hundreds-of-rohingya-drifting-at-sea-for-nearly-two-months\">Bangladesh rescued almost 400 people</a> in the Bay of Bengal, after they spent two months adrift. They had attempted to sail to safety in Malaysia, survivors reported, but were refused entry. Dozens of those onboard had died.</p> \n<p>On the same day, it has since emerged, another Rohingya boat was intercepted by two Malaysian navy vessels after it was spotted by an air force jet off the north-western island of Langkawi. Malaysian sailors gave the refugees food before escorting them out of the country\u2019s waters, the air force said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWith their poor settlements and living conditions ... it is strongly feared that undocumented migrants who try to enter Malaysia either by land or sea will bring [Covid-19] into the country,\u201d the air force said in a statement late on Thursday.</p> \n<p>It added that \u201cmaritime surveillance operations will be intensified\u201d.</p> \n<p>Chris Lewa, of <a href=\"https://www.peaceinsight.org/conflicts/myanmar/peacebuilding-organisations/arakan-project/\">the Arakan Project</a>, which works on Rohingya rights issues, said that Covid-19 was not an acceptable reason for any country to refuse entry to refugees.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe duty of the navy is to rescue people at sea, not to push them out and put their life at risk even more,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is going to happen?

      "bodyText": "Hundreds more Rohingya refugees remain stuck at sea, rights groups have warned, just one day after it emerged that dozens of people died onboard a boat that was refused entry to Malaysia and left adrift for two months. On Friday, Malaysia\u2019s air force confirmed it had denied entry to a second boat carrying about 200 Rohingya people, claiming it had done so to prevent further spread of the coronavirus within the country, which remains under lockdown. Researchers believe other boats are likely to also be stuck at sea, packed with refugees who are attempting to escape desperate and squalid conditions in the city of Cox\u2019s Bazar in Bangladesh. Refugee camps on the border of Bangladesh grew to be some of the biggest in the world following a brutal military crackdown in 2017 that forced more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee Myanmar. Amnesty International said it had received information about as many as five boats spotted off the coasts of Malaysia and southern Thailand in recent days, believed to be carrying hundreds of people. It is feared that the refugees could remain trapped at sea and unable to disembark as countries cite the spread of Covid-19 as a justification for turning boats back. The developments are reminiscent of a 2015 crisis when many Rohingya died at sea after south-east Asian nations refused entry, prompting the UN to warn that people were being left stranded on \u201cfloating coffins\u201d. On Thursday, Bangladesh rescued almost 400 people in the Bay of Bengal, after they spent two months adrift. They had attempted to sail to safety in Malaysia, survivors reported, but were refused entry. Dozens of those onboard had died. On the same day, it has since emerged, another Rohingya boat was intercepted by two Malaysian navy vessels after it was spotted by an air force jet off the north-western island of Langkawi. Malaysian sailors gave the refugees food before escorting them out of the country\u2019s waters, the air force said. \u201cWith their poor settlements and living conditions ... it is strongly feared that undocumented migrants who try to enter Malaysia either by land or sea will bring [Covid-19] into the country,\u201d the air force said in a statement late on Thursday. It added that \u201cmaritime surveillance operations will be intensified\u201d. Chris Lewa, of the Arakan Project, which works on Rohingya rights issues, said that Covid-19 was not an acceptable reason for any country to refuse entry to refugees. \u201cThe duty of the navy is to rescue people at sea, not to push them out and put their life at risk even more,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is going to happen? Where are these people going to go?\u201d The refusal of entry to Malaysia is a worrying sign that the country is becoming increasingly hostile to Rohingya refugees. While relatively few boats carrying Rohingya have arrived in Malaysia since the 2015 crisis, some have been allowed in. Earlier this month, 202 Rohingya people landed in Langkawi and were detained. In a statement, Amnesty International called on Malaysia and Thailand to \u201cimmediately dispatch search and rescue boats with food, water and medicine to meet the urgent needs of possibly hundreds still at sea\u201d. Both countries should urgently allow the people to disembark safely, the group said, adding: \u201cBoth Thailand and Malaysia are aware that people\u2019s lives are in danger. Refusing to help the people on these boats would not be wilfully blind \u2013 it would be consciously making their plight even worse.\u201d Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

      "body": "<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying I deserve to be in the England squad but I think I deserve to have been given a chance,\u201d says Drew Spence, Chelsea\u2019s longest serving player. A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager\u2019s plans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/womens-football-faced-with-existential-threat-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Women's football faced with 'existential threat' from coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/chelsea-women-arsenal-womens-league-cup-final\" title=\"\">first League Cup</a>, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad.</p> <p>Spence admits \u201cthe squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there\u2019s so many good midfielders in England. It\u2019s tough\u201d. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.</p> <p>\u201cPhil\u2019s not spoken to me once,\u201d says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. \u201cTo not be given that chance makes me question: \u2018Is it because of what happened?\u2019 I think it is because of what happened, if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d</p> <p>Spence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/aug/21/eni-aluko-interview-race-difficult-situation\" title=\"\">Eni Aluko spoke to the Guardian about her treatment</a> after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI\u2019m not saying I deserve to be in the England squad but I think I deserve to have been given a chance,\u201d says Drew Spence, Chelsea\u2019s longest serving player. A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager\u2019s plans. It is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team\u2019s first League Cup, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad. Spence admits \u201cthe squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there\u2019s so many good midfielders in England. It\u2019s tough\u201d. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd. \u201cPhil\u2019s not spoken to me once,\u201d says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. \u201cTo not be given that chance makes me question: \u2018Is it because of what happened?\u2019 I think it is because of what happened, if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d Spence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate Eni Aluko spoke to the Guardian about her treatment after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko\u2019s account of the event. After a very public and messy series of investigations, the FA \u201csincerely apologised\u201d to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out. Spence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t speak out straight away was because I was worried,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stressed at the time.

Staying in Hayes\u2019s plans is tough.

Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.

Among the projects receiving cash is one led by Public Health England (PHE), which hopes to develop an antibody drug, something that has the potential to work as both a prophylactic and a treatment for those infected.</p> \n<p>A potential antibody drug could be given as a regular infusion to healthcare workers and other high-risk groups, and would provide protection perhaps over a few weeks or months. It could also be used as a treatment to help people fight off the virus when infected.</p> \n<p>Sharma\u2019s announcement, at the daily Downing Street press briefing, focused mainly on the idea of the vaccines taskforce, combining government and industry, which would both coordinate research efforts to develop a vaccine and then seek to ensure it could be provided to people as soon as possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, the taskforce will also include representatives from the drugs firm AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust medical foundation.</p> \n<p>\u201cUK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people\u2019s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts,\u201d Sharma said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe vaccine taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/14/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The taskforce will have the brief of first helping provide research groups and industry with support and resources to help develop a vaccine, and then when one arises, to boost manufacturing, if needed reviewing regulations to ensure it can be provided widely and at speed.</p> \n<p>The consensus among pandemic experts is that the mass use of a reliable vaccine against coronavirus is likely to be the only way governments around the world can fully ease distancing measures.</p> \n<p>Work is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/biohacking-online-forums-coronavirus-vaccines-testing\">taking place in numerous countries</a>, with some human trials already starting. Vallance has maintained that a year to 18 months is<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/when-will-coronavirus-vaccine-be-ready\"> a \u201creasonable\u201d timeframe </a>for a vaccine to be widely available.</p> \n<p>Some teams are aiming to move faster than this. Prof Adrian Hill, director of the University of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/uk-drive-develop-coronavirus-vaccine-science\">vaccine candidate is expected to enter human trials this month</a>, said the team hoped to be able to confirm efficacy by September and is already scaling up manufacturing. \u201cThe aim is to have at least a million doses [available] by around about September and move even faster from there,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The government has already announced \u00a3250m in funding towards worldwide efforts to develop a vaccine, with \u00a310.5m allocated to six projects in March.

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p>\n    <p>A widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days has led to it being touted in some quarters as a potential cure for Covid-19.

The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it.

It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not. The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/oliver-milman\">Oliver Milman</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> Vallance said the taskforce would \u201censure that any potential coronavirus vaccine, when available, can be produced quickly and at scale so it can be made available to the public as quickly as possible\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has announced a new vaccines taskforce to help the development of a vaccine for Covid-19 and ensure its rapid production and rollout if one arrives. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, also gave details of cash grants for work into both vaccines and potential treatments. Among the projects receiving cash is one led by Public Health England (PHE), which hopes to develop an antibody drug, something that has the potential to work as both a prophylactic and a treatment for those infected. A potential antibody drug could be given as a regular infusion to healthcare workers and other high-risk groups, and would provide protection perhaps over a few weeks or months. It could also be used as a treatment to help people fight off the virus when infected. Sharma\u2019s announcement, at the daily Downing Street press briefing, focused mainly on the idea of the vaccines taskforce, combining government and industry, which would both coordinate research efforts to develop a vaccine and then seek to ensure it could be provided to people as soon as possible. Led by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, the taskforce will also include representatives from the drugs firm AstraZeneca and the Wellcome Trust medical foundation. \u201cUK scientists are working as fast as they can to find a vaccine that fights coronavirus, saving and protecting people\u2019s lives. We stand firmly behind them in their efforts,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cThe vaccine taskforce is key to coordinating efforts to rapidly accelerate the development and manufacture of a potential new vaccine, so we can make sure it is widely available to patients as soon as possible.\u201d The taskforce will have the brief of first helping provide research groups and industry with support and resources to help develop a vaccine, and then when one arises, to boost manufacturing, if needed reviewing regulations to ensure it can be provided widely and at speed. The consensus among pandemic experts is that the mass use of a reliable vaccine against coronavirus is likely to be the only way governments around the world can fully ease distancing measures. Work is taking place in numerous countries, with some human trials already starting. Vallance has maintained that a year to 18 months is a \u201creasonable\u201d timeframe for a vaccine to be widely available. Some teams are aiming to move faster than this. Prof Adrian Hill, director of the University of Oxford\u2019s Jenner Institute, whose vaccine candidate is expected to enter human trials this month, said the team hoped to be able to confirm efficacy by September and is already scaling up manufacturing. \u201cThe aim is to have at least a million doses [available] by around about September and move even faster from there,\u201d he said. The government has already announced \u00a3250m in funding towards worldwide efforts to develop a vaccine, with \u00a310.5m allocated to six projects in March. On Friday, another \u00a314m was allocated to 21 new projects, based on both vaccines and treatments. Among these is funding for the possible new antibody drug, being developed by PHE, billed as intended to \u201coffer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus\u201d. A \u00a33.2m grant will go to a study called Virus Watch, conducted by University College London, that will test 10,000 participants every time they report any symptoms that could be linked to Covid-19 and trace participants\u2019 movements using mobile apps. Other research funded will look at the impact of Covid-19 on pregnancy outcomes and track the rates of infection, through antibody tests, in children and teenagers, who have made up only a tiny fraction of confirmed cases. There has been considerable focus on drugs usually used to treat malaria as a possible way to alleviate coronavirus symptoms. Some of the grant money will go to a clinical trial led by Oxford University in which more than 3,000 patients over the age of 65 presenting at GP surgeries will be given the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine to see whether it reduces the need for them to go to hospital or speeds up recovery. Vallance said the taskforce would \u201censure that any potential coronavirus vaccine, when available, can be produced quickly and at scale so it can be made available to the public as quickly as possible\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Like many businesses, the fashion industry has ground to a halt during the coronavirus crisis. As some brands pivot towards making the face masks, gowns and scrubs much needed by healthcare workers, three London-based fashion designers have set up the Emergency Designer Network (EDN), seeking to \u201cgalvanise local level production\u201d and supplement stocks, starting with scrubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe way I saw it, in order to do their jobs safely, what key workers needed was clothes \u2013 and clothes is what we do,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/may/30/why-were-watching-phoebe-english\">Phoebe English</a>, who teamed up with fellow designers Holly Fulton and Bethany Williams to form the network. The trio have been working to get the project up and running since the UK lockdown began, communicating largely via Zoom, and launched the EDN website on Thursday \u2013 the same day that the government was criticised for being slow to enlist the help of British textile firms, focusing instead on high-profile names such as Burberry.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a small designer, I was receiving enquiries direct from hospitals about supplying specific garments or assisting in their manufacture,\u201d says Fulton, who is usually known for creating clothes with bold graphic prints. \u201cIt transpired that Phoebe and Bethany had similarly been approached with these requests. A lot of [designers] are keen to do something but it\u2019s hard to know where to start, where to get the correct fabric. We took the initiative to work as a team, utilising our links with the Fashion Roundtable and Make it British.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group has also enlisted the help of \u201cconnector\u201d Cozette McCreery, who set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for raw materials, such as hospital-approved fabric.

      "bodyText": "Like many businesses, the fashion industry has ground to a halt during the coronavirus crisis. As some brands pivot towards making the face masks, gowns and scrubs much needed by healthcare workers, three London-based fashion designers have set up the Emergency Designer Network (EDN), seeking to \u201cgalvanise local level production\u201d and supplement stocks, starting with scrubs. \u201cThe way I saw it, in order to do their jobs safely, what key workers needed was clothes \u2013 and clothes is what we do,\u201d explains Phoebe English, who teamed up with fellow designers Holly Fulton and Bethany Williams to form the network. The trio have been working to get the project up and running since the UK lockdown began, communicating largely via Zoom, and launched the EDN website on Thursday \u2013 the same day that the government was criticised for being slow to enlist the help of British textile firms, focusing instead on high-profile names such as Burberry. \u201cAs a small designer, I was receiving enquiries direct from hospitals about supplying specific garments or assisting in their manufacture,\u201d says Fulton, who is usually known for creating clothes with bold graphic prints. \u201cIt transpired that Phoebe and Bethany had similarly been approached with these requests. A lot of [designers] are keen to do something but it\u2019s hard to know where to start, where to get the correct fabric. We took the initiative to work as a team, utilising our links with the Fashion Roundtable and Make it British.\u201d The group has also enlisted the help of \u201cconnector\u201d Cozette McCreery, who set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for raw materials, such as hospital-approved fabric. They began working with 10 volunteer manufacturers and designers \u2013 a number which had now grown to about 70 following an \u201cincredible\u201d response. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling how keen people are to get involved and how generous they are with their time,\u201d says Fulton. \u201cIt\u2019s been a truly collective effort \u2013 a lot of individual makers as well as some larger setups.

But it is. And one of the consequences of recent shortages, as well as the new and welcome emphasis on the \u201ckey\u201d roles performed by food industry workers including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/romanian-fruit-pickers-flown-uk-crisis-farming-sector-coronavirus\" title=\"\">fruit pickers</a> and supermarket employees, has been to open more people\u2019s eyes to this.</p> <p>It is too soon to predict with any confidence that the fragility of supply chains that has been revealed in recent weeks, as well as renewed warnings about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/human-impact-on-wildlife-to-blame-for-spread-of-viruses-says-study-aoe\" title=\"\">risks to humans from animal viruses</a>, and the light shone on the agricultural labour market, will lead to lasting changes. It is not too soon to assert that, among the many issues raised by the pandemic, questions about the future of food cannot be safely ignored.</p> <p>Already, because of Brexit and the climate crisis, food had risen from its previously lowly position on the political agenda. Leaked no-deal planning documents revealed warnings that fresh food supplies could be reduced, causing price rises (although details in the public domain are limited, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/12/defra-refuses-disclose-details-no-deal-brexit-food-supply-disruptions\" title=\"\">having refused to share them</a>). The regulations that will govern agricultural imports in any future trade deal with the US are highly contentious, with the opening up of a big European market to the US food industry \u2013 which has low standards compared with the EU \u2013 among America\u2019s chief aims.</p> <p>British consumers, as well as farmers who fear being undercut, are widely understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/10/chlorination-cheap-us-chicken-brexit\" title=\"\">chlorinated chicken</a> \u2013 and the American mega-farms that it symbolises. Antibiotics, steroid hormones and pesticides are all used more freely by farmers in the US. But in the UK, too, the number of industrial-sized pig and chicken farms (classified as holding more than 2,000 pigs or 40,000 birds) has recently gone up \u2013 by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/industrial-sized-pig-and-chicken-farming-continuing-to-rise-in-uk\" title=\"\">7% since 2017</a>. Around 70% of all UK farm animals are farmed intensively in indoor units.</p> <p>This is because meat and dairy products produced in this way are cheap. At a time of widening inequality, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/08/food-bank-run-out-stock-before-coronavirus-lockdown-ends\" title=\"\">rising hunger</a> (along with the poor nutrition evidenced by obesity) among its most unjust manifestations, it is difficult to argue against the importance of affordability. But while anti-poverty measures must be among ministers\u2019 top priorities, both now and when the crisis eases, some means must also be found to balance the downward pressure on prices, with a more rounded assessment of what food is worth.</p> <p>Animal welfare considerations are one reason to do this. The risk of disease outbreaks in intensive farms is another. While the precise origins of Covid-19 remain uncertain, warnings about the risk of other outbreaks (avian flu, for example) must now be taken seriously. In rich western countries like the UK, there are also health reasons for most people to rebalance their diets away from animal products and towards plants (as the UK\u2019s school and hospital caterers recognised this week with a pledge to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/16/school-and-hospital-caterers-vow-to-cut-meat-served-by-20\" title=\"\">reduce meat use by 20%</a>). Broader environmental considerations of land use and biodiversity, food security and resilience must also be part of the equation. British agriculture is skewed towards livestock and grain feed.</p> <p>Change will not be easy. Our food system is complicated, as is the global one of which it is part. Competing priorities \u2013 including price, animal welfare, carbon footprint and consumer preference \u2013 produce inevitable conflicts. But some beneficial effects could follow from our having been forced to take more notice. What we grow and eat are the result of political choices.</p>",

Leaked no-deal planning documents revealed warnings that fresh food supplies could be reduced, causing price rises (although details in the public domain are limited, the government having refused to share them). The regulations that will govern agricultural imports in any future trade deal with the US are highly contentious, with the opening up of a big European market to the US food industry \u2013 which has low standards compared with the EU \u2013 among America\u2019s chief aims. British consumers, as well as farmers who fear being undercut, are widely understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of chlorinated chicken \u2013 and the American mega-farms that it symbolises. Antibiotics, steroid hormones and pesticides are all used more freely by farmers in the US. But in the UK, too, the number of industrial-sized pig and chicken farms (classified as holding more than 2,000 pigs or 40,000 birds) has recently gone up \u2013 by 7% since 2017. Around 70% of all UK farm animals are farmed intensively in indoor units. This is because meat and dairy products produced in this way are cheap. At a time of widening inequality, with rising hunger (along with the poor nutrition evidenced by obesity) among its most unjust manifestations, it is difficult to argue against the importance of affordability. But while anti-poverty measures must be among ministers\u2019 top priorities, both now and when the crisis eases, some means must also be found to balance the downward pressure on prices, with a more rounded assessment of what food is worth. Animal welfare considerations are one reason to do this. The risk of disease outbreaks in intensive farms is another. While the precise origins of Covid-19 remain uncertain, warnings about the risk of other outbreaks (avian flu, for example) must now be taken seriously. In rich western countries like the UK, there are also health reasons for most people to rebalance their diets away from animal products and towards plants (as the UK\u2019s school and hospital caterers recognised this week with a pledge to reduce meat use by 20%). Broader environmental considerations of land use and biodiversity, food security and resilience must also be part of the equation. British agriculture is skewed towards livestock and grain feed. Change will not be easy. Our food system is complicated, as is the global one of which it is part. Competing priorities \u2013 including price, animal welfare, carbon footprint and consumer preference \u2013 produce inevitable conflicts. But some beneficial effects could follow from our having been forced to take more notice. What we grow and eat are the result of political choices.",

The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March. The extension amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. Ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable.</li> \n   <li>The government has set up a vaccine taskforce to find a coronavirus vaccine, the business secretary <strong>Alok Sharma</strong> announced at the daily press conference. He called producing a vaccine a \u201ccolossal undertaking\u201d that would take many months and there was no guarantee of success.</li> \n   <li>The health secretary<strong> Matt Hancock </strong>was unable to give MPs assurance that some hospitals won\u2019t run out of gowns this weekend. This came on the same day the Guardian learned that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a> bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">hospitals across England are set to run out of supplies within hours</a>.</li> \n   <li>The government will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to recommend a change in policy on face masks. <strong>Sadiq Khan</strong> has been lobbying the government to change its advice on wearing masks to members of the public. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, the mayor of London urged the public to wear non-surgical masks when they go out, particularly on public transport and in shops where it isn\u2019t always possible to stay 2 metres apart. He was backed by the Labour leader <strong>Sir</strong> <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> who said he thought he was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the government would have to start advising people to wear masks in certain circumstances, in step with changes taking places across Europe. </li> \n   <li>Booking summer holidays at this time would be a mistake, the transport secretary <strong>Grant Shapps</strong> said, highlighting that while there are signs that the curve is flattening there has yet to be a decline.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side.

Vallance did not question the importance of finding a vaccine. But he did at least twice stress that finding one might take time. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>First of all, we\u2019ve got to get a vaccine. That isn\u2019t two days away, it\u2019s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn\u2019t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we\u2019re in that position.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And later he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success.</p> \n   <p>So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it\u2019s never the case that you know you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s the first thing that we need to be sure of. </p> \n   <p>The second thing is then the safety and it\u2019s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that\u2019s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine.</p> \n   <p>And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that government advisers would decide on Tuesday next week whether to recommend a change of policy on face masks.</strong> At the moment the government does not advise members of the public to wear them. Vallance said this was in line with World Health Organisation recommendations. But Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said that people on public transport should be advised to wear them (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad#block-5e9951c88f08ea7431f447ad\"> 7.53am)</a> and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he thinks a change in policy is inevitable. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e99c7088f080ee110446e1b#block-5e99c7088f080ee110446e1b\"> 4.29pm.) </a>Asked about their views, Vallance said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The evidence is quite variable around masks. It\u2019s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it, and there aren\u2019t really good trials of masks. We are looking at the evidence now. We\u2019ve looked at it this week twice. We\u2019re going to look at it again on Tuesday and hope to be able to make some advice around whether any changes are needed or not at the moment. We\u2019re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. </p> \n   <p>The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread which adds an added complexity to where masks may or may not fit into this. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fab8e92f76afdfe1cbb866925115fdade568690d/1625_342_1755_1053/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alok Sharma (left) and Sir Patrick Vallance.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Parsons/10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:20:10.455Z\">at 6.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99e1128f08bade1f2954a3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T17:02:27.775Z\">6.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ec6f3359b26b67de0d9317e625d60f45618600b/0_0_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People exercising and maintaining physical distance on Thames Walk, Erith, Kent.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e99dc8e8f08bade1f295425\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T16:43:45.897Z\">5.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Sharma</strong> ends by thanking people for the sacrifices they are making.</p> \n  <p>And he repeats the message about staying at home to protect the NHS.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s it.

When<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\"> it was originally announced</a> it was open for a period of three months, until the end of May.</p> \n  <p>Now it will be extended for a month. In <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-to-end-of-june\">a press notice</a> the Treasury said this decision was being announced in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three weeks. It will now be open until the end of June, \u201cproviding businesses with the certainty they need\u201d, the Treasury says.</p> \n  <p>In a statement Sunak said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide job retention scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity.</p> \n   <p>It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March.</p> \n  <p>Even thought a one-month extension may not sound like something hugely significant, this amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. That is because the scheme itself amounts to a colossal public spending commitment. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme\"> it will cost the government between \u00a330bn and \u00a340bn every three months.</a></p> \n  <p>This is one reason why the Treasury is so keen for the lockdown not to last too long.

It establishes clearly that the PM\u2019s colleagues were not being fully truthful about how ill he really was in the days before his admission to intensive care. Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/carrie-symonds-recovering-from-coronavirus\">and self-isolating</a> with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. [Matt] Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.</p> \n   <p>In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d</a>. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.</p> \n   <p>The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.</p> \n   <p>At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.</p> \n   <p>It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)</p> \n   <p>On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">got significantly worse</a>. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.</p> \n   <p>At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/06/global-leaders-send-messages-of-support-to-boris-johnson\">sent him good wishes</a>.

(See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/17/uk-coronavirus-live-lockdown-last-three-weeks-dominic-raab-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07#block-5e9982698f0895d83068fd07\">11.19am.)</a></p> \n  <p>Hunt also said he thought the government should also involve councils in contact-tracing, the process that involves contacting people who have been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus.

The health secretary today said that he hadn\u2019t decided whether it was going to be done centrally or with local government and I think one of the lessons we could reasonable draw from the slowness of ramping things up centrally is that this is something we should trust local government to help us with when we move out of the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt said in South Korea 1,000 people were involved in contract tracing. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This could be tested out in places like Yorkshire or Cornwall because those are parts of the country which have got relatively few Covid cases - and so we could start seeing whether it was possible to lift the lockdown by replacing it with this testing and contact tracing.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the job retention scheme \u2013 the multi-billion coronavirus 80% wage subsidy \u2013 will be extended by one month until the end of June. The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March. The extension amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. Ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable. The government has set up a vaccine taskforce to find a coronavirus vaccine, the business secretary Alok Sharma announced at the daily press conference. He called producing a vaccine a \u201ccolossal undertaking\u201d that would take many months and there was no guarantee of success. The health secretary Matt Hancock was unable to give MPs assurance that some hospitals won\u2019t run out of gowns this weekend. This came on the same day the Guardian learned that NHS bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals across England are set to run out of supplies within hours. The government will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to recommend a change in policy on face masks. Sadiq Khan has been lobbying the government to change its advice on wearing masks to members of the public. Appearing on BBC Breakfast, the mayor of London urged the public to wear non-surgical masks when they go out, particularly on public transport and in shops where it isn\u2019t always possible to stay 2 metres apart. He was backed by the Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer who said he thought he was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the government would have to start advising people to wear masks in certain circumstances, in step with changes taking places across Europe. Booking summer holidays at this time would be a mistake, the transport secretary Grant Shapps said, highlighting that while there are signs that the curve is flattening there has yet to be a decline. That\u2019s it from us today on the UK side. Thank you to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions, and to all of you for reading along. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the worldwide picture, head over to our global live blog. Here are the main points from the press conference. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, sought to quash hopes that a vaccine could provide an early solution to the coronavirus crisis. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, used the press conference to announce that Vallance will chair a new government vaccine taskforce that will \u201cdrive forward, expedite and co-ordinate efforts to research and then produce a coronavirus vaccine and make sure one is made available to the public as quickly as possible\u201d. Vallance did not question the importance of finding a vaccine. But he did at least twice stress that finding one might take time. He said: First of all, we\u2019ve got to get a vaccine. That isn\u2019t two days away, it\u2019s not two months away. Making a vaccine is a difficult, complicated process. It doesn\u2019t only have to work, it has to be safe, and of course for a disease like this it has to be very safe if you are going to use it right across the population. So there is a lot to do before we\u2019re in that position. And later he said: Just to put some realism on vaccine development, each single project does not have a high probability of success. So although everyone goes out with great enthusiasm and we hope they work, it\u2019s never the case that you know you\u2019ve got a vaccine that\u2019s going to work. So that\u2019s the first thing that we need to be sure of. The second thing is then the safety and it\u2019s incredibly important that these vaccines are tested properly, that\u2019s why it takes some time to get to the clinical trials and understand the potential unwanted effects of a vaccine. And then only when that has been done can this be used widely across the population and so those are the stages we need to go through. Vallance said that government advisers would decide on Tuesday next week whether to recommend a change of policy on face masks. At the moment the government does not advise members of the public to wear them. Vallance said this was in line with World Health Organisation recommendations. But Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has said that people on public transport should be advised to wear them (see 7.53am) and Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has said he thinks a change in policy is inevitable. (See 4.29pm.) Asked about their views, Vallance said: The evidence is quite variable around masks. It\u2019s not easy to really get a firm position on some of it, and there aren\u2019t really good trials of masks. We are looking at the evidence now. We\u2019ve looked at it this week twice. We\u2019re going to look at it again on Tuesday and hope to be able to make some advice around whether any changes are needed or not at the moment. We\u2019re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. The difference between this disease and others is the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic spread which adds an added complexity to where masks may or may not fit into this. Sharma ends by thanking people for the sacrifices they are making. And he repeats the message about staying at home to protect the NHS. That\u2019s it. The press conference is over. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. Q: Why are you going ahead with HS2 when money is so short? Sharma says it is important to support the construction sector. And the government should keep the economy going where it can. Q: There is a disproportionately high number of deaths in the West Midlands. Do you know why? Doyle says they expected cities to be hit first. But other factors are relevant. For example, they are looking at areas where there are lots of care homes. Q: Will West Midlands hospitals get the PPE they need? Sharma says he is aware of the supply problems. But there is a global supply issue. He pays tribute to businesses that have stepped in to supply PPE. Q: Will you commit to ensuring care workers have full sick pay? Sharma says a whole range of support is provided. He says the government very much values the heroes that we have. Q: Was it a mistake for the government to dismiss essential workers as low-skilled labour? Sharma says everyone in government wants to pay tribute to the work of NHS workers. Q: Dominic Raab talks yesterday about possibly strengthening the lockdown in some areas. In which areas? Geographically, or by sector? Sharma says he does not want to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d by speculating. Vallance says there are a number of options. But it is too early to be talking about them. Q: Are you considering recommending the use of face masks for people on public transport? Sharma says Sage, the scientific advisory group for emergencies, is looking at this. Vallance says Sage is looking at this. The evidence is variable. He says there may be a decision on Tuesday. He says at the moment the UK is in line with WHO advice. Q: You told the CBI earlier they would have to get used to a new normal. What did you mean by that? Will some restrictions have to stay in place until there is a vaccine? Sharma says the government is asking people to work from home if they can. But this is not always possible. He says employers will have to adapt the way they work, so they can keep people safe. Q: Are you saying you expect people to carry on working from home until there is a vaccine? Sharma says the lockdown has been extended for three weeks. But there are exceptions, he says. He says he has been emphasising that, in those circumstances, employers must follow Public Health England guidance. Q: Have there been any findings from investigations into the deaths of NHS workers from coronavirus? Doyle says the investigations are under way. Not all of these are workplace deaths, she says. And she says it is important to get these investigations right. Q: Oxford scientists have said they are so confident that their vaccine will work that they are going to manufacture 1m doses. What will you do to make sure the UK is first in the queue to buy it? Sharma says this is a reference to the Edward Jenner Institute. He has spoken to them, and is supporting the work that they are doing. Vallance says these researchers have done a great job. But there are over 100 vaccine projects around the world. There are at least two, or perhaps three, in the clinic. But most vaccine trials do not work, he says. He says you can only use vaccines when you know they are safe. He says the vaccine can come from anywhere. The domestic effort is being supported. But it might come from somewhere else. We just need to back lots of horses at the moment. And we may need more than one vaccine, he says. Q: When might businesses get back to normal? Was Nadine Dorries right to say it will only be when there is a vaccine? Sharma says people will understand why the lockdown has been extended. The government will always be led by the scientific advice, he says. Q: What can you say to the tourism sector? Will there be a summer season? Sharma says he speaks to businesses every day. The government has given support for businesses in this sector. The furlough scheme has been extended. But this is a tough time, he says. Q: Some 21,000 tests were carried out yesterday. How will you get to 100,000 a day by the end of the month? Sharma says the capacity is for 38,000 tests a day. And there are 26 drive-through testing centres. They are doing everything they can to hit this target, he says. Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, claims they are on track to meet the target. Q: When you get a vaccine, who will get it first? Vallance says this is not immediate. It is not two days away, nor two months away. When you have a vaccine, you vaccinate the most vulnerable first. But they are not at that stage yet. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, is presenting the daily slides. On transport use, he says there is some evidence in places where there is little coronavirus of people ignoring social distancing rules. They should not. Here is the testing data. Vallance says this next slide is the most important. He says more than 5,500 people are involved in clinical trials. The number of hospital cases are not only plateauing, but going down in some places. That will mean fewer people going to intensive care, he says. But he says this process will take weeks. Here is the final slide, with death figures. The measures being taken are making a difference, Vallance says. Sharma says producing a vaccine will be a colossal undertaking. He says it will take any months. And there is no guarantee of success. But he is proud of the way Britain has stepped up to the challenge. We are a country with a rich history of pioneering science, he says. Earlier the government sent out an embargoed press release with more details of the vaccine taskforce that Alok Sharma has just announced. Here is an excerpt. The taskforce, led by Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Jonathan van Tam, will support efforts to rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine as soon as possible by providing industry and research institutions with the resources and support needed. This includes reviewing regulations and scaling up manufacturing, so that when a vaccine becomes available, it can be produced quickly and in mass quantities. Representatives from government, academia and industry are coming together to form the Taskforce. Members will include government life sciences champion Sir John Bell, as well as AstraZeneca, and the Wellcome Trust. Alongside the creation of the taskforce, the government is also announcing that 21 new coronavirus research projects will benefit from funding worth around \u00a314m. Giving details, it says: One new project led by the University of Oxford will trial an anti-malarial drug believed to have anti-inflammatory properties to determine whether it could diminish the effects of Covid-19 on people in high risk groups. GP surgeries across the UK have been invited to take part in this ground-breaking trial, to ascertain whether it could reduce the need for affected patients to go to hospital and speed up their recovery. Other projects receiving vital government funding from this new pot include: Imperial College London testing a vaccine against coronavirus that aims for the body to produce more protective antibodies; Public Health England developing a new antibody that could offer protection against infection and disease progression of coronavirus; Public Health England studying how Covid-19 can be transmitted from person-to-person by determining how long it can survive in the air and on different materials found in hospitals and households like fabric, plastics, metals and ceramics. Sharma says one way to defeat the virus is to find a vaccine. We need to apply the best of British scientific endeavour to this, he says. Sharma says government has set up a vaccine taskforce to find a coronavirus vaccine. He says it will back all stages of vaccine developments. Sharma starts by summarising the government\u2019s aims. He reads out the latest testing and death figures. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has just started the press conference. He is with Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England. NHS bosses are preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients as hospitals across England are set to run out of supplies within hours, our colleague Denis Campbell reports. He says: The guidance will be a reversal of Public Health England (PHE) guidelines stipulating that full-length waterproof surgical gowns, designed to stop coronavirus droplets getting into someone\u2019s mouth or nose, should be worn for all high-risk hospital procedures. In a significant U-turn, PHE is set to advise frontline staff to wear a flimsy plastic apron when gowns have run out, in a move that doctors and nurses fear may lead to more of them contracting the virus and ultimately put lives at risk. Prof Keith Willett, who has been leading NHS England\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis, has helped formulate the guidance, which will be sent to all 217 trusts in England. It will set out options for what frontline staff should do when they cannot access gowns. They will include hospitals which still have gowns lending each other batches of them, wearing coveralls \u2013 one-piece items of personal protective equipment (PPE) which cover the whole body \u2013 and using plastic aprons as alternatives. A source with knowledge of the plan told the Guardian: \u201cThe new guidance will say \u2018this is what you do if you don\u2019t have any gowns\u2019. Wear an apron instead \u2013 that will be the new policy for the foreseeable future, though the medical organisations will go mad about that.\u201d The full story is here. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, is taking this afternoon\u2019s government press conference. It is due to start at 5pm. Sharma will appear alongside Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Prof Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England. Reports of domestic abuse sent to UK police forces by Crimestoppers have surged by nearly 50% during the coronavirus lockdown, and the charity is urging people to come forward if they think a friend, family member, colleague or neighbour is a victim. Figures show Crimestoppers sent 120 domestic abuse reports to forces in the week beginning 6 April, after restriction of movement rules came into force, an increase of 49.3% from the average of 80.4 per week across a five-week period in January and February, before the lockdown. Earlier this week, the victims commissioner, Dame Vera Baird, said the Counting Dead Women project had recorded 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the last three weeks, around five a week, up from the usual average of two. The chair of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council, Martin Hewitt, revealed police had recorded a 3% rise in domestic violence offences in England and Wales in the four weeks to 12 April, compared with the same period last year. Commander Sue Williams, who leads on safeguarding for the Metropolitan police, said: The Met is absolutely committed to protecting those at risk and our officers are out every day, arresting perpetrators and supporting victims. It is more important than ever for people to look out for one another. If you know or suspect that a friend, neighbour or relative is a victim of domestic abuse, we urge you to speak up and tell someone. Crimestoppers is asking those with concerns to pass on information anonymously at the charity\u2019s UK contact centre on 0800 555 111 or visit crimestoppers-uk.org. And anyone who needs help in a domestic abuse situation, but is fearful an abuser may hear them calling, can dial 999 and then press 55, which will let the police know they need assistance. People can also call national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has used an interview with the BBC to back Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, over face masks. (See 7.53am.) Here are the main points. Starmer said he thought it was \u201cinevitable\u201d that the government would have to start advising people to wear masks in some circumstances. He said: Across Europe I think the advice is changing on face masks and I think it\u2019s inevitable that we will get to a stage where there will be instructions on face masks. I would like to talk to the government on that, because I don\u2019t want to set up rival strategies or rival theories going forward. But it would be sensible. This is why we need to start talking about the exit strategy or the exit plan \u2013 so that we can have exactly that kind of discussion, challenge, agreement, if we can reach agreement. He criticised the government for refusing to discuss what its exit plan from the lockdown might be. He has been calling for the government to publish a plan. Ministers claim this would distract public attention from the need to follow the lockdown rules now. But Starmer dismissed that argument. He said: In other countries across Europe governments are openly talking about the exit plan. I don\u2019t think the British are uniquely unable to understand the difference between lockdown and what comes next \u2026 Just parking this question, and saying we are not even going to look at it for another few weeks, I think is just fundamentally wrong. He said he wanted Labour to be in a position where it could support the government\u2019s exit plan. He said: What I really want, when I\u2019ve seen the plan, is to come in behind it, because we want the trust of the public. I think seeing all the major political parties saying, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ll get behind that,\u2019 just as we got behind the lockdown, that is a good thing. The return of Premier League football is dependent on the rollout of mass coronavirus testing, clubs learned on Friday. In a two-hour video conference, representatives of English football\u2019s top 20 teams met with league officials to discuss various scenarios for bringing back the competition. While the presumption is that any resumption of the 2019-20 season would happen behind closed doors, testing of everyone involved in a given event \u2013 from players, to coaching and medical staff, match officials and TV broadcast crews \u2013 would be necessary. Here is the full story. Job losses \u201cmay no longer be increasing\u201d, the Resolution Foundation thinktank says in its latest analysis of the economic impact of coronavirus. It is a shred of positive news in an outlook that is otherwise predictably bleak. Here is an extract. The scale of the damage to the labour market has become much clearer in the past week: data show that the reduction in employment is huge and unprecedented, but may not be increasing further. The number of new universal credit (UC) claimants has reached 1.4m since the crisis started. The number of new applicants fell to 220,000 in the most recent week, down from its peak of 540,000 in the final week of March. This is, however, still more than twice as bad as the worst of the financial crisis. More encouraging is timelier data based on the frequency of web searches for unemployment-related terms which has closely matched the path of UC claims in recent weeks. Web searches have now fallen back to close to levels seen on average during 2019. This suggests new UC claimants will fall again next week. However, this data is unlikely to be capturing the majority of the people who have stopped work as their employer makes use of the government coronavirus job retention scheme. The Ministry of Justice has defended its response to the coronavirus pandemic in prisons after two major penal reform groups threatened legal action. The Howard League for Penal Reform and the Prison Reform Trust have written to the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, setting out a proposed judicial review of his plans for reducing the prison population (see blog post at 15.02). So far, Buckland has proposed temporarily releasing up to 4,000 prisoners who are within two months of their release date, as well as up to 70 pregnant women or mothers. Around 500 temporary cells are being built on the grounds of the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy. The Ministry of Justice said it would respond to the letter in due course. A spokesperson said: We have robust and flexible plans in place to keep prisoners, staff and the wider public safe based on the latest advice from Public Health England. As part of the national plan to protect the NHS and save lives, we have already announced up to 4,000 risk-assessed prisoners who are within two months of their release date will be temporarily released from jail, along with pregnant women. The rise in confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prison staff continues to significantly outpace the rate of infection among inmates, the latest update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Thursday, 138 prison staff had tested positive for the coronavirus across 49 prisons, a 43% increase in 24 hours. There are around 33,000 full time equivalent staff in public sector prisons in England and Wales. Meanwhile, the number of infected prisoners stood at 255 across 62 prisons, an increase of 10% in the same period. There are around 82,000 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons. Ministers earlier this week revealed that prison staff had started accessing testing, which was expected to increase and continue in the weeks ahead. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has announced that the coronavirus job retention scheme - the plan to allow firms to furlough their workers during the coronavirus crisis, with the state paying them 80% of their wages, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month - will be extended. When it was originally announced it was open for a period of three months, until the end of May. Now it will be extended for a month. In a press notice the Treasury said this decision was being announced in the light of the decision yesterday to extend the lockdown for at least three weeks. It will now be open until the end of June, \u201cproviding businesses with the certainty they need\u201d, the Treasury says. In a statement Sunak said: We\u2019ve taken unprecedented action to support jobs and businesses through this period of uncertainty, including the UK-wide job retention scheme. With the extension of the coronavirus lockdown measures yesterday, it is the right decision to extend the furlough scheme for a month to the end of June to provide clarity. It is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery. The scheme is due to formally open on Monday next week, although payments will be backdated to 1 March. Even thought a one-month extension may not sound like something hugely significant, this amounts to an immense spending announcement, perhaps costing the Treasury \u00a310bn or more. That is because the scheme itself amounts to a colossal public spending commitment. The Resolution Foundation has estimated that it will cost the government between \u00a330bn and \u00a340bn every three months. This is one reason why the Treasury is so keen for the lockdown not to last too long. At this price, ministers reportedly believe that keeping the scheme going through the summer and beyond would be simply unaffordable. The Duchess of Cornwall recorded a video message of support for the official opening of NHS Nightingale Hospital North West in Manchester. Speaking from Birkhall, Prince Charles\u2019s home on the Balmoral estate, Camilla said the new field hospital was bringing \u201clight at a dark time\u201d. She added: But this is not surprising, Manchester in a past master at bringing light to dark times. After all this is not the first time you have shown the world what it is to meet a great challenge with even greater resolve. My husband and I visited Manchester in 2017, shortly after the terrible bombing, and were deeply moved and inspired by the city\u2019s courage and unity. She praised the NHS, military, social services, planner, builders and technicians involved in building the temporary hospital at the Manchester Central Convention Centre. She added: We all feel the deepest admiration for the single-minded dedicated that has created the NHS Nightingale North West Hospital, and the way all efforts have been directed to one object - caring for those who contract Covid-19. In this ace video diary, Jo, a nurse practitioner, documents her first week at one of the largest field hospitals in the world: the Nightingale at the London ExCeL centre. The hospital was built in nine days with a capacity for up to 4,000 patients in reaction to the global coronavirus outbreak. Here is the video. From PA\u2019s Ian Jones. NHS England has revised the daily hospital death toll for 23 dates, with 8 April still having the highest total. Woolwich Ferry was spotted sounding its horn and spinning in the River Thames in support of healthcare staff during the fourth weekly Clap for Carers event on Thursday evening. Junior doctor Becky Stout, who filmed the tribute, said on Twitter: \u201cBig thumbs up from the Woolwich Ferry for NHS workers tonight!\u201d The commuter ferry, which operates in south-east London, spun in a circle and honked its horn in the middle of the Thames while the applause took place. The two leading prison reform groups in the country have threatened the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, with legal action over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in jails in England and Wales. The Howard League for Penal Reform and the Prison Reform Trust have written to Buckland setting out a proposed judicial review of his plans for reducing the prison population. So far, Buckland has proposed temporarily releasing up to 4,000 prisoners who are within two months of their release date, as well as up to 70 pregnant women or mothers. Around 500 temporary cells are being built on the grounds of the existing prison estate to increase single-cell occupancy. The letter says \u201cthe rate of releases has been too slow and too limited to make any substantial difference to the prison population and the plans as we understand them are incapable of achieving what the secretary of state has publicly acknowledged is required\u201d. The \u201cletter before action\u201d, sent via the groups\u2019 lawyers, Bhatt Murphy solicitors, is the first step in judicial review proceedings. Buckland has a period of time to respond. If the response is considered inadequate then the group can issue legal proceedings. The letter suggests a range of actions that the government could take to address the problem, including expanding the scope of the temporary scheme, expediting the consideration of release of pregnant women and mothers, and considering the release of all children in custody in line with international guidance and law. As of 5pm on Wednesday, 232 prisoners had tested positive across 60 prisons. Ninety-six prison staff, working in 38 prisons, and seven Prisoner Escort and Custody Services (PECS) staff had also tested positive. A further update will be published later today. This afternoon the Guardian has published a superb in-depth account of Boris Johnson\u2019s coronavirus illness. It establishes clearly that the PM\u2019s colleagues were not being fully truthful about how ill he really was in the days before his admission to intensive care. Here is an extract. By the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant and self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. [Matt] Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d. In reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, saying this was \u201ca precautionary step\u201d. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert. The following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes. At 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday. It appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.) On Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition got significantly worse. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street. At 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians sent him good wishes. His aides were knocked over, distraught. And here is the full article, by Luke Harding, Rowena Mason, Dan Sabbagh, Mattha Busby, Denis Campbell and Owen Bowcott. It\u2019s well worth a read. Scotland is known as a world leader in the fight against period poverty, but lockdown means that women and girls who normally pick up their free products from schools, colleges and other community settings have to look elsewhere. But in Perth and Kinross, all they need to do is dial up the tampon taxi. Lori Hughes, communities manager at the PKAVS charity, has come up with the plan of a contact-free delivery service whereby women can email or text their order and the free period products will be bagged up by volunteers and dropped off by car. Hughes has also stocked a Give and Take box in Perth city centre with free products, and is hoping to set up more roadside pick-up points. Downing Street has urged people to follow social distancing guidance after the country\u2019s most senior police officer was filmed clapping for carers on a crowded Westminster Bridge. As PA Media reports, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, led dozens of officers in the weekly applause for key workers at 8pm on Thursday. A video posted to the force\u2019s Twitter account shows her standing in front of officers, who are lined up with gaps in front of police vehicles along the bridge near parliament. But the gesture drew criticism from some after another video, which has been viewed millions of times online, emerged showing groups of people, near police officers, apparently ignoring social distancing guidance, PA reports. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We would ask that everyone takes responsibility and adheres to social distancing rules so that we can safely show our appreciation for those who are working so hard to fight coronavirus. We would ask that in showing their appreciation for those who are working so hard as carers, they do so in a way which adheres to the social distancing rules. In an interview on the World at One Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health committee, said that when Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gave evidence to his committee this morning, he thought it was significant that Hancock had stressed more than ever before his commitment to mass community testing. (See 11.19am.) Hunt also said he thought the government should also involve councils in contact-tracing, the process that involves contacting people who have been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. He said: One of the reasons testing took too long to ramp up is because it was all done centrally by Public Health England. The health secretary today said that he hadn\u2019t decided whether it was going to be done centrally or with local government and I think one of the lessons we could reasonable draw from the slowness of ramping things up centrally is that this is something we should trust local government to help us with when we move out of the lockdown. Hunt said in South Korea 1,000 people were involved in contract tracing. He went on: This could be tested out in places like Yorkshire or Cornwall because those are parts of the country which have got relatively few Covid cases - and so we could start seeing whether it was possible to lift the lockdown by replacing it with this testing and contact tracing. So, that really has to be the next step. The Department for Health and Social Care has published the latest coronavirus hospital death figures for the UK. There have been 847 new deaths, taking the total to 14,576. The full details are here. This is down slightly on yesterday\u2019s equivalent daily figure, which was 861. And the latest coronavirus death figures for Northern Ireland are in this bulletin (pdf) from its Public Health Agency. It says there have been 18 new deaths in Northern Ireland, taking the total to 176. According to Public Health Wales there have been 11 new reported coronavirus deaths in Wales, taking the total to 506. The latest details are here. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, has given a qualified welcome to Matt Hancock\u2019s announcement that firefighters will now be included in the list of public sector workers who can get a coronavirus test. (See 11.19am.) In a statement Wrack said: We\u2019re pleased to see that the government has listened to the FBU and finally agreed to open up some testing to other key workers, including fire and rescue personnel. However, it is a shame it has come this late, with thousands of firefighters already self-isolating - this is something that could have been easily avoided. We are awaiting further details but it is clear that there are questions around the functioning of the scheme that is now open to more key workers . The health secretary said fewer NHS staff were coming forward to be tested than hoped [see 11.34am], but this is surely an issue of accessibility, rather than frontline staff not wanting to be tested. Many of the testing centres are far out of town and require extended trips in a car \u2013 if this is a barrier to nursing staff, it will also be a barrier to other key workers. The Welsh government has announced a string of initiatives it is taking as it works towards a lockdown exit. The first minister Mark Drakeford said the Labour-led administration was looking forward \u201ccarefully and cautiously\u201d to the future. Drakeford said the next three weeks would be used to plan ahead to prepare for an easing of lockdown. He said: We are planning for the day when things can change. If the data and the science tells us in three weeks time that we have suppressed the circulation of the virus to an extent where it is possible to begin to lift restrictions that is what we will look to do. Drakeford said he favoured a UK-wide lockdown. But he added: There may be some things at the margins that we will do differently in different parts of the UK but a UK way of doing things remains a strength. He set out six initiatives that will be undertaken in the next three weeks: Establish objective measures across the UK that will inform when it is safe to ease the lockdown. Drakeford said this should be done early in this three week period. Put in place public health surveillance to spot localised new outbreaks after the exit. Further strengthen the NHS. Set up criteria for lifting individual restrictions: for example, can a particular easing be policed, can it be rapidly reversed if necessary? Continue to learn from international experience. Draw in expertise from outside government to challenge thinking and bring in new ideas. Nicola Sturgeon has told reporters at her daily briefing that it may be \u201clogical and sensible\u201d for Scotland to move in a different direction to the rest of the UK in terms of exit strategy in certain circumstances. Earlier on Friday the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, warned against confusing the public message. He told BBC Radio Scotland: I would suggest that this is not the time to muddy the message by talking about exit strategies or getting into arguments about sectors or geography or demographies or anything else. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has also called for more details to be disclosed about how the UK government plans to leave the lockdown. But this lunchtime, Sturgeon insisted that she would be transparent about her own exit plans, treating the Scottish public \u201clike the grown-ups you are\u201d, and added: Where the evidence, with judgment applied, drives us in a slightly different direction \u2013 as long as that\u2019s not for some silly political reason \u2013 then that is logical and sensible. This virus doesn\u2019t respect borders or boundaries, that is obvious ... that is why the Scottish government has been working so carefully and collaboratively and closely to align our thinking and decision with the Welsh, UK and Northern Irish governments. She said that \u201cif the evidence and the science tells us that because we are all at different stages of the infection curve we might have to do things differently\u201d, it would be \u201castounding\u201d for any leader to say they would not take account of that. An initiative to provide NHS workers with enough food for two days of nutritious family meals \u2013 on their hospital doorstep \u2013 has been launched. HelpNHSHeroes, set up by volunteers after critical care nurse Dawn Bilbrough\u2019s high-profile plea on social media for shoppers not to empty supermarket shelves, aims to help all NHS hospital workers have access to food and essential supplies. The scheme enables frontline hospital staff to have the opportunity to pick up a box to feed a family of four for two days on the hospital\u2019s doorstep. The contents include the important food groups such as protein, carbohydrates and fruit and vegetables and are sold at cost price. Food companies which have donated items for food parcels and breakfast include Meatless Farm, Kingsmill and Deli Kitchen flatbreads. The first hospital to participate in the scheme is the Lister hospital in Stevenage, part of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS trust, where 1,600 staff have already registered. Boxes are collected daily from a pop-up shop, with over 1,000 distributed to date. A further facility has been built at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading, part of the Royal Berkshire NHS foundation trust, which includes a cafe serving free breakfasts as well as accommodation for back-to-back shift workers. The aim is to roll the scheme out nationally and the organisation says it has already had interest from over 40 hospitals throughout the UK. From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Boris Johnson, spoke to the prime minister on Thursday, Downing Street said. The PM\u2019s spokesman said Johnson was \u201ccontinuing his recovery at Chequers and he is not doing government work\u201d. Johnson has not had any calls with foreign leaders. Downing Street also suggested summer holidays should not be booked yet as there is no certainty of when the lockdown will be lifted and travel can resume. The PM\u2019s spokesman was asked about the transport secretary, Grant Shapps\u2019s comments that he has no plans to book a summer holiday yet because of the pandemic. The spokesman said: While we are making progress in our fight against coronavirus, we are not able to say with certainty the point at which the social distancing measures can be relaxed and in terms of travelling within the UK for holidays, that is not something which the current social distancing guidelines allow for. And secondly, in terms of travel abroad, the advice of the Foreign Office continues to be that you should go abroad for essential travel only. As of today, it is a fact that both the guidelines and the official Foreign Office advice do not allow for people going on holidays. The government should allow people resilient to the coronavirus \u2013 the young, fit, slim, and non-smokers \u2013 to return to work to build-up herd immunity, and save the economy, according to two leading vets. Ministers should abandon their \u201cfinancially ruinous\u201d strategy to contain the pandemic and only keep the 40% of the population vulnerable to infection from Covid-19 under the lockdown, according to Joe Brownlie, emeritus professor of veterinary pathology at the Royal Veterinary College, and Dick Sibley, director of West Ridge veterinary practice in Devon. The government\u2019s aim of curtailing transmission rates to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed with cases is \u201cmore a system of delaying deaths than saving lives\u201d, they write in Vet Record magazine. They dismiss this strategy as being more about making the number of fatalities \u201cmore palatable\u201d to the media and the public, and wrecking the economy in the process. Arguing that the government should learn lessons from how animal disease outbreaks have been managed, they write: The young, fit, slim, non-smokers could be left to get on with creating the wealth that we are going to need to secure our futures, instead of being locked away waiting for the inevitable. The only effective long-term control to minimise new infections will be through developing immunity, either by managed exposure or vaccination, while at the same time accepting that there will always be vulnerable individuals requiring intensive treatment and support. Back to the health committee, and it\u2019s the final question. Q: Last year the joint committee on human rights said the human rights of people with autism were being restricted when they were in hospital. Hospital visits have now been limited. This has a particular impact on autistic people. What can be done about this? Hancock says many inpatients also have a higher risk of death from Covid-19. So hospitals have taken an understandable decision to restrict visits. But he worries about the consequences of this, he says. He says a programme to reduce the number of autistic inpatients is ongoing. The hearing is now finished. Labour\u2019s Rosie Cooper says there will be cancer patients around the country surprised by what Hancock was saying. Patients are having their treatment delayed. She says there is a disconnect between what Hancock has been told, and what is actually happening on the ground. Hancock says there are cases when there are good clinical reasons for treatment being delayed. But he asks Cooper to give him details of other cases, so that he can investigate them. Q: Are the deaths of NHS staff being referred to the Health and Safety Executive for investigation? Hancock says these deaths are being investigated by NHS bodies. They are the employers, and are best placed to know what happened. Q: Should HSE be involved? Hancock says he thinks the NHS should do this. Q: But if someone died because of a shortage of PPE, doesn\u2019t that investigation need to be independent? Hancock says there is an independent process in place - introduced by Hunt when he was health secretary, he says. A total of 837 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 58 from 779 on Thursday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. Sturgeon said 7,409 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 307 from 7,102 the day before. There are 189 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of seven on Thursday, she added. There are 1,799 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Hunt turns to the impact of coronavirus on other aspects of treatment. Q: Is it the case that this is having no impact on cancer treatment? Hancock says that is the government\u2019s policy. He says there are some treatments that would not be safe in the current circumstances, with a deadly virus prevalent. Some cancer treatments take your immunity down to zero. So it would not be safe to use those treatments now. He says this is not a capacity issue; it is a policy issue. But he says there is \u201cone area where I\u2019m really concerned\u201d. There has been a drop off in \u201cfirst presentations\u201d, he says. He says this is a \u201creally big worry\u201d. There are \u201cfar, far fewer people coming forward\u201d. He says the government has spent years encouraging people with cancer symptoms to see a doctor. But that has \u201ccome to a juddering halt\u201d. Anyone with a lump should call the doctor. They will be seen, and seen safely. Q: One doctor has said the delays in cancer treatment could lead to more deaths than from coronavirus. Is that right? Hancock says he thinks that is \u201cunlikely\u201d. But he says there are concerns about the impact coronavirus might have on other people needing treatment. Border Force officers have been seen fitting face masks to people believed to be migrants at Dover on Friday. The Border Force cutter HMC Vigilant has been active in the Channel this morning, PA Media news agency understands, and pictures taken in Dover show the suspected migrants being processed by UK personnel wearing fluorescent jackets. The latest incidents come as the growing Covid-19 threat, a lack of food and the exodus of volunteers has left migrants in northern France in a perilous position, according to a humanitarian charity. Nearly 400 migrants are known to have risked their lives in small boats to try to cross the Channel since lockdown measures were put in place in the UK on 23 March. Q: Have you considered using the extra critical care capacity to intervene with patients earlier? There have been some reports of patients getting oxygen too late? Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, says when patients are first admitted to hospital, they often need oxygen therapy, but not ventilation. Q: Is national guidance being issued on what doctors must do if they need to ration care for clinicians? Hancock says the government has not had to issue this guidance, because the capacity of the NHS has not been reached. The \u201coverwhelming of the NHS\u201d has been avoided, he says. Hancock says NHS has not had to issue guidance on how doctors should choose which patients to prioritise because intensive care capacity is not being exceeded. Hunt says he wants to ask now about treatments. Q: If we conclude a drug is safe, would we speed up the usual regulatory processes? Hancock says so far there have not been any clinical trials that have proved the value of any of the drugs thought to be helpful. But the UK is using some of them, because there is some evidence they are useful. He says this allows some scientific verification. Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, comes in at this point. He says, without randomised control trials, you cannot know what will work. Q: So are you saying you won\u2019t short circuit the need for these trials once you know it is safe? Van-Tam says you need to do trials. You need to know it is safe. You need to know what type of patients it might work best on. And you need to know at what stage of treatment it should be delivered. Q: So we are going to carry on following the normal processes? Van-Tam says Hunt is asking about safety. But some of these drugs might worsen outcomes. That is why trials are so important. Hunt says this amounts to a belt and braces approach. Hancock says that is not right. He says clinical trials are being accelerated faster than usual. Q: Do you accept the claim from the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services that the distribution of PPE nationally has been \u201cshambolic\u201d? Hancock says he thinks the criticism in that letter was unfair. And he says since it was written the government has published a plan for adult social care. Hancock says PPE does have to be certified by the Health and Safety Executive. But he says they have been working rapidly to certify PPE coming in from abroad. Back to the health committee. Q: Will you admit that your claim that only 15% of care homes have coronavirus looks like an understatement? Hancock says this figure is robust. It is based on testing. But he would expect it to rise, he says. Bus travel in London will effectively be free from this Monday, when passengers will all start boarding through the middle door. They will not be required to \u201ctap in\u201d to pay, with most buses now only having Oyster or contactless card readers at the front beside the driver. Transport for London said that a trial of the scheme on 140 buses had demonstrated that the move could allow sufficient physical distancing on buses, with numbers having dropped dramatically during the coronavirus lockdown. Passenger journeys on buses are down 85% in the capital. The change comes after other measures to protect drivers, including installing full protective screens around the cab, sealing off seats near the front, and giving enhanced sick pay to staff to ensure any whose family show symptoms are able to self-isolate for 14 days. Unions welcomed the move, after the deaths of 15 bus drivers and six other transport workers in London from coronavirus. Pete Kavanagh, of Unite London, said: We have lost members of our bus family in recent days and we refuse to lose any more. Claire Mann, TfL\u2019s director of bus operations, said: Even with these significant safety enhancements I would like to remind Londoners to stay at home to ensure that critical workers and London\u2019s bus drivers can get around the city safely. The move to middle-door boarding comes only a matter of weeks after TfL changed all buses, including New Routemasters, to front-door boarding only, ironically to prevent fare evasion, before the Covid-19 crisis. TfL is still in discussions with the government about covering lost revenue across all modes of transport during the lockdown - especially fares from the Underground, which largely fund buses. Back in the health committee Hancock says 11m items of PPE have been shipped from England to Scotland. That shows what a \u201cteam effort\u201d it is, he says. Hunt turns to PPE (personal protective equipment). Q: Are you confident that our hospitals will have enough gowns to get them through the weekend? [The question was prompted by stories like this one.] Hancock says the challenge is considerable. They have gone from needing relatively small numbers to huge numbers. As of this weekend, they will have shipped 1bn items of PPE across the UK. This is a massive undertaking. It is understandable that, with such a massive undertaking, there are challenges. We are tight on gowns. That is the pressure point at the moment. We have another 55,000 gowns arriving today and we\u2019re working on the acquisition internationally of more gowns, but it is a challenge. And this follows changing the guidance 10 days ago which increased the advice on the use of gowns but also said that they should be used for sessional use rather than for individual patient use. And it is a big challenge delivering against that new guidance and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can. He says officials are working through the day and night on this. Q: Will you be able to get gowns to everywhere that needs them this weekend? Hancock says that is exactly what they are aiming to do. Hancock unable to give MPs firm assurance that some hospitals won\u2019t run out of gowns this weekend. In the health committee the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, Yvette Cooper, goes next. Q: Many countries ask people to self-isolate when they arrive in the country. Why doesn\u2019t the UK? Hancock says the UK does have the capacity to do this. But he says the number of people arriving in the country has collapsed. He says the epidemiologists advise that people arriving in the UK are not a significant contribution to transmission. That could change in the future, he says. At the health committee Laura Trott asks what is being done to ensure demand matches supply for test. Hancock says this is a problem that has cropped up this week. At first it looked as if people were not coming forward for testing because of the bank holiday. But now it looks as if the number of NHS staff coming forward was not as high as expected. Within the NHS, the number of staff coming forward for testing is lower than was anticipated. You\u2019ll understand why we had a priority order for the use of the test where it was patients first, then NHS staff. Frankly, the number of NHS staff coming forward wasn\u2019t as high as expected and therefore we extended it very quickly both to residents and staff in social care. That is why it was expanded, to cover social care staff, and other public sector staff today. (See 11.19am.) Because capacity is going up sharply, I\u2019m therefore able to expand it further and we\u2019ll expand it again as soon as the capacity is there to make sure that that capacity is used up. Around 34% of pregnant NHS workers are still working in environments where they feel unsafe due to Covid-19 exposure, a survey of 1,347 pregnant women from charity Pregnant Then Screwed has found. Following the death of Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong who died at eight months pregnant after contracting coronavirus, after stopping work at seven months, Pregnant Then Screwed is campaigning for all pregnant women to be removed from front line work. Joeli Brearley, the charity\u2019s founder, said: Pregnant women should not be working on the frontline. The government has been explicit in telling all pregnant women, no matter their gestation, that they must socially distance. Yet the guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists makes a distinction between women who are before 28 weeks gestation and there after. This is causing huge confusion. We have been campaigning and lobbying for more clarity since the government placed pregnant women into the vulnerable category on the 16 March, but this hasn\u2019t come. We understand the enormous pressure on the NHS at the moment, but there shouldn\u2019t be any more tragedies of pregnant women contracting or dying of the virus. The law is very clear and yet every day we are hearing from pregnant women who are still being forced to work in environments which are not safe, some of whom are treating Covid-19 patients despite the well-documented lack of PPE and the high-risk to them and their unborn child. Back at the health committee Greg Clark, the chair of the science committee, goes next. Q: My committee has been told that 50% of those infected might be asymptomatic. Is that correct? Hancock says, unlike other coronaviruses, Covid-19 does seem to have a large number of people being asymptomatic. He says this is something his officials are looking into. Hancock insists the government is committed to contact tracing. But the amount of contact tracing you need depends on how much transmission there is of the virus, he says. Around 150,000 self-employed people are not eligible for a coronavirus income support scheme because they have worked for themselves only since after the end of the 2018/2019 tax year, according to a report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said 3% of all self-employed people in the UK have become continuously self-employed since April 2019, meaning they may not be eligible for the government\u2019s self-employment income support scheme because they would miss the threshold to prove their past income to receive wage subsidies. Only those who have submitted a tax return for the tax year ending 2019 are eligible for government assistance. The ONS said by the end of last year there were more than five million self-employed people in the UK, up from 3.2 million in 2000. Self-employment has contributed strongly to employment growth in the labour market, with self-employed people representing 15.3% of employment, up from 12% in 2000, said the report. Of all self-employed people, 87% (4.3 million) said that they have been self-employed since before April 2018. A further 9% reported starting self-employment between April 2018 and March 2019. Provided they have submitted a tax return for the tax year ending 2019 and other criteria are met, these people will be eligible for the scheme, although their profits may not be representative of a full year of trading, the ONS said. The estimates will not include people who have become self-employed since the start of 2020 and might under-report the extent of newly self-employed people, the report added. Working for yourself was the most common form of self-employment, as well as running a business or freelancing. Research by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) has highlighted that almost half of self-employed workers fear they will not have enough money to cover basic living costs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Hunt says several officials said at one point that mass community testing was not part of the government\u2019s strategy. Is it part of the strategy. Yes, says Hancock. He says: It is part of the strategy. We will be introducing it when we can. Asked if it was a mistake to give up testing everyone in the middle of March, when the government moved from the contain phase to the delay phase, Hancock says that at that stage the UK did not have the capacity to test everyone. But testing was always being ramped up. And now he does want to be able to test everyone with symptoms, he says. We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible. And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people and we\u2019re building that resource and obviously we need to have the testing and we\u2019re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we\u2019re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are. Hancock says today he can announced that a wider group of key workers will now be able to get tested in testing centres. He says the workers now covered include the police, firefighters, prison staff, local authority workers, the judiciary and DWP staff. An influential group of MPs has called on the government to investigate concerns that cramped and unhygienic conditions in asylum accommodation are putting people at risk of contracting coronavirus. The home affairs select committee has written to Chris Philp, the minister for immigration compliance and the courts, raising concerns about poor conditions in an asylum centre in West Yorkshire that reportedly breached measures to control the spread of Covid-19. The MPs also asked Philp to confirm what steps the Home Office is taking to ensure that the private contractors which manage asylum accommodation are \u201cenabling social distancing, proper hygiene and self-isolation\u201d at other centres. The select committee\u2019s action comes after the Guardian reported that asylum seekers are being made to share cramped rooms and even beds with strangers in hostels during the coronavirus lockdown. Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, called the reports \u201cvery troubling\u201d. She said: It is especially alarming that during the coronavirus pandemic lives are being put at risk as a result of cramped, poor conditions. That significantly increases the risk of spreading coronavirus both within accommodation centres and in the community. There are also serious concerns about hygiene and cleanliness within accommodation. We will continue to monitor reports of conditions in asylum accommodation centres as vulnerable people should not be put at risk. The select committee is due to hear evidence from refugee charities and migration lawyers in the next hearing of its inquiry into the Home Office\u2019s preparations for and response to the Covid-19 pandemic on 21 April. One of those giving evidence, Andy Hewett, head of advocacy at the Refugee Council, said the common practice of making unrelated asylum share rooms was \u201cmaking it impossible to abide by social distancing rules\u201d. He added: The Home Office needs to put in place urgent measures to ensure appropriate accommodation is made available, so that people can live with dignity and keep themselves safe during the pandemic. Hunt turns to testing. Q: How many tests were conducted yesterday? Hancock says the overall number was just over 18,000. Most of those tests were in pillar one (in NHS laboratories). Around 4,000 were in pillar two (in commercial laboratories). Hancock says he has just been given the latest figure for Covid-19-related NHS staff absences. It is 7.1%, not 8% (see 10.53am), he says. Back to the health committee. Q: Shouldn\u2019t you have introduced the lockdown in London earlier? Hancock says the government did consider this. But it decided to apply the restrictions to the whole country at the same time. There were \u201cdifficult judgments\u201d, he says. We did consider having a London-specific lockdown, and decided that it was better to do it across the country as a whole. And that\u2019s for two reasons. The first is that if you put a lockdown in one part of the country, then there\u2019s still travel from there to the rest of the country, so it isn\u2019t as easy as that. And the second reason is that actually one of the really strong things that\u2019s come through this crisis is that the country is acting in lockstep ... To separate off one part of the country from the rest actually has downsides in terms of the national unity that we\u2019ve seen in support for the overall response. Good morning! I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, joining Andrew Sparrow to bring you all the latest UK developments on the coronavirus pandemic as the day unfolds. As always, if you have any tips, advice, comments or suggestions, you\u2019re welcome to get in touch with me, either via email at lucy.campbell@theguardian.com or on Twitter, I\u2019m on @lucy_campbell_. The former Leeds and England defender Norman Hunter has died at the age of 76 after contracting coronavirus. The full story on the footballer is here. Q: Do you have an estimate for the number of NHS staff who have had coronavirus? Hancock says he does not. But he says 8% of staff have been off work because they or a family member have had symptoms. Hunt says that the ONS has reported just 217 coronavirus deaths in care homes. That would be less than 2% of the overall deaths. But Scotland says a quarter of its coronavirus deaths are in care homes. And France says it is half. Is the UK figure accurate? Hancock says the ONS figure is an old number. He goes on: I can tell you with a high degree of confidence that both the number and proportion [of care home deaths] are higher than you say. He says he has asked officials to get a better way of reporting care home deaths. I asked CQC to make sure that we record the data in care homes specifically, of those who are residents of care homes, whether they die in hospital or in the care home, and they started collecting that data yesterday and it will be published very shortly. So I have introduced a new measure that will directly address this question. Q: Are you still saying only 27 NHS staff have died from coronavirus? Hancock says that is the official figure. He says it gets updated three times a week. So the true number will be higher. Q: Will you publish the updates? Yes, says Hancock. And he says he would like to be able to publish a daily figure for the number of deaths of NHS staff. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is now giving evidence. He starts with an opening statement. He says he wants to explain his approach. He says his \u201cbattle plan\u201d has six elements. First, social distancing. He says everyone knows where they are on that. That is \u201cmission critical\u201d for bending the curve down. Second, building up NHS capacity. He says making sure the NHS always has capacity to treat patients is also mission critical. He says there are 2,769 spare critical care beds as of this morning. Third, supply. He says the world has suddenly needed huge amounts of particular items, like PPE, medicines, ventilators, and potential treatments. Fourth, testing. He says he expects the committee to ask about this. He says he puts this in the same category as tracking and contract tracing. It is the combination of the three that matters: test, track and trace. Fifth, treatments. He says if you can treat the disease, then its impact will be lessened. And obviously they are looking for a vaccine. And the sixth part of the plan is shielding. The more you can protect the vulnerable, the safer society will be, he says. Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, tells the health committee that she is \u201cvery worried\u201d about the shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) for nurses. Back in the health committee Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL Institute for Global Health, says there could be 40,000 deaths by the time this wave of coronavirus is over. But even with those numbers, only 10% to 15% of the population might have had the illness, and developed immunity. He says that is why it is crucial to keep the spread of the disease down until a vaccine is ready. UPDATE: Costello also suggested offering incentives to 10% of the population to stay socially isolated in order to get the economy going again. We have to get the economy going and if it means locking down 10% of our population, even giving them incentives to stay in quarantine and with digital apps to help monitor their symptoms and give them support, that\u2019s the way to really keep this going until we get a vaccine and safe herd immunity. Turning away from the health committee for a moment, Abta, the travel industry body (formerly the Association of British Travel Agents) is furious with Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, for suggesting this morning that now is not the time to book a summer holiday. (See 9.20am.) An Abta spokesperson said: It was a thoughtless comment and not based on any facts about what we know today about the future of the pandemic, but it shows complete disregard for the UK travel industry, the hundreds of thousands of people it employs and the struggle it is facing in this current crisis. It would be better if the government focused on taking the necessary steps to support the sector rather than undermining confidence in it. At the health committee Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs committee (who is making a guest appearance - see 9.50am), asks about the implications of coronavirus in the developing world. Costello says countries in Africa will struggle to test. But it is possible that the southern hemisphere could be protected for a few months because of \u201cseasonal issues\u201d, he says. He says developing countries will see a huge increase in unemployment, and debt crises. It is not just a medical crisis, he says. Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL Institute for Global Health, says the UK seems to be facing the highest death rates in Europe. He says the UK was too slow to introduce testing. But he says he does not think the UK necessarily needs 100,000 tests a day. What matters is getting the right people tested, he suggests. Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, tells the Commons health committee that she has heard of cases of nurses driving two hours to a testing centre and then being turned away. What I\u2019m hearing from the front line is nurses are sometimes just driving two hours feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus and driving to a testing station. Sometimes if you haven\u2019t got an appointment you\u2019re turned away only to be told to come back another time. So we need some really clear direction on how we can access testing both in the NHS but more so for social care, because they don\u2019t have the same infrastructure as the NHS. Jeremy Hunt, the committee chair, says he wants to start by getting an update on what is happening on the frontline. Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, says people are working very hard. In intensive care, doctors have only been able to meet the demand by changing the way they work. She says if staff had to spread themselves more thinly, there would be concern about safety being compromised. The Commons health committee hearing (see 9.50am) is just starting. The first three witnesses are: Donna Kinnair, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, and Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL Institute for Global Health. Northern Ireland\u2019s coronavirus death toll is 39 higher than previously reported, official statisticians confirmed. A total of 157 fatalities involving Covid-19 have been recorded on death certificates up to 10 April, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) said. More than two thirds, 109, happened in hospital. Another 41 occurred in care homes and hospices involving 23 separate establishments. The remaining seven happened in people\u2019s homes. The Public Health Agency (PHA) in Northern Ireland had previously reported 118 deaths involving the infection up to 10 April because of differences in how the statistics are gathered, PA reports, which relies on a patient having previously tested positive for the virus. The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, has lodged a formal complaint with BBC Scotland over what he sees as its failure to adequately challenge Scottish National party politicians on their response to the coronavirus outbreak. It is reported this morning that Carlaw was especially angered by a Reporting Scotland interview with the finance secretary, Kate Forbes, after her U-turn on business support to mirror England\u2019s grant scheme. He says the BBC did not challenge her change of stance or mention the fact that his party had been pressing the SNP on the issue. A Scottish Conservative spokesperson said: We have submitted a letter to BBC Scotland highlighting some concerns, and we look forward to working with them to resolve these in future. The Commons health committee is holding what is likely to be a widely-watched evidence session this morning when it questions Matt Hancock, the health secretary, by video link. Hancock is due up at 10.30am. In an unusual move, Jeremy Hunt, the Conservative former health secretary who now chairs the committee, has beefed up his inquisitorial team by inviting four other select committee chairs to participate, alongside the normal members of the committee. The four chairs are Clive Betts (housing), Greg Clark (science), Yvette Cooper (home affairs) and Tom Tugendhat (foreign affairs). This means it might sound more like a meeting of the liaison committee than a normal committee hearing. Before Hancock appears three other leading health experts are giving evidence at 10am. They are: Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of Royal College of Nursing , Dr Alison Pittard, dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and Prof Anthony Costello, professor of global health and sustainable development at UCL Institute for Global Health According to the Daily Telegraph (paywall), Costello will criticise the government\u2019s failure to conduct widespread testing. He will also say that the idea that the UK could relatively quickly build up \u201cherd immunity\u201d to coronavirus is mistaken because research from the Netherlands suggests only a small proportion of the population are getting the exposure to coronavirus in this wave that will give them immunity. Costello told the Telegraph: We won\u2019t get herd immunity if what the latest models show are correct. In the UK we would have to get through another eight to ten waves to get to herd immunity. This study in the Netherlands shows antibody levels are very low in the community and so the idea it is rapidly spreading and giving protection at the same time isn\u2019t there. Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities appear to be disproportionately affected by Covid-19 in the UK. However, we don\u2019t currently have enough public data to be able to understand how many people killed by the virus came from minority ethnic backgrounds. The Guardian\u2019s data editor Caelainn Barr takes a look at this issue as well as the other key information that is missing from the government\u2019s daily death toll. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining Gregory Robinson. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has been doing a round of interviews this morning. Here are the top lines. Shapps said he thought working from home was likely to become common after the coronavirus crisis was over. He said: Well, talking to business leaders like the Northern Powerhouse, for example, we were commenting on the extent to which the world probably will not go back to the way it was before in all manner of ways ... It may well be that in future companies say, actually it has worked pretty well having some of our staff working from remote locations, why don\u2019t we carry on doing that? Actually, why does everybody have to get up and travel during the rush hour at a particular time in the morning? Why don\u2019t we have that distanced through the day? And there may be different ways, both in terms of businesses and organisations, but also to do with the way the government responds, to spread the load better. We should look, as we think about the future, for lessons that we can take away that actually might change the way we can live life in the future a bit for the better. He suggested that it would be a mistake for people to start booking summer holidays now. Asked if people could book a holiday now, he replied: Clearly people will want to see what the trajectory of this disease is in the next few weeks. We\u2019ve just started to see a flattening of that daily, tragic curve that shows the deaths each day ... We are not seeing declines yet. I won\u2019t be booking a summer holiday at this point, let\u2019s put it that way. He played down suggestions that airlines might have to keep middle seats empty when air travel resumes (an idea floated by EasyJet) to allow physical distancing. Asked about this idea, he said: I think it\u2019s the case that given the catastrophic impact on particularly aviation of this virus, with virtually all aviation having stopped, that actually it\u2019s unlikely that passenger numbers, load factors, will be so high in the first place that this will be much of a problem I imagine. When we get more detail, when the scientists have looked at it and we come out of the lockdown in the future, they\u2019ll be in a better position, we\u2019ll all be in a better position to say whether that is an adequate sense of distance or not. He said he disagreed with Sadiq Khan\u2019s call for the government to back mask wearing on public transport. (See 7.53am.) Asked about Khan\u2019s proposal, Shapps said: We need to take this in the round and look at all of the evidence. So it is not the right moment to instruct people, as I saw the London mayor do this morning, to wear them if we are not certain yet that they are going to be advantageous. In fact, he wrote to me about this and said in his letter he recognises that it could be counterproductive, so I don\u2019t think we should be in that space right at this moment. He said that Keir Starmer\u2019s claim that the government was \u201cin limbo\u201d in the absence of Boris Johnson was \u201ccompletely untrue\u201d. He said the cabinet and Cobra were continuing to function properly and that it was \u201csimply not the case that everything\u2019s on standstill\u201d. He went on: There would have been no difference to those decisions [if Johnson had been present] because we have been guided by the scientists and the medical advice. Shapps said it was too early to tell if the UK would end up with a higher coronavirus death toll than other countries. Asked about this, he said: Look, I simply don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I don\u2019t think anyone will know for quite a long time. For example, countries that think they\u2019re out of it \u2013 do they have a second wave? What\u2019s the counter-factor? What\u2019s happened to people who normally might have accessed the NHS? I\u2019ve been concerned to see some of those numbers falling that may have caused illnesses or deaths which perhaps don\u2019t come to light for months or even years. So I think there will be a lot of factors that we\u2019ll need to look at, and again, rather than guessing, we\u2019ll ask people like the Office for National Statistics, the ONS, to tell us, and learn any of the lessons. A video showing dozens of people gathering on Westminster Bridge yesterday evening to clap for the NHS is going viral on Twitter this morning. From Monday, passengers will only be allowed to board London\u2019s buses using the middle door in a new pandemic measure announced by Transport for London. The new measure is being introduced in an effort to protect bus drivers and to keep passengers safe from the coronavirus, the operator said in a statement. Fifteen bus workers in the capital have died after testing positive to Covid-19. TfL\u2019s director of bus operations Claire Mann said: Bus drivers are pivotal in ensuring critical workers like NHS staff and grocery workers can perform the vital roles they do during this national emergency. Their efforts are nothing short of heroic, and it is essential that we leave no stone unturned when looking to protect them. The social media service TikTok has announced a \u00a35m donation to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Foundation\u2019s Covid-19 healthcare support fund, which will provide frontline health and social care staff practical and psychological support both during and after the emergency. The donation follows a spike in the number of TikTok videos being created by and for frontline healthcare workers. TikTok videos celebrating NHS and healthcare workers have amassed 330m views in one month - a 5,000% increase on four weeks ago. Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, said: The whole country has been overwhelmed by the dedication and professionalism of all of our health and social care heroes battling against this global pandemic. I know the extraordinary pressures this virus has brought to professional and private lives, and I\u2019m delighted that TikTok is supporting the RCN Foundation which brings so much support to so many.\u201d Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has said she would deviate from the UK government\u2019s lockdown measures if her advisers told her it was in the best interests of her country. Sturgeon told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: If I was being advised, and if the judgment I was applying to that advice told me that I had to do something different to the rest of the UK because it was right and necessary to continue to control the virus in Scotland, of course I would do that. I think people would find it astounding if I said anything different to that. But I will be driven by what advice, science and my own judgment is telling me the right thing to do is. High-end fashion retailers in the UK, including Burberry, Barbour, Louis Vuitton and David Nieper have stepped up to help meet the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), following reports of ongoing shortages. The firms have all repurposed factories to produce PPE items such as gowns and masks. Burberry CEO Marco Gobbetti said: In challenging times, we must pull together. The whole team at Burberry is very proud to be able to support those who are working tirelessly to combat Covid-19, whether by treating patients, working to find a vaccine solution or helping provide food supplies to those in need at this time. Covid-19 has fundamentally changed our everyday lives, but we hope that the support we provide will go some way towards saving more lives, bringing the virus under control and helping our world recover from this devastating pandemic.\u201d I am running a project to remember those who lost their lives working in hospitals, surgeries and care homes during the coronavirus outbreak. The government says there have been 27 verified deaths of NHS staff during the pandemic, but others have also died. The Guardian has recorded 50 deaths that have been reported in the news, although the true scale of those who lost their lives is likely to be higher, as not all deaths will be in the public domain. If you want to share any further names and stories with us, or feel there are some people we have missed, then please email me at sarah.marsh@theguardian.com. We hope to publicly acknowledge and pay tribute to the people who died working on the frontline of the pandemic, and try to understand the causes behind their deaths. Morrisons and Kellogg\u2019s have partnered with Magic Breakfast to provide 200,000 boxes of cereal to over 12,000 schoolchildren during the Coronavirus lockdown. Manufacturers of cereal, porridge, baked beans and bagels, a supermarket, schools, and delivery companies are all working with Magic Breakfast to reach vulnerable children through this period of crisis. Magic Breakfast usually delivers to 471 schools in disadvantaged areas of the UK, providing meals to children who often arrive to school hungry. In the coming weeks, Magic Breakfast will be arranging deliveries of breakfast food to alternative distribution sites, where schools are closed, and will be working with delivery partners and volunteers to deliver breakfast packs for children to their homes. Joseph Clark-Bland, Charity and Community Specialist at Morrisons said: We are playing our part in feeding the nation and that includes vulnerable young people. We hope these boxes provide fuel to help young people to concentrate on their schooling at this very difficult time.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, also told BBC Breakfast that protective measures for the capital\u2019s bus drivers had gone \u201cabove and beyond\u201d expert advice. He said: It\u2019s heartbreaking, I\u2019ve had 16 bus drivers who have lost their lives, it\u2019s personal to me. It\u2019s really heartbreaking and my condolences to those families. Khan said authorities have introduced protective glass, anti-viral cleaning and passengers sitting away from the driver to keep staff safe, as well as middle-door boarding which will be rolled out from Monday. He added: I\u2019m confident working with the excellent trade unions, we\u2019ve made sure our public transport is as safe as it can be for both passengers and also our staff as well, who deserve a huge credit for keeping public transport running in these difficult times. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan appeared on BBC Breakfast earlier to urge the public to wear non-surgical face masks when they go out. Khan said he is lobbying the government to change its advice on wearing face coverings to add \u201canother layer of protection\u201d to members of the public. In those circumstances where we can\u2019t keep our social distance, we can\u2019t keep two metres apart, think about when you\u2019re using public transport and you really have to, or you\u2019re in a shop and you can\u2019t keep two metres apart. Wearing a non-medical facial covering makes it less likely you may inadvertently give somebody else Covid-19. I want a consistent approach across the country, we don\u2019t want mixed messaging. So I\u2019m lobbying the government\u2019s experts and the government, want them to change their advice and change their guidance so we can have this additional layer of protection. Prince William discussed finding out his father Charles, Prince of Wales, had coronavirus. \u201cAt first I was quite concerned,\u201d he said in regards to his father\u2019s age. \u201cMy father has had many chest infections and colds and if anyone was going to beat this it was going to be him. He had very mild symptoms, but at that age you do worry a bit more.\u201d They also reflected on the high risk faced by older people in the UK who are \u201cgoing to have to isolate for quite some time\u201d, and called Capt Tom Moore, the 99-year-old army veteran who raised more than \u00a315m for NHS, an \u201cabsolute legend\u201d. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spoke to the BBC\u2019s Today programme about the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on mental health. Prince William said: \u201cPressure, stress and isolation are all building up.\u201d They also discussed the effect on NHS frontline workers: NHS are used to dealing with very sad situations. A lot of patients are dying with no family around them and for the frontline NHS workers at their bedsides that is very hard for them. To be able to manage those emotions is going to take some time as well.\u201d England\u2019s fishing industry has been thrown \u201ca lifeline\u201d by the government, with \u00a310m in cash grants to help them stay afloat amid the coronavirus crisis, as the export markets they rely on have collapsed, my colleague Fiona Harvey reports. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, has said Scotland could deviate from the rest of the UK\u2019s lockdown measures if it wished to do so. Blackford told BBC Breakfast: The governments across the United Kingdom, all the devolved administrations and the government in Westminster have worked very closely across the course of the last few weeks and it\u2019s right and proper that that is the case - I think the public expect to see us doing that. But of course the administration in Edinburgh does have devolved powers, we have our own emergency legislation that was put in place four weeks ago, so yes we can do things in our own way.\u201d Of course, we took action when we considered appropriate to close schools in Scotland. So there are powers the first minister, the government and the parliament in Edinburgh has and they\u2019ll use those powers in the interest of the people of Scotland.\u201d That\u2019s only right and proper that we do that, but we\u2019ll seek to work collectively with the government in London.\u201d Good morning, this is Gregory Robinson and I\u2019ll be running the live blog this morning, bringing you the latest news from the UK. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter to share insight or send tips, I\u2019m on @Gregoryjourno or send me an email at gregory.robinson@guardian.co.uk Yesterday, we learned that lockdown measures will continue for at least the next three weeks. Dominic Raab said there was \u2018light at the end of the tunnel\u2019 but it was too early to \u201cease up\u201d quarantine measures that will remain in place in the UK for at least three more weeks. The foreign secretary also laid out five key things that would allow the government to relax lockdown measures, which included getting more resources for the NHS and ensuring adjustments would not allow a second peak in the coronavirus outbreak.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, a group of actors known for their roles as fictional medical professionals on television released a video on Instagram thanking the real doctors on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic, raising money on their behalf.</p> <p>Olivia Wilde of House, Scrubs stars Zach Braff and Donald Faisona, Nurse Jackie\u2019s Edie Falco, Julianna Margulies and Maura Tierney of ER, and others, came together to share a message of support for doctors and nurses, and joked in a way best summed up by Neil Patrick Harris: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, but I was paid to be one on TV.\u201d</p> <p>Basically, they said, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. Listen to the experts.</p> <p>The four-minute video, which attempted to relay no scientific opinions about the merits of this or that hypothetical treatment, was actually more worthwhile than some of the so-called experts we\u2019re seeing on television right now. If nothing else, at the very least the fictional doctors appeared to be abiding by the foundational philosophy of doctors everywhere: first, do no harm.</p> <p>Which brings us to the television doctors appearing on cable news now \u2013 the ones that exist in a bizarre realm halfway between fiction and authenticity.</p> <p>The latest to wade into the waters of fantasy is Dr Phil McGraw, erstwhile beloved television personality, who holds a doctorate in psychology \u2013 an honor for which is not currently licensed to practice \u2013 and has no expertise whatsoever in infectious diseases.</p> <p>Attempting to downplay the threat of Covid-19, McGraw analogized it to other causes of death on Laura Ingraham\u2019s programme on Fox News. \u201cForty-five thousand people a year die from automobile accidents; 480,000 from cigarettes; 360,000 a year from swimming pools, but we don\u2019t shut the country down for that,\u201d he said, overstating that last statistic <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/water-safety/waterinjuries-factsheet.html\">by a factor of 10</a>. \u201cBut yet we\u2019re doing it for this? And the fallout is going to last for years because people\u2019s lives are being destroyed.\u201d</p> <p>The two did not address whether or not swimming accidents are highly contagious.</p> <p>It was unclear why Ingraham didn\u2019t have Dr Anthony S Fauci, leader of the White House coronavirus taskforce, stick around to answer questions after he appeared in a previous segment. Unsurprisingly, her interview with the actual expert was more contentious than the one with the guy who was closer to the Fox News party line: that this is all too much ado about nothing.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the TV personality and surgeon Dr Mehmet Oz had also appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s program to speculate on how many dead children he\u2019d be willing to sacrifice at the altar of the economy.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s start with things that are really critical to the nation, where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble,\u201d Oz told Hannity. \u201cI tell you, schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in the Lancet arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3% in terms of total mortality. And, you know, that\u2019s \u2013 any life is a life lost, but to get every child back into a school where they\u2019re safely being educated, being fed and making the most out of their lives with a theoretical risk in the back side, it might be a trade-off some folks would consider.\u201d (He has since said that he had \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrOz/status/1250896878104969216/\">misspoke</a>\u201d.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1242058758106288128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dr. Oz tells the at-risk Fox &amp; Friends audience that he&#39;s going to share &quot;the protocol&quot; a French doctor used for a scientifically unproven coronavirus treatment. <a href=\"https://t.co/uzRyRGq5sE\">pic.twitter.com/uzRyRGq5sE</a></p>&mdash; Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/revrrlewis/status/1242058758106288128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Oz, who like McGraw is a former Oprah Winfrey protege, has also been featured heavily on NBC\u2019s coverage of the pandemic.

Although he\u2019s changed his tune more recently, back in March Siegel said on Fox News that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/12/weeks-conservative-media-joined-trump-downplaying-threat-coronavirus/\">the more I learn about this, the less there is to worry about.</a>\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1234561866891919363\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donald Trump is handling the coronavirus outbreak better than his predecessors addressed earlier emerging contagions, said Dr. Marc Siegel, professor of medicine at New York University. <a href=\"https://t.co/crhSf4shzI\">https://t.co/crhSf4shzI</a></p>&mdash; Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BreitbartNews/status/1234561866891919363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Dr Drew Pinksy, another celebrity doctor, also <a href=\"https://time.com/5816604/dr-drew-apologizes-coronavirus/\">apologized</a> after a compilation of statements he made in the run-up to the coronavirus were compiled on social media.

      "bodyText": "Last week, a group of actors known for their roles as fictional medical professionals on television released a video on Instagram thanking the real doctors on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic, raising money on their behalf. Olivia Wilde of House, Scrubs stars Zach Braff and Donald Faisona, Nurse Jackie\u2019s Edie Falco, Julianna Margulies and Maura Tierney of ER, and others, came together to share a message of support for doctors and nurses, and joked in a way best summed up by Neil Patrick Harris: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor, but I was paid to be one on TV.\u201d Basically, they said, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. Listen to the experts. The four-minute video, which attempted to relay no scientific opinions about the merits of this or that hypothetical treatment, was actually more worthwhile than some of the so-called experts we\u2019re seeing on television right now. If nothing else, at the very least the fictional doctors appeared to be abiding by the foundational philosophy of doctors everywhere: first, do no harm. Which brings us to the television doctors appearing on cable news now \u2013 the ones that exist in a bizarre realm halfway between fiction and authenticity. The latest to wade into the waters of fantasy is Dr Phil McGraw, erstwhile beloved television personality, who holds a doctorate in psychology \u2013 an honor for which is not currently licensed to practice \u2013 and has no expertise whatsoever in infectious diseases. Attempting to downplay the threat of Covid-19, McGraw analogized it to other causes of death on Laura Ingraham\u2019s programme on Fox News. \u201cForty-five thousand people a year die from automobile accidents; 480,000 from cigarettes; 360,000 a year from swimming pools, but we don\u2019t shut the country down for that,\u201d he said, overstating that last statistic by a factor of 10. \u201cBut yet we\u2019re doing it for this? And the fallout is going to last for years because people\u2019s lives are being destroyed.\u201d The two did not address whether or not swimming accidents are highly contagious. It was unclear why Ingraham didn\u2019t have Dr Anthony S Fauci, leader of the White House coronavirus taskforce, stick around to answer questions after he appeared in a previous segment. Unsurprisingly, her interview with the actual expert was more contentious than the one with the guy who was closer to the Fox News party line: that this is all too much ado about nothing. Earlier this week, the TV personality and surgeon Dr Mehmet Oz had also appeared on Sean Hannity\u2019s program to speculate on how many dead children he\u2019d be willing to sacrifice at the altar of the economy. \u201cLet\u2019s start with things that are really critical to the nation, where we think we might be able to open without getting into a lot of trouble,\u201d Oz told Hannity. \u201cI tell you, schools are a very appetizing opportunity. I just saw a nice piece in the Lancet arguing that the opening of schools may only cost us 2 to 3% in terms of total mortality. And, you know, that\u2019s \u2013 any life is a life lost, but to get every child back into a school where they\u2019re safely being educated, being fed and making the most out of their lives with a theoretical risk in the back side, it might be a trade-off some folks would consider.\u201d (He has since said that he had \u201cmisspoke\u201d.) Oz, who like McGraw is a former Oprah Winfrey protege, has also been featured heavily on NBC\u2019s coverage of the pandemic. And while his scientific expertise may be stronger than McGraw\u2019s, he\u2019s come under no shortage of criticism from colleagues over the years for favoring questionably scientific cures and products. Other doctors favored by Fox News and President Trump have spread a lot of questionable information as well, including Dr Marc Siegel. Although he\u2019s changed his tune more recently, back in March Siegel said on Fox News that \u201cthe more I learn about this, the less there is to worry about.\u201d Dr Drew Pinksy, another celebrity doctor, also apologized after a compilation of statements he made in the run-up to the coronavirus were compiled on social media. He had called the pandemic \u201ca press-induced panic\u201d and said the odds of dying from it were similar to being hit by an asteroid. It can be hard to sort fact from fiction from speculation during these truly frightening times. When the messaging coming from the likes of Doogie Howser MD is, at the very least, more trustworthy than some of the other doctors on TV, it\u2019s all the more scary.",

      "bodyText": "An unprecedented US policy authorizing the summary expulsion of migrants and asylum seekers because of the coronavirus pandemic violates international law, the United Nations has warned. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a sweeping order on 20 March encouraging the immediate deportation of non-citizens arriving overland without valid documents. The order cited an obscure quarantine law to claim the move is justified on public health grounds. In the first 18 days to 8 April, 10,000 people were expelled within two hours of arriving on US soil \u2013 effectively denying them the legal right to seek international protection, according to Customs and Border Protection figures. This amounted to 80% of all migrants and refugees being escorted back over the border into Mexico, where reports of kidnapping, trafficking and assaults by organised crime gangs and corrupt security forces are rife. This novel policy of systematic and rapid expulsions constitutes \u201crefoulement\u201d \u2013 the forcible return of refugees or asylum seekers to a country where they are liable to be subjected to persecution \u2013 which violates US and international laws and treaties designed to protect people at risk of persecution, torture and trafficking. \u201cWe understand that in the current global Covid-19 public health emergency all governments have an obligation to enact measures to protect the health of their populations. While this may warrant extraordinary measures at borders, expulsion of asylum seekers resulting in refoulement should not be among them,\u201d said Chris Boian from the UN Refugee Agency. The vast majority of those expelled were men, women and children from Mexico and Central America\u2019s northern triangle \u2013 El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2013 where a toxic mix of organized crime, state sponsored repression, extreme poverty and impunity has fueled an exodus of citizens in recent years. Since taking power, the Trump administration has employed a variety of legally questionable measures to slash migration and roll back rights for asylum seekers without changing any laws. For instance, since January 2019 tens of thousands of non-Mexican asylum seekers and migrants have been forced back into Mexico under the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols, where they must wait months or years for a court hearing in the US. The new order singles out those without valid travel or immigration documents including asylum seekers for immediate expulsion on public health grounds, meanwhile excluding commerce and people with the correct documents from the same countries. But the quarantine provision of the 1944 Public Health Service Act does not supersede other laws, or allow for selective application based on immigration status. In a recent article for Just Security, the leading immigration law professor Lucas Guttentag, said: \u201cThe CDC order is designed to accomplish under the guise of public health a dismantling of legal protections governing border arrivals that the Trump administration has been unable to achieve under the immigration laws.\u201d As the coronavirus crisis unfolded, Trump initially minimized the gravity until cases and deaths started to escalate in the US, at which point he pivoted to blaming foreign nationals. He has since used the pandemic to justify ramping up construction of the wall on the southern border. There is no evidence of undocumented migrants spreading coronavirus in the US, however, the US has deported dozens of infected migrants to Guatemala. As countries across the world have enacted mitigation measures to tackle the pandemic, the right to freedom of movement has been forcefully restricted by repressive regimes in the northern triangle. Over the past few weeks, Trump has used the daily White House coronavirus briefings to congratulate himself and the Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, for a fall in numbers at the southern border. About 570 people were apprehended every day during the first week of April \u2013 down by almost 50% compared to the first week of March, according to analysis by Adam Isacson, who runs the Washington Office of Latin America\u2019s defense oversight program. If the downward trend continues, April could see the lowest number of apprehensions in 50 years. The controversial border quarantine order, which has been widely condemned by human rights, humanitarian and religious groups, must be renewed every 30 days. Isacson said: \u201cThe danger is that the administration will use coronavirus as a pretext to maintain the expulsions for as long as possible. Right now, not only are courts barely in session, but there\u2019s no litigation happening on this yet because the policy itself is mostly secret and it\u2019s hard to reach plaintiffs on the Mexican side of the border.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A Brazilian judge has banned a group of Christian missionaries from entering a vast Amazon indigenous reserve with the world\u2019s highest concentration of isolated tribes, citing risks from the coronavirus pandemic as one of his reasons. Indigenous leaders and activists hailed the decision as \u201chistoric\u201d and expressed hope that it could prevent a genocide in the Javari valley, a remote reserve the size of Austria on Brazil\u2019s western borders. \u201cFacing with this new coronavirus pandemic we wanted to guarantee the rights of indigenous people to isolation,\u201d said Eliesio Marubo, an indigenous lawyer who sought the ruling on behalf of Javari\u2019s indigenous association Univaja. Federal judge Fabiano Verli banned three missionaries, Andrew Tonkin, Josiah McIntyre and Pastor Wilson de Benjamin, from the reserve, along with the controversial missionary group New Tribes Mission of Brazil which recently bought a helicopter to convert isolated peoples in the region. The judge referred to recent articles about isolated groups\u2019 vulnerability to common diseases that decimated their populations in the past and authorised police and army to expel any of the missionaries found in the reserve. Brazil has so far seen three confirmed Covid-19 deaths among its indigenous population. Specialists from the indigenous agency Funai believe 16 isolated groups could live in the Javari valley. Concerns for their safety soared when a former New Tribes missionary was put in charge of Funai\u2019s isolated indigenous department. Verli wrote that Tonkin, a North American missionary, had been seen in the reserve and noted \u201cclear indications of an attempt at cultural assimilation\u201d of an isolated group. Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper said Tonkin was seen last year trying to make contact with an isolated group from the Korubo tribe using a hydroplane and was preparing a new expedition.

From some good news for a Tamil asylum seeker family to the much-anticipated preview of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s memoir, here are the stories you may have missed over the past week. And here is last week\u2019s list of stories \u2013 in case you missed those. Turnbull on Morrison, Murdoch and the \u2018bonk ban\u2019 The release of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s memoir A Bigger Picture was always going to ruffle some feathers, but it appeared earlier than expected, leaked by the Australian newspaper on Thursday. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor Katharine Murphy said the book was a \u201csweeping account of events from his early childhood in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs to being forced out of the prime ministership in 2018\u201d. Her analysis focused on what Turnbull had to say about his relationship with his successor Scott Morrison, who he claims was playing a \u201cdouble game\u201d. In the book, Turnbull also fires off broadsides against several of his former colleagues, as well as News Corp. Elsewhere, the former PM wrote about his role in Guardian Australia\u2019s origin story, which editor Lenore Taylor addressed here. Biloela family to stay in Australia \u2013 for now Tamil asylum seekers Priya and Nades and their Australian-born daughters, Kopika and Tharunicaa, were granted a reprieve on Friday in their fight against deportation. Known as the Biloela family, after the Queensland town that has campaigned for them to stay, they appealed to the federal court, arguing they had been denied procedural fairness during a visa claim. On Friday, the court found in their favour on that claim, which meant an injunction preventing their deportation would remain in place until final orders were made. The family have been detained on Christmas Island while they fight to stay in Australia. You can read the story here. High court rules AFP warrant for raid on News Corp journalist\u2019s home was invalid Annika Smethurst, a News Corp journalist whose home was raided by police seeking the source of leaked classified material, won a partial victory in a high court case challenging the legality of the search warrant. Smethurst reported on the material in a story outlining a plan to expand powers to spy on Australians. This week, the court quashed the raid warrant but did not order police to destroy the material seized, which may still expose the reporter and her source to prosecution. The Australian Federal Police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, said the material was \u201cquarantined\u201d while police obtained legal advice. News Corp said Smethurst had never revealed her source, not even to her employer. You can read the story here. Pell tells Bolt accuser may have been \u2018used\u2019 George Pell gave his first interview following his release from prison to News Corp columnist and Sky News host Andrew Bolt, who has long supported the cardinal\u2019s case against a now quashed child sexual abuse conviction. In the television appearance, Pell described the complainant who testified against him as a \u201cpoor fellow\u201d and suggested he may have been \u201cused\u201d by others. He did not explain what he meant by the claim. Asked by Bolt why he thinks the complainant made the allegations, Pell said: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The cardinal also made claims of corruption in the Vatican and in Victoria. He suggested he was unpopular among some Vatican officials for his efforts to get the institution\u2019s finances in order. You can read the story here. Victoria police did not use excessive force against innocent man who had arm broken, watchdog finds Victoria\u2019s anti-corruption commission has said force used by police in a raid that left an innocent man with a badly broken arm at an LGBTI bookshop was not disproportionate. Nik Dimopoulos said he was frustrated by the outcome of the one-year investigation into the raid at Hares and Hyenas in May last year, in which officers mistook him for the suspect in a carjacking. Fearing police were intruders, Dimopoulos fled, and his arm was badly broken when members of the critical incident response team restrained him. Victoria\u2019s Ibac found the force\u2019s actions were not disproportionate, but said Dimopoulos\u2019s human rights were affected when police did not inform him of the reason for his arrest.

Jess Hill wins Stella prize for See What You Made Me Do Journalist Jess Hill claimed the $50,000 Stella prize for Australian women\u2019s writing, for her 2019 investigation into domestic abuse, See What You Made Me Do. The four-year investigation was described the judging panel\u2019s chair, Louise Swinn, as \u201cincredibly powerful\u201d work that \u201cmeticulously dismantle[s] all of the lazy old lies we associate with domestic abuse\u201d. In the book, Hill turns the lens on perpetrators, asking: why do abusive men make the choices they do, and what systems of power enable them? The author told the Guardian: \u201cI wanted people to understand what victim-survivors had been through and why they\u2019d made the choices that they\u2019d made.\u201d You can read the story here. Melbourne Facebook group shut down after \u2018revenge porn\u2019 and misogynist abuse posted A boys-only Facebook group was shut down after a user allegedly posted \u201crevenge pornography\u201d of an underage girl. The group amassed at least 6,700 members in about 24 hours, but users who had tried to report it for its offensive content \u2013 which also included shocking misogynist abuse \u2013 received an automated notification from Facebook saying the page would not be removed. It was eventually shut down after Guardian Australia approached the company for comment. You can read the story here.",

The damage was compounded this month when 49 organisations missed out on Australia Council funding \u2013 and compounded again last week, when the federal government denied changes to jobkeeper legislation that would make the benefits more accessible to casual workers and those on short-term contracts (AKA most arts and entertainment workers). But there are small things you can do. For instance: streaming Australian music. Each week, in partnership with Sounds Australia, Guardian Australia will add some 15 brand new songs to a playlist for you to put on repeat. \u201cAustralian music needs all the help it can get right now,\u201d says Dom Alessio from Sounds Australia, who chose the songs for this playlist from artists who\u2019ve played Sound Australia\u2019s events. \u201cStreaming an Australian song might seem like a really small and insignificant thing to do, but artists get paid when you listen to them, and cumulatively it can have a big impact.\u201d",

For people who have been living on the streets for an extended period, the sudden isolation associated with staying indoors can be deeply challenging. \u201cWe\u2019re all of us taking a hit at the moment because we\u2019re withdrawn from the social connections that give us our identity,\u201d Owen says. \u201cThere is a toll we\u2019re going to pay down the road from the mental health issues that are going to emerge and be exacerbated by this. \u201cI had a lady who said to me, \u2018I\u2019ve got to choose between risking getting sick and having suicidal thoughts all day in my household.\u2019 That\u2019s the equation she computes every day in her head. \u201cBut what we are finding out is just even the little 15-minute bursts we\u2019re having on driveways or across doorways and in front yards is a lifeline for people. The shampoo and the toothpaste we drop off is important, but it\u2019s more important to still connect. People are saying \u2018thanks for not forgetting me\u2019.\u201d Donate to the Wayside Chapel emergency appeal",

      "bodyText": "New data suggests that Ecuador\u2019s coronavirus toll may be much higher than previously indicated, after figures revealed a massive jump in deaths in the province at the centre of the country\u2019s devastating outbreak. Since the beginning of March six weeks ago, 10,939 people have died in Guayas province, which includes Ecuador\u2019s largest city, Guayaquil, according to figures released late on Thursday. The region would usually see about 3,000 deaths in a six-week period, with the new figures suggesting that the local death rate has almost quadrupled. In Ecuador as a whole, coronavirus has been confirmed as the cause of only 421 deaths, and is suspected in a further 675, but interior minister Mar\u00eda Paula Romo said the true number was probably much higher. \u201cThe number of deaths is totally out of the ordinary,\u201d she told the Guardian. Ecuador has been one of worst-affected countries in Latin America, overwhelming medical and mortuary services in Guayaquil, where grieving families have been forced to live alongside corpses of loved ones or abandon them in the street. \u201cWe\u2019ve wanted to be open about the statistics for deaths to show a more complete panorama,\u201d Romo said, adding that the full statistics would explain \u201cwhy the funeral services and cemeteries simply could not cope in recent days in Guayaquil and Guayas\u201d. The crisis in Ecuador\u2019s commercial capital has become a warning to Latin America, where many countries have poor health services and high inequality. Last week, authorities in Guayaquil started handing out thousands of cardboard coffins and created a helpline for families who need corpses to be removed from their homes. Nearly 70% of Ecuador\u2019s coronavirus cases have been concentrated in Guayas province, which had 5,777 of the national total of 8,450 cases on Friday. Authorities said nearly 30,000 coronavirus tests had been administered in the country. There are plans to increase capacity to 1,400 tests a day.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The semi-autonomous city took the route that the World Health Organization recommends and embarked on a rigorous programme of testing everyone with symptoms.

      "body": "<p>\u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone.\u201d The cry of the Ancient Mariner, immortalised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, feels particularly apposite today as the world self-isolates. Now the 18th-century poem is set to be reimagined, in a daily online reading by stars from Marianne Faithfull to Iggy Pop, Jeremy Irons and Tilda Swinton for a world audience in lockdown.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ancientmarinerbigread.com/\">Ancient Mariner Big Read</a>, which launches on Saturday and was commissioned by The Arts Institute at Plymouth University, will see the 150-verse poem divided into 40 readings, with readers from Faithfull to Irons each recording three or four verses to be broadcast daily for free. (Faithfull recorded it before being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/04/marianne-faithfull-hospitalised-with-coronavirus\">hospitalised with the coronavirus</a>.) The project will combine the readings with works from major artists including Marina Abramovi\u0107, and refocus on the poem\u2019s \u201curgent ecological message\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe had no idea that we would be pulling this together as all of this happened,\u201d said co-curator Philip Hoare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/24/scienceandnature\">author of Leviathan or, The Whale</a>, winner of the 2009 Samuel Johnson prize. But Hoare said that the Ancient Mariner Big Read would offer \u201ca brand-new digital work of art to be experienced at home \u2013 in a wild voyage into the unknown and watery world\u201d.</p> <p>Coleridge\u2019s poem opens as the Ancient Mariner collars a reluctant Wedding Guest and begins telling him about a disastrous sea voyage. After the Mariner kills an albatross, his ship becomes becalmed. As Coleridge writes, in some of the most famous lines in poetry, the vessel lies \u201cas idle as a painted ship / Upon a painted ocean\u201d, with \u201cWater, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink.\u201d</p> <p>The Mariner is forced to wear the albatross around his neck, and is the only survivor when the ship is visited by a boat bearing Death, prompting his famous cry: \u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide wide sea!\u201d \u2013 a section which is taken on, dramatically, by Faithfull for the Big Read.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"02877d3eea3ecf20f3883902d718c2720a13e81a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02877d3eea3ecf20f3883902d718c2720a13e81a/8_0_1781_2225/800.jpg\" alt=\"The Shallow End by Glenn Brown, one of 40 artists\u2019 images that will be shown each of the 40 readings.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shallow End by Glenn Brown, one of 40 artists\u2019 images that will be shown each of the 40 readings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Brown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first modern work of literature to address the idea of isolation, in the most intense and visceral and scary, but yet strangely uplifting way,\u201d said Hoare. \u201cThe Mariner\u2019s cri de c\u0153ur of \u2018alone, alone\u2019 is part of us now.\u201d</p> <p>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is \u201ca founding fable of our modern age\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are the wedding guests, and the albatross around the Mariner\u2019s neck is an emblem of human despair and our abuse of the natural world. Yet in its beautiful terror there lies a wondrous solution: that we might wake up and find ourselves saved.\u201d</p> <p>Hoare is curating the project with artist Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, director of the Arts Institute. The three previously worked together on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/15/moby-dick-captures-stars-big-read\">Moby-Dick Big Read</a>, which saw figures including David Cameron and Stephen Fry join forces to read the entire novel aloud. It has gathered more 10m hits since first being broadcast in 2013.</p> <p>Other contributors to the Coleridge read will include Hilary Mantel and Lemn Sissay, each chosen because they have a backstory that reacts with the poem, said Hoare.</p> <p>Iggy Pop, for example, delivered a \u201croaring, graphic, growling\u201d reading: \u201cHe is the modern Ancient Mariner. He even looks like he\u2019s been on a raft in the Pacific for six months. And he brings his own story \u2013 let\u2019s face it, he had his own drug issues, as Coleridge did.\u201d More major names will be revealed as the project progresses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8caec9385117579f4e409601ed3d65a560f56710\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8caec9385117579f4e409601ed3d65a560f56710/87_62_1850_1850/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medusa West by Yinka Shonibare, another of the artworks in the project.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medusa West by Yinka Shonibare, another of the artworks in the project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yinka Shonibare</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The readings will be accompanied with work by artists including Yinka Shonibare, and paired with relevant scientific research in fields including marine science and climate breakdown. Once the poem is complete, it will be accompanied by a soundscape from electronic musician Jay Auborn, featuring field recordings of albatrosses and creaking ice from the Antarctic.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough written 200 years ago, the Mariner is more pertinent than ever, forewarning us at our own peril about the abuse of nature, and how we are all interconnected,\u201d said Cockayne, a lecturer at Bath Spa University.</p> <p>She pointed to the \u201cprophetic but eternally hopeful\u201d ending to the poem, later used in the well-known hymn, in which the Mariner advises the Wedding Guest: \u201cHe prayeth well, who loveth well / Both man and bird and beast. // He prayeth best, who loveth best / All things both great and small.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis contemporary voyage draws together a talented interdisciplinary crew, working in film, photography, drawing, painting, and sculpture,\u201d said Cockayne. \u201cThe outcome is breathtaking, a circular journey of loss, grief and retribution but also one of hope for our troubled times.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone.\u201d The cry of the Ancient Mariner, immortalised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, feels particularly apposite today as the world self-isolates. Now the 18th-century poem is set to be reimagined, in a daily online reading by stars from Marianne Faithfull to Iggy Pop, Jeremy Irons and Tilda Swinton for a world audience in lockdown. The Ancient Mariner Big Read, which launches on Saturday and was commissioned by The Arts Institute at Plymouth University, will see the 150-verse poem divided into 40 readings, with readers from Faithfull to Irons each recording three or four verses to be broadcast daily for free. (Faithfull recorded it before being hospitalised with the coronavirus.) The project will combine the readings with works from major artists including Marina Abramovi\u0107, and refocus on the poem\u2019s \u201curgent ecological message\u201d. \u201cWe had no idea that we would be pulling this together as all of this happened,\u201d said co-curator Philip Hoare, author of Leviathan or, The Whale, winner of the 2009 Samuel Johnson prize. But Hoare said that the Ancient Mariner Big Read would offer \u201ca brand-new digital work of art to be experienced at home \u2013 in a wild voyage into the unknown and watery world\u201d. Coleridge\u2019s poem opens as the Ancient Mariner collars a reluctant Wedding Guest and begins telling him about a disastrous sea voyage. After the Mariner kills an albatross, his ship becomes becalmed. As Coleridge writes, in some of the most famous lines in poetry, the vessel lies \u201cas idle as a painted ship / Upon a painted ocean\u201d, with \u201cWater, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink.\u201d The Mariner is forced to wear the albatross around his neck, and is the only survivor when the ship is visited by a boat bearing Death, prompting his famous cry: \u201cAlone, alone, all, all alone, / Alone on a wide wide sea!\u201d \u2013 a section which is taken on, dramatically, by Faithfull for the Big Read. \u201cIt\u2019s the first modern work of literature to address the idea of isolation, in the most intense and visceral and scary, but yet strangely uplifting way,\u201d said Hoare. \u201cThe Mariner\u2019s cri de c\u0153ur of \u2018alone, alone\u2019 is part of us now.\u201d The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is \u201ca founding fable of our modern age\u201d, he said. \u201cWe are the wedding guests, and the albatross around the Mariner\u2019s neck is an emblem of human despair and our abuse of the natural world. Yet in its beautiful terror there lies a wondrous solution: that we might wake up and find ourselves saved.\u201d Hoare is curating the project with artist Angela Cockayne and Sarah Chapman, director of the Arts Institute. The three previously worked together on the Moby-Dick Big Read, which saw figures including David Cameron and Stephen Fry join forces to read the entire novel aloud. It has gathered more 10m hits since first being broadcast in 2013. Other contributors to the Coleridge read will include Hilary Mantel and Lemn Sissay, each chosen because they have a backstory that reacts with the poem, said Hoare. Iggy Pop, for example, delivered a \u201croaring, graphic, growling\u201d reading: \u201cHe is the modern Ancient Mariner. He even looks like he\u2019s been on a raft in the Pacific for six months. And he brings his own story \u2013 let\u2019s face it, he had his own drug issues, as Coleridge did.\u201d More major names will be revealed as the project progresses. The readings will be accompanied with work by artists including Yinka Shonibare, and paired with relevant scientific research in fields including marine science and climate breakdown. Once the poem is complete, it will be accompanied by a soundscape from electronic musician Jay Auborn, featuring field recordings of albatrosses and creaking ice from the Antarctic. \u201cAlthough written 200 years ago, the Mariner is more pertinent than ever, forewarning us at our own peril about the abuse of nature, and how we are all interconnected,\u201d said Cockayne, a lecturer at Bath Spa University. She pointed to the \u201cprophetic but eternally hopeful\u201d ending to the poem, later used in the well-known hymn, in which the Mariner advises the Wedding Guest: \u201cHe prayeth well, who loveth well / Both man and bird and beast. // He prayeth best, who loveth best / All things both great and small.\u201d \u201cThis contemporary voyage draws together a talented interdisciplinary crew, working in film, photography, drawing, painting, and sculpture,\u201d said Cockayne. \u201cThe outcome is breathtaking, a circular journey of loss, grief and retribution but also one of hope for our troubled times.\u201d",

War veteran raises \u00a320m for health service Capt Tom Moore, the British second world war veteran who sought sponsorship to walk 100 laps of his garden before his 100th birthday, has now raised more than \u00a320m for National Health Service charities. Moore has been hailed as a \u201cone-man fundraising machine\u201d by the Duke of Cambridge. Chile to become first country to issue \u2018immunity cards\u2019 Chile will become the first country to issue \u201cimmunity cards\u201d to those who have recovered from Covid-19, exempting holders from quarantine so that they can return to work. Chile\u2019s health minister announced that some of the cards will be issued according to the presence of antibodies to the virus, despite difficulties in producing reliable tests. French death toll exceeds 18,000 According to the most recent official data, 18,681 people have now died in France; an increase of 761 in 24 hours. The death toll in hospitals rose to 11,478 from 11,060, while fatalities in nursing homes rose to 7,203 from 6,860 on Thursday. US using pandemic to unlawfully expel asylum seekers, says UN An unprecedented US policy that uses the pandemic as grounds to summarily expel people who have migrated to or sought asylum in the country violates international law, the United Nations warns. More than 14,000 have died in UK hospitals The British government announced that a further 847 people have died in UK hospitals, taking the total to 14,576 since the outbreak began. That represents slightly decelerated growth. But the figures do not take into account those who have died in other settings. Nearly 100,000 EU citizens remain stranded The European commission says 98,900 EU citizens are still stuck abroad, though efforts to bring them home continue. That compares with 600,000 who had reported being stranded at the start of the outbreak. The figures reveal the UK government has made sparing use of the EU programme to repatriate citizens, under which the bloc funds 75% of the cost of emergency flights. Health workers to run out of protective gear Health bosses in England are preparing to ask doctors and nurses to work without full-length gowns when treating patients, as hospitals are set to run out of supplies within hours.",
