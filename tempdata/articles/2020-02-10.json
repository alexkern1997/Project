Public health is at risk if health is not made a priority in the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, according to the Brexit Health Alliance (BHA), an umbrella group led by the NHS Confederation which encompasses the NHS, medical research, industry, patients and public health bodies. The BHA has urged the government to prioritise continued cooperation with key EU agencies, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and access platforms like the early warning and response system to deal with serious cross-border public health threats, such as pandemics and infectious diseases. \u201cInfectious diseases do not respect borders and we need to tackle them together,\u201d said Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation and BHA co-chair. \u201cIt is in all our interests to maintain these vital links between the UK and the EU not least because working together we are more likely to trace and tackle serious outbreaks effectively.\u201d Last week Boris Johnson said there was \u201cno need\u201d for a free trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules and has previously stated that the UK could \u201cdevelop separate and independent policies\u201d in a range of fields.

      "body": "<p>At time of publication, the coronavirus had infected close to 40,000 people, the vast majority of them in China, killed more than 800 and spread to almost 30 countries. Given China\u2019s huge importance to the global economy, the ripple effect could be choppy and lasting.</p> <h2>Why is China so important to the global economy?</h2> <p>China\u2019s extraordinary economic surge over the past 40 years has resulted in it becoming the world\u2019s second biggest economy, with a GDP of $13.6tn (\u00a310.4tn) (compared with $20.5tn for the US). Annualised growth of 7% and more \u2013 way beyond the capacity of developed economies \u2013 has become the norm.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T10:33:18/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/feb/2020-02-07T10:33:18/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>China reached this position by supplanting the US as the fulcrum of global trade. Beijing is the largest trader of merchandise in the world, and is fast catching the US in commercial services following an 18% growth spurt in 2018. The long-held practice of sourcing components and widgets from Chinese companies, and the country\u2019s vast and growing domestic market, has encouraged thousands of foreign businesses to open their own factories on the mainland, join local distribution networks and open shops.</p> <p>China is also central to a diverse range of global supply chains: much of the world\u2019s raw materials travel to China before being turned into a manufactured product. Last year\u2019s battle with the US over import tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods illustrated the power of the Chinese economy to disrupt and disturb the global outlook.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d864b08a2ad647fc169930aaca1a0a54012d0059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d864b08a2ad647fc169930aaca1a0a54012d0059/0_0_5073_3043/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese residents line up to get a free protective mask at a local pharmacy in Beijing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chinese residents line up to get a free protective mask at a local pharmacy in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Frayer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So how is the virus affecting economic activity within China?</h2> <p>Most industries in China shut down over the two weeks around the lunar new year. The majority of factories were not expected to open again until this weekend and some have delayed opening until 14 February as a precaution, as tens of millions of people remained locked down in dozens of cities across the country. </p> <p>Carmakers are shutting plants, coffee outlets are closed and ports are far quieter than usual. Small and medium-sized businesses, which operate on short-term contracts and with only small financial and physical reserves, are known to already be in trouble. Reports from regions across China\u2019s central belt tell of livestock farmers only days away from running out of feed.</p> <p>Wuhan, a city of about 11 million people and centre of the outbreak, is a large industrial centre, a regional hub, an important cog in the automotive industry and a magnet for foreign firms. It is the third largest education and scientific base in China, with two top-10 universities. It is impossible to think that weeks of standstill will not have a considerable impact on economic output. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged as much last week. In response, the authorities are redoubling efforts to shore up the economy, slashing tariffs on US imports, and making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b65de0e661bea8fe8ee9b57d0696aca6f40f51d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b65de0e661bea8fe8ee9b57d0696aca6f40f51d3/0_143_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"worker in the Everwin precision technology factory in Dongguan, Guangdong Province\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker in the Everwin precision technology factory in Dongguan, Guangdong province, which produces casings for phones, tablets and laptops for Apple, Samsung and Huawei, among others.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aleksandar Plavevski/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>So what might the overall impact on China be?</h2> <p>China\u2019s economy grew by 6% last year according to Beijing\u2019s official statistics agency, which was the lowest rate for almost 30 years and a big drop from the 10.2% achieved in 2010. There were hopes that 2020 would prove to be a period of recovery following a protracted trade war during 2019 with the US Trump administration.</p> <p>The coronavirus makes that unlikely. Most analysts are still predicting growth well above 5% for the Chinese economy, based on what is known so far about the virus\u2019s spread, and the likely impact on consumers, businesses and government.</p> <p>But Zhang Ming, an official in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is gloomier. He told Caijing magazine: \u201cGDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 could be about 5%, and we cannot rule out the possibility of falling below 5%.\u201d</p> <p>Gloomier still is the Enodo Economics chief economist, Diana Choyleva, who believes China\u2019s real growth rate figure for 2019 was probably nearer 3.7% and this year will be lower than that. Some particularly gloomy analysts are warning the worse case scenario could be economic contraction.</p> <p>Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Choyleva points to the huge overhang of bad debts that plague China\u2019s ageing state-run industries, as a drag on growth over several years. China\u2019s central bank has begun to pump extra funds into the economy to maintain borrowing while the virus takes hold, mainly to boost business investment, but Choyleva said these funds, while they are cheap and plentiful, are mainly used to keep zombie companies from going bust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa5a5791268e63f9f963eb9f14be8f82dba73ed9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa5a5791268e63f9f963eb9f14be8f82dba73ed9/0_117_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cargo ship loaded with containers makes its way into a port in Qingdao in China\u2019s eastern Shandong province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A cargo ship loaded with containers makes its way into a port in Qingdao in China\u2019s eastern Shandong province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Which industries are most vulnerable?</h2> <p>The first sectors to reel from the outbreak were the travel and tourism industries, which usually enjoy a boom during the new year holiday period. Cancelled flights and hotel bookings in China and across the Asia region, which relies on Chinese tourists, have followed the clampdown on travel to and from the big cities of China\u2019s central belt and even from the mainland to Hong Kong. Airlines have scaled back services: Cathay Pacific plans to cut flight numbers by one-third over coming weeks and has encouraged staff to take weeks of unpaid leave.</p> <p>Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cPassenger numbers have fallen by 55% compared with the lunar new year period in 2019. And given that <a href=\"https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/emerging-markets-economics/emerging-markets-economics-update/how-important-is-chinese-tourism/\">Chinese tourists spend a lot in Asian countries</a>, the costs of travel bans will be felt throughout the region.</p> <p>If the crisis persists, the global effect will be palpable. The Chinese <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IFM_Economist/status/1225554515098787846\">made 173m visits in the 12 months to end of September last year</a> and together they spent <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/chinese-tourists-spent-250-billion-in-2017/\">more than a quarter of a trillion dollars</a> \u2013 more than any other country.</p> <p>But tourism is just the start. Entire supply chains \u2013 automotive, electronic, industrial \u2013 are starting to creak. Shipping companies are reporting a sharp drop in container volumes. China also has a huge domestic market for retail and food and beverages. One indicator that really hit the skids last week, partly as a result of the virus, was the price of coffee. Starbucks alone has 4,000 outlets in China. Half of them were closed by the outbreak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18602938762c6134f8d0fd24c1a24665c86edd02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18602938762c6134f8d0fd24c1a24665c86edd02/0_264_5732_3440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women wearing face masks walk past a bank\u2019s electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women wearing face masks walk past a bank\u2019s electronic board showing the Hong Kong share index.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincent Yu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What about the stock market and other key indicators?</h2> <p>Asian stock markets endured a seesaw week last week, tumbling early because of a slump in retail, consumer services and transport businesses, before recovering amid hopes that the virus outbreak could be contained.

      "bodyText": "At time of publication, the coronavirus had infected close to 40,000 people, the vast majority of them in China, killed more than 800 and spread to almost 30 countries. Given China\u2019s huge importance to the global economy, the ripple effect could be choppy and lasting. Why is China so important to the global economy? China\u2019s extraordinary economic surge over the past 40 years has resulted in it becoming the world\u2019s second biggest economy, with a GDP of $13.6tn (\u00a310.4tn) (compared with $20.5tn for the US). Annualised growth of 7% and more \u2013 way beyond the capacity of developed economies \u2013 has become the norm. China reached this position by supplanting the US as the fulcrum of global trade. Beijing is the largest trader of merchandise in the world, and is fast catching the US in commercial services following an 18% growth spurt in 2018. The long-held practice of sourcing components and widgets from Chinese companies, and the country\u2019s vast and growing domestic market, has encouraged thousands of foreign businesses to open their own factories on the mainland, join local distribution networks and open shops. China is also central to a diverse range of global supply chains: much of the world\u2019s raw materials travel to China before being turned into a manufactured product. Last year\u2019s battle with the US over import tariffs on billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods illustrated the power of the Chinese economy to disrupt and disturb the global outlook. So how is the virus affecting economic activity within China? Most industries in China shut down over the two weeks around the lunar new year. The majority of factories were not expected to open again until this weekend and some have delayed opening until 14 February as a precaution, as tens of millions of people remained locked down in dozens of cities across the country. Carmakers are shutting plants, coffee outlets are closed and ports are far quieter than usual. Small and medium-sized businesses, which operate on short-term contracts and with only small financial and physical reserves, are known to already be in trouble. Reports from regions across China\u2019s central belt tell of livestock farmers only days away from running out of feed. Wuhan, a city of about 11 million people and centre of the outbreak, is a large industrial centre, a regional hub, an important cog in the automotive industry and a magnet for foreign firms. It is the third largest education and scientific base in China, with two top-10 universities. It is impossible to think that weeks of standstill will not have a considerable impact on economic output. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged as much last week. In response, the authorities are redoubling efforts to shore up the economy, slashing tariffs on US imports, and making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. So what might the overall impact on China be? China\u2019s economy grew by 6% last year according to Beijing\u2019s official statistics agency, which was the lowest rate for almost 30 years and a big drop from the 10.2% achieved in 2010. There were hopes that 2020 would prove to be a period of recovery following a protracted trade war during 2019 with the US Trump administration. The coronavirus makes that unlikely. Most analysts are still predicting growth well above 5% for the Chinese economy, based on what is known so far about the virus\u2019s spread, and the likely impact on consumers, businesses and government. But Zhang Ming, an official in the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, is gloomier. He told Caijing magazine: \u201cGDP growth in the first quarter of 2020 could be about 5%, and we cannot rule out the possibility of falling below 5%.\u201d Gloomier still is the Enodo Economics chief economist, Diana Choyleva, who believes China\u2019s real growth rate figure for 2019 was probably nearer 3.7% and this year will be lower than that. Some particularly gloomy analysts are warning the worse case scenario could be economic contraction. Importantly, investors hoping for a decisive rebound once the outbreak is contained are likely to be disappointed. Choyleva points to the huge overhang of bad debts that plague China\u2019s ageing state-run industries, as a drag on growth over several years. China\u2019s central bank has begun to pump extra funds into the economy to maintain borrowing while the virus takes hold, mainly to boost business investment, but Choyleva said these funds, while they are cheap and plentiful, are mainly used to keep zombie companies from going bust. Which industries are most vulnerable? The first sectors to reel from the outbreak were the travel and tourism industries, which usually enjoy a boom during the new year holiday period. Cancelled flights and hotel bookings in China and across the Asia region, which relies on Chinese tourists, have followed the clampdown on travel to and from the big cities of China\u2019s central belt and even from the mainland to Hong Kong. Airlines have scaled back services: Cathay Pacific plans to cut flight numbers by one-third over coming weeks and has encouraged staff to take weeks of unpaid leave. Neil Shearing, the chief economist at Capital Economics, said: \u201cPassenger numbers have fallen by 55% compared with the lunar new year period in 2019. And given that Chinese tourists spend a lot in Asian countries, the costs of travel bans will be felt throughout the region. If the crisis persists, the global effect will be palpable. The Chinese made 173m visits in the 12 months to end of September last year and together they spent more than a quarter of a trillion dollars \u2013 more than any other country. But tourism is just the start. Entire supply chains \u2013 automotive, electronic, industrial \u2013 are starting to creak. Shipping companies are reporting a sharp drop in container volumes. China also has a huge domestic market for retail and food and beverages. One indicator that really hit the skids last week, partly as a result of the virus, was the price of coffee. Starbucks alone has 4,000 outlets in China. Half of them were closed by the outbreak. What about the stock market and other key indicators? Asian stock markets endured a seesaw week last week, tumbling early because of a slump in retail, consumer services and transport businesses, before recovering amid hopes that the virus outbreak could be contained. Western markets largely followed suit. But oil prices came under pressure too, amid anticipation of a slowdown in global demand, as did other raw materials. China is the world\u2019s largest crude importer and also a big consumer of metals such as copper and iron ore. Travel companies, carmakers and luxury product outlets were among the most volatile sectors. What do precedents tell us about the likely economic toll? In 2002-03, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing about 750. There are estimates that put the damage from Sars at anything between $30bn and $50bn \u2013 big numbers, but a drop in the ocean compared with global GDP which even then was worth about $35tn. The coronavirus is spreading at a rate six times faster than Sars, mostly through human contact between people not yet showing symptoms. China is a much more open economy than it was even in 2002, and so the disruption is expected to be greater than that caused by Sars. Which worldwide companies would be worst affected by a China slump? Many global companies rely on suppliers based in China. For example, 290 of Apple\u2019s 800 suppliers are based in China and the country is responsible for 9% of global TV production.

Apple is supplied from factories in China and has a network of 42 Apple stores that it says will remain closed until 9 February. Other US retailers from Starbucks (4,200 shops) to Levi\u2019s have closed their stores, though Levi\u2019s only closed half its complement and China only accounts for 3% of its global sales. \u2026 and which countries? South-east Asia is most exposed, so tightly are local economies tied to the Chinese behemoth. (It\u2019s worth remembering that Asia\u2019s worst postwar financial crisis in 1997-98 was partly blamed on the devaluation of the Chinese currency). Japan may be a richer economy, but it too is exposed. China is a big buyer of Japan\u2019s industrial machines, its cars and trucks and technologically advanced consumer goods.

Already Japan is bracing for cancellations from 400,000 people in the first quarter of 2020. Australia\u2019s economy is tightly interconnected with China too, and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, warned last week of \u201ca real weight on the economy\u201d. Even Australian universities are suffering because far fewer Chinese students have returned to enrol for the new academic year. How might Britain be affected? The UK, like other European countries, is in a position to limit the flow of Chinese visitors without a huge impact on the economy, though designer outlet shopping centres such as Oxfordshire\u2019s Bicester Village will see a severe downturn if Chinese visitors stay away for any length of time. The broader impact will be felt if global trade, as expected, begins to slow. Britain is plugged in to the all the big economies and for that reason always catches a cold when the global economy sneezes. Last year UK manufacturing went into recession in response to the tariff war between the US and China, which hit global trade. Could it derail the US economy sufficiently to affect the election this autumn? There is anecdotal evidence that the impact of the virus is rippling through small American businesses. US companies may find it difficult to access components for their manufactured goods, plunging a recovering manufacturing sector back into the long recession it suffered last year. Factory closures or shutdowns in the US heartland states of Ohio and Pennsylvania could cause problems for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, which relied heavily on bringing industrial jobs to these states. But November is still nine months away, and as yet it is hard to say whether the effects of the virus will last that long. So what will be the overall impact on the global economy? Economists are cautiously speculating that the perhaps 0.3 percentage points may be shaved off global growth, though it would remain somewhere around the 3% mark. Christian Keller, the head of economics research at Barclays, said the impact on the world economy could range from almost no change to his current global growth forecast of 3.3% for 2020 to growth of about 3%. Others are gloomier still, warning that if the virus continues to spread and Chinese activity remains deeply disrupted for months, a contraction of the global economy is not impossible, particularly as central banks have little effective monetary ammunition for emergencies. \u201cThere is a risk that an adverse feedback mechanism and limited space for policy response could push the global economy towards recession,\u201d said Keller.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this Monday morning.</p> \n<p>Sinn F\u00e9in is celebrating what looks like being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/sinn-fein-to-try-to-form-ruling-coalition-after-irish-election-success\">a remarkable upset victory in the Irish election</a> that could see the former political wing of the IRA form a government in the republic. With 96% of first-preference votes counted last night, Sinn F\u00e9in had 24.1%, with Fianna F\u00e1il on 22.1%, Fine Gael on 22.1% and Greens on 7.4%. The party\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told a raucous gathering of supporters in Dublin that they had witnessed a \u201crevolution\u201d and that Ireland no longer had a two-party system. She added that she would try to form a coalition with the Greens and some small leftwing parties but did not rule out talks with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the two established parties that have ruled Ireland between them for nearly 100 years. Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018, said Sinn F\u00e9in would use its mandate to plan for its defining goal, a united Ireland. The final allocation of seats in the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann might not be known until later today or tomorrow.</p> \n<p>Our Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, examines how Sinn F\u00e9in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/09/irish-voters-have-made-sinn-fein-mainstream-election\">rode a wave of voter anger</a> about homelessness, high cost of living and disillusion with the traditional parties to spring what was a surprise result.

The bad weather is forecast to continue today with blizzards expected in Northern Ireland and most of Scotland along with 20cm of snow. There is also a snow and ice warning in place for north-west England for today and tomorrow with the unsettled weather likely to cause delays on morning commutes today due to blocked roads and cancellations of flights and train services.

Sinn F\u00e9in is celebrating what looks like being a remarkable upset victory in the Irish election that could see the former political wing of the IRA form a government in the republic. With 96% of first-preference votes counted last night, Sinn F\u00e9in had 24.1%, with Fianna F\u00e1il on 22.1%, Fine Gael on 22.1% and Greens on 7.4%. The party\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told a raucous gathering of supporters in Dublin that they had witnessed a \u201crevolution\u201d and that Ireland no longer had a two-party system. She added that she would try to form a coalition with the Greens and some small leftwing parties but did not rule out talks with Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, the two established parties that have ruled Ireland between them for nearly 100 years. Gerry Adams, who stepped down as party leader in 2018, said Sinn F\u00e9in would use its mandate to plan for its defining goal, a united Ireland. The final allocation of seats in the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann might not be known until later today or tomorrow. Our Ireland correspondent, Rory Carroll, examines how Sinn F\u00e9in rode a wave of voter anger about homelessness, high cost of living and disillusion with the traditional parties to spring what was a surprise result. You can also read his profile of McDonald here. * * * Ciara chaos \u2013 Britain is facing widespread disruption this morning after Storm Ciara battered large areas of the country, leaving flooding, power cuts and major disruptions to transport in its wake. The bad weather is forecast to continue today with blizzards expected in Northern Ireland and most of Scotland along with 20cm of snow. There is also a snow and ice warning in place for north-west England for today and tomorrow with the unsettled weather likely to cause delays on morning commutes today due to blocked roads and cancellations of flights and train services. The main line between Manchester and Scotland was closed and Network Rail said engineers would work through the night to assess the damage. The storm dumped a month and a half\u2019s rainfall on some areas in just 24 hours and also brought gusts of more than 90 miles per hour. Check out or picture gallery on the storm here, or watch this video of Britain being battered by Ciara. * * * Korea high \u2013 The 2020 Oscars belonged to Parasite, the Korean film that has become the first foreign language film to win the best picture award. Not only that, the film\u2019s director, Bong Joon-ho, won the prestigious best director prize, and the movie also picked up the statuette for best original screenplay and best international film. The black comedy saw off big-name opposition from Sam Mendes\u2019s 1917 and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, although the latter did win some recognition when Brad Pitt took home best supporting actor. Laura Dern won best supporting actress for Marriage Story. Joaquin Phoenix won best actor for The Joker and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger triumphed for her portrayal of Judy Garland in Judy. You can read a full list of winners here and get up to date with the red carpet action here. * * * Virus warning \u2013 Sixty new cases of the coronavirus have been confirmed on the cruise ship docked off Yokohama in Japan. It brings the number of infections on board the Diamond Princess to 130. The head of the World Health Organization says \u201cwe may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg\u201d with regards to the spread of the coronavirus. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who dispatched a team of experts to China today, said there were \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of the virus\u2019s spread from people with no travel history to China. In China, where the death toll from the outbreak has jumped to 908 with 40,000 cases, authorities began to oversee a partial return to work for millions of people furloughed last week in an attempt to contain the contagion.

      "body": "<p>New coronavirus cases detected in the UK and Mallorca are linked to a cluster in a ski resort in France, health officials have confirmed.</p> \n<p>On Sunday the UK\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said one of the new cases \u2013 the fourth in England \u2013 was a known contact of a previously confirmed UK case. He also said the virus was passed on in France. The latest patient is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London.</p> \n<p>The new case in England is linked to a cluster of cases affecting five Britons, including a nine-year-old child, who are in hospital in France. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals.</p> \n<p>Jerome Salomon, a French senior health official, said in a televised statement: \u201cWe learned that there were two other cases linked to this cluster, two adults \u2013 one who was diagnosed in the United Kingdom and the other who was diagnosed in Mallorca \u2013 linked to a stay in the apartment in Les Contamines-Montjoie.\u201d</p> \n<p>The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort area near Mont Blanc when they were visited by a British man on 24 January who had attended a business conference in Singapore, where he is believed to have contracted the virus.</p> \n<p>The event at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore was hosted by Servomex, a UK gas analysis company, the Singapore newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported.</p> \n<p>The British national, reported to be a middle-aged man from Brighton, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/third-person-in-uk-confirmed-as-having-coronavirus\">found to have the virus</a> when he returned to the UK at the end of last month. He returned to London Gatwick Airport from Geneva on 28 January on an easyJet flight.</p> \n<p>In a statement, easyJet said Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to Gatwick on 28 January to provide guidance in line with procedures.</p> \n<p>The airline added: \u201ceasyJet has been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the Coronavirus.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others on board the flight is very low.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline\u2019s highest priority.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14 day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice.

      "bodyText": "New coronavirus cases detected in the UK and Mallorca are linked to a cluster in a ski resort in France, health officials have confirmed. On Sunday the UK\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said one of the new cases \u2013 the fourth in England \u2013 was a known contact of a previously confirmed UK case. He also said the virus was passed on in France. The latest patient is being treated at the Royal Free hospital in London. The new case in England is linked to a cluster of cases affecting five Britons, including a nine-year-old child, who are in hospital in France. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals. Jerome Salomon, a French senior health official, said in a televised statement: \u201cWe learned that there were two other cases linked to this cluster, two adults \u2013 one who was diagnosed in the United Kingdom and the other who was diagnosed in Mallorca \u2013 linked to a stay in the apartment in Les Contamines-Montjoie.\u201d The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Alpine resort area near Mont Blanc when they were visited by a British man on 24 January who had attended a business conference in Singapore, where he is believed to have contracted the virus. The event at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore was hosted by Servomex, a UK gas analysis company, the Singapore newspaper Lianhe Wanbao reported. The British national, reported to be a middle-aged man from Brighton, was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month. He returned to London Gatwick Airport from Geneva on 28 January on an easyJet flight. In a statement, easyJet said Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to Gatwick on 28 January to provide guidance in line with procedures. The airline added: \u201ceasyJet has been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the Coronavirus. \u201cAs the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others on board the flight is very low. \u201cWe remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline\u2019s highest priority. \u201cAll of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14 day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice. Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.\u201d The man is thought to be the first UK national to contract the disease and was transferred to St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London, where there is an infectious diseases unit, last Thursday. Whitty said experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. He said of the case that emerged on Sunday: \u201cThey successfully identified this individual and ensured the appropriate support was provided. The patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital, and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus.\u201d While the total number of cases in the UK stands at four, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed a British man had tested positive for coronavirus in Mallorca. The man\u2019s wife and two daughters tested negative and were not showing any signs of having the virus. The family had been in France and had returned to Mallorca on 29 January and the father started to show light symptoms 24 hours later.

      "body": "<p>Today\u2019s problems come from what might be the longest-running puzzle column in the history of the printed word.</p> <p>In 1966, MIT student Allan Gottlieb published his first Puzzle Corner in the <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/\">MIT Technology Review.</a></p> <p>More than half a century later, Gottlieb \u2013 who has been a computer science professor at New York University since 1980 \u2013 continues to publish Puzzle Corner in every issue.</p> <p>The column has legendary status among maths puzzle nerds. Most of the problems are too technical for a non-specialist audience but the column always includes a quickie, which he calls the Speed Department. Here are four word-based conundrums I\u2019ve selected from the last decade.</p> <p>1. <em>What is the numerically largest Roman numeral that is a normal English word?</em></p> <p>2. <em>How do you prove <strong>literally</strong> that 11 + 2 = 12 + 1?</em></p> <p><em>3. The 9-letter word <strong>SPLATTERS</strong> has an intriguing property. You can remove a single letter to make an 8-letter word, without rearranging the other letters. You can remove another letter to make a 7-letter word, and then a 6-letter word, and so on down to a single-letter word. At no stage is the order of the letters rearranged.</em></p> <ul> <li><p>splatters</p></li> <li><p>splatter</p></li> <li><p>platter</p></li> <li><p>latter</p></li> <li><p>later</p></li> <li><p>late</p></li> <li><p>ate</p></li> <li><p>at</p></li> <li><p>a</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Find two other 9-letter words that share the same property. As a (kosher) hint, the words <strong>pig </strong>and<strong> sin </strong>appear as the 3-letter words. (Remember: at no stage do you ever change the order of the letters.)</em></p> <p>4. <em>What is special about 8,549,176,320?</em></p> <p>I\u2019ll be back at 5pm with the answers. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! Instead, discuss other curious patterns in English words.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/10/did-you-solve-it-are-you-smart-enough-for-mit\">UPDATE: The solutions can be read by clicking here.</a></p> <p>In other news, I\u2019ve just read <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bpstJJ\">The Rules of Contagion</a> by the mathematician and epidemiologist Adam Kucharski, which is out this week. The book is a brilliant and accessible guide to the maths of outbreaks, from diseases to internet memes. The subject could not be more topical. Indeed, Adam, who is based at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical medicine, is currently working on analysis to support the global response to coronavirus. A recommended read.</p> <p><em>Thanks to Allan Gottlieb for permission to use today\u2019s puzzles.

      "bodyText": "Today\u2019s problems come from what might be the longest-running puzzle column in the history of the printed word. In 1966, MIT student Allan Gottlieb published his first Puzzle Corner in the MIT Technology Review. More than half a century later, Gottlieb \u2013 who has been a computer science professor at New York University since 1980 \u2013 continues to publish Puzzle Corner in every issue. The column has legendary status among maths puzzle nerds. Most of the problems are too technical for a non-specialist audience but the column always includes a quickie, which he calls the Speed Department. Here are four word-based conundrums I\u2019ve selected from the last decade. 1. What is the numerically largest Roman numeral that is a normal English word? 2. How do you prove literally that 11 + 2 = 12 + 1? 3. The 9-letter word SPLATTERS has an intriguing property. You can remove a single letter to make an 8-letter word, without rearranging the other letters. You can remove another letter to make a 7-letter word, and then a 6-letter word, and so on down to a single-letter word. At no stage is the order of the letters rearranged. splatters splatter platter latter later late ate at a Find two other 9-letter words that share the same property. As a (kosher) hint, the words pig and sin appear as the 3-letter words. (Remember: at no stage do you ever change the order of the letters.) 4. What is special about 8,549,176,320? I\u2019ll be back at 5pm with the answers. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! Instead, discuss other curious patterns in English words. UPDATE: The solutions can be read by clicking here. In other news, I\u2019ve just read The Rules of Contagion by the mathematician and epidemiologist Adam Kucharski, which is out this week. The book is a brilliant and accessible guide to the maths of outbreaks, from diseases to internet memes. The subject could not be more topical. Indeed, Adam, who is based at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical medicine, is currently working on analysis to support the global response to coronavirus. A recommended read. Thanks to Allan Gottlieb for permission to use today\u2019s puzzles. Here\u2019s a video of him talking about Puzzle Corner. I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I\u2019m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.",

He\u2019ll be in joint party room, but not the Nationals party room. Which again, is not a punishment. It does rob him of the chance to do something about the leadership, which is the reason he left the party in the first place, but it doesn\u2019t do anything else in terms of government numbers. It just reinforces how divided the Nats still are.</p> <p>Although, I would pay good money to see <strong>Damian Drum\u2019s</strong> reaction in the party room tomorrow. The man isn\u2019t exactly known for being a wallflower.</p> <p>Plus, <strong>Ken O\u2019Dowd </strong>has probably done himself out of the deputy whip position, given he admitted on national television that he had voted against the party line, despite his job being to keep everyone toeing the party line.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had this many giggles since my dad fell into a pond at my wedding while singing the Banana Boat Day-O song and lost his car keys.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone who joined us today. We will be back early tomorrow.

And under the model, that\u2019s partners would build and operate the platform. </p> <p>But this is the important piece ... the government would always retain the responsibility, as they do today, for all visa decision-making. </p> <p>It would determine the business rules and how decisions are made. It would remain responsible for national security and other risk assessments, and it would be overall responsible, on an ongoing basis, for visa policy. </p> <p>In this regard, this model is actually very similar to the model which we already have in place called the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which about 30% of all visas are processed, and that model itself was in place all throughout the Labor years, which did not change. </p> <p>It was precisely that model whereby there was a partner which assists in the visa processing, but the government remains at all times responsible for the business rules, for the risk assessment, for the policy, and for all of the major decisions. <strong>Now, Mr Speaker, the process for selecting the partners here has not been completed yet. There is still a process which is under way, but I repeat that we do need to upgrade our visa processing systems at some stage soon, given the age of those systems and given how many visas we are getting every single year, and that\u2019s just increasing</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T04:42:03.462Z\">at 4.42am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e40db4e8f0811db2faf4a37\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T04:30:48.158Z\">4.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Butler </strong>to<strong> Scott Morrison:<br></strong></p> <p>Does the prime minister support providing $300 million of taxpayer funds to keep the Liddell power station open only for three more years, even though a leaked taskforce report says such an extension would not provide any guarantee of reliability, and defer private investment in new generation?</p> <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> gets the nod:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m awaiting the final report of the Liddell taskforce.

Why aren\u2019t these businesses eligible for grants, only loans, that are going to push them further into debt?</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I can update the House. In New South Wales 172 applications have been made for those small business grants. 46 have been paid out, worth over $600,000. </p> <p>As the member may recall, because I advised of him this last week, through an answer to a question from another member, the grant applications are assessed by the New South Wales state government and managed by them. </p> <p>They make the payments and we reimburse those payments and that has been the arrangement under this government, under the previous government. And when it comes to the guidelines they develop for assessing whether grants are provided in circumstances like this, we have not departed from the previous practice that we inherited, which was all about damage to those businesses. </p> <p>That damage could include things like power being cut off, and things of that nature. </p> <p>What we have done is, those businesses that may have only had \u2013 I don\u2019t mean may, because it\u2019s significant \u2013 those businesses which had a loss of income as a result of the loss of tourist trade, what we provided to them through this category D assistance is loans, zero interest, nothing to pay for two years, and then at concessional rates, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to those businesses should they seek to take those up. </p> <p>They\u2019re the same arrangements that have been put in place for previous disasters. </p> <p>I think it\u2019s important, because I was in Townsville on Friday, where we had floods a year ago. </p> <p>And we\u2019re still rebuilding from those floods. And I think it\u2019s important that we provide the same assistance to those who are in north Queensland at that time, as we are today. </p> <p>And we\u2019re ensuring a consistency in our approach, and that was the consistency that had been established.

Now they can deny the facts if they like, but they are the facts. What I\u2019ve also said in response to this dreadful black summer that we have been experiencing is that taking action on climate change isn\u2019t just about taking action on emissions. </p> <p>It\u2019s about taking action on climate resilience. It\u2019s about taking action on climate adaptation. It\u2019s about taking action on hazard reduction, which is a form of climate resilience. It\u2019s about building dams like, Mr Speaker, the billions of dollars we\u2019re investing in those projects through the national water grid. Building dams is climate action now. I note the leader of the Greens doesn\u2019t agree with that. He\u2019s entitled not to agree with that. But the science suggests it is. And our government will act on that. </p> <p>You may want to ... select and choose those bits you want to listen to, make climate change about being anti-capitalism, that\u2019s not what we think.

science, research, technology and sharing our view of the future energy sources for both of our countries, and we look forward to that partnership for energy in Australia and Indonesia, but also how that might broadly lead our region. </p> <p><strong>Monash University will establish its first foreign campus in Indonesia under this agreement,</strong> and that is an indication of how this is a two-way street. </p> <p>Not only that, but the treasurer today reinforced the opportunity for Australian pension funds, superannuation funds, to be looking at the opportunities that exist in Indonesia, as they do in many other countries around the world, and we see that investment partnership is a key part of how the agreement will be realised. </p> <p>On the issues of strategic security in our region, Indonesia is a leader and wonderful partner to Australia, whether it is on maritime cooperation or working together with international peacekeeping, which we will now be seeking to do. </p> <p><strong>This is just a further layer in what is already a very, very deep relationship, and when it comes to the South China Sea, we share our commitment to sovereignty, stability and respect for the rule of international law</strong>. </p> <p>We have also discussed today ... challenges around counterterrorism, countering foreign fighters and influence. </p> <p>These are issues in which we are sharing expertise under view of the world. </p> <p>Finally, we have the opportunity to talk through issues of the coronavirus and the measures we are taking in concert and the information we are sharing to contain the impact of the coronavirus in Indonesia and Australia, and we will continue to work closely with our medical advisors and the other arrangements we have to ensure we can both effectively carry out our responsibilities to our peoples to keep the health and well-being of our peoples in the highest possible order. </p> <p>As you can see, it\u2019s been a very wide-ranging

We\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning, when all the parties meet to discuss policy, strategy, and, if you are the Nationals, how to stay together. Llew O\u2019Brien will have had his chat to the prime minister by then. He\u2019ll be in joint party room, but not the Nationals party room. Which again, is not a punishment. It does rob him of the chance to do something about the leadership, which is the reason he left the party in the first place, but it doesn\u2019t do anything else in terms of government numbers. It just reinforces how divided the Nats still are. Although, I would pay good money to see Damian Drum\u2019s reaction in the party room tomorrow. The man isn\u2019t exactly known for being a wallflower. Plus, Ken O\u2019Dowd has probably done himself out of the deputy whip position, given he admitted on national television that he had voted against the party line, despite his job being to keep everyone toeing the party line. I haven\u2019t had this many giggles since my dad fell into a pond at my wedding while singing the Banana Boat Day-O song and lost his car keys. Thank you to everyone who joined us today. We will be back early tomorrow. You can catch me on Twitter or Instagram in the meantime. Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy will all be back as well, along with the rest of the Guardian brains trust. Thanks again \u2013 and take care of you. So, in conclusion, the Nationals leader\u2019s pick for the deputy speaker position was gazumped by a Labor troll, after the rogue Nats\u2019 plan to fleece Michael McCormack, led by Barnaby Joyce, and put Ken O\u2019Dowd in place of Damian Drum was scuttled. What does it mean? Nothing other than the man who has led the charge against McCormack, Llew O\u2019Brien, gets a pay rise, and McCormack has once again, and quite publicly, had his authority over his party shot to pieces. And that last bit is what is going to cost him long term. As sincere as a Kardashian therapy session: \u201cSam, the first night at BED when you left, Rob...\u201d The Greens also have a production of documents order on this report \u2013 which also wants the emails between PMO and Bridget McKenzie. That one is due to be ignored by Thursday. Jacqui Lambie is very, very angry over Mathias Cormann\u2019s use of cabinet-in-confidence to stop the tabling of the PM&amp;C report in the Senate. Lambie says this is why the public can\u2019t trust politicians. \u201cDoes he take us all for morons,\u201d she says, adding that the prime minister doesn\u2019t \u201chave the guts\u201d to table the report. Just a reminder that Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s salary boost for becoming deputy speaker is worth about three years of Newstart. Apparently Labor\u2019s Julian Hill almost missed casting his ballot because he was taking a photo of it to troll the government, and then forgot it under his iPad. He found it, signalled the clerks, there was a discussion, and then it was counted. Not that it mattered in the end \u2013 75 to 67 is a comprehensive win. Over in the Senate, which shockingly is the sane chamber lately, Mathias Cormann will have to front up to explain why the government won\u2019t be complying with the Senate order to produce the Phil Gaetjen\u2019s report into why the sports grant affair is hunky dory. It was due on Thursday. It was not produced. They\u2019ll call it cabinet-in-confidence, so you won\u2019t get it for 20 years, even though other reports into ministerial conduct have been released. You like me, and I like it all We like dancing and we look divine You love bands when they\u2019re playing hard You want more and you want it fast They put you down, they say I\u2019m wrong Ken O\u2019Dowd is also the Nationals deputy whip. Not sure he can hold on to that position, having just admitted he voted against the party line on national TV. Ken O\u2019Dowd logic: Barnaby is considered in Queensland nearly a Queenslander. I know he was born in New South Wales but he has spent a lot of his life in Queensland. When I first met him he was a senator for Queensland. I still get him sometimes as a Queenslander. I am still laughing. Honestly. At this point, the Nationals couldn\u2019t organise a piss-up in a brewery. Looking at those numbers, it looks like, if we consider the crossbench voting with Labor, another five government MPs came over to the Labor vote. 75 would equal 64 Labor MPs, plus six in the crossbench, plus five government MPs. So Ken O\u2019Dowd is a yes. Barnaby Joyce is most likely a yes. Llew O\u2019Brien is a yes. Who are the other two? Asked by Patricia Karvelas why some in the Nationals are so upset with Michael McCormack: If it wasn\u2019t for central Queensland and the seats around Flynn, we wouldn\u2019t be in government today. I don\u2019t think that has been recognised fully by the National party. We wanted more representation in ... with the Coalition. This is another step forward, as far as I\u2019m concerned. The new deputy leader of the Nationals is a Queenslander. Keith Pitt is now in the cabinet. There are only 21 Nats. I am not sure how much more Queensland representation they want, but hey \u2013 LET\u2019S FIND OUT. Llew O\u2019Brien (thanks to a blog watcher for the transcription): It is a tremendous privilege to be in this place. Every election we put ourselves forward to our constituents to serve them in the most honest and best way we can. I\u2019m privileged to be here. As a country policeman, I find it incredible that I can walk into this place and take part in this. It\u2019s an honour to serve the people of Wide Bay and it will be an honour to serve this House as deputy Speaker. Ken O\u2019Dowd tells Patricia Karvelas that Barnaby Joyce was going to nominate him for deputy speaker, despite the party room vote, but ahead of the vote this afternoon, O\u2019Dowd told him not to, to help with party unity. But then he voted against what the party wanted, because (extreme Billy Moore voice) QUEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNSSSSSSLLLLLLANNNNNDER O\u2019Dowd, who once said he would be willing to step up as deputy prime minister and leader of the Nats if he was called upon (narrator: he was never, and would never, be called upon. There aren\u2019t enough evens to can\u2019t for that to happen) says he thinks Barnaby Joyce should come back as leader of the Nationals, because he still thinks of him as a Queenslander as well. Queensland \u2013 it is the greatest nation on earth. (I can say that, because I grew up there and I am allowed.) Ken O\u2019Dowd is telling Patricia Karvelas he voted for Llew O\u2019Brien over Michael McCormack\u2019s pick. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to call the challenge last week. He followed up with divorcing the National party, which I thought was a pretty bold move. As I just said, fortune favours the brave. But I didn\u2019t support him. PK: What did you say you did support him? So you did support him today. Yes. Why? O\u2019Dowd: Barnaby has made a few points and I was bowled over by Damian and the party room this morning because I stood for the deputy speaker too. I was beaten in a fair ballot. That remains the same. It was good to see that Llew O\u2019Brien, who comes from Queensland, he is only a couple of doors away from where I live and I know he will do a good job. It is good to have one of our own in that position. Happy for him and happy to Queensland. We can\u2019t be all Victoria and NSW. PK: I want to get to the bottom of this. Damian Drum won the nomination but you didn\u2019t vote for the person the Nationals wanted to be the deputy speaker? O\u2019Dowd: It was the party room that wanted Damian as opposed to myself. Then Llew O\u2019Brien was also a Queenslander, LNP, I am LNP, really take my hat off to Llew for making a stand. Fortune favours the brave. He was brave enough to make those steps. He made them. Fully realising the consequences of those steps. Look at that. Came out in front. Good on the underdog. All the Labor MPs are shaking Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s hand as they leave. Michael McCormack had promised Damian Drum the role following the leadership spill. It is always confirmed by a vote of the parliament, but once again, the Coalition underestimated Labor\u2019s tactical abilities. They are just better at this sort of stuff, because they practice on each other through factional battles. Also, Llew O\u2019Brien just received a $42,000 payrise for quitting the Nationals party room AND got revenge against McCormack. Not a bad day\u2019s work. Michael McCormack\u2019s candidate for (deputy) speaker just got rolled in a house wide vote. I actually can\u2019t stop laughing. This may be his greatest gift to the parliament. Llew O\u2019Brien is on duty at 7pm tonight. So guess he won\u2019t be meeting with the prime minister tonight then. Scott Morrison: Can I congratulate the member. With two government members to choose from I\u2019m pleased to see government members received the full confidence of all the member for the House. The member and his experience that he brings to this House \u2013 I more than most have an understanding of what he brings to this House, as I do also understand what the member for Nichols brings to this House, Mr Speaker. There is no shortage of government members in this House to make sure that we continue to deliver on the promises we made the Australian people, Mr Speaker. These government members will continue to make sure that a strong economy saves Australia, and a government that will continue to meet the needs of the Australian people will be delivered on each and every day that this government majority serves in this House. Anthony Albanese: No amount of marketing or spin can hide the humiliation for the government. I congratulate the member for Wide Bay on receiving such strong support from his colleagues in the House of Representatives. I asked the question earlier today, the first question of Question Time, to the stability of the government. We have just seen the stability of the Coalition on all of you. On full view. For everyone to see, government members running against each other, for a position of deputy speaker of the House of Representatives. Albanese moves on to congratulate O\u2019Brien. Michael McCormack: \u201cI congratulate the member and I know he\u2019ll do a good job ... that\u2019s democracy.\u201d Tony Smith is attempting to work out if Llew O\u2019Brien still counts as a member of the government. He hasn\u2019t read the O\u2019Brien stories today. I have clearly stated that I am still a member of the government, I do not sit as a National party member, I sit as a member of the LNP, which is what I put forward to the people of Wide Bay,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. So there you go. It is official. Michael McCormack looks like he has just read this blog. Scott Morrison is congratulating McCormack. \u201cThere is no shortage of government members in this House to ensure that we continue to deliver for the people of Australia,\u201d Morrison says, pointing out that two government MPs were up for election. Anthony Albanese says \u201cno amount of marketing and spin can hide the humiliation from that vote\u201d and then congratulates Llew O\u2019Brien on his comprehensive win. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Llew O\u2019Brien is the new deputy speaker. The votes have been counted Damian Drum: 67 Llew O\u2019Brien: 75 George Christensen has put up a new statement on Facebook, in response to his \u201cinner city Liberal\u201d criticism earlier this morning. I will always stand up for local workers, local businesses, local farmers and local industry, no matter if it\u2019s the Greens, Labor or my own side trying to talk down our opportunity to prosper with new affordable and reliable clean coal-fired power. This is presented with the caveat that there is a very, very low bar for excitement in this place. Australian variety TV low Sorry, as corrected by Paul Karp \u2013 if the crossbench votes with Labor, then you only need two from the government. One would think that Llew O\u2019Brien would vote for himself, so that would mean one more vote for O\u2019Brien. As seen by Mike Bowers: Barnaby saw a Llew: The crossbench saw one too: It\u2019s a secret ballot. For Labor\u2019s troll to work here (one Llew O\u2019Brien has very enthusiastically picked up) the crossbench would have to vote with Labor, along with three government MPs. Not impossible, but also not likely. Still. Stranger things have happened in this place. Llew O\u2019Brien has accepted the nomination, formally. This is almost as great as Parasite winning best picture. Excellent news The deputy speaker role comes with an additional 20% of the base wage, which is $211,250 a year. That\u2019s an extra $42,000 or so. Tony Smith is dealing with practice issues \u2013 usually the nominees for deputy speaker have to accept the nomination. Llew O\u2019Brien isn\u2019t in the chamber, so Smith is trying to work out if he accepts Labor\u2019s nomination. The nominee doesn\u2019t have to be present at the election, or inform the House of whether or not they accept the nomination \u2013 but Smith will ask if he makes it to the House for the vote. Tony Burke is now trolling the government by nominating Llew O\u2019Brien for the role. Damian Drum will be the new deputy speaker. It\u2019s kinda cute that the parliament is pretending that this is a proper election and not something that was stitched up in the joint party room. The folders were stacked \u2013 and now question time is over. Anthony Albanese to Alan Tudge: My question is addressed to the acting minister for immigration, and it goes to his last answer where he ignored the $165,000 donation from a private company, which seeks to, to quote him, \u201cbuild and operate the visa system\u201d. I say to the minister: If it looks like a privatisation and smells like a privatisation, why won\u2019t the minister concede that this is privatisation of our visa system by a major donor and mate of the prime minister? Christian Porter attempts to stop the question, but Tony Smith rules it in order: Tudge: I can only just reiterate that it is not a privatisation because the government will remain responsible for all of the key national security decisions, the risk assessment, the visa policy, the business rules and all of the key functions of government. In that regard, this model, which we have been going through an expression of interest process through, is precisely the same as the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which, when Labor was in government for those six, long years, they ran and they were quite happy with that process under way. And 30% of all visas today go through the Electronic Visa Authority. So, clearly, the Labor party did not have a great problem with that model when they were in government but now today they are seeking to politicise this system. They didn\u2019t make the decision to upgrade the visa processing system because they didn\u2019t have the money to do so. We\u2019ve made the decision to do so, and we will go through it in a methodical, professional way, doing the things that governments should be doing. Andrew Giles to Scott Morrison: Does the Prime Minister plan to proceed with the privatisation of Australia\u2019s visa system in light of revelations that his mate, Scott Briggs, spent last year leading a group trying to buy the visa group while spending $165,000 to the Liberal party? Alan Tudge gets this one: Let me point out that we are not privatising the visa system \u2013 far from it. Rather, several years ago we decided that we needed to upgrade our visa processing capabilities ... because the visa processing capabilities are about 25 years old and unable to do some of the modern functionality which we would like. Furthermore, given the growth in the visa applications, are projected by a further 35% over the next 10 years to 13 million visa applications each year, it is clearly timely to be examining whether or not to upgrade the visa processing system. So we\u2019ve actually been out to the market to see who would partner with the government to build the new capability. And under the model, that\u2019s partners would build and operate the platform. But this is the important piece ... the government would always retain the responsibility, as they do today, for all visa decision-making. It would determine the business rules and how decisions are made. It would remain responsible for national security and other risk assessments, and it would be overall responsible, on an ongoing basis, for visa policy. In this regard, this model is actually very similar to the model which we already have in place called the Electronic Travel Authority, upon which about 30% of all visas are processed, and that model itself was in place all throughout the Labor years, which did not change. It was precisely that model whereby there was a partner which assists in the visa processing, but the government remains at all times responsible for the business rules, for the risk assessment, for the policy, and for all of the major decisions. Now, Mr Speaker, the process for selecting the partners here has not been completed yet. There is still a process which is under way, but I repeat that we do need to upgrade our visa processing systems at some stage soon, given the age of those systems and given how many visas we are getting every single year, and that\u2019s just increasing. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister support providing $300 million of taxpayer funds to keep the Liddell power station open only for three more years, even though a leaked taskforce report says such an extension would not provide any guarantee of reliability, and defer private investment in new generation? Angus Taylor gets the nod: I\u2019m awaiting the final report of the Liddell taskforce. I won\u2019t pre-empt the outcome of that report. Once we received that report, once we have received it, we\u2019ll consider its recommendation. But we\u2019ve been clear all the way along. And as generators come to the end of their natural lives. We want to see life extension or like for like replacement. This is all about replacement. This is all about adding in more supply to the electricity market whilst we ensure that the existing supply is managed very carefully. And we are seeing results. We have now seen four consecutive quarters in reduction in retail electricity prices, for the first time in recorded history. ... As I was saying, four consecutive quarters of electricity price reductions in the CPI, 3.5% reduction. We have also seen that in the last three months, Mr Speaker, compared to the same period last year, we\u2019ve seen 35% reductions in wholesale electricity prices in the national electricity market, 35% reductions. Queensland, 30%. South Australia, 50%. Victoria 38%. Tasmania, 32%, and Queensland 4%, to an average of 35%. And we will ensure, we will work with the energy companies to make sure this is passed through to electricity consumers because the big stick legislation ensures the substantial and sustained savings, and reductions in costs must be passed through to consumers, and we are achieving all of this while we meet and beat our Kyoto Paris targets. And why are we seeing reductions in energy prices? Could it be that a buttload (the official measurement) of renewables have come onto the grid? Could it? The answer, dear readers, is yes. It is. Peter Dutton is back with just how safe are you, Australia: Indonesia cooperation edition. You are as safe as the government can make you, kittens. Which is much, much safer than anyone could ever have made you, ever. Fiona Phillips to Scott Morrison: A local business in my electorate, Rob\u2019s Bait and Tackle, has lost 80% of their income for the year as a direct result of the fires. This small family business and many others are reluctant to pile on debt at a time when they have very little income. Will the government provide grants for businesses like this, instead of loans that increase their debt? Morrison: That is is a devastating loss of income for that business. I would be very pleased if you can pass on their details. I make them available to the head of the national bushfire recovery agency and see what measures, additional measures, they may not be able to be aware of, to assist them specifically to their circumstances. A range of questions put forward by the opposition today that are seeking a change to the assessment for these grants. I note that\u2019s what you\u2019re suggesting. There should be a change. I would invite the leader of the opposition to write to me and set out the changes to the grant guidelines that he is proposing, Mr Speaker. And I will happily have those assessed by the Department of Finance and I\u2019ll be able to advise the House about the outcome and we can assess the feasibility of the proposal they are making. I invite them to put that proposal in writing to us. Either there is a new spirit of bipartisanship in the chamber, or the prime minister just asked the opposition to come up with policy for him. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Last Friday on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about the collapse in tourism income over the peak earning period for small businesses. Has the prime minister received the same response that we heard firsthand, that his government\u2019s marketing campaign is not cutting through? Josh Frydenberg gets the nod: I find it amusing coming from the shadow minister, a question about small business, when 62,000 closed their doors in their last year in office, Mr Speaker. 62,000 and over the last year, 75,000. [Labor\u2019s final year in office was the global financial crisis]. Now the reality is that small businesses will have access to half a million dollars in working capital, Mr Speaker, as the prime minister said, two years interest free, and then the interest rate will be half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate, Mr Speaker. Half the 10-year commonwealth bond rate. The reality is that small businesses have been damaged by the fires will get grants up to $50,000 and we\u2019re working through the states. Primary industries. ... $76 million we have announced for tourism to help create jobs in the tourism sector and deal with what has been a [devastated] sector, by not only the ongoing drought, but these devastating bushfires. We have announced a significant package of measures to small business, and over the last reported year, we have seen 75,000 small businesses created. Our focus is on helping the tourism sector get back on its feet. It is really, really rare that Barnaby Joyce actually speaks for the nation Labor\u2019s second set of questions is about the female facilities and water safety stream program, which gave $150m with no guidelines on eligibility. Labor highlights that Scott Morrison had promised \u201cfurther details\u201d on the program which never materialised. Sport minister Richard Colbeck first defends the OG sports rorts fund \u2013 the community sports infrastructure grant program \u2013 by noting it was oversubscribed. Colbeck then moved on to female facilities and water safety \u2013 noting the health department is using standard CDG (capital development guidelines) \u201cto deliver grants that were subject of election promises\u201d. He said that Labor had committed $250m to sports facilities. The general point is: there didn\u2019t need to be any application process, because the government had already cherry-picked which projects were going to get money if they won. Honestly, looking for sense in a Michael McCormack answer is as useless as searching for meaning in a Diplo song. Michael McCormack appears to be malfunctioning in answer to a Terri Butler question about building dams. He seems only able to say \u201cgetting on with the jobs\u201d and \u201cdams\u201d and other words, which, if you squint, may approximate a sentence. But there is a bit of Blu Tack on the roof, which suddenly seems exceptionally interesting. White bread: Those opposite, Mr Speaker, when they were in power, they just wanted to take water away from our irrigators. We want to give them more water. We do that by capturing water when it falls. We had a lot of it just this weekend. We want to make sure that when water falls, whether it\u2019s in the north, wherever it is in the country, we can capture it, we can store it, we can harness it, we can harvest it for when it is dry. And even, I\u2019m sure, the Greens leader, the former ALP branch member, Mr Speaker, he\u2019ll understand that too. He\u2019ll understand that too. There\u2019s nobody more committed to building dams than, Mr Speaker, our regional members on this side of the house. Because we understand the great economic capacity it will be for our nation, the great economic boost it will be for our regional areas, and we\u2019ll get on with the job. We are getting on with the job. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Last Thursday night, while visiting bushfire-affected communities on the south coast of New South Wales, I met a truck driver in Nelligen, who is losing income because of the fires but isn\u2019t eligible for any assistance under the government\u2019s recovery package. Can the prime minister tell the house why thousands of workers who lost income because of the fires can\u2019t get a helping hand from this government? Morrison: As the member would recall, when he was in a government managing disasters, that he would know there are many other payments, whether it\u2019s in the welfare system, whether it is in the Newstart program, or many other measures available to provide income support for those who found themselves in difficulty. That\u2019s the whole point of the safety net that has been built. I tell you how you can keep a safety net in place. You keep it in place by ensuring you manage money well, you actually can bring a budget back into balance and do it without adding levies, as those opposite had to do when they were struck by disasters, Mr Speaker. They had to go out and tax Australians more because they couldn\u2019t manage money. We are delivering $2 billion of additional support in initial and addition support through the national bushfire recovery agency. We\u2019re working through the disaster recovery payment arrangements we put in place about the states and territories. We\u2019re doing that consistent with all the same guidelines and rules put in place by the previous government, and those rules and guidelines did serve their government well, and I believe they serve our government well. Mr Speaker, I will take the interjection. Because he said I was just criticising those arrangements. I was not criticising those arrangements. His own member who asked the question previously of me was criticising the very arrangements that the government is putting in place now. Now, Mr Speaker, we will continue to work with the state and territory governments, we\u2019ll continue to work with local councils, we\u2019ll continue to work with businesses right across the country through local economic recovery plans now being put in place by the states with the commonwealth working with the former commissioner Colvin, who heads up the national bushfire recovery agency. What we\u2019ll stay focused on is rebuilding this economy in those areas that have been so devastated by the bushfires, that will happen with the rebuilding work we\u2019re putting in place. Listen carefully to those communities, whether it\u2019s the orchardists out there in Batlow or those in the forestry industry, or the defence force we sent in who rebuilt the roof on Mogo zoo, and cleared out the Eden mill so they can get their operation back on track. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do each and every day. We won\u2019t play politics with bushfires in this place. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and says something about it being an eventful month, and then seems surprised that there is laughter in response. Me too \u2013 it proves that there are still people in there listening to him. He meant trade, but because he has the self awareness of a YouTube star making an apology, he apparently doesn\u2019t get how a week out of a ridiculous leadership spill that continues to have ramifications for the government, \u201cbit of an eventful week\u201d is probably the closest he has come to having a personality. Stephen Jones to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. It\u2019s also about business, because last Friday, while on the south coast of New South Wales, I was told about businesses which did not burn down but had taken a huge hit to income because of the bushfires. Why aren\u2019t these businesses eligible for grants, only loans, that are going to push them further into debt? Morrison: I can update the House. In New South Wales 172 applications have been made for those small business grants. 46 have been paid out, worth over $600,000. As the member may recall, because I advised of him this last week, through an answer to a question from another member, the grant applications are assessed by the New South Wales state government and managed by them. They make the payments and we reimburse those payments and that has been the arrangement under this government, under the previous government. And when it comes to the guidelines they develop for assessing whether grants are provided in circumstances like this, we have not departed from the previous practice that we inherited, which was all about damage to those businesses. That damage could include things like power being cut off, and things of that nature. What we have done is, those businesses that may have only had \u2013 I don\u2019t mean may, because it\u2019s significant \u2013 those businesses which had a loss of income as a result of the loss of tourist trade, what we provided to them through this category D assistance is loans, zero interest, nothing to pay for two years, and then at concessional rates, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to those businesses should they seek to take those up. They\u2019re the same arrangements that have been put in place for previous disasters. I think it\u2019s important, because I was in Townsville on Friday, where we had floods a year ago. And we\u2019re still rebuilding from those floods. And I think it\u2019s important that we provide the same assistance to those who are in north Queensland at that time, as we are today. And we\u2019re ensuring a consistency in our approach, and that was the consistency that had been established. And I see you shake your head. If you\u2019re saying it should be different, why didn\u2019t the Labor party change it when you were in government, we\u2019re using your rules. Oh golly gee, I don\u2019t know Mr prime minister. Maybe it\u2019s because disasters seem to have changed a bit in the past six years since the Coalition has been in power and we are seeing worse disasters more often? Maybe it\u2019s something the actual government could look at changing? Really excited to see how hazard reduction burns will help stop floods. Right after we get onto all those arsonists who started them, and the Greens policies which didn\u2019t let us burn the rain ahead of the monsoon season. Really loving the re-writing of the climate narrative Scott Morrison is bringing into parliament lately. It is almost as if the summer has wounded him, and he\u2019s now attempting to pretend that there is no question in his government climate change is causing impacts. Like Jim Molan didn\u2019t just go on national TV and question it. Like Craig Kelly didn\u2019t straight out deny it on international TV. Like the Nationals aren\u2019t threatening to blow up the whole show over it. But then again, \u201cclimate action now\u201d apparently means dams and hazard reduction burns and adding exclamation marks to things, so I guess the bar is very, very low these days. Adam Bandt: Australia is in record drought, catastrophic megafires have burnt our country, our capital cities have ranked amongst the world\u2019s most polluted and now we\u2019re facing a flood disaster. Do you now accept we\u2019re facing a coal-fuelled climate emergency? Morrison: As I advised the House last week, the royal commission that the government will be moving forward on, once I receive feedback from the states and the territories, on the terms of reference for that royal commission, and at that time, I will then forward a copy of that to the opposition before announcing what we intend to do with that royal commission. It starts from the premise that we\u2019re dealing with longer, hotter, drier summers and we have always, and I have always acknowledged the link between the climate change and these broader weather climatic events. That\u2019s not been in dispute by our government. It\u2019s not in dispute by our government. Those on the opposite [side]... they laugh and giggle and smirk, because they\u2019re seeking to put forward a false conflict in this place. Our government is taking action to reduce emissions and they have fallen by 12. 8%. Mr Speaker, our government has put in place policies that has led to one of the highest levels of renewable investments this country has ever seen. Now they can deny the facts if they like, but they are the facts. What I\u2019ve also said in response to this dreadful black summer that we have been experiencing is that taking action on climate change isn\u2019t just about taking action on emissions. It\u2019s about taking action on climate resilience. It\u2019s about taking action on climate adaptation. It\u2019s about taking action on hazard reduction, which is a form of climate resilience. It\u2019s about building dams like, Mr Speaker, the billions of dollars we\u2019re investing in those projects through the national water grid. Building dams is climate action now. I note the leader of the Greens doesn\u2019t agree with that. He\u2019s entitled not to agree with that. But the science suggests it is. And our government will act on that. You may want to ... select and choose those bits you want to listen to, make climate change about being anti-capitalism, that\u2019s not what we think. We think that capitalism and technology is the way you ensure a brighter future for this world and this country. In its first set of Senate questions, Labor targeted new Nationals deputy David Littleproud saying he doesn\u2019t know if climate change is manmade (he has since recanted) and Liberal senator Jim Molan saying he has an open mind on the question. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, replied that the government is \u201ccommitted to taking effective action on climate change\u201d, then filibustered, leading Penny Wong and others to interject \u201cWHAT CAUSES IT?\u201d. Eventually, on the third question \u201cdoes the Morrison government accept climate changed is human-induced?\u201d, Cormann gives a simple answer: \u201cYes.\u201d Chris Bowen to Scott Morrison: Will the government agree to Labor\u2019s proposal to extend Medicare rule incentives to bushfire-affected areas and work with states to provide counselling for kids in affected schools? Morrison: The member would be aware of the mental health package and the other support measures that have been directed to support students in schools in bushfire-affected areas. And that has been part of the response of the government through the national bushfire recovery agency. I have also had very good discussions, with the New South Wales premier in particular, about the measures they are also developing and delivering in the bushfire-affected areas, and the same has been true of the programs put in place by the Victorian government and [I am] working with the Victorian premier. \u2026 there are so many upsetting and devastating impacts of these recent fires, but the impact on the mental health and wellbeing of children, those who may not have lived in the bushfire-affected areas but have travelled to those areas and have seen things they have never seen before, and the trauma it could have caused is something very much in foremost in the minds of the government and the actions of the national bushfire recovery agency. We have made commitments in that area and we\u2019ll be assessing carefully about what else needs to be done. Keith Pitt gets his first question as a minister from Terri Butler: Does the minister support the development of a domestic nuclear power industry fuelled by Australian resources and cooled by our scarce water reserves? Pitt starts by attempting to be clever, having prepared for this very question (Labor\u2019s first press release on Pitt\u2019s ascension was on this very topic and there have been many, many tweets) but the question is worded simply enough that he gets a \u201cback on the topic please\u201d ruling from the Speaker. As the honourable member knows, there\u2019s already a nuclear industry in Australia, it\u2019s at Lucas Heights. We have a nuclear reactor in Australia producing very important medical technology for all Australians. Those opposite should do their research. I was a supplementary member [of the committee]. I couldn\u2019t even vote on the report ... Cue Speaker warning. Pitt: Noted, Mr Speaker. Tony Smith: That\u2019s a ruling. You can note it, and act on it is the most important thing. Pitt: As I will. The opposition knows the government\u2019s position. There\u2019s a moratorium on nuclear energy in this country. I was a member of the backbench committee that made recommendations. The government will respond to the recommendations in due course. In a dixer, Scott Morrison seems to say that the government can\u2019t guarantee it will be organising any more flights out of coronavirus impacted areas: There can be no guarantee the Australian government are in a position to operate further flights into these affected areas. We said we would prioritise isolated and vulnerable Australians and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done and we thank the Chinese government for their co-operation in assisting us to be able to assist the departure of those Australians from those areas. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I ask, how can the prime minister claim to lead a stable government when, on the day set aside to pay respect to victims of the bushfires, the Nationals decided to have a leadership challenge, and today a National party member quit, threatening the government\u2019s control of the House. When Australia needs stable government, why do we have a coalition of chaos? Morrison: The leader of the opposition does not represent the situation in the government at all. Not at all. Mr Speaker, our government ... Here are all of our members, and the member for Wide Bay is up the top there, he\u2019s doing a great job. As all the members are representing all of their constituents, and I tell you what they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re doing what they promised the Australian people they would do, Mr Speaker. They said, when they went to their electorates, they were part of a government that was going to keep the economy strong, keep Australians safe, and keep Australians together, Mr Speaker. And what we\u2019ve done since that election, we\u2019ve been delivering on the commitments we took to the Australian people. Delivering tax cuts, Mr Speaker, getting on with the job of delivering our climate solutions fund, getting on with the job of keeping Australians safe, and in the face of some of the biggest disasters we\u2019ve seen, Mr Speaker, ensuring that the response, the establishment of the national bushfire recovery agency, the stand-up of the first compulsory call-out of the reserves in response to a bushfire crisis, Mr Speaker, the implementation of our packages to support drought-affected farmers, the stand-up of our arrangements in terms of counter-terrorism, and ensuring that we\u2019re doing the right thing in terms of foreign interference and the impact, Mr Speaker, of foreign terrorist fighters. Our government is keeping Australians safe and we\u2019re respecting our veterans with the measures we announced last week, and we\u2019re getting on with the job what if we promised the Australian people. $100 million in additional infrastructure investments, not only building the roads, but the rail connections this country needs, both now and into the future. We\u2019re delivering on what we told the Australian people we would do. What do we have from those opposite? Each way. They\u2019re for tax cuts, they\u2019re against tax cuts, they are for the drought fund, they\u2019re against the drought fund. The bells are ringing for the resumption of parliament. [cont from previous post] Veronica Koman, an Indonesian human rights lawyer and advocate for West Papua, currently living in exile in Australia, said it was incumbent on Australia, as a neighbour and friend of Indonesia, to raise the issue of West Papua with the visiting president. She said 56 indigenous West Papuans and one Indonesian advocate were currently in prisons across Indonesia charged with treason and facing the potential of life imprisonment for protesting against Indonesian rule over Papua. \u201cThese people were arrested when expressing their opinion during mass protests against racism and for an independence referendum in August and September 2019 and during commemoration of West Papua\u2019s national day on 1 December,\u201d Koman said. \u201cWe demand their immediate and unconditional release.\u201d As many as 45,000 people are displaced from the Nduga regency of Papua following a joint military and police operation there, Koman said. Father Santon Tekege, a priest in the diocese of Timika in West Papua, said the massive and continued military build-up across Nduga and other parts of Papua was \u201cadding to the trauma of fear and anxiety\u201d for West Papuans. \u201cMany indigenous Papuans are starving, many people are displaced in the forests, other community members have been raped or shot dead,\u201d he told the Guardian. The Indonesian government position on West Papua has been resolute for decades. It regards the province as an indivisible part of a unitary Indonesia state, and has consistently rebuffed demands from West Papuans for independence. The Australian government supports Jakarta\u2019s position. Widodo did not mention West Papua in his speech to the Australian parliament. However, a joint statement issued by Widodo and Australian prime minister Scott Morrison, \u201creaffirmed [the leaders\u2019] commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia\u2019s respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u201d. Indonesian president Joko Widodo has been urged to uphold a two-year-old promise to allow United Nations human rights officials free and unfettered access to the restive province of West Papua. Greens leader Adam Bandt met with Widodo following his address to the House of Representatives Monday and told him: \u201cThank you for your speech, thanks for your comments on climate change, now please get something done on West Papua\u201d. Resource-rich but under-developed West Papua has been engaged in a campaign for independence from Indonesia since 1961. The issue flared to acute violence again last year, with mass protests \u2013 and widespread arrests \u2013 across the remote province, sparked by racist abuse of indigenous Papuan students in other parts of Indonesia. A letter from Bandt, and Victorian senator Richard di Natale, presented to the Indonesian president, welcomed his commitment in February 2018 to allow UN human rights officials \u201cimmediate and unfettered access to Papua\u201d. \u201cWe call on you to implement that commitment \u2026 we also welcome your previous statements indicating that you would lift restrictions on access for foreign journalists and human rights monitors, and ask that you expedite this promise. \u201cWe further urge you to order an independent and impartial investigation into all human rights violations related to last year\u2019s protests in Papua, with the aim of bringing the perpetrators of such abuse to justice.\u201d Every time someone says \u201cXX is tearing the Nats apart\u201d I just picture Tommy Wiseau screaming in The Room, and I have to say it makes a lot of things better. Joko Widodo also compared Australia and Indonesia to the good guys in the Marvel universe, using a movie where the main character dies (for the common good) and the good guys only win because they manage to go back in time. The collaboration of the Indonesian-Australia partnership, in the midst of the rising global uncertainties, can be illustrated by the movie \u2018Avengers: Endgame\u2019. When the forces of good unite, the Avengers assemble and the common enemy can be defeated. When Indonesia and Australia continue to collaborate and work together, then intolerance and protectionism and the fear of poverty and the threat of climate change can be overcome. Sarah Martin has heard from Llew O\u2019Brien\u2019s office \u2013 the man of the hour will make a statement after 7pm, when he has spoken to the prime minister. Just stepping outside of parliament for the moment. There are evacuation orders for some Sydney areas \u2026 Just wondering if anyone has asked Peter Dutton yet whether arsonists also lit the floods? Question time won\u2019t be until after 2.30pm. The rest of the parliament has gone quiet while the Joko Widodo formalities play out, so now is a great time to get some lunch, or a mimosa or something. Malcolm Turnbull was stopped in the marble foyer ahead of the reception for Joko Widodo, and was asked about the *latest* energy war in his former party room. The cheapest form of new generation is a combination of renewables plus storage. And there is \u2013 literally, that is no longer a remotely contentious proposition. And these people who are advocating that the government should fund coal-fired power are basically making a case for higher emissions and higher energy prices. And that is nuts. The 15th address from a foreign leader to the parliament (with senators as guests). So nice to see we have moved on from all of this (that was obviously extreme sarcasm). Really enjoying Liberal National party MPs saying they want to see Llew O\u2019Brien \u201cstay in the team\u201d. HE HAS NOT LEFT THE TEAM. He is still an LNP MP. He remains a Morrison government backbencher. He is just not going to sit in the Nationals party room. THAT IS IT. Remember when the leadership spill which ended Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s prime ministership was supposed to end all the energy fights in the Coalition? The hands have been shaken and the talks had \u2013 Joko Widodo has left the chamber. This is interesting. Joko Widodo: I would like to propose a number of priority agendas as we head into the century of partnership. First, we must continue to advocate the values of democracy and human rights. Stop intolerance, stop xenophobia, stop radicalism and stop terrorism. Identity politics is a trap to democracy. A threat to diversity and a threat to tolerance. These threats will become more actual exploitation for short-term political interests, resulting in hatred, fear and even social conflict. As democratic and diverse countries, we must work hard, side by side together, to defend the values of democracy, tolerance and diversity and to look at the clash of civilisation. Second, Indonesia and Australia must enforce open, free and fair economic principles. Whilst protectionism is rising, we must continue to advocate economic openness and fairness. And the growing popularity of the approach we need to bolster, win-win. I very much believe an open and fair economic system will be beneficial for all. Joko Widodo is pretty strong when it comes to explaining Australia\u2019s relationship with Indonesia: The people of Indonesia will always remember, will always remember, when Indonesia was struck by a tsunami in 2004 in Aceh. Australian soldiers sadly perished while assisting friends in Aceh. They are friends of Indonesia and they are heroes of humanity. The Indonesian president is only the 15th world leader to be given this honour. He opens with a G\u2019day mate, which gets a laugh. The representatives of Australia, the platoon of the Indonesian army engineers, along with personnel of the Indonesian national body for emergency management, have departed Indonesia to New South Wales. They only have one purpose \u2013 to work hand in hand with the Australian people to overcome the bushfire crisis in Australia. And at the same time, teams from Indonesia and Australia are currently discussing possible cooperation for weather modification. On 23 December 2019, I have reaffirmed to Prime Minister Morrison a clear message that Indonesia will always be with Australia during this difficult time. Following the untimely passing of Prime Minister Morrison\u2019s father, [I] had a briefing with the prime minister and his family. True friends are people who stay with you during the good and bad times. A friend in need is a friend indeed. Having a look at the chamber, Adam Bandt has one of the rock star seats behind the main table, right smack bang in front of the lectern where Joko Widodo is making his address. The seat next to him is empty. That seemed a little strange, so we have made some calls. Under the protocol, the seat Bandt is sitting in is reserved for the Greens leader in the Senate, which would be Larissa Waters. So it looks like, as party leader, Bandt has taken that seat. OK The empty chair though, next to his, is reserved for the Nationals leader in the Senate. Which would be Bridget McKenzie. McKenzie is in the chamber \u2013 she is sitting in the benches. I\u2019ll leave it to you to decide why she has not taken her designated seat of honour. I\u2019ve just been reminded of why the parliament doesn\u2019t do these addresses as a joint sitting of the parliament anymore \u2013 it\u2019s because of Bob Brown. In 2003, the then Greens senator interrupted then US president George W Bush as he spoke to the parliament, embarrassing then prime minister John Howard. Greens senator Kerry Nettle was also ejected from the chamber for interrupting. It not only made international news, it also changed parliamentary practices. The House Procedure Committee recommended any future addresses should be carried out as House sittings, with senators invited as guests (which limits their ability to speak, because it makes it easier to boot them out). The practice was adopted and now, senators can as guests, but joint sittings are out. So quite a bit to unpack there. Basically \u2013 trade and investment will grow. The countries are in lockstep on regional security and the South China Sea. There will be more discussions on visa changes between the two countries. And Australia wants to grow the relationship. The statement continues: Contributing to Indo-Pacific Stability and Prosperity 36. With a view to strengthening cooperation in the Indian Ocean, leaders welcomed the elevation of the Indonesia-Australia-India Strategic Dialogue to foreign ministers\u2019 level, with the first meeting to be held as soon as practicable, and looked forward to working closely with India in strengthening the resilience of the Indian Ocean countries, including through the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). 37. Leaders also agreed on the importance of working together in the South Pacific. They welcomed the first iteration of the Indonesia-South Pacific Forum held in March 2019 as well as the Pacific Exposition held in Auckland in July 2019; and looked forward to trilateral development cooperation with Pacific neighbours in areas of mutual interest to support the development and economic prosperity of the region. 38. Leaders agreed on the need to deepen our collaboration in support of Asean-led regional architecture. Australia commended Indonesia\u2019s leadership of the Asean Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, and welcomed Indonesia\u2019s plans to host the World Economic Forum on Asean and the Indo-Pacific 2020 in July, in which Australia looks forward to participating. 39. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment for Australia and Indonesia to work collaboratively toward the establishment of a co-deployment to a United Nations Peacekeeping Operation as a new chapter in our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They highlighted that the co-deployment would elevate our contribution to the implementation of the United Nations\u2019 Action for Peacekeeping initiative and our already strong and mature defence cooperation, as it would be the first time Australia and Indonesia deploy together. 40. Leaders also emphasised their commitment to continue to work together at the UN to support the international rules-based order, acknowledging Indonesia\u2019s term on the UN Security Council (2019-20) and both countries\u2019 current membership of the UN Human Rights Council (Australia 2018-20; Indonesia 2020-22). 41. Leaders welcomed continued cooperation between Indonesia and Australia in the G20, including in advocating for action to give effect to the G20 commitment to end IUU fishing and in supporting the G20 initiative on preventing terrorist exploitation of the internet. 42. Leaders affirmed the continued importance of Apec in promoting sustainable development and free, and open trade. Leaders will advocate for an ambitious Apec post-2020 vision to follow the 1994 Bogor Goals under Malaysia\u2019s Apec chairmanship in 2020. 43. Leaders recognised the importance of collaboration and cooperation in managing and responding to disaster risks and humanitarian crises in the Indo-Pacific region and will bolster these efforts through a new Indonesia-Australia Partnership in Disaster Risk Management, including to build capacity in disaster risk management at the sub-national level in Indonesia. 44. Building on decades of collaboration in the health sector, leaders agreed to explore new opportunities for bilateral and regional cooperation, including through a new Indonesia-Australia Health Security Partnership, which will operate in collaboration with Australia\u2019s Indo-Pacific Centre for Health Security to help prevent, detect and respond to health emergencies, including infectious disease outbreaks in our region. 45. President Widodo expressed his sincere gratitude to the Australian Government for the warm welcome and the hospitalities accorded to him and the Indonesian delegation during the state visit, which reflects the bonds of long-standing friendship and solid foundation for the advancement of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The statement continues: Maritime Cooperation 27. Leaders recognised the importance of maritime trade and the blue economy to Australia and Indonesia\u2019s collective prosperity. They committed to developing maritime connectivity between markets in the region. 28. Leaders expressed serious concerns about developments in the South China Sea, including the continued militarisation of disputed features, and reaffirmed the importance of maintaining peace, security, stability, and freedom of navigation and overflight in the region. They called for disputes to be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law, particularly the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982. 29. Leaders noted negotiations between Asean and China towards a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea and underlined the importance of any Code of Conduct: being consistent with international law, particularly UNCLOS; not prejudicing the interests and rights of third parties or other states; and supporting existing, inclusive regional architecture. 30. Leaders committed to deepen practical cooperation on maritime issues to support common interests in the maritime domain, including in the areas of improving maritime domain awareness, supporting understanding of and adherence to UNCLOS, combatting illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing and other activities under the Joint Declaration on Maritime Cooperation\u2019s Plan of Action. Indonesia welcomes Australia\u2019s interest in a partnership to develop maritime and fishing capacities in Indonesia\u2019s outermost islands. 31. Leaders reaffirmed both countries\u2019 active interest in ocean sustainability. Indonesia and Australia co-led the establishment of the Regional Plan of Action to Promote Responsible Fishing Practices including Combating Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in the Region (RPOA-IUU) and will continue to advance regional fisheries objectives through this important instrument. 32. Leaders welcomed the announcement of a cooperation arrangement with JCLEC that formalises the Maritime Training Faculty and will see an Australian Border Force official posted to JCLEC. 33. Leaders welcomed the cooperation between the Indonesian Directorate General of Sea Transportation (DGST) and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) that will result in the establishment of two significant maritime safety training facilities. 34. Leaders also welcomed the extension of the Arrangement between the Maritime Security Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (Bakamla) and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as represented by the Australian Border Force (ABF) on Maritime Security Cooperation a further three years, the prospect of an Australian port visit by Bakamla, and acknowledged the tenth anniversary of desktop training cooperation between Bakamla and the ABF. 35. In acknowledgement of the serious and growing challenge of marine plastic waste, Leaders agreed to establish an Indonesia-Australia Systemic Innovation Lab on Marine Plastic Waste under the leadership of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Agency for Marine and Fishery Research and Human Resources of the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fishery. This new initiative will strengthen our research collaboration to help identify new approaches in tackling marine plastic waste across our region. The joint statement continues: Securing Our and the Region\u2019s Shared Interests 17. Leaders acknowledged the closeness of the two countries\u2019 wide-ranging bilateral cooperation on justice, law and security. They welcomed the achievements of the Australia Indonesia Partnership for Justice II, aimed at supporting Indonesia\u2019s law and justice institutions and civil society, and strengthening our overall security architecture. 18. Leaders acknowledged the need for an increased focus on countering violent extremism, and committed to work together to prevent radicalisation, challenge extremist propaganda, and maintain strong, cohesive, and multicultural and multi-faith societies. 19. Leaders highlighted the importance of bilateral strategic dialogue, including through the annual 2+2 meetings between foreign and defence ministers, held most recently in Bali in December 2019. 20. Leaders welcomed the ongoing Indonesia-Australia Ministerial Council on Law and Security, and the Indonesia-Australia Counter Terrorism Consultation as important forums for strengthening cooperation on the evolving threats of terrorism, transnational crime and cyber security. 21. Leaders highlighted the ongoing success of the sub-regional meeting established in 2017 and co-chaired by Indonesia and Australia as a regional mechanism to collectively respond to transnational security threats, particularly terrorism and foreign terrorist fighters. 22. Leaders emphasised the importance of an open, free and secure Internet to economic growth and innovation. Leaders welcomed the concrete program of bilateral activities underway, particularly cyber bootcamps for Indonesian officials, and regular training on cyber security, cyber policy and international law and norms. Leaders resolved to further deepen cooperation in areas of mutual interest and welcomed further initiatives supported by the Cyber Cooperation Program to strengthen cyber security skills, institutions and digital skills development through short-term fellowship opportunities. Leaders looked forward to the next Indonesia-Australia cyber policy dialogue taking place in 2020. 23. In the context of co-chairing the Bali Process, leaders acknowledged the two countries\u2019 constructive bilateral cooperation to counter people smuggling and trafficking in persons in collaboration with regional partners. Leaders looked forward to the next Bali Process Ministerial Conference taking place in late 2020. Leaders welcomed progress on the Bali Process Government and Business Forum to engage the private sector in addressing trafficking in persons and related exploitation. 24. Leaders emphasised the importance of protecting the victims and witnesses of serious transnational crimes such as trafficking in persons and terrorism. Indonesia and Australia have committed to work together to strengthen domestic and regional capacity to effectively assist victims and witnesses. 25. Leaders acknowledged that the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation (JCLEC) will continue to be a centre of excellence for capacity building on law enforcement in combating transnational, serious and organised crime. 26. Leaders witnessed the signing of a new Memorandum of Understanding on Transportation Security Cooperation, recognising the importance of the transport sector to the economic and social development of both countries. The joint statement continues: Connecting People 13. Leaders expressed their sincere sympathies to those affected by the bushfires in Australia, and the recent flooding in Jakarta. Australia welcomed the deployment of Indonesian military engineers to assist in the response to the bushfires. Leaders reflected on our countries\u2019 long and proud history of supporting each other in times of need \u2013 from TNI\u2019s assistance to Australia following Cyclone Tracy in 1974 to the ADF\u2019s assistance following the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in 2018. 14. Leaders recognised that shared links in areas such as education and research collaboration help to create greater understanding between our communities and act as a springboard for an even broader partnership between our two countries. Leaders welcomed the continuation of programs such as Building Relationships through Intercultural Dialogue and Growing Engagement (BRIDGE), the New Colombo Plan, the Destination Australia Program, the Darmasiswa Scholarship, and the Indonesia Arts and Culture Scholarship, which enhance interactions among students and teachers from both countries. 15. Leaders welcomed the announcement that Monash University will open a campus in Indonesia \u2013 the first foreign university campus in Indonesia \u2013 which will greatly strengthen educational collaboration between the two countries. 16. Leaders welcomed the holding of the first Interfaith Dialogue in Bandung in March 2019, and committed to another Interfaith Dialogue in 2021. It continues: Enhanced Economic and Development Partnership 5. Leaders welcomed the imminent completion of their respective domestic processes for the ratification of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA\u2011CEPA). 6. Australia and Indonesia committed to deepening our economic, trade and investment relationship, including taking forward initiatives this year to harvest early benefits from IA\u2011CEPA ratification. This will include full implementation of IA-CEPA and early work on an IA\u2011CEPA Economic Cooperation Program; an Australian Business Week delegation led by the Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, and a further visit by major Australian private sector investors; the establishment of a CEO Roundtable; the development of a Blueprint for Trade and Investment in Indonesia and assistance to Indonesian SME exporters. 7. A bilateral economic, trade and investment ministers\u2019 meeting will be inaugurated, to drive this deepening of cooperation on bilateral and global economic issues. A senior economic officials\u2019 meeting will also be established. 8. Leaders noted opportunities for increasing people-to-people links, including through IA\u2011CEPA\u2019s skills package, and that Indonesian access to Australia\u2019s work and holiday visa will increase from 1,000 to 4,100 upon IA-CEPA\u2019s entry into force, and increase further to 5,000 in the sixth year of the agreement. 9. Leaders reaffirmed the benefits of open markets and inclusive regional economic integration. Leaders committed to working constructively together through the G20, Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) and other regional and multilateral fora to support the multilateral trading system and take forward WTO reform. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will work together to finalise all outstanding negotiations ahead of signature in 2020, completing an agreement which builds on the Asean-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) and which complements IA-CEPA. 10. Through our longstanding economic partnership for development, leaders agreed to cooperate to encourage sustainable and inclusive economic growth and stability; address poverty and inequality; strengthen human capital, education and skills; promote women\u2019s leadership and empowerment; and support disability inclusion. 11. Given how close eastern Indonesia and northern Australia are, leaders agreed to explore ways to further boost economic cooperation and connectivity, including through better transportation links. 12. Leaders highlighted opportunities for collaboration on the relocation of Indonesia\u2019s capital city, a national development priority for Indonesia. Scott Morrison and Joko Widodo have released their joint statement, which outlines what has been agreed upon in their bilateral talks so far: 1. During President Joko Widodo\u2019s state visit to Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and President Widodo met for the Indonesia-Australia annual leaders\u2019 meeting and held a joint ministerial meeting with other Australian and Indonesian ministers in Canberra on 10 February 2020. 2. Leaders acknowledged the recent 70th anniversary of formal diplomatic relations between Australia and Indonesia, and agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation under the five pillars of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2018. 3. Leaders witnessed the signing of the Plan of Action for the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership by foreign ministers, which outlines the practical cooperation between the two countries for 2020-2024. 4. Leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the Lombok Treaty, signed in 2006, which outlines Indonesia and Australia\u2019s respect for each other\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as being the bedrock of our defence and security relationship. The last time a leader from another nation addressed the Australian parliament, was in October 2016, when Singapore prime minister Lee Hsein Loong gave a speech. Joko Widodo has been announced and he has taken his seat of honour, ready to make his address. While we wait for the address to begin, Murph has taken a look at just how Scott Morrison uses the lack of trust in the political system to his advantage in the latest Full Story podcast. Malcolm and Lucy Turnbull are in the gallery for Jokowi\u2019s address. Turnbull and Widodo were quite close as leaders \u2013 you may remember that Turnbull was sent to Indonesia by Scott Morrison to smooth things over after Morrison floated the idea of moving the Israeli embassy during the Wentworth byelection. Joko Widodo\u2019s address to parliament is about to begin. The House is filling up. Senators have been invited as guests. Question time will be pushed back until about 2.30 to accommodate the change in schedule. The assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, has lodged some regulations revealing details about the census, including that it will be held on 10 August, 2021 and there will be two new questions on defence force service and health conditions diagnosed by a doctor or nurse. This appears to end a scuffle in the government over whether to include two new questions on gender and sexuality. Last week Guardian Australia reported that health minister Greg Hunt had lobbied Sukkar to include the questions because they would\u201dgreatly inform the government\u2019s knowledge about the LGBTI+ population cohort in Australia in the 2021 census\u201d. The Australian Bureau of Statistics had noted that two federal departments need the data to deliver services and it would have \u201cstrong value across all levels of government\u201d but recommended sexual orientation not be added to the census due to possible backlash. A spokesman for Sukkar told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe government has accepted the recommendations of the Australian Bureau of Statistics regarding topics that should be included in the 2021 Census, which ensures the information collected reflects Australia\u2019s priority information needs.\u201d Back to the Joko Widodo visit: Jokowi also addressed the media, saying the visit marked a \u201cnew beginning\u201d for the two countries following the signing of the Indonesia-Australia comprehensive economic partnership agreement \u2013 the official name for the free trade agreement signed between the two countries. \u201cThis means going forward, the economic relationship between the two countries will grow and bring more tangible benefits to the people,\u201d he said. He added that the two leaders had discussed opportunities for Australia in the areas of infrastructure and education investment in Indonesia, as well as strategic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. He spoke about the hope for \u201cpeace and stability\u201d in the region, with the pair discussing the security situation in the South China Sea and climate change action, with particular reference to Pacific island nations. Despite Indonesia being one of the most important democracies in the region, the media statement from Jokowi did not allow for journalists to ask any questions. So, just to recap \u2013 Llew O\u2019Brien has quit the National party but not the LNP. In Queensland, the Liberal-National coalition is formalised as one party. So NOTHING HAS CHANGED. He will sit with the Coalition in the chamber, he will sit in the joint Coalition party room and he will vote with the government, because he is still a member of the government. He just won\u2019t be going to National party room meetings anymore. Which sounds like a win-win. Much like when my maths teacher would make me sit outside the classroom for being \u201ceasily distracted and a distraction to others\u201d. Barnaby Joyce released his text message to Scott Morrison to Sky News this morning, explaining just why he is throwing a tantrum over Michael McCormack\u2019s cabinet picks: \u201cSorry Scott but Michael picking only those who voted for him is foolish as it leaves little room for ownership to the team and as such makes things precarious\u201d. It\u2019s worth noting that the last time there was a leadership tantrum in the Nationals, McCormack did include Joyce backers in the cabinet. And this text message seems fine to release, but Joyce apparently can\u2019t release his \u2018text message\u2019 reports he made to Morrison as the drought envoy. Those relating to government to policy need to stay secret, but texts about internal party waa-waa-crying-face sulks are apparently in the public interest. Anthony Albanese\u2019s son Nathan is in parliament today \u2013 he will be the opposition leader\u2019s guest at Joko Widodo\u2019s address Scott Morrison was a little more expansive on what the chat between himself and Joko Widodo was about: We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. We have much to share, both in understanding of the challenges and as Indonesia is going through an accelerated development path, [about] how we can ensure that the fuel sources for the future are very much part of Indonesia\u2019s development and Australia\u2019s. We will be working together on science, research, technology and sharing our view of the future energy sources for both of our countries, and we look forward to that partnership for energy in Australia and Indonesia, but also how that might broadly lead our region. Monash University will establish its first foreign campus in Indonesia under this agreement, and that is an indication of how this is a two-way street. Not only that, but the treasurer today reinforced the opportunity for Australian pension funds, superannuation funds, to be looking at the opportunities that exist in Indonesia, as they do in many other countries around the world, and we see that investment partnership is a key part of how the agreement will be realised. On the issues of strategic security in our region, Indonesia is a leader and wonderful partner to Australia, whether it is on maritime cooperation or working together with international peacekeeping, which we will now be seeking to do. This is just a further layer in what is already a very, very deep relationship, and when it comes to the South China Sea, we share our commitment to sovereignty, stability and respect for the rule of international law. We have also discussed today ... challenges around counterterrorism, countering foreign fighters and influence. These are issues in which we are sharing expertise under view of the world. Finally, we have the opportunity to talk through issues of the coronavirus and the measures we are taking in concert and the information we are sharing to contain the impact of the coronavirus in Indonesia and Australia, and we will continue to work closely with our medical advisors and the other arrangements we have to ensure we can both effectively carry out our responsibilities to our peoples to keep the health and well-being of our peoples in the highest possible order. As you can see, it\u2019s been a very wide-ranging discussion. Zali Steggall and her crossbench colleagues have just held a press conference marking the introduction of her climate bill. Steggall is trying to nudge Liberals inclined to talk about the importance of climate action to do something about it. She wants a conscience vote, and she wants MPs to consider how they might \u201cdeliver safety and certainty for their electorates\u201d. Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie says a conscience vote creates an opportunity \u201cfor modern Liberals to stand and take some action\u201d. The Victorian independent Helen Haines says this bill represents an opportunity for parliamentarians to restore trust in politics, by projecting a capacity to work together. Steggall has not yet discussed the bill with Scott Morrison. It\u2019s not clear whether there will be support to bring it on in the parliament. Steggall makes it clear she wants to build support in the community to pressure MPs to move the bill forward. She\u2019s set up a website to accompany the bill and says if MPs decline the opportunity to be constructive \u201ctheir electorates will be made very aware of their position\u201d. The bill includes a commitment to achieving net zero by 2050, specifies the need to have an adaptation plan, and establishes an independent climate commission. Scott Morrison is welcoming Joko Widodo to Canberra, in one of the committee rooms. Widodo will address the House later this morning. The bilateral talks are all about trade and security (when are they not?) but there is a bit of climate and energy thrown in for good measure. Morrison: We have discussed many issues as part of our growing partnership, our growing agenda, between our two nations. The 100 day action plan for the implementation of the agreement will see it, as it comes into effect, ramped up and the momentum established at all levels. [It will be] a mutually beneficial arrangement, one that sees the cooperation of our economies for the strong growth that it will see over the next decade and beyond. Indonesia will be one of the star economies of the world over the next 10 to 20 years and this arrangement, this mutually beneficial arrangement, will ensure that our economy is linked for this exciting period of growth in the years ahead. Today we have agreed to include new elements as part of this implementation. We are pleased that our home affairs minister here in Australia will be engaging with his Indonesian counterpart to proceed to look at how we can simplify and streamline the issues of entry into Australia. We also agree to reconsider and look at the issues of travel advice in Indonesia, particularly for those areas most frequented by Australian visitors. Indonesia is a very large country with a very large population, and we need to ensure that we have this flexibility that respects and understands that, and we thank the president and his ministers for raising these issues with us. We have also agreed to establish an energy dialogue between Australia and Indonesia. Really, really looking forward to Pauline Hanson defining \u201ctraditional sex\u201d in the Senate when she enters her latest WTAF piece of legislation: From the \u201cwhy is this happening\u201d file \u2013 The Prohibiting the Indoctrination of Children bill would counteract a wide range of issues described as indoctrination of young children: including skewed versions of history taught as fact, controversial sexual programs that teach gender fluidity and realignment to infants, unsubstantiated human-induced climate change, as well as the teachings of so-called \u201csafe\u201d underage sex, sexting, and non-traditional sex. The bill recognises parents across Australia who have concerns about biased teachings, they don\u2019t like the teaching of non-traditional and controversial views that don\u2019t give the full picture; they want to protect and strengthen their children, and this bill does that. Parents want a sensible curriculum that sets their children up for meaningful, employable futures, without the distraction of false or imbalanced ideology. Under his eye, yadda, yadda, yadda. Matt Canavan has written an article for the Courier Mail, where he came up with this line: Renewable energy can complement our energy needs but renewables do not run all the time making them unsuitable to support manufacturing jobs. Renewables are the dole bludgers of the energy system, they only turn up to work when they want to. First of all \u2013 sigh. Secondly, I guess that makes coal the franking credit recipients of the energy system \u2013 holding on, despite the death throes and the impacts to the rest of society. Good times: That \u201cinner city Liberal\u201d Christensen is talking about, is Trent Zimmerman, who made comments on Sky this morning that he didn\u2019t believe investing in coal was a role for the government \u2013 that the market could decide. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s position as well \u2013 even Joel Fitzgibbon manages to hold on to that one. The bells are ringing \u2013parliament is about to begin The government has said it will be releasing its 2050 emissions strategy ahead of the climate meeting in Glasgow (which they have to, in order to be able to trade with the EU, as the French foreign minister has already told us). But the government is also still trying to calm down its party room, which has a section completely obsessed with coal. It\u2019s funding a $4m feasibility study into a north Queensland coal power station, because it\u2019s trying to kick that fight down the road. Mathias Cormann had a chat about that to the ABC this morning: We always said that we would support a feasibility study like the one that\u2019s been announced, and you know, obviously coal will continue to be an important part of our energy mix in the foreseeable future, and a high efficiency, low emissions coal-fired power station, obviously, can be an important part of helping us meet our emissions reduction targets. But ultimately, a project like that will have to stack up commercially. It will have to stack up on its own right. And that is obviously a matter for after the feasibility study. I mean, the whole range of industries, exporting industries, manufacturing exporting industries in Australia, do need access to reliable, affordable power, and obviously we want to ensure that that power is environmentally as efficient as possible. And in that context, this feasibility study, hopefully, will be able to demonstrate that this project can stack up based on private sector investment. Australia produces about 6% of global coal, it has responsibility for about 6% of global coal production. I think you\u2019ll find that Australia will continue to be a significant producer, exporter and consumer of it. And of course, Australian coal is environmentally much more efficient than the coal alternatives from other parts of the world. I mean, our coal, our black coal, is ... it obviously has lower moisture content, lower ash content, higher energy intensity. And it is, obviously, in the interests of the environment for more Australian coal to be used and for it to displace coal from other sources, which is more polluting. Oxfam has welcomed Zali Steggall and the crossbench climate bill. From the group\u2019s climate change advisor Simon Bradshaw: This bill represents the minimum action necessary to bring Australia into line with comparable countries and to get us on the path to zero emissions as soon as possible. It is an important and practical step that deserves support from all sides of politics. As parliament resumes after a horrendous summer of extreme weather and bushfires, we welcome this move by Ms Steggall, which is a response to community sentiment to \u2018just get on with it\u2019 when it comes to setting the framework required to address the climate crisis. Importantly, by beginning a sequence of five-year emissions budgets, guided by independent advice, the bill requires a strengthening of Australia\u2019s existing and woefully inadequate 2030 emissions reduction targets. We recognise that this proposed law alone will not be enough to ensure Australia plays its part in limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C and avoiding a future of ever more devastating climate disruption, and that it will need to be accompanied by determined efforts to shift Australia rapidly beyond coal and gas and to 100% clean exports by 2030. Nonetheless, it is an important foundation. The climate crisis affects every one of us. Globally, it is the single greatest threat in the fight against hunger and poverty. Here in Australia, it is already taking an enormous toll on the lives and livelihoods of many Australians. If Australia can break free from decades of policy paralysis and partisan battles over climate action, we can not only help ensure a safer future for Australians and people everywhere, but equally realise Australia\u2019s huge potential to prosper in a zero-carbon world. It\u2019s time for our leaders to act. Zali Steggall has released the Climate Change (National Framework for Adaptation and Mitigation) bill 2020. The crossbench are hoping to get a conscience vote on this. But for those wondering what it\u2019s all about, here is the introduction to the bill. This act establishes a framework for adaptation and mitigation in relation to climate change. Decision-makers must consider seven guiding principles when performing functions or duties or exercising powers under this act or provisions of other prescribed acts. The commission is required to prepare a national climate change risk assessment within a year of the commencement of this act and every five years after that. In response to each national climate change risk assessment, the minister must prepare a national adaptation plan. The commission must evaluate the implementation of these plans annually. This act sets a target of zero net accounting emissions by 2050. The target can only be changed if there is a significant change in circumstances and the commission is satisfied the significant change justifies the change. In order to meet the net zero target, the act also provides for the minister to set emissions budgets for emissions budget periods on advice from the commission. The minister must also prepare emissions reduction plans for each emissions budget. The commission provides advice on these plans also. This act establishes the commission and provides for a Parliamentary Joint Committee on climate Adaptation and Mitigation. Appointments to the commission must be approved by the committee. Just a reminder \u2013 this is not a very sad situation. Literally nothing changes. Nothing. If Llew O\u2019Brien is still a member of the LNP, he is still a member of the government. He is just not sitting in the Nationals party room, and is freed to slam Michael McCormack\u2019s leadership even more. And for the pedants out there, a clarification: Joko Widodo will not be addressing a joint sitting of the parliament \u2013 just the House. But senators are invited to watch as guests. Over in the Senate, and Labor wants to try and address some issues with the encryption laws \u2013 the ones Labor had passed, in the hopes that it could fix the legislation if it won the election. We all know how that played out. Today, Labor will try and have the recommendations the intelligence and security committee put forward, which the government did not implement. From Kristina Keneally: Today in the Senate, Labor will debate a private senator\u2019s bill \u2013 Telecommunications Amendment (Repairing Assistance and Access) bill 2019. The bill implements the bipartisan recommendations of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. The amendments in Labor\u2019s bill were agreed to by Liberal PJCIS members and promised by the government some 14 months ago. The Australian tech sector holds great potential for economic growth and job creation, but is being held back by the Morrison government\u2019s failure to deliver these legislative changes. Tech companies report that customers are less likely to seek out contracts with Australian companies because the encryption laws pose risks that they would be required by the government to introduce systemic weaknesses into their products and systems. ... Labor\u2019s plans to improve the flawed encryption legislation have been supported by the Communications Alliance, StartupAus, the Australian Industry Group, BSA The Software Alliance, the Human Rights Law Centre, Digital Rights Watch, Electronic Frontiers Australia and the Australian Privacy Foundation. In bipartisanship news, Dave Sharma and Josh Burns will introduce a private members motion together, calling on Israel to extradite Malka Leifer. Leifer is wanted on 74 charges related to child sexual abuse dating back to when she was principal of the Adass Isreal school in Melbourne. Australia first requested Leifer be extradited in 2014. From the joint release: There have been 63 court hearings since that time, and the case still has not moved to the formal extradition phase, despite a psychiatric panel declaring Malka Leifer fit for extradition in January this year. Leifer\u2019s alleged victims, sisters Dassi Erlich, Nicole Meyer and Elly Sapper, have waited long enough for their former principal to face justice in Australia. Indonesian president Joko Widodo is (literally) in the House. He\u2019ll sign the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) with Scott Morrison and address the parliament later this morning. Amnesty International has called on Morrison to raise the West Papuan situation with Widodo and Greens leader Adam Bandt and former leader Richard Di Natale will be wearing West Papuan lapel flags during the address. West Papuan human rights advocate Ronny Kareni will also be Di Natale\u2019s guest. Kareni \u201cis a member of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua and is a longstanding campaigner for West Papuan human rights\u201d. OK. Back on deck now (the rain, welcome as it is, led to a few logistical problems for me this morning, so apologies). What does the Llew O\u2019Brien drama mean? Nothing really. He remains in the LNP, and he\u2019ll sit in the joint party room. He just won\u2019t sit in the Nationals party room. He is a pretty conservative guy, so there is no way on Lizzo\u2019s green earth he won\u2019t vote with the government 99% of the time. The government\u2019s two-seat majority is not in doubt. He\u2019ll just be free(er \u2013 he has never been a quiet one) to make a bit more noise. A bit like Kevin Hogan after Malcolm Turnbull was rolled. Hogan stayed in the Nationals but sat on the crossbench in the chamber. O\u2019Brien remains in the LNP, so he is still a member of the government, but won\u2019t sit in the Nationals party room. It\u2019s the clayton\u2019s crossbench. Here is AAP on Llew O\u2019Brien: Nationals backbencher Llew O\u2019Brien has quit the party following Barnaby Joyce\u2019s failed leadership bid. O\u2019Brien told Scott Morrison of his decision on Sunday night. He will remain in the Coalition party room. \u201cO\u2019Brien joined the LNP at its inception and remains a member of the LNP. O\u2019Brien will not make any statements until after he has met with the prime minister,\u201d his spokeswoman told AAP on Monday. The member for Wide Bay in Queensland was among Barnaby Joyce supporters who were last week threatening to cross the floor and block Coalition legislation after the failed leadership bid. Senior government minister Mathias Cormann said O\u2019Brien would still be a member of the Liberal National party. \u201cHe continues to support the government \u2013 that is what he has made clear to the prime minister,\u201d Cormann said. O\u2019Brien will give the government supply. The Nationals just keep on keeping on, don\u2019t they? The Courier Mail reports Wide Bay (one of the safest Liberal National party seats in Queensland) MP Llew O\u2019Brien quit the National party last night, after a \u201cshouting match\u201d with Michael McCormack. You can read the whole story here in the Courier Mail. O\u2019Brien is the MP who brought on the leadership spill last week. Seems he is still not over it. His local paper reports he told Scott Morrison last night he was going to quit the National party \u2013 but Morrison has granted him permission to stay in the LNP. What that means I am not quite sure, but at this stage, O\u2019Brien won\u2019t be sitting in the National party room or the Liberal party room. And he\u2019ll still give the government supply. But he will be free to cross the floor on a whole heap of other issues, like ensuring integrity. Meanwhile, it seems George Christensen is falling into line. But don\u2019t think this is over. Not by a long shot. There are a group of National MPs who seem pretty determined to get their way and they don\u2019t seem to mind what the consequences are. That\u2019s not something that is going to just pass. In my experience, it\u2019s something which festers. Oh, and Indonesian president Joko Widodo is in town for a bilateral visit. He will address the parliament today, becoming only the second Indonesian leader to do so. And Zali Steggall, Helen Haines, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie will be releasing a climate bill today. They want a bipartisan approach to preparing for climate change and are hoping to get a conscience vote on the issue. Stay tuned for all of that and more as the day unfolds, with Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and a one-coffee me at your service. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>In just a month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">the coronavirus outbreak</a> has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take.</p> \n<h2>Can it be contained?</h2> \n<p>When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/01/23/its-been-sequenced-its-spread-across-borders-now-the-new-pneumonia-causing-virus-needs-a-name/\">2019-nCoV</a> are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). \u201cSars emerged in one or two people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start \u2013 it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small \u2013 two people versus 16, say \u2013 in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks.</p> \n<p>It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronacharts10feb-zip/giv-3902cLQ77wfhT4KD/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronacharts10feb-zip/giv-3902cLQ77wfhT4KD/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-who-warns-spread-by-people-who-had-not-visited-china-could-be-tip-of-the-iceberg\">could be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d</a>, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/10/coronavirus-uk-declares-outbreak-serious-threat-to-health\">declared the virus \u201ca serious and imminent threat to public health\u201d</a> after four new cases were diagnosed in the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. \u201cThere are a large number of cases in China, even though they\u2019re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China.

      "bodyText": "In just a month, the coronavirus outbreak has snowballed from a handful of cases to more than 40,000, reaching four continents and prompting an all-out battle to stop the spread across China and beyond. As those in Wuhan face shortages of hospital beds and supplies that have been likened to \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, experts and scientists are attempting to trace out the possible paths that the virus might take. Can it be contained? When Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) hit in 2002, after an initial surge in cases, the epidemic fizzled out. However, many experts believe the chances of this happening with 2019-nCoV are looking increasingly slim. In fact, the odds may have been more difficult even from the start of the latest outbreak, according to David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). \u201cSars emerged in one or two people,\u201d he said. \u201cThis current outbreak it seems was quite explosive at the start \u2013 it was many different people infected at the start, and they each set off their own chain of transmission.\u201d Although the difference in initial case numbers may sound small \u2013 two people versus 16, say \u2013 in an epidemic where numbers of infections are doubling every five days that could have set back containment efforts by several weeks. It is too early to calculate how effective quarantines have been in containing the spread. A slight levelling off in the number of global cases over the past few days has been taken by some as a cause for optimism, although this may also reflect difficulties in recording cases. On Sunday, World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that cases of the coronavirus being transmitted by people who had never been to China could be \u201cthe tip of the iceberg\u201d, while on Monday the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, declared the virus \u201ca serious and imminent threat to public health\u201d after four new cases were diagnosed in the country. \u201cOne has to be a little bit pessimistic at this stage,\u201d said Prof Peter Smith, an epidemiologist at LSHTM. \u201cThere are a large number of cases in China, even though they\u2019re putting in place these draconian measures to contain it. It\u2019s looking increasingly likely that it will become well-established in China. The likelihood is then that it will leak to other countries.\u201d \u201cMy pessimistic view at this stage is that it is likely to become quite widespread and will be around for some time.\u201d If it\u2019s not contained, will it be here to stay? Some coronaviruses are seasonal and so it is possible that the number of cases may begin to dampen down as spring comes. But if the virus is already widespread by that point, it does not necessarily mean it is gone for good \u2013 just like flu, coronavirus could rear its head again next winter, at which point it would be considered an endemic human disease. There are already four circulating coronaviruses (chances are you have had one \u2013 they cause about a quarter of common colds) that originally made the leap to humans from cows, bats and other animals. \u201cCoronaviruses have established themselves before. We have four of them that cause common cold-like illness,\u201d said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \u201cThere\u2019s a very high chance that can be the fifth.\u201d If the coronavirus is still circulating in a year, its impact could be lessened by a level of immunity in the population and, possibly, the availability of vaccine to protect health workers and those most vulnerable. \u201cThis is the situation where a vaccine will become relevant,\u201d said Smith.

The coronavirus is not expected to mutate this rapidly and so once a vaccine is here, it should continue to work far into the future. When will a vaccine be ready? Teams around the world are racing to produce a vaccine, with some vaccine candidates already being tested in animals, just weeks after the coronavirus DNA sequence was released. Jeff Richardson of Inovio Pharmaceuticals, one of the teams backed by funding from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), said the team\u2019s DNA-based vaccine is already being manufactured on a larger scale for human testing projected to start early summer. A team from the University of Queensland, also backed by Cepi, is already testing its vaccine in combination with a technology developed by GSK, which makes the immune system respond more strongly to vaccines, potentially lowering the dose required by a factor of four.

      "bodyText": "The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight, as the government announced new powers to detain people suspected of having the virus. The four new cases \u2013 three men and one woman \u2013 were transferred from Brighton, where they were diagnosed, to London over the weekend in order to receive specialist care. Public Health England (PHE) later confirmed that two of the four were healthcare workers. Of those in the UK now diagnosed with the virus, five were closely linked to a businessman who was told he had the disease last week in Brighton. The development came as the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health, a step that gives authorities additional powers to fight its spread. One of the latest group to be diagnosed is a male doctor who was part of a group skiing in a resort near Chamonix in France with the man at the centre of the Brighton outbreak, the Guardian understands. The other three patients were also infected on the skiing trip. The businessman is being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in south London, one of the NHS\u2019s network of specialist high-consequence infectious diseases (HCID) treatment centres in England. A GP practice in Brighton, the County Oak Medical Centre, had been closed after a doctor there tested positive for the virus. It said it had closed its doors \u201cbecause of an urgent operational health and safety reason\u201d. People wearing protective full-body suits and gloves were seen cleaning the centre. Staff at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove told the area\u2019s Argus newspaper that they had been told to self-isolate as a man with the virus had attended a yoga class there last week. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London, and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said that eight people had tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested as of 2pm Monday. \u201cFour further patients in England have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight,\u201d he said. It also emerged on Monday that one of those being tested was a student at the University of Sussex, though no result had yet been returned. A spokeswoman for the institution said: \u201cThe student had recently returned from overseas. We are following all Public Health England guidance in terms of practical next steps and we will be keeping our students and staff at the university informed if there are any developments. The University of Bath also confirmed that a member of its community was being tested for coronavirus \u201cas a precaution and is self-isolating pending the outcome of the test results as advised by Public Health England\u201d. PHE medical director Yvonne Doyle said: \u201cAs a result of our contact tracing, we now know the new cases announced today are all closely linked to one another. Two of these new cases are healthcare workers and as soon as they were identified, we advised them to self-isolate in order to keep patient contact to a minimum.\u201d \u201cThe new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France. Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases.

Under the measures announced on Monday, the Department of Health said people with coronavirus could now be forcibly detained and sent to isolation if public health professionals believed there was a reasonable risk that they may have the virus. Hancock said the government was taking every possible step to control the outbreak. \u201cNHS staff and others will now be supported with additional legal powers to keep people safe across the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe transmission of coronavirus would constitute a serious threat, so I am taking action to protect the public and isolate those at risk of spreading the virus.

All those who have been evacuated to the UK have been asked to sign a contract agreeing to remain in quarantine for 14 days, but there were concerns that these contracts were not legally enforceable. The new designation by the Department of Health follows reports that a British man who caught coronavirus at a business conference in Singapore had been linked to at least seven other confirmed cases in England, France and Spain. The middle-aged man visited a ski chalet in the Alpine resort area near Mont Blanc before returning to the UK on an easyJet flight to Gatwick airport from Geneva on 28 January. He was diagnosed with the virus in Brighton and was transferred on Thursday to St Thomas\u2019.",

Academy Awards veer off script with a thrilling twist ending Bong Joon-ho\u2019s Parasite was the unexpected victor at the 92nd Academy Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday. The South Korean production is the first foreign-language film to win best picture, with Bong also claiming Oscars for best director, best international feature and best original screenplay. The rest of the winners\u2019 list went largely to form, with acting prizes going to Joaquin Phoenix (Joker), Ren\u00e9e Zellweger (Judy), Laura Dern (Marriage Story) and Brad Pitt (Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Welcome change. Peter Bradshaw says Parasite\u2019s win shows Hollywood is at last opening its mind to the outside world. Taika Waititi, who won the best adapted screenplay Oscar for Jojo Rabbit, dedicated his win to aspiring Indigenous storytellers. Post-ballgown looks. From capes to chainmail, Sunday\u2019s red carpet looks went well beyond old Hollywood glamour, writes Jess Cartner-Morley, while some stars used their outfits as an opportunity to make a political statement. WHO warns confirmed coronavirus cases \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 The head of the World Health Organization has warned that international cases of the coronavirus among people who have never travelled to China \u201cmay indicate more widespread transmission in other countries\u201d. It came as China prepared to return to work on Monday following the extended lunar new year holiday. China\u2019s death toll has jumped to 908, with 40,000 confirmed infections, while a further 60 cases have been confirmed onboard a quarantined cruise ship in Japan. Missing journalist. Chen Qiushi, a citizen journalist and human rights advocate who was reporting from the heart of the outbreak in Wuhan, has gone missing \u2013 prompting claims the Chinese authorities may have silenced another whistleblower. Global economy. China plays an outsized role in today\u2019s world economy, which means the financial fallout from the coronavirus crisis could be large and long-lasting, writes Philip Inman. Sheldon Adelson \u2018to donate $100m to Trump and GOP\u2019 The billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson intends to donate at least $100m to Donald Trump and Republican congressional candidates during the 2020 presidential cycle, GOP fundraisers have told the Guardian.

Sanders campaign to ask for \u2018partial recanvass\u2019 in Iowa Bernie Sanders\u2019s presidential campaign has asked for a partial recanvass of the chaotic caucus results in Iowa, as the Democratic field gears up for Tuesday\u2019s primary in New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg still leads the Vermont senator by two state delegates at the latest count, but the results are still considered somewhat unreliable. A recanvass is not a recount, but a check of the existing vote count to make certain that the results were tallied correctly. New Hampshire. Sanders remains the favourite in New Hampshire, with Joe Biden stepping up his attacks on his rival\u2019s democratic socialism as the former vice-president struggles to regain frontrunner status in the national race. Cheat sheet Sinn F\u00e9in, the former political wing of the IRA, is celebrating an electoral \u201crevolution\u201d in Ireland, where its leaders say they will attempt to form a governing coalition after winning more votes than any other party in the country\u2019s general election. Angela Merkel\u2019s designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is not planning to run for the chancellorship in Germany at the next federal election and plans to step down as the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union. A hitman suspected of involvement in the murder of Brazilian politician Marielle Franco, who had close links with the family of president Jair Bolsonaro, has been shot dead by police in the country\u2019s Bahia state. Trump has decried a photo showing him with a stark forehead tan line as \u201cfake news\u201d, while Twitter and Facebook refused to remove a video posted by the president, which misleadingly shows Nancy Pelosi repeatedly tearing up his State of the Union speech. Bill Gates is doing his bit for the environment by commissioning the world\u2019s first hydrogen-powered superyacht, worth an estimated $644m and featuring an infinity pool, helipad and spa.

The rise of climate anxiety While the physical impact of the climate crisis is becoming impossible to ignore, it is also taking its toll on people\u2019s mental wellbeing. Now climate scientists are recruiting psychologists to help tackle the trauma caused by ecological breakdown, as Matthew Taylor and Jessica Murray report. Why comic-book movies are ditching gloomy monochrome From Birds of Prey to Wonder Woman 1984, the latest batch of superhero blockbusters is getting rid of the gloomy, realistic greys in favour of a vibrant riot of colour.

The outbreak has forced smartphone factories across China to shut down as officials impose restrictions on travel and large groups of people assembling in one place. The analysis firm TrendForce predicted that 275m smartphones will be made in January-March, down 12% from 310m in the first three months of 2019. Apple\u2019s production will fall 10%, it estimates, while Huawei will be 15% lower. \u201cDelayed resumption work and uncertainties in employees\u2019 returns will cause the monthly delivery of key components to be postponed, thus affecting the progress of smartphone production,\u201d TrendForce said. Separately, the research firm Canalys predicted that sales of smartphones in China could halve this quarter as many retail shops are closed and production has been hit. The Apple supplier Foxconn, which has switched some of its production lines to make surgical masks for its own staff, received government approval on Monday to resume production at a plant in the city of Zhengzhou but its major plant in the Longhua district of Shenzhen, as well as others, remains closed. According to Nikkei business daily, government officials feared that Foxconn\u2019s factories have a \u201chigh risk of coronavirus infection\u201d because of poor airflow and central heating systems. In the eurozone, investor morale has fallen for the first time in four months, according to the research group Sentix, which blamed anxiety about the outbreak\u2019s impact on global trade. The Sentix managing director, Manfred Huebner, said: \u201cWhile at the beginning of the year there was still a clear upswing scenario for the global economy, the outbreak of the coronavirus in China has changed the situation significantly. \u201cThe drastic measures taken by the Chinese government for the Hubei region show the danger to the global economy if the outbreak cannot be limited regionally.\u201d Sentix\u2019s euro-area confidence measure dropped to 5.2 in February from 7.6 in January but remains higher than last autumn, when the index was dragged negative by trade war fears. Other industries with sizeable manufacturing operations either in China or dependent on the parts it produces continue to suffer, with shutdowns affecting everything from fashion to restaurants and the automotive industry. On Monday, Nissan said it would temporarily suspend production at its Kyushu manufacturing plant in south-west Japan, in the latest sign of strain in the global supply chain. Last week the South Korean carmaker Hyundai halted production lines because of a shortage of parts from China.

The foreign delegates included one from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak.</p> \n<p>After the conference, the Briton travelled to the French ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, where he stayed with his family between 24 and 28 January. He flew back to the UK on a busy easyJet flight from Geneva to Gatwick. Still oblivious to the fact he had the virus, which has a two-week incubation period, he returned home and on the evening of 1 February he visited a local pub, The Grenadier, in Hove.</p> \n<p>It was only after being informed by the conference organisers that another delegate had contracted the virus that he alerted the public health authorities and subsequently tested positive.</p> \n<p>As protocol dictates, a scramble began to identify all those with whom he had been in contact to ascertain whether they too had been infected. Five workers at The Grenadier were instructed to self-isolate.

      "bodyText": "Three weeks ago, when knowledge of the coronavirus was still in its infancy, a middle-aged man from Hove, East Sussex, travelled to Singapore for a sales conference. The event, organised by his firm, Servomex, was a chance to sharpen up sales skills and network with colleagues from other countries in the plush surrounds of the five-star Grand Hyatt hotel, where rooms can cost \u00a31,000 a night. The trip exposed the Sussex businessman to the Wuhan coronavirus and in the days after the conference it is believed he passed the bug to at least 11 Britons in three countries, prompting concerns about the danger posed by so-called super-spreaders. The unnamed man, the first Briton to have tested positive for coronavirus, attended the sales conference from 20 to 22 January. He was among 94 delegates \u2013 out of a total of 109 \u2013 who travelled from abroad. The foreign delegates included one from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. After the conference, the Briton travelled to the French ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, where he stayed with his family between 24 and 28 January. He flew back to the UK on a busy easyJet flight from Geneva to Gatwick. Still oblivious to the fact he had the virus, which has a two-week incubation period, he returned home and on the evening of 1 February he visited a local pub, The Grenadier, in Hove. It was only after being informed by the conference organisers that another delegate had contracted the virus that he alerted the public health authorities and subsequently tested positive. As protocol dictates, a scramble began to identify all those with whom he had been in contact to ascertain whether they too had been infected. Five workers at The Grenadier were instructed to self-isolate. The man\u2019s travels in the intervening period multiplied the number of people he had potentially infected, and cases linked to him began to emerge. On Saturday, the French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said five British citizens, including a nine-year-old child, had tested positive for the coronavirus. They had stayed in a chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie, which had been visited by the businessman from Hove. Buzyn said another six UK nationals were being kept under observation in French hospitals, and two schools the nine-year-old visited were being shut as a precaution. On Sunday, more cases linked to the businessman emerged. Public Health England (PHE) said another patient in the UK had tested positive after the virus was passed on in France from another already confirmed UK case. It was announced that a British man living in Mallorca, who had been in Les Contamines-Montjoie with his family until 29 January, had also tested positive. On Monday, it was confirmed that a further four people in the UK \u2013 three men and a woman in Brighton \u2013 had tested positive for coronavirus. The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said all were \u201cknown contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France\u201d. Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said: \u201cThis is not particularly surprising but it does appear that the index case has passed on the infection to an unusually large number of contacts.

The US ambassador to Seoul, Harry Harris, tweeted, \u201cwe are doing a watch party at the embassy eating jjapaguri\u201d, referring to the noodle dish the wealthy family eats in the movie. The American actor and filmmaker Eugene Lee Yang said: \u201cLanguage is a core expression of identity. Subtitles do not divide or disqualify \u2013 they\u2019re gateways into incredible stories you might have otherwise never known. Tonight I heard the language of my family on the Oscars stage. I can\u2019t wait to hear many, many more.\u201d Hashtags #Parasite and #DirectorBongJoonho were topped trends on Twitter South Korea, while the film\u2019s name was the most searched on the local Naver web portal after the wins. The Korea society, a nonprofit that promotes greater understanding between people in Korea and the US, said Parasite had \u201cshattered\u201d more than nine decades of Oscar history on Sunday night. Many South Koreans described Parasite\u2019s Oscar successes as a victory for the entire country, not just for its film industry, with some saying it was one of the few brights spots in a month dominated by the coronavirus\u2019s spread to South Korea. But some in South Korea, particularly in the independent film sector, voiced concern about the film\u2019s links to the chaebol \u2013 a reference to the powerful family-run conglomerates that drove modern South Korea\u2019s economic development. \u201cOn one hand, I feel happy about its win but at the same time, the film was produced by a chaebol company,\u201d Ahn Hae-ryong, a documentary maker, told the Guardian. \u201cTogether, they own 99% of all the screens and monopolise them for blockbusters. It is a film about the gap between the rich and the poor, but it is in fact feeding off the suffering of the poor to make the fat cats even fatter. The Oscar wins will do nothing for indie filmmakers.\u201d Others said the film\u2019s success was cause for celebration, despite its chaebol connections. Jeong Min-ah, a South Korean film critic, was particularly impressed by Miky Lee\u2019s acceptance speech after Parasite was named best picture. \u201cShe thanked everyone who has supported Korean cinema. She is aware of the power of audiences,\u201d Jeong said. Kim Si-moo, head of the South Korean branch of the International Federation of Film Critics, said the awards had recognised the power of storytelling, regardless of the language. \u201cThe Oscars have opted for change at last. Hollywood\u2019s technical advancement has reached its peak, as shown with other nominees,\u201d Kim said. \u201cBut the Academy Association members have gone for a unique story that is also universal.\u201d",

We will see if this sustains and if the supply chain shock that we have all been worried about is just a temporary set back as we get things back on track. The question would become, are we going to see a \u2018v\u2019shaped recovery as pent up demand catches up or did we lose a lot of production that will not come back? That is assuming of course that the virus is contained and that still remains to be seen.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mihir Kapadia, </strong>the CEO of <strong>Sun Global Investments</strong>, says the rising death toll is worrying investors:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u201cAsian markets have continued their slide as the death toll from the coronavirus has exceeded the SARS epidemic, which is raising concerns that the virus growing more serious. With 908 now dead in China, and the possibility of it reaching 1,000 in just a few days, Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7% to record a second day of losses while Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.8% and Australian shares dropped 0.5%.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Coronavirus fears continue to weigh on the financial markets, as supply chains are hit by factory closures and consumers face higher prices in the shops. Stocks are down in Europe and the US today, following losses in most of Asia. The FTSE 100 is currently down 30 points, or 0.4%, with travel companies and hotel operators among the fallers. The French CAC and German DAX are also down almost 0.5%. Although Chinese workers were due back at work today, many factories, shops and offices are still closed. LG, Samsung and Foxconn, for example, have all been forced to keep manufacturing sites closer. This has led analysts to predict that global smartphone production could slide by over 10% this quarter, with many Chinese assembly lines gathering dust. The crisis has also hit market confidence; Sentix\u2019s survey of investor morale has fallen this month, on fears that global growth will be hit. President Xi Jinping has tried to calm the situation, pledging that large-scale layoffs will be avoided. But families are already being hit in the pocket; Chinese inflation has hit an eight year high today, partly due to supply shortages and stockpiling. Last year\u2019s swine fever epidemic, which has driven pork price up by over 100%, is another factor. Wall Street has opened lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average losing 75 points or 0.25%. That adds to losses on Friday, which unwound some of the recovery seen last week after heavy losses on Monday. Rupert Thompson, Chief Investment Officer at Kingswood, predicts more volatility as the cost of the coronavirus becomes clearer: Chinese growth looks set to slow sharply in the first quarter and global growth is also likely to weaken significantly. However, the important point is that this disruption is expected to be only temporary, with activity bouncing back in the second and third quarters. This was certainly the experience of previous health scares. This time, the backdrop of improving business confidence should increase the ability of the global economy to withstand the hit from the virus. Even so, it will be a few weeks before it becomes evident that the virus really is under control, and a few months before the global economic recovery has clearly managed to ride out the disruption. We anticipate further market volatility during this period of uncertainty and we are not looking for global equities to sustain a break higher for a while yet. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro has seized on the coronavirus crisis to renew calls for US companies to shift factories back to America. Speaking on Fox News today, Navarro argued that the supply chain disruption shows that more pharmaceutical and medical manufacturing should be brought back to the US. Navarro also told Fox Business that it\u2019s too early to assess the impact on the US economy. \u201cI think we are going to have to wait another couple of weeks or a month to see just what exactly is going on. \u201cThere\u2019s also companies that are going back to work in China as we speak. We won\u2019t know for a couple of weeks now whether the virus is going to peak or whether it\u2019s going to spread.\u201d Wall Street is heading for a rather dull open in an hour\u2019s time. The main indices are flat in the futures market, with coronavirus worries weighing on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs have predicted that the impact on the global economy, and company profits, will be \u201climited\u201d, telling clients: The impact of the lower global and U.S. economic activity on 2020 S&amp;P 500 earnings per share will be limited. \u201cInvestors who believe the economic consequences of the coronavirus will be limited should increase exposure to cyclicals and value stocks.\u201d But Brad Betchel of Jefferies points out that we simply don\u2019t know how the Chinese economy will react. Even if supply chains rebound quickly, firms may not recover lost business. We start out with a slew of headlines indicating that factories and businesses in several regions around China are reopening after their extended holiday. Some municipalities seem to be advising factories to remain shut and employees to remain at home but otherwise the bulk of the headlines have been about reopening. We will see if this sustains and if the supply chain shock that we have all been worried about is just a temporary set back as we get things back on track. The question would become, are we going to see a \u2018v\u2019shaped recovery as pent up demand catches up or did we lose a lot of production that will not come back? That is assuming of course that the virus is contained and that still remains to be seen. Mihir Kapadia, the CEO of Sun Global Investments, says the rising death toll is worrying investors: \u201cAsian markets have continued their slide as the death toll from the coronavirus has exceeded the SARS epidemic, which is raising concerns that the virus growing more serious. With 908 now dead in China, and the possibility of it reaching 1,000 in just a few days, Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7% to record a second day of losses while Japan\u2019s Nikkei fell 0.8% and Australian shares dropped 0.5%. These came following Wall Street\u2019s struggles on Friday where the Dow fell 0.9% and, the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.5% in what will likely see markets follow a similar trend this week, unless Beijing makes any concrete announcements that the coronavirus has been contained. It is clear that markets will remain sensitive to any coronavirus-related headlines. Although we are currently seeing relatively stable markets, any significantly worse news on the virus could lead to further significant declines in global indices. Precious metal prices are up this morning, China\u2019s state TV is reporting that president Xi Jinping has pledged to prevent the large-scale layoff of workers, due to economic disruption caused by the coronavirus. Xi, who visited a hospital treating patients from the outbreak today, warned that the situation was \u201cstill severe\u201d, but pledged that China would win the battle. He pledged that states will take \u201cmore decisive measures\u201d to combat the virus, and to restrict the dangers of rising infections as people return to work this week. On the economic front, Xi insisted that the \u201clong-term improving momentum\u201d of China\u2019s economy hasn\u2019t changed -- perhaps brushing over the fact that growth hit a 30-year low last year. Economic \u201cadjustments\u201d will be made to minimise the impact of the coronavirus, he added, as Beijing strives to hit its economic and social targets for 2020. The coronavirus has already had a major impact on Mobile World Congress, the huge mobile phone conference held in Barcelona each year. Some big names have pulled out of the show, including Sony, Amazon, Nvidia, LG and Ericsson. They want to avoid their executives potentially becoming infected as they mingled at the trade stands or hold business meetings. But this is another sign that the coronavirus could have a long-term impact on the global economy -- fewer deals and connections will be made at MWC, which could lead to less innovation and new products down the line. Reuters is reporting that Nissan are suspending production at a car factory in Kyushu, in Japan, due to the coronavirus. The Kyushu factory manufactures Nissan\u2019s X-Trail SUV, and this is a sign that the virus is hurting global supply chains. Last month Nissan suspended work at its Chinese factories, including joint ventures in the Wuhan area. Other carmakers took similar moves, and they now seem to be having a knock-on impact. South Korean car maker Hyundai was force to close all its car factories in South Korea after running out of components from China. It\u2019s official: The coronavirus outbreak has hurt investor confidence across Europe. Eurozone investor morale has fallen for the first time in four months, according to research group Sentix. It blames fears that the coronavirus will have a serious impact on the global economy. Sentix chief Manfred Huebner explains: While at the beginning of the year there was still a clear upswing scenario for the global economy, the outbreak of the coronavirus in China has changed the situation significantly. The drastic measures taken by the Chinese government for the Hubei region show the danger to the global economy if the outbreak cannot be limited regionally Sentix\u2019s euro-area confidence measure dropped to 5.2 in February, from 7.6 in January. That\u2019s still higher than last autumn, when the index was dragged in negative territory by trade war fears. But there could be worse ahead. Currently, most investors are hopeful that the economic damage from coronavirus can be confined to China (which may be optimistic, given the number of major companies affected). So morale could keep falling, if more cases are diagnosed around the globe. As Huebner puts it: \u201cThe outbreak of the coronavirus and the subsequent drastic measures taken by the Chinese government cast a shadow over the economic outlook. Fortunately, so far the effect is limited.\u201d \u201cHowever, in view of the significant declines in Chinese economic data, it is clear that the negative effect is likely to be much greater if it does not become apparent in the coming days that the spread of the virus has been taken away.\u201d The coronavirus crisis could slash global smartphone production by 12% this quarter, according to a new analyst report. Trendforce has predicted that just 275 million smartphones will be made in January-March, down from around 310m in Q1 2019. Apple\u2019s production will fall 10%, it estimates, while Huawei will be 15% lower. Trendforce says: \u201cDelayed resumption work and uncertainties in employees\u2019 returns will cause the monthly delivery of key components to be postponed, thus affecting the progress of smartphone production.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has already forced smartphone factories across China to shutdown. Foxconn, which manufacturers iPhones, has been forced to abandon plans to reopen plants today. According to Nikkei business daily, government officials feared that Foxconn\u2019s factories have a \u201chigh risk of coronavirus infection\u201d, due to poor airflow and central heating systems. Apple temporarily closing its 42 stores in mainland China earlier this month, which will inevitably hurt sales. Separately, research firm Canalys predicted that sales of smartphones in China could HALVE this quarter, as many retail shops are closed and production has been hit. They warned: \u201cVendors\u2019 planned product launches will be canceled or delayed, given that large public events are not allowed in China. \u201cIt will take time for vendors to change their product launch roadmaps in China, which is likely to dampen 5G shipments.\u201d Back in the City, shares in hotel firms and airlines are among the fallers - on fears that the coronavirus outbreak will hurt the tourism industry. Ireland\u2019s stock market has slumped by 1.25% in early trading after a seismic general election result created political deadlock. Bank shares are leading the rout, down over 5%, after Sinn F\u00e9in smashed the dominance of Fine Gail and Fianna F\u00e1il. Sinn F\u00e9in appears to have won the most first preference votes, as voters flocked to its progressive policy platform including tackling Ireland\u2019s housing crisis, supporting lower-paid workers and cut childcare costs -- and to push for a \u2018unity referendum\u2019 on a united Ireland. Coalition talks could take several days, or longer, with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar ruling out an agreement between his Fine Gail party and Sinn F\u00e9in. Ouch! Italian factory production has slumped much more than expected, in a worrying signal for the eurozone economy. Italy\u2019s manufacturing output slumped by 2.7% month-on-month in December, matching similar declines in France and Germany. Economists had only expected a 0.5% drop. We already knew that Italy\u2019s economy shrank in October-December, and today\u2019s figures underline its weakness. Over in Germany, a major political story is breaking. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer is stepping down as leader of the governing CDU party, dashing expectations that she would run to succeed Angela Merkel as German chancellor. This throws the race to replace Merkel wide open, with significant implications for the eurozone. AKK\u2019s decision follows a political crisis over local elections in the small state of Thuringia, where CDU deputies teamed up with the far-right Alternative for Germany party. AKK had pleaded with party members not to work with AfD, but was ignored, undermining her authority as party leader. Although the Lunar New Year break has ended today, there are clear signs that China\u2019s economy isn\u2019t getting back to normal yet. Electronics manufacturer LG has reported that three of its factories, in Hangzhou, Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, are all closed as it seeks permission from local government officials to reopen. Samsung says its TVC factory in Tianjin will remain closed until next Monday, in line with official guidelines. Metal prices are rising this morning, on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt supplies. Copper has gained 0.8% this morning, while nickel is up 2%, zinc is 1.6% higher and tin is up 1.8%. There are concerns that China\u2019s metal output will fall sharply this quarter (as so many factories have been shuttered), as Reuters explained: \u201cBefore the price consolidation, the main concern was demand destruction due to China\u2019s economic slowdown and lockdown, but as the situation develops, it seems that supply is also disrupted,\u201d said analyst Helen Lau of Argonaut Securities. European stock markets have started the new week by dropping into the red. The FTSE 100 is down 26 points, or 0.35%, while the broader Stoxx 600 index has lost 0.25%. Investors are trying to assess the economic damage from the coronavirus, and its impact on global supply chains as (some) Chinese workers head back to the office or factory. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: New cases in China are stabilising but it\u2019s now more deadly than SARS was. What\u2019s still unknown is the real economic damage this has wrought. Markets will continue to find support from ample liquidity delivered by willing central banks and the buy-the-dip mentality lives on. An explosion of cases in London or New York could spook traders still\u2026the UK government calls the coronavirus a \u2018serious and imminent threat\u2019 to public health. Most Asia-Pacific stock markets have dipped today, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng and South Korea\u2019s KOSPI both losing 0.6%. Japan fell 0.7%. China\u2019s markets rose, though, up around 0.5% on relief that some employees returned to their workplaces today. The CSI 300 index closed at 3,916, having been trading over 4,200 in mid-January before the coronavirus crisis. China\u2019s inflation rate is likely to remain high for months, warns Nomura analysts, as the coronavirus hits supplies and encourages families to stockpile goods. They told clients: We believe the coronavirus outbreak may keep CPI inflation above 4 percent (year on year) in the first half of 2020 due both to hoarding by households (e.g, food and other supplies), disruptions to transport and supply shocks as a result of those lockdowns,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus crisis continues to weigh on global markets. As the death toll steadily rises, new cases are reported around the world and factories across China remain closed -- leaving economists struggling to assess the impact on the global economy. Today we have new evidence that the outbreak is pushing up prices in China. Chinese inflation has jumped to an eight-year high, climbing to 5.4% per annum in January from 4.5% in December. It appears that the coronavirus is one factor, as households scramble to stock up on essential items, and medical items like face masks and disinfectants. China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics said the jump in inflation was partly due to to the Lunar New Year holiday and the coronavirus outbreak. It reported that Hubei province, which has been hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak, saw a 5.5% jump in consumer inflation, slightly over the national average. That implies that the measures imposed to curb the crisis could be hitting supplies, and thus creating inflationary pressures. Prices across China jumped by 1.4% in January alone -- a sharp rise, which may be partly due to the Lunar New Year (the scramble to get home and buy presents often pushes up costs). Food prices have jumped by over 20% in the last year, partly due to pork prices which surged by 116% year-on-year in January. China has been forced to slaughter hundreds of millions of pigs following the swine fever outbreak last year, leading to a chronic shortage of pork. Non-food prices rose 1.6% in January from a year earlier, picking up from a 1.3% increase in December. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says these three factors all pushed inflation to its highest since 2011: A mix bag of higher pork prices, stronger Chinese New Year demand and the coronavirus outbreak pushed the Chinese inflation to the highest level in more than eight years. The surge in inflation revived worries that the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) would have less freedom to ease its monetary policy to give support to the Chinese economy hit by the coronavirus outbreak, following more than a year-and-a-half long trade frictions with the US. The latest word is that over 900 people have died from the virus which first appeared in Wuhan in December, with 40,171 infected cases. And in the last few minutes, the UK government has declared on Monday that the new coronavirus was a serious and imminent threat to public health. Chinese workers had been expected to return to work today after the extended New year break. But with schools and many factories closed, many people will remain at home. Global stock markets are expected to dip today, after the The head of the World Health Organization warned that we could only be seeing the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019 of coronavirus cases. Also coming up today Sentix\u2019s survey of investor morale, due this morning, could show that the coronavirus crisis has hurt morale. New factory data from Italy is expected to drop in output, as Europe\u2019s manufacturing woes continue. David Madden of CMC Markets explains: Last week there were dreadful industrial production reports from German and France as they showed a fall of 3.5% and 2.8% respectively. The industrial output isn\u2019t the most influential update, but at the same time a very disappointing update will be remembered by traders. The agenda 9am GMT: Italian industrial production figures for December; output expected to fall by 0.5% 9.30am GMT: Sentix survey of eurozone investor confidence; expected to drop to 5.9 from 7.6",

Morrison\u2019s approval stood at 45% at the end of 2019, but slumped five points in January as Australians battled terrible bushfires. This fortnight, Morrison\u2019s approval sits on 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance. While Morrison led the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, as preferred prime minister decisively last November (44% to 28%) before disaster struck, the Guardian Essential sample now has the two leaders neck-and-neck on 36%, with 28% unsure. A community debate about the link between climate change and the summer of wild weather has also spilled over to the Coalition now that federal parliament has resumed for 2020, with Liberals and Nationals now publicly at odds about whether more needs to be done to prevent global heating, and about taxpayer backing for new coal-fired power. As well as the open scrapping between Liberals and Nationals on climate action, the Nationals also remain rancorously at odds after Barnaby Joyce launched an unsuccessful bid to return to the party leadership last week. Late on Monday, Labor managed to humiliate the government by elevating the renegade Nationals MP Llew O\u2019Brien as deputy speaker, despite Michael McCormack backing another candidate, Damien Drum.

While a majority of the sample are entirely sanguine about the government walking away from the surplus commitment in order to bankroll bushfire recovery, more than half of respondents (57%) are critical of the Coalition declaring the budget was \u201cback in the black\u201d when that was a projection, and not a reality. On the sports grants issue, 70% of the sample agrees the decisions of all government MPs involved in allocating grants needs to be investigated given the scathing assessment of the program by the Australian National Audit Office.

Just under half the sample (49%) says the government is doing enough to protect Australians, and 30% say not enough. A strong majority of respondents support the quarantine and travel restriction initiatives put in place by the government. There has been controversy post-election about the reliability of opinion polling, as none of the major surveys \u2013 Newspoll, Ipsos, Galaxy or Essential \u2013 correctly predicted a Coalition victory last May. The polls instead projected Labor in front on a two-party-preferred vote of 51-49 and 52-48. The lack of precision in the polling has prompted public reflection at Essential, as has been flagged by its executive director, Peter Lewis. Guardian Australia is not now publishing measurements of primary votes or a two-party-preferred calculation, but is continuing to publish survey results of responses to questions about the leaders and a range of policy issues. The poll\u2019s margin of error is plus or minus 3%. The sample size is 1,056 respondents.",

In the latest statement on monetary policy, issued on Friday, the Reserve Bank is trying to straddle the position of being concerned about the impact of fires and the coronavirus and also being upbeat.

      "body": "<h2><strong>PITCHFORKS FOR PICKFORD</strong></h2> <p>Jordan Pickford is a complex character, a mass of contradictions who claims to have the hide of a rhinoceros but is apparently wrapped in quite thin skin. We saw the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/08/everton-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">best and worst of him on Saturday</a>, the Everton goalkeeper brilliantly saving a Christian Benteke header with his chest just a few minutes after he\u2019d helped the hapless striker end his fabled drought by morphing into a near-post hologram to gift him a much-needed goal. The Crystal Palace striker\u2019s subsequent effort from point-blank range wasn\u2019t the only thing Pickford got off his chest, as he decided to unburden himself during a post-match interview in which he explained how impervious he is to criticism, while simultaneously conveying the distinct impression that it actually bothers him quite a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me,\u201d he said, before immediately contradicting himself. \u201cBut it does piss you off.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/10/oldham-league-two-trouble-rent-north-stand\">Disputes, unpaid rent and an empty stand: Oldham lurch towards crisis | David Conn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Warming to his theme, the ambivalent Pickford suggested any criticism that comes his way is prompted by his status as an England player, rather than an England player who is enduring a conspicuous period of patchy, but hardly diabolical form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because everyone raves about you when you are with England, but when you go back to your club everyone wants to slate you,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cEveryone hates you, for some reason, that\u2019s part of being an England player. I think the press and everybody, the punters \u2013 look at Gary Neville \u2013 they just want to come for the England players.

      "bodyText": "PITCHFORKS FOR PICKFORD Jordan Pickford is a complex character, a mass of contradictions who claims to have the hide of a rhinoceros but is apparently wrapped in quite thin skin. We saw the best and worst of him on Saturday, the Everton goalkeeper brilliantly saving a Christian Benteke header with his chest just a few minutes after he\u2019d helped the hapless striker end his fabled drought by morphing into a near-post hologram to gift him a much-needed goal. The Crystal Palace striker\u2019s subsequent effort from point-blank range wasn\u2019t the only thing Pickford got off his chest, as he decided to unburden himself during a post-match interview in which he explained how impervious he is to criticism, while simultaneously conveying the distinct impression that it actually bothers him quite a lot. \u201cI don\u2019t let it affect me,\u201d he said, before immediately contradicting himself. \u201cBut it does piss you off.\u201d Warming to his theme, the ambivalent Pickford suggested any criticism that comes his way is prompted by his status as an England player, rather than an England player who is enduring a conspicuous period of patchy, but hardly diabolical form. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, because everyone raves about you when you are with England, but when you go back to your club everyone wants to slate you,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cEveryone hates you, for some reason, that\u2019s part of being an England player. I think the press and everybody, the punters \u2013 look at Gary Neville \u2013 they just want to come for the England players. Everyone gets stick.\u201d While your nit-picking Fiver\u2019s guessing Pickford meant to say \u201cpundits\u201d rather than \u201cpunters\u201d, his decision to single out Neville suggests he has been proving to himself how much he doesn\u2019t let criticism affect him by spending five months brooding over the Sky Sports pundit\u2019s criticism of him for laughing in the immediate aftermath of another blunder that almost cost his side a goal in a game against Manchester City. An undeniably good goalkeeper, Pickford has endured greater torment than being sanctimoniously berated by the punditocracy, having forged his reputation as the standout player in a Sunderland side that happened to be one of the worst teams in the history of the Premier League. While the trauma of shipping three or four goals week in, week out might have proved too much of a psychological burden for some young goalkeepers, Pickford had sufficient mental fortitude to earn himself the move that would ultimately lead to his installation as England\u2019s No 1. With that in mind, it seems slightly odd that he gives two hoots what Neville, The Fiver or any other press box Johnny thinks of him at this slightly difficult time. As Pickford has done little wrong for England, he seems likely to remain Gareth Southgate\u2019s first-choice goalkeeper but is well aware that young pretenders Dean Henderson and Nick Pope (who is actually older than him) are snapping at his heels. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really affect me,\u201d he said, when asked about the looming presence of the Sheffield United goalkeeper in his rear view mirror. \u201cHe\u2019ll do what he\u2019ll do and I\u2019ll do what I\u2019ll do.\u201d And Southgate will do what he\u2019ll do, after wrestling with one of several tricky selection dilemmas facing him in the weeks and months ahead. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cPhilip told me quite soon after we married that he loved me very much but I was a very close second to football and I\u2019m not insulted by that in any way \u2026 we\u2019ve been married 20 years and we\u2019ve been together 23 years and he\u2019s never even made me a drink, honestly\u201d \u2013 Julie Neville explains P Nev\u2019s uncompromising devotion to the beautiful game. FIVER LETTERS \u201cReading the story last week of the Newcastle fan\u2019s graphic goal celebration, along with story regarding safe standing, got me thinking. Do we really want to provide English football fans with the opportunity to stand erect at games?\u201d \u2013 Stuart Robertson-Reed. \u201cFollowing on from music played at the gladiators\u2019 entrance I recall an excellent piece of music making by fans. Elland Road, 1970s, two members of Yorkshire plod walk in front of the away fans (Crystal Palace) leading to immediate rendition of Laurel and Hardy\u2019s theme tune.

      "bodyText": "Kevin Foster, a Home Office minister, has defended government plans to deport 50 people to Jamaica tomorrow, despite the fact that some of them came to the UK as children. Responding to an urgent question tabled by the Labour MP David Lammy, Foster said that the people being deported had collectively been sentenced to a total of 300 years in prison and that the government was deporting them to comply with rules introduced by Labour to protect the public from serious and persistent offenders. But Lammy and other Labour MPs said that there was a danger of the government perpetrating an injustice of the kind inflicted on the Windrush generation, and that the deportations should be halted pending the publication of the Windrush lessons learned review. According to BBC\u2019s Newsnight, one draft of the lessons learned report recommended that the government consider ending the deportation of offenders who came to the UK as children. Aslef, the train drivers\u2019 union, has said that it is backing Rebecca Long-Bailey to be the next leader of the Labour party, and Angela Rayner to be the deputy leader. Sinn F\u00e9in has declared victory in Ireland\u2019s general election and called for talks with other main parties to form a coalition government. And here is Lisa O\u2019Carroll\u2019s take on what this means for the UK. Ministers are actively looking into Boris Johnson\u2019s idea of a road bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, Downing Street has said, rejecting scepticism from engineers and criticism of the prime minister\u2019s mixed record on delivering bridges. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has confirmed that the UK will introduce import controls on EU goods at the border from the start of 2021. He also said there were would be no measures to protect businesses in the event of a possible no-deal Brexit at the end of 2020, of the kind that were planned in 2019, because \u201cbusinesses have time to prepare.\u201d Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour leadership campaign team has reiterated its concern after the party launched an investigation into alleged misuse of data, with one of his key supporters calling the claims \u201cscurrilous\u201d and baseless. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has formally apologised in parliament to Yvette Cooper after a Conservative activist was jailed for sending messages threatening to pay \u201ccrackheads\u201d \u00a3100 to beat up the Labour MP. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The legal challenge against the government plan to deport 50 people to Jamaica tomorrow (see 12.32pm) has been refused, the BBC\u2019s Adina Campbell reports. This is from Steve Back, the photographer who covers Downing Street and who tweets as @PoliticalPics. And here is a gloss on what it means from Faisal Islam, the BBC\u2019s economics editor. The SNP has issued its own comment on Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, and it is more critical than Nicola Sturgeon was when she was asked about this earlier. (See 3.30pm.) An SNP spokesperson said: It is going to take more than a bridge to undo the harm to EU relations that the Tory government has caused with its extreme Brexit plans, and given Boris Johnson\u2019s failed history of unwanted and over budget bridge projects we are going to take a lot of convincing. The SNP will always welcome engagement with how we can strengthen relations with Northern Ireland and Ireland, but we will focus on practical and achievable ideas - not unsubstantiated vanity projects and baseless briefings which this Tory Prime Minister is all too familiar. The full text of Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech to the European Policy Centre earlier is now here, on the Scottish government\u2019s website. A bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland would be bad new for ferry operators, and so understandably the UK Chamber of Shipping is not keen. It has just issued this statement on the PM\u2019s proposal. We fully support any initiative which seeks to improve trade and tourism links. However, there are already a range of ferry operators taking tourists and trade between Northern Ireland and Scotland. Spending \u00a315bn-\u00a320bn of taxpayers\u2019 money on a bridge simply to replicate what those ferries already do is unnecessary. The money could be far better spent improving road and rail links to our ports across the UK. These are from my colleague Anushka Asthana, who presents the Guardian\u2019s flagship podcast, Today in Focus. They are regularly outstanding, and this episode is particularly fascinating. Labour\u2019s Stephen Doughty says Foster is asking MPs to trust a department that regularly makes mistake. He says the Home Office has admitted wrongly detaining 312 people in just one year. And it will not say how many people have been wrongly deported, he says. Foster says it would be wrong for the government to not deport these people, because that would leave the public at risk. And that\u2019s it. The UQ is over. Labour\u2019s Shabana Mahmood says Foster should not be hiding behind the 2007 legislation when he knows that the independent review of lessons learnt from Windrush will say that people who came to the UK in childhood should not be deported. Foster says the government is not hiding behind the 2007 law; it is implementing it. Labour\u2019s Claudia Webbe asks if any of those facing deportation have had access to legal advice and representation. Foster says they have all gone through the criminal justice system. Labour\u2019s Stephen Timms asks Foster to confirm that there will be 50 people on the flight tomorrow. How many came to the UK in childhood? Foster says he will not comment on individuals, or on the numbers. But he says they all meet the threshold for deportation. Labour\u2019s Taiwo Owatemi says one of the people being deported was jailed some time ago. Is if fair for someone to be punished twice of an offence? Foster says the deportations are required by law. Alex Chalk, a Conservative, asks Foster to confirm that the government would be subject to judicial review if it did not deport these individuals. Foster says this is an interesting point. He says if the deportations did not go ahead, the government would be answerable to any potential future victims. Yvette Cooper, the Labour chair of the home affairs committee, asks Foster to give details of the offences committed by those people being deported, and the age at which they came to the UK. Foster says all the offences meet the threshold set by the act. These are people who are serious or persistent offenders, he says. Foster says it is unbelievable that Labour wants to associate the Windrush generation with a group of serious offenders. Vicky Ford, a Conservative, asks Foster if he has looked at the casework for every individual being deported and assured himself that they are all \u201cpersistent and serious\u201d offenders. Foster says he has looked at the list. He says he cannot comment on individual cases, but all these cases have been properly reviewed, he says. Labour\u2019s Marsha de Cordova says Kevin Foster\u2019s attitudes is \u201cshameful\u201d. She says one of her constituents is being deported having served a seven-month sentence in 2015. She says the government should accept the recommendations of the review of lessons to be learnt from Windrush. She asks Foster why he is not interested in the consequences of what he is doing. Foster says the government is worried about the consequences of allowing criminals to stay in the UK to commit further crimes. Here is some comment from journalists on the tone being adopted by the Home Office minister Kevin Foster. From the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush From my colleague Peter Walker Stewart McDonald, the SNP\u2019s justice spokesman, says some of those being deported tomorrow have much stronger connections with Britain than with Jamaica. He says these deportations will leave 41 children without fathers, and nine Britons without a husband or a father. Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, says there is real concern in the community about this mass deportation flight. She says Kevin Foster\u2019s dismissive attitude implies he is dismissing all the concerns of the community. Foster says the law is clear; the government is obliged to make deportation orders. And the law is applied in accordance with the offences committed by offenders, not their nationality. Lammy is responding to Foster. He asks Foster how he can be sure that none of the people facing deportation to Jamaica are actually British citizens, in the light of the experience of the Windrush generation. And he asks Foster to confirm that some of them came to the UK were very young. He says the government is showing disrespect for the contribution of West Indian, Caribbean and black people to this country. Foster says none of those being deported tomorrow are Britons. He says that between them they have been sentenced to 300 years in jail. It is wrong to compare them to the Windrush generation, he says. That fact that Labour is implying otherwise implies Labour has \u201clost the plot\u201d, he says. The Labour MP David Lammy asks for a Commons statement on the government\u2019s suppression of the review of its treatment of the Windrush generation, and its plans for a deportation flight tomorrow. Kevin Foster, a Home Office minister, is replying. He says the government has acted swiftly to address the injustices suffered by the Windrush generation. He says some 8,000 people have received some form of documentation and there have been 5,000 grants of citizenship, he says. He says there have been news stories recently citing a draft report from last summer. He won\u2019t comment on leaked reports, he says. But he says the lessons learnt report has not been completed. When it is available, the Home Office will publish it. As for the flight tomorrow, he says the home secretary is required by law to issue a deportation order for people subject to deportation. He says these laws were drawn up when Labour was in office. He says the deportation rules relate to the offences committed by people, not where they come from. He says he does not accept that there is any similarity with the Windrush generation. Here are the main points from Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A at the European Policy Centre in Brussels this afternoon. Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a bridge linking Scotland to Northern Ireland as a \u201cdiversionary tactic\u201d and said there were better ways of spending the money. Asked about the plan, she said: Boris Johnson has promised lots of physical bridges in his political career so far. He hasn\u2019t delivered, to the best of my knowledge, a single one of them. I bow to nobody in my ambitions for Scotland, and my ambitions for Scotland to be connected to Ireland and to Europe. But I do think there are big practical questions over the feasibility and deliverability of this \u2013 not just the distance, but the depth of the water, there\u2019s an old munitions dump underneath it. We\u2019ll see where it goes. I certainly don\u2019t close my eyes, or close my mind, to suggestions like this. But I suspect from Boris Johnson it\u2019s more a diversionary tactic \u2013 to have people talking about that rather than some of the real issues we are grappling with in both Scotland and Ireland. I would say, if you\u2019ve got \u00a320bn or whatever it might take to build such a bridge going spare just now, I\u2019m sure the Scottish government and the Northern Ireland executive could find lots of ways to spend it on possibly more important priorities. She claimed that Johnson was refusing to keep the UK aligned to EU regulations after Brexit because he wanted to lower standards. She said that Johnson had not given any examples of how divergence could benefit the UK. She went on: The only possible reason for wanting the freedom to diverge is if you want to adopt lower standards than the EU does. She said Scotland would remain aligned with EU rules so as to make it easier for Scotland to rejoin the EU in due course. This is from the BBC\u2019s Glenn Campbell. She said she thought it was possible that Boris Johnson could abandon his determination not to allow an extension to the post-Brexit transition. (See 2.26pm.) She said the COP 26 climate change summit in Glasgow in November could be the most important event happening in the world this year. This is from the BBC\u2019s Natalie Higgins. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, has activated the government\u2019s emergency Bellwin scheme for areas in the north of England affected by Storm Ciara, the Press Association reports. The scheme - activated for qualifying areas in West Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire - enables local authorities dealing with the storm to apply to have all of the eligible costs they incur, above a threshold, to be reimbursed by the government. On the subject of the post-Brexit transition (see 2.26pm), Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister in charge of no-deal planning, said at an event this morning that there would be no extension. Gove was giving a speech at an event for \u201cUK border stakeholders\u201d (as No 10 describes them). But, intriguingly, there might be a phased implementation, apparently. These are from Peter MacSwiney, chairman of ASM UK, which provides customs clearance software. This is interesting. Last week my colleague Patrick Wintour reported that Foreign Office officials are under strict instructions not to refer to the transition period as an implementation period, even though under Theresa May implementation period was the government\u2019s approved terminology. Peter Foster, the Telegraph\u2019s Europe editor, had a very plausible theory as to why this might be. The Cabinet Office has not released a copy of Gove\u2019s speech yet, but I will post more on it if I ever get a copy. Q: Do you think there is any chance of Boris Johnson changing his mind in relation to ruling out an extension to the post-Brexit transition? Sturgeon says she has to assume that what the UK government says about ruling out an extension is what they mean. But it would not be beyond the bounds of possibility, and not inconsistent with the way he has behaved before, if he were to change his mind. So she won\u2019t rule it out, she says. Sturgeon says she thinks it is possible that Boris Johnson could abandon his determination not to allow an extension to the post-Brexit transition. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. I will post a summary shortly. Q: Have you had any contact from the police in relation to Derek Mackay\u2019s conduct? And do you think he should resign as an MSP? Sturgeon says she has not had any contact over this from the police. As for whether Mackay should stand down as an MSP, she says he should reflect on this. But it is not a decision for the SNP, she says. Q: Lawyers argue that Scotland does not need Westminster\u2019s permission to have a referendum, or declare independence. Kosovo was able to declare its independence unilaterally? Sturgeon says she is a democrat. For Scotland to legitimately become independence, you have to demonstrate that. She says opinion polls are not enough. She jokes that, however tempting just declaring independence might be, she thinks others would not agree. As for holding a referendum without Westminster\u2019s approval, she says whether or not Edinburgh can do this has not been tested in court. She is not ruling this out, she says. It may have to be tested. But she says going to court always involves uncertainty. That is why she wants the UK government to grant permission for a referendum. She repeats the point about thinking that Johnson will not be able to resist the pressure for one. Q: What do you think of the plan for a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland? Sturgeon says Boris Johnson has promised lots of bridges in the past. But they have never been built. She says she thinks there would be many practical difficulties, not least the depth of the water and the munitions dump. (See 1.56pm.) She goes on: I don\u2019t close my mind to suggestions like this. But I suspect from Boris Johnson it\u2019s a diversionary tactic. She says, if Johnson has got a spare \u00a320bn, the Scottish government and Northern Ireland executive could suggest better ways of spending the money. On Scottish independence, Sturgeon says she wants to have a referendum that is seen as legal. There is no point having one not seen as legitimate, she says. She says people think the deadlock between London and Edinburgh won\u2019t be broken. But she says she does not agree; she thinks Boris Johnson realises he has to win the argument. She says that is why the UK government is making the case for the union in Scotland. As for what currency an independent Scotland would use, she says it would start using sterling, before moving to its own currency. As for the claim that independence would lead to controls at the border, Sturgeon says that it is Brexit that creates problems at the border, not independence. Nicola Sturgeon says the SNP has been critical of the common fisheries policy for years. But she says she thinks the UK government will find it hard to meet the promises it has made to Scottish fishermen. Nicola Sturgeon has finished her speech to the European Policy Centre in Brussels. She is now taking questions. There is a live feed here. The Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn has more on the problem posed by unexploded ordnance (UXO) to the proposal to build a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Richard Burgon, a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, says there is a lesson for his party from Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s success in the Irish general election. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is giving a speech to the European Policy Centre in Brussels. Here are some excerpts, from the Sun\u2019s Nick Gutteridge. There is one urgent question in the Commons today, on the planned deportation flight to Jamaica, and one statement, on the flooding. On the subject of a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is worth flagging up this letter on the subject, sent to the Sunday Times in 2018 after the paper first reported that Boris Johnson was interested in the idea. It is from a a retired offshore engineer who said the idea was \u201cabout as feasible as building a bridge to the moon\u201d. And here is what the Labour MP Wes Streeting is saying about the bridge plan. Last summer my colleague Matthew Weaver calculated that projects championed by Boris Johnson when he was London mayor, that were all subject to legitimate criticism, cost a total of \u00a3940m. The worst example was probably the doomed garden bridge, which cost the public more than \u00a340m before it was abandoned with nothing to show for all the time and money lavished on it, but Matthew identifies seven other projects where Johnson\u2019s passion for new infrastructure led to questionable spending decisions. Since Matthew wrote his piece, fresh problems have emerged with Johnson\u2019s Routemaster buses. As my colleague Gywn Topham wrote last month, Transport for London is going to convert them to stop passengers boarding the buses at the back - supposedly one of the main advantages of the Routemaster design - because they have realised the feature encourages fare dodging. Here is Andrew Adonis, the Labour former transport secretary, on Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal for a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland. It was the Mail on Sunday that first seems to have broken the bridge story at the weekend, not the Sun. It is also worth noting that No 10 estimate for what this might cost seems to have risen from \u00a315bn to \u00a320bn within just five months. (See 12.17pm.) My colleague Kate Proctor points out various potential problems with building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland. Another potential problem is that, if Boris Johnson were to go ahead with the project, it is not impossible that, by the time it was actually finished, Scotland could have voted for independence and Northern Ireland could have voted for reunification with the Republic of Ireland. It could end up as a bridge between two countries no longer part of the UK. Lawyers are launching a judicial review in an attempt to halt a flight deporting 50 people to Jamaica amid widespread calls for the jet to be grounded, PA Media reports. Duncan Lewis Solicitors, which is representing 15 people due to be on the flight, is expected to file the papers at the high court imminently and have called for an urgent oral hearing on Monday afternoon to discuss the matter. PA says the move comes after the government insisted it would be pressing ahead with the flight, which is thought to be leaving the UK at 6.30am on Tuesday. The Rebecca Long-Bailey campaign has sought to draw a line under the row about alleged breaches of data rules in the campaign. (See 9.30am.) A spokesman for the campaign said: The investigation into Keir Starmer\u2019s campaign over an alleged data breach should not be allowed to distract from a moment of significant importance in determining the future direction of our party. As Rebecca\u2019s campaign has said previously, the accessibility of members\u2019 data stemmed from a failure to close [phone banking app] Dialogue at the end of the general election campaign. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has described the notion of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland as \u201ccrazy\u201d. The question at the No 10 lobby briefing about the proposed bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland was prompted by this story by Natasha Clark in the Sun, saying part of the link could take the form of a tunnel. She says the bridge could run from Portpatrick in Scotland to Larne in Northern Ireland. Here is an extract from her story. The bridge, made of steel and concrete, would consist of two levels - one for cars and one for a railway. Part of it could be a tunnel too, as a way of dealing with the offshore dumpsite Beaufort\u2019s Dyke. Unexploded World War Two bombs are believed to be one of the risks of the project, which lie near the dump. An artificial island around 2.5 miles long and 500 yards wide is likely to link the bridge to the tunnel. Under one version of Boris\u2019 plan, the bridge would run from the Scottish coast over the trench, before becoming a tunnel for the final stretch to Northern Ireland. Local geography might even dictate the need for two artificial islands to span the North Channel. Johnson has in the past signalled that he favours in principle building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland - for example, here, in September, and here, in the Queen\u2019s speech debate in December - but Downing Street has never been as explicit as it was this morning (see 11.26am) in saying that officials are working on the idea. UPDATE: Sorry, it seems to have been Glen Owen in the Mail on Sunday who had this story first. When Johnson was speaking about the proposal in September, he said it might cost \u00a315bn. Five months later, according to the Mail on Sunday, the estimated cost now seems to have risen to \u00a320bn. Asked about the Daily Mail story about a rift between Dominic Cummings and Carrie Symonds (see 10.43am), the spokesman says he does not recognise the thrust of what the story is saying. And that\u2019s it. The briefing is over. Q: Is levelling up about spreading opportunity, or making the country more equal? The spokesman says the PM\u2019s agenda is about both opportunity and outcome. Q: Is the government considering a mansion tax? The spokesman says he does not comment on budget matters. And he sidesteps a question on the reshuffle too. Asked about the Irish elections, the spokesman says close links between the UK and Ireland will continue. UPDATE: The spokesman said: We are of course following the results of the Irish election carefully. The UK and Ireland are close neighbours and friends and we look forward to continuing to work together. The close relationship between the UK and Ireland will continue regardless of the election result. Q: Is the government committed to building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland? The spokesman says he has nothing to add to what the PM said about this at PMQs a few weeks ago. The PM said the idea had some merit. So officials are looking into this, he says. He says: Work is underway looking into the idea of a bridge. Q: Is the PM concerned that his previous record with bridges does not inspire confidence? The spokesman does not accept this. He says: The PM is ambitious in terms of infrastructure projects. He is looking at a wide range of schemes across the United Kingdom that could boost productivity. Asked for more detail of the work being undertaken, the spokesman says he has not more to add. Q: Can you say roughly how many officials are working on this? No, says the spokesman. Q: Recently the Treasury told ministers not to waste money on projects. Would this count as a waste of money? The spokesman did not accept this. Q: But it is being seriously considered? Yes, says the spokesman. Q: Should the public be worried about coronavirus? The spokesman says the NHS is extremely well prepared. Q: But won\u2019t some people be concerned by the decision to declare it a serious and imminent threat? The spokesman says the language reflects the steps being taken. But the chief medical officer says the threat is moderate, he says. Q: When did the government learn that Anne Sacoolas was a US spy? The spokesman says the Foreign Office has said she was notified to the UK government as the spouse of a US official, with no official role. Q: Was the Foreign Office misled? The spokesman says he has nothing to add. The spokesman also says that a host government has to be notified of a diplomat\u2019s role for them to be covered by diplomatic immunity. Q: Will you get an announcement on immigration before the end of the week? The spokesman says the government is not planning to publish anything this week. Q: Rishi Sunak said this morning the Jamaicans due to be deported tomorrow had committed serious offences. Do you have details? The spokesman says some of those due to be deported have been convicted of manslaughter, rape, violence or drug dealing. He says it is long-standing policy that foreign offenders sentenced to more than 12 months are considered for deportation. He says the people on tomorrow\u2019s flight will come into this category. It\u2019s correct to say that some of those on board are convicted of manslaughter, rape, violence and drug dealing. It is long-standing government policy that any foreign national offender sentenced to 12 months or more in prison should be considered for deportation. The policy is designed to protect the public. Q: But Sunak implied most of the offenders had committed crimes like manslaughter? The spokesman repeats the point about 12-month sentences. The spokesman also says that people facing deportation can appeal. Q: Last week Robert Jenrick said he would like to see a British embassy in Jerusalem. Is this government policy? The spokesman says he did not see that. He will chase it up, and come back with an answer later. The Downing Street lobby briefing has started. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman says Michael Gove will be giving a speech today about border arrangements at the end of the year. The spokesman refuses to say when the HS2 announcement will come, even though it has been widely reported that it will come on Tuesday. He confirms that cabinet will have to sign it off. I\u2019m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I\u2019ll have my laptop, and so I will probably be posting updates as it goes along, but the embargo arrangements on these briefings are a bit fluid at the moment and so that will depend on whether the embargo gets lifted. One story that may come up is a report by Simon Walters in the Daily Mail claiming there has been \u201ca falling-out between Boris Johnson\u2019s partner Carrie Symonds and his chief adviser Dominic Cummings over the cabinet reshuffle\u201d. Walters writes: Well-placed Treasury sources say Miss Symonds is backing ministers who say Mr Cummings\u2019 aggressive approach towards ministers, officials and journalists is damaging the Prime Minister. The rift has been fuelled by reports that Mr Cummings urged Mr Johnson to fire two ministers with close links to Miss Symonds: Chancellor Sajid Javid and Defence Secretary Ben Wallace. It is understood Mr Johnson has refused to sack Mr Javid in the reshuffle expected this week, but the fate of Mr Wallace is less clear. In addition, Mr Cummings is believed to be planning to fire several Conservative ministerial special advisers, including some with connections to Miss Symonds. Insiders fear Mr Johnson is in danger of being caught in the middle of a damaging power struggle between the two most powerful members of his No 10 kitchen Cabinet of key advisers. David Henig, the former civil servant and trade expert who now runs the UK Trade Policy Project, has been tweeting about the government\u2019s freeports plan today. Henig also accused Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, of not accepting that freeports can and do operate within the EU. To be fair to Sunak, elsewhere in his Sky interview he claimed that the UK would be able to operate freeports in a more ambitious way than when it tried them when it was in the EU. He said the EU\u2019s definition of a freeport was \u201cvery narrow\u201d. For more on freeports, this Institute for Government briefing is helpful. Here\u2019s an extract. Economic studies have found the main advantage of freeports is that they encourage imports by lowering duty and paperwork costs. Manufacturing businesses that are inside the freeport can benefit from cheaper imported inputs/components in comparison to those outside the area. On the other hand, the UK Trade Policy Observatory (UKTPO) cautions that the evidence of wider economic benefits of freeports and other zones are mixed, as they depend heavily on the design, access to transport infrastructure, skilled labour and capital within the zone in question. There is also a risk that freeports and zones don\u2019t create new economic activity but rather divert existing business into the area with the allure of tax breaks \u2013 at a cost to the taxpayer in the form of lost revenue. Recently Lisa Nandy, a Labour leadership candidate, said that Twitter was causing \u201creal problems\u201d for the left because it gave people a misleading view of public opinion. Now Clive Lewis, who was interested himself in running for the Labour leadership but could not get enough backing from MPs, says he is giving it up himself. This blog focuses on UK politics, but no country is closer to the UK than Ireland, or more entwined with its politics (at least in one region) than Ireland, and so there will be intense interest in what is happening in Dublin following Saturday\u2019s election. Ireland uses the single transferable vote with multi-member constituencies, which means counting the results can take a while. My colleague Se\u00e1n Clarke is keeping a tally of the results here. Here is my colleague Rory Carroll\u2019s overnight story. This morning Mary Lou McDonald, the Sinn F\u00e9in president, told RTE that she thought the best outcome for Ireland would be government without Fianna Fail or Fine Gael. The Sinn F\u00e9in leader has made contact with a number of smaller groupings, according to the Press Association. McDonald said: This vote for Sinn F\u00e9in is for Sinn F\u00e9in to be in government, for Sinn F\u00e9in to make a difference, for Sinn F\u00e9in to be tested, for Sinn F\u00e9in to deliver ... There are very serious issues facing our society and we have a duty and feel that responsibility very keenly to deliver solutions. We want to talk to anyone who is interested in delivering a programme for government, that is about getting to grips with the housing crisis and solving it, getting to grips with the crisis in health and giving families and workers a break and giving a new lease of life to government. Yesterday the BBC ran a report saying that the Labour party had formally reported members of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s leadership campaign team to the information commissioner\u2019s office, accusing them of misusing the membership database. The Starmer camp described that claims that it had done anything wrong as \u201cutter nonsense\u201d, saying that the Labour letter to the ICO was in fact sent in response to the Starmer campaign warning about a potential abuse of the database rules by Rebecca Long-Bailey\u2019s campaign. This morning David Lammy, the Labour MP and vice chairman of Starmer\u2019s campaign, said the allegations against his side were \u201cscurrilous\u201d. He told the Today programme: It didn\u2019t happen. There was no data-scraping. I can say categorically that this did not happen and it\u2019s denied fundamentally. There was no attempt by the campaign to do this - it\u2019s scurrilous to suggest so and I\u2019m quite sure that the information commissioner will find the allegations completely untrue. Good morning. Within the last hour or so the government has declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health, in a move that means people with the illness can be forcibly quarantined. My colleague Frances Perraudin has the full story here, and my colleague Aamna Mohdin is covering this on a coronavirus outbreak live blog. In non-coronavirus news, the government has this morning launched a consultation on creating up to 10 freeports and Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been on Sky News promoting the plan. There were two main news lines. Sunak dismissed claims that free ports would facilitate tax avoidance as a red herring. When Sky\u2019s Kay Burley put this to him, he replied: I absolutely don\u2019t think they do [facilitate tax avoidance] and obviously you have stringent rules. It\u2019s worth pointing out that the EU is pretty much the only place in the world that doesn\u2019t use freeports, for example there are over 200 in the US, employing several hundred thousand people, hundreds, billions of dollars of trade happens in those areas and that\u2019s replicated around the world. The US head of customs and border protection told me a while ago he thinks their free trade zones are actually more secure than their regular ports, because they go through vetting with the customs bodies before they get given freeport status, and they have dedicated agents in the freeports, so I think that\u2019s a bit of a red herring. Sunak defended government plans to deport dozens of Jamaicans this week, despite the fact that many of them have been in the UK since childhood. Asked about the move, he said: What that plane is about is deporting foreign national criminals. Many of these people have committed crimes such as manslaughter, rape, other very serious offences. I think it\u2019s right and the British public would expect us to be able to deport foreign national criminals - that\u2019s what\u2019s going on here. Regardless of the country they come from, it\u2019s a policy that\u2019s been in place. It\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s proportionate, and something the British people would expect us to do for foreign criminals who have committed very serious crimes should be sent back to their countries where they have a right to reside elsewhere. Here is the agenda for the day. 11am: Downing Street lobby briefing. 11am: The committee on standards in public life publishes a report on artificial intelligence. 2.30pm: Priti Patel, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Melanie Roberts, 48, saw the centre was closed from her house just across the road.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s worrying that it\u2019s so close.

Over the weekend the number of UK cases doubled as four more people were diagnosed in Brighton \u2013 three men and one woman, all of whom had been in contact with the previously confirmed Brighton case. However in many parts of Brighton, residents remained unconcerned by the latest developments. In Hove, the Grenadier pub remains open after a man who was diagnosed with coronavirus was served there a few days ago. There were about a dozen customers watching football and enjoying a pint on Monday afternoon. Although all staff who were on duty at the time the man was hosted had been told to isolate themselves, there were still plenty of workers behind the bar.

Top stories A Liberal National party donor received a $5.5m jobs and investment grant despite potentially being ineligible because it is a registered training organisation. In April 2018 Nolan Meats was approved to receive the grant under the $200m regional jobs and investment package\u2019s business stream, despite being listed as a registered training organisation, a disqualification under the program guidelines. According to a scathing auditor general report, released in November, the program received 12 applications that were ineligible for funding, including one that was successful. A day ahead of the New Hampshire primary, Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders remain on a collision course. The two candidates represent disparate wings of the Democratic party and are increasingly contesting frontrunner status in the contest for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November\u2019s presidential election. On Sunday, a Boston Globe/WBZ/Suffolk University poll found Sanders leading in New Hampshire with 26% support, followed by Buttigieg with 19% and the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar in third with 13%. It was the latest in a string of surveys showing Sanders or Buttigieg leading the rest of the field. Bright spots have meanwhile been few and far between for Joe Biden of late. After the catastrophic performance in Iowa, where he finished a distant fourth, Biden is polling fifth in New Hampshire, too, unthinkable for someone who spent most of 2019 in the lead. Former resources minister Matt Canavan delayed releasing documents about his interactions with coal lobbyists until he resigned his post, rendering a freedom of information request void. In November, the Australian Conservation Foundation sought access to all records of Canavan\u2019s interactions with New Hope Coal and its lobbyists in the weeks leading up to the announcement of a crackdown on the use of secondary boycotts by environmental activists.

Australia Drones are being used to save koalas injured in the bushfires. Victorian forest and wildlife officers, with the help of the Australian defence force, are using drone and infrared technology in a search and rescue operation for koalas affected by recent bushfires in Victoria. Heavy rain in parts of regional NSW may have relieved immediate water security issues in as many as 20 towns, said the state\u2019s public servant charged with keeping the taps running in drought-hit regions. Scott Morrison remains in the political doldrums, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The Prime minister\u2019s approval sits on 39%, and more than half the sample, 52%, disapprove of his performance. Celebrity chef George Calombaris has put much of his restaurant empire into voluntary administration. About 400 employees are set to lose their jobs. The only part of the business excluded from the appointment is a chain of four Yo-Chi outlets.

Its leader, Mary Lou McDonald, urged Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il to start negotiations with the republican party as the scale of its breakthrough confirmed a realignment of Irish politics. Another 66 passengers onboard a luxury cruise liner quarantined in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the number of infected people on the ship to 136. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks, as some people began to return to work following the extended lunar new year holiday. The Trump administration has submitted its 2021 budget proposal to Congress, a $4.8tn plan which has no chance of passing into law. Massive swarms of locusts sweeping across much of east Africa have reached Uganda and Tanzania, the United Nations has said, threatening millions more people with hunger in an already fragile region. The US military is preparing to report a more than 50% jump in the number of cases of traumatic brain injury stemming from Iran\u2019s missile attack on a base in Iraq last month. Girls are beginning puberty almost a year earlier than women 40 years ago, according to research. Recommended reads Hadley Freeman\u2019s night at the Oscars was tacky and endearing. \u201cThere must be a word \u2013 maybe in German, or possibly in Korean \u2013 for that piquant feeling of being at one of the most exclusive events in the world, surrounded by people who have only ever turned left on a plane, but are now cheering on a movie about the corrosive effects of class barriers. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it was genuinely delightful to be there on Sunday night, watching Parasite bulldoze its way through the awards. And goodness, how the audience was on Parasite\u2019s side, with the cheers becoming so much more pronounced for it than any of its other fellow nominees that it felt almost awkward by the end.\u201d It\u2019s time for government spending, writes Greg Jericho, with household wallets closed tight even before the hit from bushfires and the coronavirus. \u201cPeople will likely remain hesitant about what the future holds. With the Reserve Bank continuing to predict that wages growth will remain low and that the economy is currently having a bit of a stumble, unless the government sees fit to come to the rescue and determine a strong boost in spending is required to get some life into the economy, that hesitancy is likely to continue for another year.\u201d Listen On Today in Focus: does the British Labour party have room for Blairism and Corbynism? Peter Mandelson and Steve Howell represent the two opposite poles of the Labour party: one was a key architect of Blairism, the other of Corbynism. But they started out as inseparable friends at the same school in north London. Now their focus is on what comes next for the party. Plus: Matthew Taylor on the growing prevalence of climate anxiety. Cook A simple batter can be tweaked for savoury or sweet applications, used pan-fried, deep fried or baked, writes Jackie Middleton. \u201cI like recipes that are predictable, solid and dependable, and this basic savoury batter is all three. I use the batter, spiced slightly, for these pan-fried sweetcorn and zucchini fritters. I\u2019ve also deep-fried this mixture and baked it in little muffin moulds to create canap\u00e9s too.\u201d Sport South African teams are eclipsing Australia\u2019s Super Rugby efforts, writes Bret Harris. Form so far this season indicates a competitive Springboks team could be assembled by just selecting players from domestic franchises. A former NFL player has won the Oscar for best animated short film eight years after predicting he would one day be nominated. Matthew A Cherry wrote and directed Hair Love and won the award along with producer Karen Rupert Toliver. Media roundup The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age lead with the budget surplus, using the words \u201cwipeout\u201d and \u201cup in smoke\u201d respectively, to describe its fate. The Australian reports that a second person \u201chas been isolated in quarantine on Christmas Island pending the result of a coronavirus test.\u201d The Australian Financial Review takes a look at some of the Australian companies impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. Coming up The high court will decide on whether the Australian government can deport two Aboriginal \u201caliens\u201d Daniel Love and Brendan Thoms.

While state media have frequently reported statements made by Xi, he had not been seen in public since a meeting with the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 29 January and a meeting with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, in Beijing on 5 February. He has not been shown visiting doctors or hospitals or patients or visiting Wuhan. Instead, he sent his second-in-command, the premier, Li Keqiang.</p> <p>Observers say Xi may have been insulating himself from the public fallout from the crisis, making it easier to blame local officials. Others have pointed out that he is doing what several other Chinese leaders before have done during times of crisis of stepping back from the limelight while still maintaining firm control. Internet users have joked that he may have found a safe place to quarantine himself.</p> <p>Now that the central government has taken control of the handling of the outbreak, it may be harder to deflect blame. Moreover, the top leadership is also facing an outpouring of public anger over the recent death of a doctor who was punished for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the virus. Xi may not have the luxury of staying in the background. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T12:07:25.147Z\">at 12.07pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e4139c58f0811db2faf4cc5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T11:11:10.170Z\">11.11am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Public Health England is speaking to people who have had close and sustained contact with the new confirmed cases. </p> <p>Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of national infection service at Public Health England, said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These new cases are all closely linked and were rapidly identified through Public Health England\u2019s comprehensive contact tracing approach and tested quickly. </p> <p>Our priority is speaking to those people who have had close and sustained contact with confirmed cases so that we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T11:12:28.387Z\">at 11.12am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e41321e8f086a28115a8e38\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-10T10:55:00.475Z\">10.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A growing number of countries across the world are evacuating or planning to evacuate their citizens from parts of China hit by coronavirus.</p> <p>Reuters has collated a list of the countries who have evacuated some of their citizens so far: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Kazakhstan</strong> will send two planes to China on 10 and 11 February to evacuate its citizens.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us on this blog, though our coverage will continue overnight in a new live blog. Here\u2019s a summary of the events since we last wrapped things up about 16 hours ago. The new coronavirus represents a serious and imminent threat to public health, the UK\u2019s health secretary declared. The step gave the government additional powers to fight the spread of the virus. Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested. The figures were released by the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and meant the number of confirmed cases had doubled. If you\u2019d like to read more, my colleagues Denis Campbell and Frances Perraudin have the full story: China\u2019s Hubei province confirms a total of 31,728 cases of Coronavirus and 974 deaths by the end of today, the Reuters news agency reports. That number includes 103 new deaths and 2,097 new cases, according to the report. A student at the University of Sussex is being tested after falling ill, the institution has said. A spokeswoman has told the Guardian: We can confirm that a student on our campus has been admitted to hospital today for tests. A case of coronavirus has not been confirmed at this point. The student had recently returned from overseas. We are following all Public Health England guidance in terms of practical next steps and we will be keeping our students and staff at the university informed if there are any developments. This is a difficult time for the young person involved, and their fellow students, and we are concerned at making sure they are supported. The Girls\u2019 Schools Association has echoed legal experts\u2019 advice to independent institutions to discourage their students from flying to China. The body even warned that people flying back in from south-east Asia could face quarantine upon their return to the UK. A spokeswoman has said: We have recommended that our schools advise parents, carers and guardians of any pupils proposing to travel to south-east Asia over February half-term to consider not travelling. We have also advised schools that, where possible, they should help to make suitable alternative arrangements with guardians. In the case of students who decide to travel, we have recommended that schools advise them and their families that protective measures could well be in place before they return and that they prepare for the possibility of quarantine procedures. In its guidance, the Boarding Schools\u2019 Association says institutions must also consider the risk of any visits by parents or carers, avoiding \u201cunnecessary restrictions\u201d on anyone beyond the 14-day incubation period. It says schools must ensure boarders are protected both on and off the premises, following reports of children being targeted on the basis of their ethnicity. China sends more pupils to UK fee-paying schools than any other country. British Airways has extended the suspension of flights serving Chinese cities amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus. On Monday, the airline said flights to and from Beijing and Shanghai had been cancelled until 31 March. We are contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options, including rebooking onto other carriers where possible, full refunds or booking with BA for a later date of travel. Safety is at the heart of everything we do and we will keep the situation under review. Virgin Atlantic extended the suspension of its flights to mainland China last week. The airline said flights on its Heathrow-Shanghai route would not be in operation until 28 March. In the same statement, PHE revealed that two of the four new cases of coronavirus are healthcare workers. Doyle added: \u201cTwo of these new cases are healthcare workers and as soon as they were identified, we advised them to self-isolate in order to keep patient contact to a minimum. \u201cWe are now working urgently to identify all patients and other healthcare workers who may have come into close contact, and at this stage we believe this to be a relatively small number.\u201d On Monday afternoon, the BBC reported that a GP practice in Brighton had been temporarily closed after a staff member tested positive for the virus. The government has declared coronavirus a serious and imminent threat to public health, while eight people have tested positive for it in the UK overall. Four of the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK are all closely linked to one another, Public Health England has confirmed. It was revealed earlier on Monday that three men and one woman had been transferred from where they were diagnosed in Brighton to London over the weekend in order to receive specialist care. Yvonne Doyle, medical director for PHE, said: \u201cAs a result of our contact tracing we now know the new cases announced today are all closely linked to one another. \u201cOur priority has been to speak to those who have close and sustained contact with confirmed cases, so we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus. The director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said recent cases of coronavirus reported in France and the UK could \u201cbe the spark that becomes a bigger fire\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\u2019 comments came after a British man, who caught the virus at a conference in Singapore, was linked with other cases in the European countries. Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, while five British nationals tested positive in France following the Sussex businessman\u2019s trip to a French ski resort. Ghebreyesus told a press conference: \u201cIn recent days we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the UK today. \u201cThe detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire. But for now, it\u2019s only a spark. Our objective remains containment. \u201cWe call on all countries to use the window of opportunity we have to prevent a bigger fire.\u201d More than 50 people in Scotland have been tested for coronavirus, latest figures have revealed. Although statistics published on Monday showed all 57 people had returned negative results, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood warned there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d a patient would test positive for the virus in the future. In a statement on its website, the Scottish government said: \u201cThe Scottish Government\u2019s approach is guided by the Chief Medical Officer and we continue to monitor the situation closely and to work with the World Health Organisation and international community.\u201d Laboratories at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh have been set up to test patients in Scotland for the virus. The number of people they have tested has risen by 16 since Sunday. Across the UK, a total of 1,114 people have been tested for coronavirus. A school in Southampton has been closed after students were put in isolation over coronavirus fears. St Mary\u2019s Independent School in Bitterne Park is on lockdown, and pupils have been evacuated, according to the Bournemouth Echo. Some of the children at the school were reportedly struck down with symptoms similar to those of the virus, and put in isolation after being assessed by medical professionals at Southampton General Hospital. St Mary\u2019s, which is in contact with Public Health England, will remain closed for deep cleaning. The Echo reported a statement sent to parents from headteacher Claire Charlemagne said: \u201cI am sorry to inform you that a family with children at the prep and senior departments who have recently travelled to the region affected by coronavirus have developed symptoms similar to those presenting with the coronavirus, and having been checked by medical professionals at Southampton General Hospital have been placed in isolation.\u201d Hi, I\u2019m Amy Walker, taking over the live blog from my colleague Aamna Mohdin. The Chinese gadget manufacturer, TCL communication, has become the latest company to make cutbacks to its planned presence at the upcoming Mobile World Congress (MWC) amid the coronavirus crisis. The company has said it would still have a booth on the tech show\u2019s floor, but would no longer hold a press conference. Sony and Amazon are among the other phone makers to have withdrawn from the event \u2013 which will be held in Barcelona later this month \u2013 in recent days, citing concerns about the spread of the virus. Ericsson, LG and Nvidia have also pulled out of the show. In a statement, TCL said: \u201cGiven the recent global health concerns due to the spread of the 2019-nCoV virus, and out of an abundance of caution and care for our staff, customers, press and other guests, TCL Communication is cancelling its global press event for MWC 2020, which was planned for 22 February 2020. \u201cThis decision does not impact any other MWC 2020 activities planned by the company and TCL will still announce its latest mobile devices and showcase them at its booth in the Fira Gran Via - Hall 3, Stand 3D11 - from 24-27 February as scheduled.\u201d A UK law firm that specialises in private education has said independent schools should discourage students from flying to China and consider keeping their boarding house open and staffed during the half-term break. Vicky Wilson, Senior Associate in the Education practice at Wilsons, said: Pupils from China and Hong Kong make up the biggest single group of overseas student in the UK\u2019s independent schools. Coronavirus is something every school must address this week. The Foreign Office has advised people in the UK to avoid all but essential travel to China and independent schools must reinforce that to pupils and their families. Missing a family reunion is hard on everyone but it is preferable to pupils risking their education being seriously disrupted by Coronavirus and its fallout. Wilsons Solicitors have listed six things all independent schools should be doing ahead of the holiday. Talk to students and families about whether it\u2019s necessary to go back to China If Chinese pupils stay in the UK, ensure they have guardianship arrangements in place Consider keeping your boarding house open and staffed during the holiday Have a staff member at the school responsible for communicating with pupils and families If students do travel to China, ensure medical staff at the school are trained to spot Coronavirus symptoms Ensure children can still study if they have to enter quarantine The Royal Free Hospital, in north London, said two of the patients had been taken for treatment at its high consequence infectious disease treatment centre. A statement said: We are treating an additional two patients with Wuhan novel coronavirus at the Royal Free Hospital (RFH), which means there are a total of three patients with the condition at the RFH. The RFH is one of a small number of specialist centres in England for treating infectious diseases such as coronavirus. As the patients are being treated in isolation, there is no risk to any other patients or visitors. All of our services remain open as usual, so if you have a hospital appointment please attend as planned. Staff at a local community centre in Brighton have been advised to self-isolate after the man at the centre of the Brighton and Hove outbreak visited a class there last week, The Argus reports. A manager and some volunteers at the Cornerstone Community Centre in Hove have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate after the man attended a yoga class. One concerned centre user told The Argus: The man visited the centre last week to go to a runners yoga class. People are very concerned about the lack of clear information from the NHS about this man\u2019s movements. The centre manager has been told to self-isolate. \u201cPeople are turning up at the centre and don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Eight people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK out of 1,114 tested as of 2pm Monday, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said. At the Grenadier pub in Hove punters seemed unconcerned that a man who has been diagnosed with coronavirus was served here a few days ago. There were about a dozen customers watching football and enjoying a pint on Monday afternoon, and although all staff who were on duty at the time the man was hosted have been told to self-isolate, there were plenty of people behind the bar too. A Grenadier pub spokesperson said: \u201cWe are following the advice and working closely with Public Health England who have advised us that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such the pub remains open for business as usual.\u201d The man, who was the third confirmed case of coronavirus in the UK, is believed to have visited the pub on the evening of 1 February. Breaking: a GP in Sussex has been temporarily shut down after a member of staff tested positive for the coronavirus, BBC reports An message left at the medical centre\u2019s phone says: \u201cUnfortunately, the building has had to close due to an urgent operational health and safety reason,\u201d Reuters reports. Here\u2019s a report by my colleague Haroon Siddique on the British national believed to have passed the bug to at least 11 Britons in three countries, prompting concerns about the danger posed by so-called super spreaders. The unnamed man, the first Briton to have tested positive for coronavirus, travelled to Singapore for a sales conference that exposed the Sussex businessman to the Wuhan coronavirus. After the conference, the Briton travelled to the French ski resort of Les Contamines-Montjoie near Mont Blanc, where he stayed with his family between 24 and 28 January. He then flew back to the UK on a busy easyJet flight from Geneva to Gatwick. Still oblivious to the fact he had the virus, which has a two-week incubation period, he returned home and on the evening of 1 February he visited a local pub, The Grenadier, in Hove. Just under a fifth of known cases of the new coronavirus in the worst-affected region in China may result in death, a report from Imperial College London estimates. Researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis have found that the case fatality ratio (CFR) for people in Hubei province is 18% \u2013 this however may reflect the most severe cases that the overwhelmed health system is treating, with other less severe cases not being recorded. The researchers estimate the CFR is much lower in travellers outside China, between 1.2 and 5.6%, and the overall CFR in all infections, both asymptomatic and symptomatic, is approximately 1%. The researchers said: It is important to note that the differences in these estimates does not reflect underlying differences in disease severity between countries. CFRs seen in individual countries will vary depending on the sensitivity of different surveillance systems to detect cases of differing levels of severity and the clinical care offered to severely ill cases. All CFR estimates should be viewed cautiously at the current time as the sensitivity of surveillance of both deaths and cases in mainland China is unclear. The UK\u2019s decision to declare the coronavirus outbreak as a \u201cserious and imminent threat\u201d to public health gives the government fresh legal powers to forcibly quarantine people and send them into isolation if they pose a threat. The PA Media news agency reports that the decision was in response to one of the Britons who returned from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak, attempting to leave isolation at Arrowe Park hospital on Merseyside. The news agency cited a government source that \u201cthere was someone who was threatening to abscond from Arrowe Park\u201d. All the Britons who returned on the evacuation flight signed a contract agreeing to a 14-day quarantine period, which ends this Thursday. There were concerns, however, that those contracts were not legally enforceable, leading to the new regulations. The Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, has made his first public appearance in weeks. State broadcaster CCTV has posted a short segment of Xi visiting a neighbourhood in Beijing. Xi is shown wearing a surgical mask, having his temperature taken, and greeting residents. According to CCTV, Xi \u201cinvestigated and directed\u201d the ongoing virus prevention work and asked after residents and workers. Xi\u2019s disappearance over the last few weeks is unusual for a leader whose face is featured constantly on state newspapers and broadcast on the nightly news. While state media have frequently reported statements made by Xi, he had not been seen in public since a meeting with the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on 29 January and a meeting with the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, in Beijing on 5 February. He has not been shown visiting doctors or hospitals or patients or visiting Wuhan. Instead, he sent his second-in-command, the premier, Li Keqiang. Observers say Xi may have been insulating himself from the public fallout from the crisis, making it easier to blame local officials. Others have pointed out that he is doing what several other Chinese leaders before have done during times of crisis of stepping back from the limelight while still maintaining firm control. Internet users have joked that he may have found a safe place to quarantine himself. Now that the central government has taken control of the handling of the outbreak, it may be harder to deflect blame. Moreover, the top leadership is also facing an outpouring of public anger over the recent death of a doctor who was punished for trying to warn colleagues and friends about the virus. Xi may not have the luxury of staying in the background. Public Health England is speaking to people who have had close and sustained contact with the new confirmed cases. Dr Nick Phin, the deputy director of national infection service at Public Health England, said: These new cases are all closely linked and were rapidly identified through Public Health England\u2019s comprehensive contact tracing approach and tested quickly. Our priority is speaking to those people who have had close and sustained contact with confirmed cases so that we can advise them on what they can do to limit the spread of the virus. A growing number of countries across the world are evacuating or planning to evacuate their citizens from parts of China hit by coronavirus. Reuters has collated a list of the countries who have evacuated some of their citizens so far: Kazakhstan will send two planes to China on 10 and 11 February to evacuate its citizens. Kazakhstan has already evacuated 83 people from Wuhan. Of the 719 Kazakhs remaining in China, 391 have asked to be repatriated. Singapore: A second evacuation flight is bringing back another 174 Singaporeans and their family members from Wuhan to the city-state on 9 February, Singapore\u2019s foreign ministry said. Philippines: Thirty Filipinos returned to the Philippines on 9 February from Wuhan, the department of foreign affairs said. The returning passengers and a 10-member government team will be quarantined for 14 days. UK: Britain\u2019s final evacuation flight from Wuhan, carrying more than 200 people, landed at a Royal Air Force base in central England on 9 February. A plane carrying 83 British and 27 European Union nationals from Wuhan landed in Britain last week. Brazil: The 34 Brazilians evacuated from Wuhan landed in Brazil on 9 February, where they will begin 18 days of quarantine. US: Two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly US citizens, took off from Wuhan on 6 February bound for the US. It was the third group of evacuees from the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, the US state department said. Taiwan: About 500 Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan are the first batch to be evacuated Uzbekistan: 251 people from China and quarantined them on arrival in Tashkent, the Central Asian nation\u2019s state airline said on 6 February. Italy: The country flew back 56 nationals from Wuhan to Rome on 3 February. The group will spend two weeks in quarantine in a military hospital, the government said. Saudi Arabia: 10 students from Wuhan have been evacuated, Saudi state television reported on 2 February. A plane-load of New Zealanders, Australians and Pacific Islanders evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Auckland, New Zealand on 5 February, officials said. Thailand: A plane brought 138 Thai nationals home from Wuhan last week. They will spend two weeks in quarantine. France: Some nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan and would be placed in quarantine. It said it would first evacuate nationals without symptoms and then those showing symptoms at a later, unspecified date. Canada: The first group of 176 citizens were evacuated from Wuhan to an Ontario air force base early on 5 February, according to the Globe and Mail newspaper. All evacuees will be quarantined on the base for two weeks. Japan: The country has repatriated 565 nationals since the end of January. South Korea: About 368 people were flown home on a charter flight that arrived on 31 January. A second chartered flight departed Seoul for Wuhan on the same day, with plans to evacuate around 350 more South Korean citizens. Indonesia: The government flew 243 Indonesians from Hubei on 2 February and placed them under quarantine at a military base on an island north-west of Borneo. Reuters also has a list of countries preparing to evacuate their citizens. Netherlands: The country is preparing the voluntary evacuation of 20 Dutch nationals and their families from Hubei, Stef Blok, the Dutch foreign minister, said. The Netherlands is finalising arrangements with EU partners and Chinese authorities. Spain: The government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate its nationals. Dr Al Edwards, an associate professor at the University of Reading\u2019s school of pharmacy, said the government was right to declare the coronavirus as a serious and imminent threat to people in the UK. Edwards said: The main challenges facing Britain and the wider world are containment, finding everyone infected and stopping the spread, and the treatment of very ill patients, which could easily overwhelm hospitals in any country, however well-developed the health system. Finding people who have been infected is extremely challenging, but it is essential for containment. We are lucky we do have fairly rapid tests available, based on detecting the virus in patient blood samples, for example. However, these will only work when patient is quite sick. After people get better, or if they have mild infection, the virus can\u2019t be detected. The current rapid tests are based on detecting the nucleic acid of the virus by measuring RNA. This is the genetic \u2018code\u2019 of the virus. When the level of the virus drops in, a patient doesn\u2019t have very much viral RNA. This is good for the patient but makes the virus almost undetectable. One of the four new confirmed cases from Brighton \u2013 one of the three men \u2013 is a doctor who was part of the group that were skiing in the resort near Chamonix with the man who is at the centre of this outbreak, the Guardian understands. Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has confirmed the four new cases of coronavirus in England. The new cases have brought the total number of cases in the UK to eight. He said in a statement: Four further patients in England have tested positive for novel coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the UK to eight. The new cases are all known contacts of a previously confirmed UK case, and the virus was passed on in France. Experts at Public Health England continue to work hard tracing patient contacts from the UK cases. They successfully identified these individuals and ensured the appropriate support was provided. The patients have been transferred to specialist NHS centres at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019s and the Royal Free hospitals, and we are now using robust infection control measures to prevent further spread of the virus. The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts these patients have had. Japanese health officials had confirmed four Australian nationals among the new cases on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. These new cases included 45 Japanese nationals, 11 Americans, three from the Philippines and one each from Canada and Ukraine, Reuters reports. The figure on Monday took the number of infections on the ship, docked in Yokohama, to 130. EasyJet has confirmed that a passenger who recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus. The airline said Public Health England is reaching out to all customers on the flight. A spokeswoman said: EasyJet has been notified by the public health authority that a customer who had recently travelled on one of its flights has since been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Public Health England is contacting all passengers who were seated in the vicinity of the customer on flight EZS8481 from Geneva to London Gatwick on 28 January to provide guidance in line with procedures. As the customer was not experiencing any symptoms, the risk to others onboard the flight is very low. We remain in contact with the public health authorities and are following their guidance. The health and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is the airline\u2019s highest priority. All of the crew who operated have been advised to monitor themselves for a 14-day period since the flight in line with Public Health England advice. Note this happened 12 days ago and none are displaying any symptoms.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the UK has doubled from four to eight after four more people in Brighton were diagnosed with the infection over the weekend. The new cases include three men and one woman. The four have been transferred from Brighton to London to receive specialist care. Crucially, one of the four had been at the same ski resort near Chamonix in France visited by the patient from Brighton who was moved from the city to the isolation unit at St Thomas\u2019s hospital in central London last Thursday after they were diagnosed with Coronavirus. The gender of the four new cases, and whether they are adults or children, is not known. St Thomas\u2019s is one of the NHS\u2019s network of specialist high consequence infectious diseases (HCID) treatment centres in England. One of the other four confirmed cases is being treated at the HCID unit at the Royal Free hospital in north London and the two Chinese nationals who tested positive for Coronavirus in York are being treated at the HCID centre in Newcastle. Businesses are gradually reopening in China following the lunar new year holiday, which was extended to discourage travel in an attempt to contain the virus, but they face heavy losses. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the Coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @aamnamohdin Here\u2019s a report by my colleague Frances Perraudin on what it means now the UK has declared the coronavirus outbreak a serious and imminent threat to public health. Under the measures announced on Monday, the Department of Health said people with coronavirus can now be forcibly quarantined and will not be free to leave, and can be forcibly sent into isolation if they pose a threat to public health. A spokesman said: \u201cOur infection control procedures are world leading and the NHS is well prepared to deal with novel coronavirus. \u201cWe are strengthening our regulations so we can keep individuals in supported isolation for their own safety and if public health professionals consider they may be at risk of spreading the virus to other members of the public. \u201cThis measure will rightly make it easier for health professionals to help keep people safe across the country.\u201d A team of experts headed by the World Health Organization (WHO) flew into Beijing on Monday to help assess the latest outbreak. While China has borne the brunt of the disease with the vast majority of confirmed cases and all but two of the deaths, the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said there had been \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of transmission from people who had not been to China. \u201cThe detection of a small number of cases may indicate more widespread transmission in other countries; in short, we may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg,\u201d he said on Twitter. He called on the global community to work together and share what they know in real-time with WHO. Military personnel set up a covered walkway this morning next to the Diamond Princess cruise ship. About 3,600 people are quarantined onboard due to fears of the new coronavirus at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama port. Another 60 passengers on board the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infections on the ship to 130. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the blog from my colleague Alison Rourke. The UK health secretary declared on Monday that the new coronavirus was a serious and imminent threat to public health, a step that gives the government additional powers to fight the spread of the virus. The Department for Health and Social Care said: The secretary of state declares that the incidence or transmission of novel Coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health, and the measures outlined in these regulations are considered as an effective means of delaying or preventing further transmission of the virus. China\u2019s death toll has jumped to 908, with 40,000 confirmed infections. Another 60 passengers on the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of infections on the ship to 130. Tens of millions of Chinese have gone back to work today after the extended lunar new year break. The World Health Organization has sent a team of international experts to Beijing to help combat the epidemic. The WHO boss has warned that confirmed cases of coronavirus being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. A memorial has been held in New York for the whistleblower doctor, Li Wenliang, who died last week from coronavirus. China\u2019s food prices spiked by 20.6% in January. A citizen journalist in Wuhan, Chen Qiushi, who has been reporting on the coronavirus epidemic, has been missing since Thursday. There are plenty of figures published about coronavirus cases in China, but here\u2019s are some that I found very interesting \u2013 the daily confirmed cases of the virus outside Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. The graph below, published by the state media outlet the Global Times, shows a distinct fall in numbers of people being diagnosed with the virus outside Hubei. The figures they have used are taken from the Chinese national health commission. Chinese state media is reporting that the government pumped $129bn into the financial system today. It says the money has gone in via \u201creverse repos\u201d, which is a reverse repurchase agreement. This is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. A citizen journalist who had been reporting from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak has gone missing, prompting claims that the Chinese authorities are silencing another whistleblower. Chen Qiushi, a human rights advocate, has been missing since Thursday \u2013 the same day Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist who was punished by authorities for trying to warn colleagues and friends about a new Sars-like virus, was first reported to have died from the coronavirus. You can see our full story here. Sixty more cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Diamond princess cruise ship, domestic broadcaster TBS TV said via Twitter. NHK Japan is also saying around 60 new cases have been identified, quoting the health ministry. That brings total cases on the ship docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, to 130, according to TBS. When the boat arrived off Japan, authorities initially tested nearly 300 people of the 3,711 on board for the virus, gradually evacuating dozens who tested positive to local medical facilities. In recent days, testing has expanded to those who had close contact with other infected passengers or crew, and several more cases were reported over the weekend. Those who remain on the ship have been asked to stay inside their cabins and allowed out only briefly onto open decks. They have been asked to wear masks and keep a distance from each other when outside, and given thermometers to regularly monitor their temperatures. The Mobile World Congress \u2013 the largest exhibition for the mobile phone industry \u2013 being held in Barcelona this month, has announced travellers from Hubei province will not be admitted. In addition, organisers announced that: All travellers from the Hubei province will not be permitted access to the event All travellers who have been in China will need to demonstrate proof they have been outside of China 14 days prior to the event (passport stamp, health certificate) Temperature screening will be implemented Attendees will need to self-certify they have not been in contact with anyone infected Amazon has announced it will not attend the conference, because of coronavirus-related concerns. Other companies believed to have pulled out include LG and Ericsson, according to Techcrunch. China\u2019s consumer prices rose at the highest rate in more than eight years, official data on Monday showed, with inflation more than expected on the back of lunar new year demand and a deadly virus outbreak. The consumer price index (CPI), a key gauge of retail inflation, came in at 5.4% last month on-year, up from 4.5% in December \u2013 with prices of pork and fresh vegetables pushing up costs. It\u2019s the highest CPI rise since October 2011. The report showed that food prices spiked 20.6%, including pork which rose 116% from a year ago, up from the 97% rise in December. The on-month rise for pork was 8.5%. \u201cPeople also tend to hoard food and other supplies in this kind of situation. The hoarding will most likely push up prices,\u201d said Lu Ting of Nomura in a research note last Thursday. The Economist\u2019s Simon Rabinovitch in Shanghai, has been posting some pictures about the empty streets on the day people were supposed to go back to work. The Journal of the American Medical Association has published a report on the clinical characteristics of 138 coronavirus patients in Wuhan. It details symptoms and clinical characteristics of the virus and gives an insight into infections. Of the 138 patients covered in the results, common symptoms included fever (99%), fatigue (70%), dry cough (60%). Less common symptoms were headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. Most patients received antiviral therapy and many also received antibacterial therapy. About a quarter of patients in the study were admitted to intensive care because of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome. The median time from the first symptom to shortness of breath (dyspnea) was five days, and eight days to acute respiratory symptoms. The median hospital stay was 10 days. The study also found that of the 138 patients, 57 were presumed to have been infected in hospital, including 17 patients (12.3%) who were already hospitalised for other reasons and 40 health care workers (29%). This may go some way to explaining the rapid building of coronavirus-specific hospitals in Wuhan. The report says \u201cto our knowledge, is the largest case series to date of hospitalised patients\u201d and was published on 3 February. For the medically minded, I have attached the report here. You can find our latest wrap on the coronavirus below, including the WHO\u2019s warning that confirmed cases of coronavirus being transmitted by people who have never travelled to China could be the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. As people in Beijing return to work for the first time after lunar new year, state media is reporting a 50% drop in train passengers. \u201cThose not wearing a face mask will be advised to leave the station,\u201d CGTN says. Normal restrictions in Beijing to limit the number of private cars on the road have been lifted temporarily, to help people avoid public transport. The state run tabloid Global Times has published footage of Wuhan\u2019s twice-daily disinfections, that began on Sunday. The head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says \u201cwe may only be seeing the tip of the iceberg\u201d with regards to the spread of the coronavirus. He says the detection of a small number of cases (globally) may indicate more widespread transmission in countries outside China, adding that there have been \u201csome concerning instances\u201d of the virus\u2019s spread from people with no travel history to China. He has reiterated a point he made on Sunday \u2013 that \u201call countries must use the window of opportunity created by the containment strategy to prepare for the virus\u2019s possible arrival\u201d. Ghebreyesus has called on all countries to share what they know \u201cin real time with @WHO\u201d. Members of a WHO-led \u201cinternational expert mission\u201d flew to China on Monday to help coordinate a response to the virus outbreak. A little bit more on the Kia announcement. It blames a shortage of parts for the suspension of production at its factories at Gwangju and Sohari on MOnday and Tuesday. It said it would monitor the availability of auto parts in order to determine whether to resume production after that. Kia\u2019s Hwaseong factory halted output on Monday but is expected to resume production on Tuesday. The continued closure of Wuhan means many shops remain closed, making it harder for elderly people to shop, as this tweet from the New York Times Beijing reporter, Chris Buckley, points out. South Korean carmaker Kia is suspending production at three factories in the country, according to Reuters. It follows Hyundai\u2019s decision last week to suspend work at its giant plant at Ulsan, citing a shortage of parts from China. In other markets news, the Australian dollar has risen 0.38% on signs that businesses are starting to reopen in China. The Aussie, as the currency is known, is standing at US67.01c after dipping to US66.62. The currency is seen as a proxy for the Chinese economy because of Australia\u2019s close economic ties with China. Looking at those figures for deaths and infections in China that we reported, I wanted to quickly look at where the suspected infections were. Of the 4,008 new cases of suspected infections, 2,272 are in Hubei province. This is 56% of suspected cases. It compares with last week as per below: Sunday: 3,916 suspected new cases; 2,067 in or 53% Hubei Saturday: 4,214 suspected new cases; 2,073 or 49% in Hubei Friday: 4,833 suspected new cases; 2,622 or 54% in Hubei Thursday: 5,328 suspected new cases; 3,230 or 60% in Hubei Wednesday: 3,971 suspected new cases; 1957 or 49% in Hubei Tuesday: 5,072 suspected new cases; 3,182 or 63% in Hubei Monday: 5,173 suspected new cases; 3,260 or 70% in Hubei Sunday: 4,562 suspected new cases; 2,606 or 57% in Hubei Of the 97 new deaths, the overwhelming majority are in Hubei province (91), with 2 in Anhui province, 1 in Heilongjiang province, 1 in Jiangxi province, 1 in Hainan province, and 1 in Gansu province Six more people quarantined aboard a luxury cruise liner moored at the Japanese port of Yokohama tested positive for the coronavirus on Sunday, bringing the number of confirmed infections on the Diamond Princess to 70. The new infections were found among five crew members and one passenger - four Filipinos, one American and one Ukrainian aged from their 20s to 70s, Japan\u2019s health ministry said, adding that none was displaying serious symptoms. Japan health authorities have now tested 336 of the ship\u2019s 3,700 passengers and crew. Initially, 273 \u201cat risk\u201d people were tested, but all passengers and crew have since been given thermometers and told to take their temperatures every four hours. Those with temperatures of 37.5C have to inform medical workers onboard the ship, British passenger David Abel said in a Facebook post on Monday morning. The Diamond Princess has been quarantined in Yokohama, south of Tokyo, for a week after it emerged that an 80-year-old man who disembarked in Hong Kong late last month had tested positive. Japan\u2019s government has said that \u201cin principle\u201d the quarantine will end on 19 February. Kyodo news agency said the government was responding to requests to secure medicine for passengers with chronic health conditions. The overall number of infected people in Japan now stands at 96 - the highest number outside mainland China. They include 10 people who were evacuated from Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the outbreak is thought to have started. A Japanese man suspected of being infected with the coronavirus died in Wuhan at the weekend. If the virus is confirmed as the cause of death, the man, in his 60s, would be the first Japanese victim of the respiratory illness. Stock markets remain fairly calm about the outbreak despite mounting concerns about the impact on the global economy. The Japanese Nikkei index is down 0.4% so far today, Sydney is off 0.2% and the Kospi in Seoul has lost nearly 1%. The markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai are down 1% and 0.8% after 30 minutes of trading. in commodities, oil continues to slide on fears of oversupply. Brent crude was down 38 cents to $54.09 a barrel. Nickel, a key steel-making ingredient, has however risen 2% after steep falls last week. Tens of millions of people plan to go back to work on Monday as a prolonged Lunar New Year holiday comes to an end. Authorities had extended the end of the holiday, which sees tens of millions of people criss cross the country to go back to work from their hometowns, by 10 extra days because of the virus. Many cities have been turned into ghost towns over the last few weeks. But it is unclear how much life will go back to normal. Schools are still shut. China\u2019s state council has said that staff should come back in \u201cbatches\u201d rather than all at once. Many factories remain shut and many businesses have asked their staff to work from home. Foxconn, the company that makes the iPhone, says it is still in talks with the Chinese government over when it can reopen its factories in Shenzhen in the country\u2019s south and Kunshan west of Shanghai, Reuters reports. But it has been given approval to get workeers back into its facility at Zengzhou in the central province of Henan. Phillip Inman, economics editor of the Observer, has taken an in-depth look at the effect that coronavirus is having on the global economy. Among the gloomier possibilities is this: If the virus continues to spread and Chinese activity remains deeply disrupted for months, a contraction of the global economy is not impossible, particularly as central banks have little effective monetary ammunition for emergencies. Here\u2019s the full story: Reuters reports that China\u2019s agriculture ministry has said the highly pathogenic H5N6 strain of avian flu has been found in a poultry farm in southwestern Sichuan province. This is the first H5N6 avian flu detected from a poultry farm after four cases found in swans this year. The ministry said on Sunday night 1,840 birds had died in the farm of 2,497. The rest have been culled. A memorial for whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang has been held in New York. Li\u2019s death sparked an outpouring of anger inside China. Li was silenced by the government for trying to warn people over the threat of the new virus, and later died after contracting it. Some welcome news for the 3,700 people onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is quarantined in Yokohama harbour after several cases of coronavirus among passengers. Reuters has more details on the advance team of international experts led by the World Health Organization (WHO) that has left for Beijing to help investigate the epidemic. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who made a trip to Beijing for talks with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers in late January, returned with an agreement on sending an international mission. But it has taken nearly two weeks to get the government\u2019s green light on its composition. The only member of the team that has been made public is WHO veteran Dr Bruce Aylward, a Canadian epidemiologist and emergencies expert, was heading it. \u201cI\u2019ve just been at the airport seeing off members of an advance team for the @WHO-led \u00a32019nCoV international expert mission to \u00a3China, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, veteran of past public health emergencies,\u201d Tedros said in a tweet from Geneva. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is where things stand: Total deaths in China: 908, up by 97. Total infections in China: 40,171, up by 3,062. The rise in confirmed cases reverses the significant reduction reported on Sunday. Then, there were 2,656 new cases, which was down by about 20% from the 3,399 reported in the previous 24-hour period. China returns to work today, after the end of the new year break, which was extended by 10 days to try to prevent the virus from spreading. An advance team of international experts led by the World Health Organization has left for Beijing to help investigate the epidemic. There have been reports of \u201cshocking\u201d levels of racism in Britain in the wake of the crisis. 3,600 people quarantined on a cruise ship in Hong Kong have been allowed to disembark after tests came back negative. French health officials have confirmed that new cases of coronavirus detected in the UK and Mallorca are linked to a cluster in a ski resort. A doctor who blew the whistle on the Sars epidemic in 2003 is under house arrest.",
