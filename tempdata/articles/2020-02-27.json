Although a local Democratic Party web site said that the \u201conly guaranteed way to get a ticket is to become a sponsor of the debate\u201d, this page was later deleted.

Reporter Amanda Holpuch has more. Barack Obama called on TV stations in South Carolina to pull an ad by a pro-Trump super PAC, saying that it takes Obama\u2019s words out of context to create a misleading attack on Joe Biden. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing the newspaper of intentionally publishing a false article related to the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016. A federal appeals court in New York ruled that the Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars from law enforcement agencies in so-called sanctuary cities that don\u2019t cooperate with immigration enforcement agencies, reported the New York Times. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio blasted the decision, saying that the ruling, if implemented, would strip local law enforcement of resources and make it more difficult for them to maintain public safety. On Wednesday a federal appeals court ruled that the Trump administration can withhold millions of dollars from law enforcement agencies in so-called sanctuary cities that don\u2019t cooperate with immigration enforcement agencies. The New York Times reports that the decision by United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan makes it the first to side with the administration on whether it can withhold money to enforce cooperation. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio blasted the decision, saying in a statement: \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s latest retaliation against his hometown takes away security funding from the number one terrorist target in America, all because we refuse to play by his arbitrary rules,\u201d he said, adding \u201cWe\u2019ll see President Trump back in court. And we will win.\u201d Immigrant rights advocates argue that such cooperation between local police and immigration enforcement agencies make communities less safe because they discourage immigrants from reporting crimes to law enforcement out of fear they\u2019ll face deportation or other sanctions. Cutting funds could further jeopardize police efforts, they say. Trump on the other hand, has taken aim at sanctuary cities, arguing that they flout the rule of law and jeopardize public safety by releasing dangerous criminals into the community, despite evidence showing that sanctuary laws do not make communities less safe. While today\u2019s decision breaks new ground, immigration enforcement and local police have worked together with a wink and a nod, even in jurisdictions associated with sanctuary polices. This week a jury in New York toppled Harvey Weinstein when it convicted the former movie titan of rape. A jury of 12 at the New York supreme court took five days to reach their verdict: guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree for forcing oral sex on the former Project Runway production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The verdict was welcome news to his many accusers. It was also closely watched by Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who\u2019s faced criticism for not bringing charges against the film mogul long ago. Reports the New York Times: Mr. Vance, who leads one of the most storied district attorney\u2019s offices in the country, was the first prosecutor to bring charges against Mr. Weinstein, and the verdict marked a triumphant moment in the career of a liberal who first ran as a champion on women\u2019s issues. Yet, as much as the prosecutor wanted to turn the page, he remained embattled, still struggling to regain the support of feminists and victims\u2019 advocates who have faulted his office\u2019s handling of sex crimes. In an interview with the Times, Vance expressed regret to survivors of sexual assault who left his office feeling \u201cnot listened to.\u201d Former president Barack Obama asked TV stations in South Carolina to pull an ad by a pro-Trump super PAC, saying that it takes Obama\u2019s words out of context to create a misleading attack on Joe Biden. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that The Committee to Defend the President reported to the Federal Election Commission that it had spent more than $250,000 in South Carolina to oppose Biden. The paper writes that the ad falsely suggests that Obama\u2019s voice in the narration refer to Biden. Katie Hill, Obama\u2019s communications director, told the Post in a statement: This despicable ad is straight out of the Republican disinformation playbook, and it\u2019s clearly designed to suppress turnout among minority voters in South Carolina by taking President Obama\u2019s voice out of context and twisting his words to mislead viewers. In the interest of truth in advertising, we are calling on TV stations to take this ad down and stop playing into the hands of bad actors who seek to sow division and confusion among the electorate. The day before in-person voting is set to begin in California, the nation\u2019s most populous state where 415 delegates are at stake, Joe Biden\u2019s East Los Angeles field office is quiet, writes the New York Times. It could be a sign of things to come for Biden, even as he looks for a win in the South Carolina primary to boost his chances against Bernie Sanders. Biden\u2019s ground-game in the Golden State is dwarfed by those of Sanders and Mike Bloomberg. \u201cInterviews with party leaders in half a dozen Super Tuesday states suggest that the same vulnerabilities that plagued Mr. Biden beginning in Iowa \u2014 subpar organization, limited outreach to local Democrats and a late start to campaigning \u2014 are holding him back in the states that next week will dole out a third of the total delegates in the Democratic primary,\u201d writes the New York Times. Read more on Biden\u2019s chances in California and what that could mean for his campaign. Multiple people have been killed in Milwaukee after a shooter stormed the campus of Molson Coors, an industrial pocket located in the city\u2019s near northwest side. Early reports indicate at least five are dead, including the shooter. Donald Trump, speaking at a press conference on the US response to the Coronavirus outbreak, called the shooter a \u201cwicked murderer\u201d and said \u201cOur hearts break for them and their loved ones.\u201d Former politician and current gun control advocate Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt by a gunman in Tucson, condemned the attack on Twitter. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is on the ground monitoring the situation. More news to come. Donald Trump is scheduled to start speaking in the next several minutes on the US government\u2019s response to the Coronavirus outbreak. Tune in to the Guardian\u2019s liveblog on the topic to hear the latest. A US district judge has denied a motion by the Miami Herald and reporter Julie K. Brown that asked her to reconsider her ruling that a large cache of files related to Jeffrey Epstein be released. Courthouse News reporter Adam Klasfeld Tweeted that the news is a setback to those looking to unseal the files but that there should be future opportunities to do so. A bill to make lynching a hate crime under federal law passed the House on Wednesday. The Emmett Till Anti-lynching Act is a nod to Emmett Till, who was 14 when a group of white men beat him with a gun, shot him and threw his body in the Tallahatchie River with a cotton-gin fan tied to his neck with barbed wire. An all-white, all-male jury later acquitted two of the suspected murderers. The bill passed by a wide margin, 410-4. For some, just as newsworthy as the results is the fact that four voted \u201cno\u201d on the bill. As US health officials warn that the Coronavirus outbreak has entered a new phase, Donald Trump is expected to address the public tonight at 6:30 ET, speaking to questions on the US government\u2019s response to it. So far Trump has issued messages that downplay the scope and spread of the disease despite warnings from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the respiratory illness is likely to cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans. Guardian reporter Amanda Holpuch has five things to watch for in Trump\u2019s upcoming address: How the US is monitoring the outbreak While South Korea has tested more than 35,000 people for coronavirus, the US has tested 426 people, excluding those returned on evacuation flights, Holpuch writes. Who\u2019s in charge The White House says the coronavirus response is in the hands of the health secretary, Alex Azar. But Ronald Klain, who held monitored the Ebola outbreak under Obama, told the New York Times that Azar is not enough: \u201cOne cabinet secretary cannot run an interagency response. Azar has the biggest civilian job in the American government. Is he doing this in his spare time?\u201d How much money is available Now, the White House has requested $1.25bn in new emergency funding and to divert another $1.25bn from existing federal programs, Holpuch reports. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, a critic of the administration\u2019s response to coronavirus, on Wednesday requested more than three times that amount. Whether the US has enough equipment Azar told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the federal government had a stockpile of 30m masks. It could need as many as 300m for health workers. Can the president instill confidence? It will be interesting to see if and when messages from Trump and the CDC align. Mario Koran here on the west coast, picking up the blog from Adam in New York. M. Saad Ejaz in New York has the post: During Tuesday night\u2019s fiery democratic debate, Bernie Sanders criticized Michael Bloomberg for having no supporters except other billionaires. To Sanders\u2019 visible surprise, the audience at the debate booed him. \u201cOh dear,\u201d the Vermont Senator replied as he pointed his finger back and forth. Commentators and analysts have since asked whether candidates shelled out thousands of dollars to crowd the expensive seats with their own supporters. \u201cBloomberg literally packed the audience for cheers for himself,\u201d said Kyle Kulinski, host of the Kyle Kulinski show, \u201cThis is the most pathetic thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \u201cMost working people that I know don\u2019t spend $1,700 to get a ticket to a debate and that\u2019s problematic,\u201d Sanders said after the debate. \u201cThat\u2019s what the DNC did,\u201d he added, referring to the Democratic National Committee. Yet the DNC has stated that tickets were distributed equitably. \u201cThis is the most diverse audience,\u201d tweeted Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokesperson for the DNC. Over a thousand spots were available at the debate, according to Green Schneider, the communications director at the South Carolina Democratic Party (SCDP). Almost 400 of these went to the SCDP itself, and these were distributed among activists, party leaders, and elected officials, she said. Fifteen were given to each campaign. As for the remaining 600 or so, some were sold to sponsors who contributed between $1,750 and $3,200 to the event and related gatherings, according to a local news station, WCSC. \u201cThis is something that the average person doesn\u2019t usually get to go to,\u201d one official said on local television. \u201cThese kinds of events really are set up for sponsors and things like that.\u201d Were these tickets bought up by Bloomberg and others? Although a local Democratic Party web site said that the \u201conly guaranteed way to get a ticket is to become a sponsor of the debate\u201d, this page was later deleted. And confusingly, Schneider of the SCDP said that while sponsors received access to dinners and other events, they did not receive a ticket to the debate itself. The mystery remains. \u2022Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times, over an article related to the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016. Trump\u2019s staff say the article\u2019s assertion that Trump had an \u201coverarching deal\u201d with \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s oligarchy\u201d is untrue. \u2022Joe Biden picked up a boost when he was endorsed by South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn, ahead of the state\u2019s primary on Saturday. Clyburn, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, represents predominantly African American neighborhoods in and around Charleston and Columbia. He said Biden \u201chas stood for the hard-working people of South Carolina\u201d. \u2022Bernie Sanders is targeting Amy Klobuchar\u2019s home state of Minnesota ahead of Super Tuesday. Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would hold an event in Minnesota on Monday. The Vermont senator is holding rallies on Friday and Saturday in Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home state. \u2022Trump pushed back against criticism that his administration isn\u2019t doing enough to meet the coronavirus threat, as lawmakers said disease fighters need far more than the $2.5bn the White House has requested. Trump is due to hold a press conference addressing the coronavirus at 6pm ET. Bernie Sanders has accused Donald Trump of \u201ctaking a page from his dictator friends\u201d after the president announced he was suing the New York Times. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: we have a president who believes he is above the law and can do and say whatever he wants without consequences,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. Donald Trump has ignored the Constitution, disregarded the will of Congress, and attacked the judiciary. Trump has called the press the \u2018enemy of the people,\u2019 and now \u2013 taking a page from his dictator friends around the world \u2013 is trying to dismantle the right to a free press in the First Amendment by suing the New York Times for publishing an opinion column about his dangerous relationship with Russia. Enough. Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in modern history, and this November we will defeat him, restore the rule of law, and protect our constitutional rights. Lawmakers from both parties have warned that the Defense Department is undermining its own efforts to get military money, by diverting billions of dollars for the construction of President Donald Trump\u2019s US-Mexico border wall, according to Associated Press: The chairman of the House Armed services committee and the committee\u2019s top Republican told Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday that overturning congressional funding decisions to shift money for the wall is an enormous problem that will have consequences. The plan to shift money has triggered rare Republican opposition to one of Trump\u2019s priorities. Rep Mac Thornberry, Republican from Texas, said the result may be that Congress will place greater restrictions on the Pentagon\u2019s ability to move money around to meet military needs. The chairman, Democratic Rep Adam Smith of Washington, said the money transfer is \u201cvery, very damaging to the Pentagon.\u201d \u201cThe message it sends is the Pentagon has plenty of money,\u201d said Smith, adding that it \u201cundercuts any arguments for any need for resources.\u201d The Pentagon announced this month that it was slashing billions of dollars in funding for Navy and Air Force aircraft and other military programs to free up money for the construction of the wall. Bernie Sanders\u2019 New Year\u2019s resolution, more than three decades ago: \u201cIn 1978, as in other years, I hope to play some role in making working people aware that the present day reality of poverty, wage slavery and mind-destroying media and schools is not the only reality \u2013 but simply a pathetic presentation brought to us by a handful of power-hungry individuals who own and control our economy.\u201d Bernie Sanders is \u201ctaking aim\u201d at Amy Klobuchar\u2019s home state of Minnesota, according to Associated Press. Sanders\u2019 campaign announced earlier that he will hold a rally on Monday in St. Paul, the day before Minnesotan Democrats go to the polls in the \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d extravaganza. \u201cIt comes after Sanders already announced rallies Friday night and Saturday in Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home state of Massachusetts,\u201d AP reports. Klobuchar is averaging 5.4% in national polls, but seems unlikely to drop out before Tuesday\u2019s vote. A total of 14 states, plus American Samoa, vote on Tuesday, coughing up 1,357 delegates. Candidates need 1,991 delegates to win the nomination. Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has filed a libel lawsuit against the New York Times, accusing the newspaper of intentionally publishing a false article related to the investigation into Russian election interference in 2016. According to Reuters, the lawsuit was being filed in the New York State Supreme Court, the state\u2019s trial-level court, on Tuesday. The lawsuit relates to an opinion piece in the New York Times, published in March 2019. [Trump] campaign officials said the lawsuit was being filed in the New York State Supreme Court, the state\u2019s trial-level court. A statement from the campaign said the aim of the litigation was to \u201chold the news organization accountable for intentionally publishing false statements against President Trump\u2019s campaign\u201d. The statements Trump\u2019s campaign alleges are false are, according to a Trump attorney: \u201cThat Trump had an \u2018overarching deal\u2019 with \u2018Vladimir Putin\u2019s oligarchy\u2019 to \u2018help the campaign against Hillary Clinton\u2019 in exchange for \u2018a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from ... economic sanctions\u2019\u201d. In 2016 USA Today found that Trump had been involved in 3,500 lawsuits over the past three decades. There are now 60 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the US, health secretary Alex Azar said this afternoon. \u201cAs of this morning, we still had only 14 cases of the novel coronavirus detected in the United States involved travel to or close contacts with travelers. Coming into this hearing, I was informed that we have a 15th confirmed case, the epidemiology of which we are still discerning,\u201d Azar said. Three Americans repatriated from Wuhan had already been diagnosed with the coronavirus, along with 42 people evacuees from the cruise ship Diamond Princess, bringing the total to 60. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign is deploying musician John Legend to South Carolina, as the Massachusetts senator seeks to shore up support among black voters here. Legend, in his introductory remarks for Warren today, used some of the same anti-corporate largesse arguments as his chosen candidate. Speaking in front of a largely black audience at South Carolina State University, a Historically black college and university, Legend pointed out that Warren \u201csupports creating a commission on reparations.\u201d He also knocked former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Warren\u2019s favorite punching bag of late, over the billionaire\u2019s past positions and comments on housing. \u201cUnlike Mayor Bloomberg, she knows that housing discrimination through redlining has been a national tragedy,\u201d Legend said. Much of Legend\u2019s speech was tailor-made to appeal to the audience. He said Warren \u201cknows that racism has been codified in our criminal justice system\u201d and that the country needs \u201cprogressive criminal justice reform\u201d. Warren, during her remarks, didn\u2019t call out Bloomberg by name but did use some of her favorite anti-billionaire lines, like when she was checking off her proposals for reducing inequality. \u201cYou may have heard some billionaires don\u2019t like this. Some of them go on TV and cry,\u201d Warren said. \u201cSome of them run for president,\u201d Warren added, quipping that it isn\u2019t so easy. Warren has struggled in the first few primary contests. In the Nevada caucuses and New Hampshire primary she placed fourth both times, failing to net any delegates. South Carolina is a more conservative state than some of the earlier contests, and recent polls have shown Warren trailing her rivals here. A recent Eastern Carolina university survey found Warren trailing former vice-president Joe Biden, Senator Bernie Sanders, and billionaire Tom Steyer. Warren usually offers a selfie line at her events. At this event, Legend performed instead. Donald Trump pushed back today against criticism that his administration isn\u2019t doing enough to meet the coronavirus threat, as lawmakers called for giving disease fighters much more money than the $2.5 billion the White House has requested. A day after he sought to minimize fears of the virus spreading widely across the U.S., Trump prepared to hold a White House press conference with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the AP reports. Meanwhile, two new coronavirus cases have been reported in Americans who had traveled on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, health officials said Wednesday. The new cases bring the US tally to 59. Trump tweeted Wednesday that the CDC, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and others in the administration are \u201cdoing a great job with respect to Coronavirus!\u201d and accused some news outlets of \u201cpanicking markets.\u201d The White House said Wednesday that it had faith in Azar and was not considering appointing a virus czar. You can follow our global live blog on the coronavirus crisis here. Mike Bloomberg is out with a new ad accusing Trump of putting Americans\u2019 health at risk with his handling of coronavirus. \u201cManaging a crisis is what Mike Bloomberg does,\u201d the ad\u2019s narrator says. \u201cIn the aftermath of 9/11, he steadied and rebuilt America\u2019s largest city, oversaw emergency response to natural disasters, upgraded hospital preparedness to manage health crises, and he\u2019s funding cutting edge research to contain epidemics.\u201d Bloomberg was the first person to mention coronavirus during last night\u2019s Democratic debate, which came after two days of steep stock market losses due to concerns about the spreading health threat. \u201cThe president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago,\u201d Bloomberg said last night. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he\u2019s defunded the CDC.\u201d Moderator Gayle King then tried to cut Bloomberg off to return to the topic of his efforts to ban soda in New York, prompting criticism on Twitter. The moderators eventually asked the candidates a question about coronavirus, nearly an hour and a half into the debate. Things are looking up for Joe Biden, in South Carolina at least: The state votes on Saturday. We haven\u2019t heard much from Donald Trump today. This was him earlier. I have absolutely no idea where he got this from: On Tuesday an Economist poll found Trump had 11% support among black voters, and last week an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found he had 14% support. Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, told aides \u201cgood work\u201d in 2017, after an Atlanta newspaper exposed problems in the way voters were removed from electoral rolls. \u201cGood work, this story is so complex folks will not make it all the way through it,\u201d Kemp, then Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, wrote in an email. Kemp was elected governor in 2018. The email was released by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which is investigating voter suppression in Georgia, Texas and Kansas. The 2017 story in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution detailed the way local election officials were inaccurately removing people from the rolls. It featured one woman whose voter registration was challenged because her name did not show up on water utility records. The story quoted an election official in the secretary of state\u2019s office saying it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to use a water bill to begin the process of removing a voter. David Dove, a Kemp aide, wrote back that he agreed not a lot of people would read the story. \u201cI think she wrote this to appease her folks on the left, but this won\u2019t help draw eyeballs,\u201d he wrote. Kemp has long faced scrutiny over the way his office has aggressively removed people from the voter rolls. Stacey Abrams, his opponent in the 2018 gubernatorial race, said Kemp won the race because of voter suppression. The committee also released some information from its probe into voter suppression accusations in Kansas and Texas. You can read the full memo here. How about this then: FiveThirtyEight\u2019s forecast gives Sanders a 44% chance of winning the Democratic nomination. Party grandees (well, one) appear to be coming to terms with the concept. (According to FiveThirtyEight the next most likely winner is \u201cno one\u201d.) In head-to-head polls, pitting Democratic candidates against Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders outperforms every one of his rivals. RealClearPolitics polling average suggests that the progressive Sanders would defeat Trump, nationally, by 4.4 points, while moderates like Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg would also triumph by 4.3% and 3.3% \u2013 which could allay fears that Sanders is too left-wing to win. Those numbers could, however, \u201cbe a mirage\u201d, according to a new article by Vox. Vox surveyed 40,000 people in early 2020, asking them to choose between Trump and a Democratic candidate. The results reflected polling that shows Sanders would defeat Trump nationally. However, according to Vox: \u201cOn closer inspection [...] this finding relies on some remarkable assumptions about youth turnout that past elections suggest are questionable.\u201d Vox found that if Sanders is the nominee, some independents would be driven away from the Democratic party. And yet: Sanders appears in our survey data to be similarly electable to the moderates, at least at first blush. Why? Mainly because 11 percent of left-leaning young people say they are undecided, would support a third-party candidate, or, most often, just would not vote if a moderate were nominated \u2014 but say they would turn out and vote for Sanders if he were nominated. The large number of young people who say they will only vote if Sanders is nominated is just enough to offset the voters Sanders loses to Trump in the rest of the electorate. Specifically, one \u201cin six left-leaning young people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t vote would need to turn out because Sanders was nominated\u201d, Vox says, for Sanders to defeat Trump. Vox reckons this surge in young people voting for Sanders is unlikely. First, people who promise in surveys they will vote often don\u2019t, meaning the turnout estimates that Sanders\u2019s electability case rests upon are probably extremely inaccurate. Second, such a turnout surge is large in comparison to other effects on turnout. For example, Sanders would need to stimulate a youth turnout boost much larger than the turnout boost Barack Obama\u2019s presence on the ballot stimulated among black voters in 2008. Third, Sanders\u2019s electability case requires this 11 percentage point turnout increase among young voters in 2020 to occur on top of any turnout increase that would otherwise occur if another Democrat were nominated. Read the Vox piece in full here. A bipartisan group of 70 former senators have penned a letter to the current US Senate, claiming it is \u201cnot fulfilling its constitutional duties\u201d The former Senators, writing in the Washington Post, include John Kerry; recently ousted Democrats Claire McCaskill and Heidi Heitkamp; and the Republicans Jeff Flake and John Warner. They appear to suggest \u2013 the letter is quite mealy-mouthed \u2013 that the Senate, and the House, have handed over too much power to the president in recent years. Examples of Congress ceding its powers to the executive through the years include the power to regulate international trade, the power to authorize the use of military force in foreign conflicts and, when the president declares national emergencies, the power of the purse. The solution to this, the former senators believe, is \u201cthe creation of a bipartisan caucus of incumbent senators who would be committed to making the Senate function as the framers of the constitution intended\u201d. Clyburn has represented South Carolina in the House since 1993, and currently serves as the House majority whip. His congressional district includes predominantly African American neighborhoods in and around Charleston and Columbia, and as the third-ranking Democrat in the House, Clyburn holds huge sway in South Carolina. Black voters made up 55% of ballots in the 2008 South Carolina primary, and 61% in 2016. Biden\u2019s lead in the state has been narrowing, but the former vice-president will hope that with Clyburn\u2019s backing he can finally notch his first victory. Jim Clyburn has endorsed Joe Biden for president, a crucial boost ahead of the Democratic primary in South Carolina. Clyburn is seen as a key backer given his support and influence among South Carolina\u2019s African American community. Here\u2019s Clyburn\u2019s statement, posted on Twitter: \u201cI know Joe Biden. I know his character, his heart, and his record. Joe Biden has stood for the hard-working people of South Carolina. We know Joe. But more importantly, he knows us. In South Carolina, we choose presidents. I\u2019m calling on you to stand with @JoeBiden. Most of the Democratic frontrunners are attending a National Action Network breakfast in South Carolina this morning. All eyes are on Jim Clyburn, the state\u2019s influential congressman whose endorsement could be crucial as candidates hope to boost their support among African American voters. Clyburn is expected to endorse Joe Biden... but he hasn\u2019t done it yet, according to our man Oliver Laughland. CNN are reporting that Senate Democrats are preparing to request $8.5 billion to combat the coronavirus. The Trump administration has only asked for $2.5 billion so far, not all of which is new funding. There are only 57 cases of coronavirus in the US of the illness that has affected over 80,000 people globally - but officials have already said they expect it to spread further domestically. [See 13:10] President Trump is holding a news conference about the outbreak at 6pm. The Los Angeles Times is reporting more pressure being applied to Elizabeth Warren over her past claims of Native American heritage. Warren has been sent an open letter from over 200 citizens of the Cherokee nation and other Native American groups, which opens: Senator Warren, as you seek the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, your history of false claims to American Indian identity and the defense of these claims with a highly publicized DNA test continue to dog your political career. For Native Americans, this moment is more than an annoyance; it represents the most public debate about our identity in a generation. In a country where Indigenous people are mostly invisible, what Americans conclude from this debate will impact Native rights for years to come. Warren apologised for her claims back in February 2019. The continued relevance of the issue centres around an LA Times investigation that found \u201cmore than $800 million in government contracts reserved for minorities instead went to companies set up by members of groups with dubious claims to being Cherokee and Creek Indian tribes\u201d - claims often fuelled by commercial DNA tests. The open letter cites the investigation, and concludes: You have done some good things for Indian Country during your time in political service. You have also done real harm. Right now, you have the platform and the opportunity to stand firmly on the side of justice. This is not about politics or your career. This is about the well-being of our nations. The time has come for you to show true leadership and make this right. You can read the open letter in full here. Struggling Democratic candidate Elizabeth Warren will be buoyed somewhat by the endorsement of the Boston Globe today. Despite a so-so performance at the debate last night in South Carolina and having been eclipsed on the progressive wing by Bernie Sanders in recent weeks, as he moved into position as the frontrunner for the nomination, the Globe reminds everyone it\u2019s far from over and its local US Senator is the one to pick. Despite the undeniable momentum Senator Bernie Sanders has gained in recent weeks, the party\u2019s presidential nominee is in no way a foregone conclusion. Only three states have voted, and 97 percent of delegates are still up for grabs. The time is right to back the best candidate in the race. The publication praises the top six candidates still in the race and says each would make a way better president than Donald Trump. But it adds: One candidate stands out as a leader with the qualifications, the track record, and the tenacity to defend the principles of democracy, bring fairness to an economy that is excluding too many Americans, and advance a progressive agenda. She would fight the corruption and corporate influence that distort our politics, lift up working families, and combat gun violence and climate change. That candidate is Elizabeth Warren\u2026 Fearless and brilliant on her feet, Warren has the greatest potential among the candidates to lay bare Trump\u2019s weaknesses on a debate stage. Our senator brings her heart and her head to an election where so much, including the future of our neighborhoods, the justice system, and the planet is at stake. On that score, there can be no doubt: Elizabeth Warren will fight for the integrity of our democracy and for our society\u2019s most vulnerable. Massachusetts \u2014 and for that matter, South Carolina and other Super Tuesday states \u2014 should give her the chance to keep doing it. The president has confirmed he will be giving a news conference today about the coronavirus outbreak. Along the way he couldn\u2019t resist having a swipe at the media and the opposition. As of Tuesday, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the number of cases in the United States has risen to 57. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, has said that \u201cWe expect we will see community spread in this country. It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d Trump has faced criticism for the way the administration is handling the crisis, with Chuck Schumer being one of the most vocal. Bernie Sanders was also scathing during the Democrat debate last night, saying: \u201cIn the White House today, we have a self-described \u2018great genius\u2019, and this \u2018great genius\u2019 has told us that this Coronavirus is going to end in two months. April is the magical day that this great scientist we have in the White House has determined.\u201d Joe Biden also criticised Trump, comparing his handling of coronavirus with the way the Obama administration tackled the threat of Ebola, and how the current president has dismantled that operation: \u201cWhat we did with Ebola -- I was part of making sure that pandemic did not get to the United States, saved millions of lives. We set upthat office in the presidency on diseases that are pandemic diseases. We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. And our president today - he\u2019s wiped all that out.\u201d CBS have published a full transcript of last night\u2019s debate if you want to pick over the bones of it. There\u2019s also an interesting - if slightly unwieldy - set of fact checks from the New York Times on some of the claims made last night by the candidates. Perhaps most damaging of these findings are the suggestion that Bernie Sanders mischaracterised studies of the costs of his health care plan, falsely stating that they all say it will save money. Joe Biden was also found to be \u2018mostly false\u2019 when said that the Obama administration did not know about Russian involvement in subverting American elections until the end. Joe Biden keeps on piling up support from the rest of the Democrat party, with the news this morning that former Gov. Pat Quinn and more than 80 other top Illinois Democrats are endorsing him for president. The new endorsements include former Chicago Deputy Mayor Andrea Zopp, state Sen. and Assistant Majority Leader Iris Martinez and Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. One concern for Biden though - Illinois doesn\u2019t vote until 17 March, by which time Bernie Sanders may have already nearly gained an unassailable lead in the delegate count. We\u2019ve got a couple of pieces looking at how the digital Democrat campaign is going. First up is a piece co-published with The Markup looking at the effectiveness of candidate emails at actually reaching your inbox. They found that Pete Buttigieg is doing best, with Elizabeth Warren doing worst. There\u2019s two elements to the story though. Firstly, of course, some of it is down to the way that the campaigns themselves are formatting and sending out email. But there\u2019s another aspect. We know that Facebook and Twitter customise and personalise your news feed to show you things it thinks you might be interested in - but we don\u2019t often think about how this also happens with the email we see. It\u2019s a fascinating look at the topic. The second piece is from my colleague Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco. She writes: Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign has spent the last month unapologetically performing the digital equivalent of dumping buckets of fresh garbage into the trash fire that is internet discourse in 2020, apparently with little or no concern for the toxic side effects. She takes on the Bloomberg campaign\u2019s decision in recent days to publish misleadingly edited video and deliberately fabricate quotes from his opponents. One battle for the Trump administration over the next couple of weeks is their bid to reauthorise some of the expiring provisions under the USA Freedom Act. These include the highly controversial phone records programme known as Section 215 This is the process by which the National Security Agency (NSA) can record the metadata on all incoming or outgoing calls to a specific number. While it doesn\u2019t give the agency access to the contents of the calls, many privacy advocates argue that it gives the state too much intrusive power. The existence of the programme was only made public after the Edward Snowden leaks of classified information. Jordain Carney has a good look at this issue for The Hill this morning. Although the NSA stopped using the system in 2015, they are asking for it to continue to be available to them. There seems to be bipartisan dissent in Congress against the idea. The deadline for reauthorisation is 15 March. Read more - The Hill: Congress eyes killing controversial surveillance program Back to the fall-out from last night\u2019s Democratic debate. With a crowded field it was the last TV opportunity for one of the candidates who isn\u2019t Bernie Sanders to have a break-out moment that could propel them towards next week\u2019s Super Tuesday. That, according to Ryan Lizza in Politico, is not what happened. By the end, it was clear that there was no Bernie slayer at the lecterns in Charleston, someone who alone had the time and skills to convince Democratic voters that the democratic socialist was a radical whose nomination would forfeit the party\u2019s chance to defeat Trump. Lizza has a detailed analysis on how Bloomberg, Biden, Warren and the others had different strategies to set themselves up in opposition to Sanders, all without much joy. Read it here - Politico: A Bernie slayer fails to emerge at Tuesday\u2019s debate The court hearing in London into the US attempt to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is underway again. Journalist James Doleman is tweeting from the court. My colleague Ben Quinn has also been following proceedings - here is his round-up of what took place yesterday. The president is back home - and as expected straight on to the topic of the coronavirus outbreak. He also gave his verdict on last night\u2019s TV debate. There\u2019s been talk this week of Donald Trump conducting some kind of \u2018deep state\u2019 purge of people he feels are anti-Trump in the administration and the civil service, and even that people have been preparing secret hit-lists of staff to target. My colleague Tom McCarthy in New York has more on one of the people who would be involved in the hirings and firings, with a profile of the so-called \u2018Baby-faced assassin\u2019 - 29 year old Johnny McEntee who was recently named White House director for presidential personnel. The sudden conferral on the young McEntee of such broad power over thousands of civil service careers is highly unusual in the history of US government, according to public administration experts. But as Trump winds up his re-election machinery, McEntee\u2019s elevation is only one among dozens of such moves taking place across the executive branch to install Trump loyalists, purge Trump critics and protect the president\u2019s political wellbeing, whatever the cost. You can read Tom\u2019s full profile of the young man who once went viral on social media for trick shots when he was a college football quarterback. \u201cI\u2019m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight,\u201d Sanders joked during the debate: \u201cI wonder why.\u201d With a lead going into Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, Sanders needed a good debate performance to keep his momentum going under the concentrated fire of the other challengers. Opinion - as you\u2019d expect - is divided as to how he managed. The Hill have a wrap of their winners and losers on the night, which puts Elizabeth Warren, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders as the winners. Crucially for Biden their verdict was that he \u201ckept his hopes alive\u201d with one of his strongest debate performances as he faces \u201ca moment of truth\u201d. Read it here - The Hill: Winners and losers from the South Carolina debate\u201d The Washington Post also had a winners and losers list, but they counted Sanders among the losers. They felt he didn\u2019t cope well with the attacks ranged against - although suggest \u201cthe question is whether it\u2019s too little, too late by his opponents.\u201d Read it here - Washington Post: Winners and losers from the South Carolina Democratic debate Everybody seems to agree though that the CBS moderators didn\u2019t cover themselves with glory. \u201cYou think the last four years has been chaotic divisive toxic exhausting. Imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders vs Donald Trump\u201d Pete Buttigieg seemed to be channelling the thoughts of what Bernie Sanders has dismissed as the \u2018Democratic establishment\u2019 with his attack on the Vermont senator at the debate last night. In an apparent reference to Sanders\u2019 comments about Cuba over the weekend, Buttigieg also said \u201cI am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s.\u201d Like most of the challengers for the nomination, his attacks were focussed on Sanders. Elizabeth Warren conceded that \u201cBernie and I agree on a lot of things,\u201d before adding \u201cBut I think I would make a better president than Bernie.\u201d Mike Bloomberg suggested that Russia was interfering in the Democrats selection process in Sanders\u2019 favour in order to engineer a Sanders-Trump election that would see Putin\u2019s preferred candidate re-elected. And Joe Biden attacked the Sanders record on gun ownership legislation. You can watch some of the most pointed attacks in this highlights reel from last night. Good morning. Will last night\u2019s Democratic debate have helped one of the centrist candidates pull ahead of the others to become the main opponent to Bernie Sanders for the nomination? At the moment this photo from the Charleston event seems to sum up the very definition of a \u201ccrowded field\u201d - and it doesn\u2019t even feature Joe Biden, who is polling in first place for Saturday\u2019s primary. There\u2019s plenty of post-debate analysis to sink your teeth into. Here\u2019s the verdict from our panel: And here\u2019s the wrap from my colleague Daniel Strauss, who says: The debate often descended into cross-talk, and even occasional shouting. It was more common for candidates to go over their allotted time than stick to it, and moderators were criticised for their lack of control over proceedings. You can read his full report here. You can also re-watch the debate in full on the CBS News YouTube channel - it gets going about an hour into this video Meanwhile Donald Trump will the early hours in transit from Germany back to the White House after his visit to India. That doesn\u2019t usually stop him commenting on the day\u2019s events, and after some stinging criticism from Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer yesterday, we can probably expect more robust defence from the president on the country\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.",

New Zealand\u2019s exports have taken a major hit since the epidemic, with everything from timber to meat and fruit facing delays and cancellations. Pessimism among New Zealand businesses grew in January as the outbreak caused widespread alarm about the economic outlook, an ANZ Bank survey showed. \u201cOur best hope is that the disruption proves short-lived, but there\u2019s no question the export-oriented economy is reeling,\u201d ANZ chief economist, Sharon Zollner, said in a note on Thursday. Robertson, however, said New Zealand\u2019s economy is in a strong position to respond to the coronavirus. \u201cWe are well prepared to respond to a range of scenarios that could play out,\u201d he said. So far no cases of the virus have been detected in New Zealand, though hundreds of people evacuated from Wuhan and more from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were put into two weeks of quarantine at an air base north of Auckland. A ban on any travellers arriving from mainland China has also been in place since mid February. Universities are lobbying the government to allow Chinese students into the country to resume their tertiary studies, with the sector saying it stands to lose tens of millions of dollars if the travel ban continues into the first semester, disrupting studies. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Monday that the government was considering granting an exemption to Chinese university students, and were in talks with the sector about how they would safely quarantine arriving students. Ardern said the government\u2019s health bodies were in the advanced stages of planning for the virus\u2019s arrival in New Zealand, which the PM and health bodies agree is highly likely at some point. She said there were nine million P2 masks, and general purpose surgical masks available, and since early February the government had received reports of more than 5,000 people self-isolating themselves after returning from, or near, mainland China.",

Border screening is ineffective because carriers can be asymptomatic. Any pandemic outbreak will spread rapidly throughout the Australian community. The population groups at greater risk from seasonal influenza are the elderly, young, people with chronic diseases, and communities with high numbers of at-risk individuals such as Indigenous communities. Multiple pandemic waves are possible. Australia is maintaining a travel ban on visitors from the Chinese mainland. \u201cAs infected travellers may have no symptoms on their arrival into Australia, border screening of incoming passengers is unlikely to be of benefit in preventing a pandemic influenza strain entering the country,\u201d NSW Health says. If and as a pandemic worsens, contingencies could see the ordering of schools closed and of public transport altered in order to implement social distancing measures. Mass gathering events, such as sporting events or concerts, may be cancelled. People may be advised \u2013 or even ordered \u2013 to work from home if possible. People will be forced off work if they are ill, to care for family members, or by advice \u2013 or orders \u2013 to self-isolate. Hospitals may need to set up screening stations outside emergency departments and designate specific \u201cflu areas\u201d within hospitals to ensure coronavirus patients are isolated from others. If hospitals are overrun, operating theatres or general wards could be requisitioned as intensive care surge areas and children may be able to be treated and managed at adult hospitals. \u201cOverflow facilities are used to accommodate patients when it is impractical to manage them at home or in a hospital,\u201d NSW Health says. \u201cHealthcare facilities, including private hospitals, would be used preferentially.

The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning. There are now cases linked to Iran in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman. There are now cases linked to Italy in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland.</p> \n   <p>Yesterday, a joint team between WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control arrived in Rome to review the public health measures that have been put in place and provide technical support. A WHO team will travel to Iran this weekend to provide support.</p> \n   <p>The increase in cases outside China has prompted some media and politicians to push for a pandemic to be declared.

This would make isolation of identified cases more effective at reducing onward spread. </p> \n  <p>The majority of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features. People in at-risk groups and those with comorbidities may experience more severe illness.

      "bodyText": "We have now closed this blog and moved over to a new page. Here\u2019s a summary of recent developments. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new cases. There were 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. There are 334 new cases in South Korea, mostly in Daegu. Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. US vice-president Mike Pence will lead and coordinate the US\u2019s response to the coronavirus. President Donald Trump said the risk to Americans is \u201cvery low\u201d but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn\u2019t think is inevitable, in contradiction to US health authorities who expect to see more cases. Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. US secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, says \u201cwe can expect to see more cases in the US\u201d, and while containment is working, \u201cthe degree of risk can change quickly\u201d. The National Institute of Health said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so will not help this current outbreak, but may assist a seasonal return. The answer right now is containment. Trump said \u201cit\u2019s not the right time\u201d to extend travel restrictions to other affected countries like Italy and South Korea. Stock markets in Asia saw mounting losses on Thursday\u2019s open. Prestigious sporting events are at risk, with organisers of the Six Nations, the Cheltenham Festival, the Giro d\u2019Italia, Euro 202 and the Tokyo Olympics all monitoring the situation. A number of countries have extended travel bans due to virus fears, including Fiji, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. From Reuters: A Korean Air flight attendant who has tested positive for coronavirus had worked on flights between Seoul and Los Angeles, local media reported. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Wednesday that the crewmember had been on a Korean Air KE958 flight from Israel to Incheon on 15-16 February. The passengers included a South Korea tour group from which 31 coronavirus cases were seen to have originated. But it has yet to release details of other routes and flights flown by the employee. Yonhap News Agency and other media said she worked on flights KE017 and KE012 on 19 February and 20 February to and from Los Angeles. Some 30 crewmembers who were on the same flights with her have self-quarantined for 14 days, media reports said. Korean Air has referred all inquiries about the employee\u2019s itinerary to KCDC, as the authority in charge, adding \u201cWe will continue to work closely with the relevant authorities to ensure the safety of our passengers and employees.\u201d Fiji has extended its travel ban due to coronavirus fears. Travellers who have been in Italy, Iran and the South Korean cities of Daegu and Cheongdo will not be permitted to enter Fiji. Visitors who had been in mainland China in the last 14 days have also been forbidden entry into the Pacific nation. There are no suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus in Fiji, but Pacific nations are fearful of how their health systems will cope were the virus to reach their shores. Ian Thorpe, the Australian Olympic swimming legend, says athletes must consider their own health before attending the Tokyo Games this year. Thorpe, whose five Olympic golds make him the most successful Australian Olympian all time, spoke out as concerns mounted about whether the Games in July and August will go ahead because of the coronavirus outbreak. I think the decision should come down to each individual athlete. But whether or not they want to compete, that they should take their health into consideration first. Here\u2019s the full story: New Zealand\u2019s economy is facing a \u201cserious impact\u201d from the virus, according to the finance minister. The country\u2019s lucrative tourism industry is reliant on Chinese visitors \u2013 they spend around NZ$180m a month during the peak holiday period \u2013 but they have dried up as flights have been suspended. Exports such as timber and food have also suffered. Our correspondent Eleanor Aigne Roy has the full story here: NHK is reporting that a Japanese woman who was treated for Covid-19, confirmed as virus-free, and left hospital earlier this month has since retested positive for the disease. According to the report, the woman is a tour-guide in her 40s, in the city of Osaka. She began feeling throat and chest pain about two weeks after leaving hospital, and after several visits to doctors, retested positive for the illness, NHK said. She is now in hospital and has not been to work or in contact with anyone, it said. The article said prefecture authorities believed she had either been reinfected or that the virus had remained in the woman and multiplied. Romania has reported its first case of the virus. The patient is a man who was in contact with an Italian visitor to the country last week, AFP reports. Seven other people who lived at the same address as the patient have all tested negative but emergency department official Raed Arafat said that as a precaution will still be quarantined for two weeks. A large number of the year\u2019s prestigious sporting events are at risk as the coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, with the organisers of the Six Nations, the Cheltenham Festival, the Giro d\u2019Italia, Euro 2020 and the Tokyo Olympics all closely monitoring the situation after a significant increase in the number of cases worldwide. Full report: Losses are mounting on Asian stock markets on Thursday morning. The Nikkei is now down 1.65% in Tokyo while Seoul has dropped 0.6% in the wake of those grim new Covid-19 case numbers from South Korea. In Sydney the ASX200 is off 0.77%. Hong Kong has just opened is down 0.63%. The Shanghai Composite is down 0.8% in the first few minutes of trade. More weak signals from the commodities markets in China where oil and iron ore futures are falling again. The latter is especially bad news for Australia because iron ore is the country\u2019s biggest export. Chinese health authorities have released their figures for the virus\u2019s spread and impact on Wednesday, recording another consecutive drop in both the number of new cases and the number of deaths. By the end of Wednesday, mainland China reported 433 new confirmed cases, and 29 deaths, according to figures from the National Health Commission. 409 of the new cases and 26 of the deaths were in Hubei, the province at the centre of the outbreak. The Hubei city of Wuhan was the site of 383 of the cases and 19 of the deaths). The commission reported 508 new suspected cases across mainland China, bringing that total number to 2,358. The country has reported a total of 78,497 confirmed cases since the known start of the outbreak. There were no new reported cases in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. There\u2019s a blizzard of economic news and comment on coronavirus including Moody\u2019s revising downwards its forecast for car sales around the world from a drop of 0.9% to -2.5%. The rating agency says the outbreak \u201creduces demand and disrupts automotive supply chains\u201d. We expect global auto unit sales to decline 2.5% in 2020, narrowing from a 4.6% drop in 2019, but worsening from the 0.9% decline that we had previously projected for this year. We expect sales to rebound only modestly in 2021, with growth of 1.5%. Our outlook on the sector remains negative. On the general market situation, Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist, CMC Markets and Stockbroking in Sydney, says the virus issue remains \u201cat the heart of market concerns\u201d. Stocks are still struggling but he rings the alarm on an apparent freeze in lending: The most concerning thing is the fact that credit markets froze. In very unusual trading there were no new corporate bonds issued in Europe or the USA. This last occurred on a non-holiday in 2007, just before the global peak in equity markets and the plunge that heralded the GFC. In Australia, BIS Oxford Economics have said that weak capex figures for the fourth quarter released on Thursday morning makes it more likely that the Reserve Bank will have to reduce rates or introduce some kind of monetary easing. The data confirm our view that capex growth this year will be soft, and is very likely to miss the RBA\u2019s forecast \u2013 as the survey was done in Q4 it does not include any additional drag from the coronavirus outbreak. We continue to expect further monetary easing, and the pressure will mount on the government to loosen policy in its May budget. South Korea\u2019s centre for disease control has reported a further 334 new cases of Covid-19, bringing the total to 1,595 in the worst outbreaks outside of mainland China. 307 of the new cases are in Daegu, where the church at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak is located. As flagged earlier this week, South Korea and the US have also decided to indefinitely postpone joint military drills. From Reuters: Growing concerns inside the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank about the spread of the new coronavirus have prompted the institutions to consider scaling back their Spring Meetings in April or hold them by teleconference, people familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday. The institutions\u2019 17-19 April Spring Meetings are scheduled to bring some 10,000 government officials, journalists, business people and civil society representatives from across the globe to a tightly packed, two-block area of downtown Washington, DC, that houses their headquarters. The virus\u2019 spread has raised concerns inside the Fund and the World Bank that the close interactions among people from their 189 member countries at the Spring Meetings could inadvertently contribute to the problem. Officials from both institutions and member governments said that talk of canceling the meetings outright is premature, but they are considering several options to modify them. No decisions have been made, they said, adding that much depends on efforts to contain the virus in the coming days and weeks. Options include scaling back the number of meetings, canceling external events and limiting the size of the country delegations that would travel to Washington. Another alternative is to hold \u201cvirtual\u201d meetings by teleconference, and the institutions could still proceed with full-fledged meetings. OK, that marathon press conference from president Trump is finished. There were some mixed messages. Here\u2019s a quick summary of what we were told, and you can read our full report from Amanda Holpuch here. Vice-president Mike Pence will lead and coordinate the US\u2019s response to the coronavirus. Trump said the risk to Americans is \u201cvery low\u201d but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn\u2019t think is inevitable. Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC said authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. \u201cThe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.\u201d Secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, says \u201cwe can expect to see more cases in the US\u201d, and while containment is working, \u201cthe degree of risk can change quickly\u201d. 15 cases of coronavirus in the US, as well as three cases from Americans repatriated from Wuhan and 42 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Trump says of the 15, eight have returned home, five have fully recovered, one is in hospital, and one is about to go home. Trump defended the low testing rate in the US (fewer than 500 so far). Trump said the illness was \u201clike the flu\u201d, except with far fewer deaths, and people just need to exercise usual hygiene measures like washing their hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a very quick manner.\u201d The National Institute of Health said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so will not help this current outbreak, but may assist a seasonal return. The answer right now is containment. Trump said \u201cit\u2019s not the right time\u201d to extend travel restrictions to other affected countries like Italy and South Korea. Stocks markets in Asia Pacific have slumped again \u2013 not helped by Donald Trump\u2019s mixed messages on the virus just now. The ASX200 in Sydney dropped 0.5% when Trump was speaking. It had started the day flat after three straight days of losses. The S&amp;P500 E-mini futures also dropped 0.3% when the president spoke. In Tokyo, the Nikkei is down 1.1% and in Seoul the Kospi is up 0.17%. Trump defends past comments, an example of which is below, criticising Obama for appointing non-medical health czars. He says it\u2019s different because Ebola was much worse and more fatal, and this is like the flu. He defends not appointing Azar to run point on the US\u2019s response, saying he wants Azar to focus on his complicated work, and that Pence will work closely with Azar. \u201cI don\u2019t want to spare the horses, I have very talented people and I want to use them.\u201d Trump has been rambling a bit, blaming the federal reserve, Boeing, General Motors, and Obama, for drops in the US market. Q: Are you telling Americans, apart from the ones who are sick, not to change any of their behaviours? A: No, you should wash your hands, you don\u2019t have to grab every handrail, he says. Treat it like the flu. Then he tells an anecdote about a man who came up to him to say hello, and hugged Trump, and then said he was very ill, so Trump extricated himself. ~~~ Q: In the course of the last few minutes you have disputed what some of the health officials standing behind you have said. Don\u2019t you trust them? A: I haven\u2019t disputed them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable\u201d that there will be further outbreaks. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance it could get worse, a chance it could get fairly substantially worse, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable.\u201d Italy now has 447 cases of coronavirus, according to a new report by Associated Press. Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte\u2019s government appealed to European neighbours for cooperation, not isolation and discrimination. Twelve people have died amid the country\u2019s struggle to contain the rapidly spreading outbreak. Q: The administration has tested less than 500 people, which has been questioned by health officials, as other countries test thousands. Will the US increase its testing? Trump: \u201cWe\u2019re testing everybody that we need to test and finding very little problem. You treat this like the flu,\u201d he says, telling people to wash hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a very quick manner.\u201d (That vaccine, if successful, is at least 12-18 months away.) \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be panicked,\u201d he says, returning again to those numbers of flu deaths. \u201cThis is a little different... but we have it so well under control and we really have done a very good job.\u201d Asked if financial markets are overreacting, Trump skirts the well-documented impact of the coronavirus on markets around the world: \u201cI think financial markets are very upset when they look at Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools of themselves...I think that has a huge effect.\u201d Meanwhile, the Washington Post is reporting the first case of Covid-19 in the US in a person who has not recently returned from a foreign country or have contact with another confirmed case. We haven\u2019t independently confirmed this. Trump urges people to travel within the US instead of overseas, because of the virus but also because the US is the greatest tourism destination in the world, and then says that even the 15 cases they now have will \u201cin a couple of days be close to zero\u201d. Are there plans prepared for quarantining cities like in Wuhan? There are plans for a large scale response, he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need it but you always have to be prepared.\u201d Trump is being asked about whether the travel ban they placed on people from China would now extend to other countries with outbreaks, like South Korea. \u201cAt a right time we may do it. At the moment it\u2019s not the right time. We are checking people as they come through.\u201d Now he\u2019s asked about why everyone was downplaying the severity of the situation and the need for a czar to be put in charge of the response, only to now announce Pence. He says Pence is in the administration so it\u2019s not a czar position, and that he\u2019ll be coordinating the response and that Indiana (Pence\u2019s state) has a great health system. (Here\u2019s one reaction to that) Dr Anthony Fauci, national institutes of health, is updating reporters about a vaccine. \u201cI told you we would have a vaccine that we\u2019d be putting in to trials to see if it was safe... in about three months... I think it\u2019s going to be closer to two months.\u201d Testing would then take six months, before a trial to determine efficacy. \u201cAt the earliest an efficacy trial would take an addition six to eight months.\u201d So despite the speed of development, it would take up to 18 months before a vaccine was available. \u201cWe can\u2019t rely on a vaccine over the next several months to a year.\u201d The answer right now is containment, although a vaccine could help down the track if the virus made a season return. Anne Schuchat, deputy director at US centers for disease control and prevention, is up now, and urges authorities and organisations to dust off their pandemic preparedness plans. \u201cIt\u2019s a good time for the American public to prepare.\u201d She urges people to take the basic steps of hygiene - wash hands, cover mouth when sneezing, stay home when sick. \u201cThe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain.\u201d Alex Azar, health and human services secretary is up now. He too opens by praising Trump and Pence. Then confirms there are 15 cases of Covid-19, as well as three cases from Americans repatriated from Wuhan, and 42 who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess. The early actions taken by the Trump administration were \u201cappropriate, wise and well calibrated\u201d to the situation. \u201cThis has helped us contain the spread of the virus,\u201d he says. Because of Trump\u2019s leadership, the risk to the US population is low, he says. But then he changes tack, and adds that \u201cwe can expect to see more cases in the United States\u201d. \u201cOur containment strategy has been working but the degree of risk can change quickly.\u201d He urges people and employers to \u201crefresh themselves\u201d about what they could do in the event the situation changes. Trump appears to want to say something behind him but then stops. They will be \u201caggressively transparent\u201d with the American people, Azar says. Pence says he\u2019s met with state leaders and health authorities and \u201cwe\u2019ll be working with them in renewed ways to make sure they have the resources they need to respond\u201d and there will be additional roles created at the White House. Pence praises Trump\u2019s leadership. \u201cWhile the threat to the American public remains low... you have directed this team to take all steps necessary to ensure the health and wellbeing of the American people.\u201d Trump announces that vice president Mike Pence will be in charge of the US\u2019s response, working with health authorities. \u201cWe have no higher priority than the safety, security, and health of the American people,\u201d says Pence. As anticipated, Trump is somewhat talking down the threat of the virus. He says he\u2019s amazed to have recently learned how many people are killed by the flu every year, citing a figure of 25,000 to 69,000 annually. \u201cAnd so far if you look at what we have with the 15 people and they\u2019re recovering, one is pretty sick, but hopefully will recover. But the others are in great shape.\u201d He says the US is \u201cvery very ready\u201d whether it\u2019s a large breakout of the virus or not. He holds up a piece of paper saying it\u2019s a list from Johns Hopkins university of the \u201cbest rated countries in the world\u201d as far as preparation goes, and that the US is top. \u201cThe risk to the American people remains very low,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had tremendous success, tremendous success, beyond what people would have thought. At the same time, you do have some outbreaks in some countries - Italy and various countries are having some difficulties.\u201d Trump says he spoke with president Xi Jinping, and \u201che\u2019s working very hard\u201d. \u201cThe infection seems to have gone down over the last two days [in China].\u201d Trump is up for a press briefing at the White House. He\u2019s begun with a statement of condolence over the shooting in Milwaukee. He says he\u2019s received a briefing from \u201ca great group of talented people\u201d on the virus. He defends the US\u2019s early decision to block the entry of some people coming from affected areas in China. Trump says the number of cases in the US is low and people are getting better. Of the 15 who came from Wuhan he says eight have returned to their homes, one is in hospital and five have fully recovered. One is about to go home, he suggests. Bahrain, which is reporting a growing number of cases, has now suspended flights to and from Iraq and Lebanon, the country\u2019s civil aviation affairs has announced. Saudi Arabia has suspended religious tourists from entering the country. A government statement said it was: \u201cSuspending entry into the Kingdom for the purpose of Umrah and visiting the Prophet\u2019s Mosque temporarily.\u201d It also said it was suspending entry to the Kingdom for people from \u201ccountries in which the new coronavirus (19-COVID) poses a risk\u201d. The Umrah is an Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of the year. Hello this is Helen Davidson in Sydney picking up our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Thanks to Kevin Rawlinson and our team in London for their coverage. We are expecting a news conference shortly from Donald Trump on the coronavirus. The number of Americans infected with the virus stands at 59. Of those 44 returned from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and 14 returned from Wuhan on US evacuation flights. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes the virus situation as \u201crapidly evolving\u201d. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far today: The coronavirus spread continued as a series of countries announced they had detected their first confirmed cases. Pakistan, Georgia and Norway, as well as Norway and Greece, all reported their first cases. The Greek health ministry said the patient was a 38-year-old woman who had recently travelled to northern Italy. Ireland\u2019s rugby union matches against Italy has been called off due to fears about coronavirus.The decision to postpone the men\u2019s fixture on 7 March, the women\u2019s match on 8 March and Under-20s match on 6 March came after the intervention of the Irish government. Donald Trump is to give a news conference on coronavirus later on Wednesday. He suggested the event was planned to counter false claims that have panicked the financial markets. The number of new coronavirus cases reported outside China has exceeded those in the country for the first time. Despite the turning point, the World Health Organization (WHO) has again resisted declaring the outbreak a pandemic. WHO expert who led a delegation to Wuhan has warned countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a pandemic. The virus has infected more than 81,000 people, and killed 2,762, the vast majority of cases in mainland China and in particular Hubei province. South Korea reported a further 284 new coronavirus cases, taking its total to 1,261. The authorities said they planned to test about 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the outbreak. British tourists quarantined in a Tenerife hotel where four former guests tested positive for coronavirus say they are desperate to return to the UK to avoid contracting the disease. They fear that being locked in the four-star hotel means they will face the same outcome as passengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus spread as the boat was quarantined off Yokohama. A hotel in the Austrian city of Innsbruck remains under lockdown after its Italian receptionist tested positive. Authorities say 62 people at Innsbruck\u2019s Europa hotel have been tested for possible infection with the virus, of which 12 have been quarantined for two weeks because they were in close contact with the receptionist. A 12th coronavirus patient in northern Italy has died. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 374, an increase of more than 50 on the day before. Facebook is to ban ads that promise to cure coronavirus or incite panic around the outbreak in its latest attempt to prevent misinformation. The tech firm said it is prohibiting advertising that creates \u201ca sense of urgency\u201d about the Covid-19 illness, such as those that \u201cimply a limited supply, or guarantee a cure or prevention\u201d. The health minister, Matt Hancock, said the government expects the number of cases in the UK to increase. He told the Commons the government had a four-point strategy: contain, delay, research and mitigate. Three more people died in Iran, bringing the total to 16 from almost 100 cases. And Latin America recorded its first case with a patient in Brazil testing positive. Attilio Fontana, the president of Italy\u2019s Lombardy region, said one of his team has tested positive for coronavirus and that he would self-isolate for two weeks. In a video posted on Facebook, he said: The number of cases is still going up; not dramatically but there are additional people who have contracted this virus ... it seems my close associate has been confirmed to have this virus. It\u2019s a person I work with constantly; a brilliant person who helps me a lot. Unfortunately, tests confirmed she was positive for coronavirus. Evidently, all of us in the team, including me, had to have tests and the news is that, for now, we haven\u2019t contracted any type of infection, so we can continue to work to fight against the spread of this virus. I am happy for me and my associates, even if the change from today mean that I too will follow the guidelines of the Higher Health Institute and self-isolate for two weeks, which will \u2013 above all \u2013 protect the people working with me. The Romanian health minister, Victor Costache, has said a man from the southern county of Gorj has become the country\u2019s first case. The man had been in direct contact with an Italian citizen who travelled to Romania earlier this month. He is in a good condition and will be transferred to a Bucharest infectious hospital. A small group of pupils at Prince George and Princess Charlotte\u2019s primary school, Thomas\u2019s Battersea have been sent home as a precautionary measure following a trip to northern Italy. A spokesman for Thomas\u2019s Battersea has said: Like all schools we are taking the potential risks connected with the spread of Covid-19 very seriously and to this end are following government guidance to the letter around both prevention against infection and in dealing with cases where any staff or pupils are suspected of being exposed to the virus or who display any symptoms. We currently have a very small number of pupils who have been tested and these individuals are currently, as per government advice, remaining at home pending the receipt of their test results. All parents have been informed and we have maintained regular communication with our school community to ensure that advice is shared and important information is circulated. We will of course preserve staff and pupil confidentiality and will not be commenting on specific cases. Bahrain has detected seven new cases of coronavirus, taking the number 33, the country\u2019s minister of health has said. And flights to and from Dubai International airport have been suspended for an additional 48 hours, the country\u2019s Civil Aviation Affairs (CAA) has announced. The Norwegian public health agency has confirmed that one person has tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Reuters news agency. The person is being kept isolated at home, having returned from China late last week, authorities say. They did not appear ill initially and were deemed unlikely to infect others, the agency said. Iraq has banned its citizens from traveling to China, Iran and Thailand, as well as South Korea, Japan and Singapore, its health ministry has said. They will also be prevented from traveling to Italy, Kuwait and Bahrain, while the latter two nations have been added to the entry ban list. Public gatherings in places such as cinemas, coffee shops and clubs are also to be banned, while schools and universities will be shut down from 27 February to 7 March. Meanwhile, more has emerged about the first victim to contract the virus in Greece. The 38-year-old, while not publicly named, has been identified as a well-known designer who had travelled to northern Italy to attend Milan\u2019s fashion week. She returned to Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern capital, on a Ryanair flight on Sunday and admitted herself to hospital after beginning to feel unwell on Tuesday. The designer, who has also run for public office, is reported to have travelled to Milan with a group of journalists and several town hall councillors. So far, 15 people \u2013 including members of her family \u2013 have been quarantined for two weeks. But an inquiry is under way as to how many people she has been in contact with. A friend who flew with her on what he described as a \u201cpacked plane\u201d told Live News the woman \u201cseemed fine, we didn\u2019t understand that anything [was wrong] with her\u201d. Greece has assigned 13 state-run hospitals to admit Covid-19 patients. The health minister Vassilis Kikilias, who has rescinded leave for medical workers and doctors across the board, is expected to travel to Thessaloniki tomorrow. Israel has urged its citizens to reconsider all foreign travel, citing the growing spread of the coronavirus outside the country. Two Israelis who returned home after being quarantined in Japan on the Diamond Princess cruise ship are the only confirmed coronavirus cases in Israel, and the ministry has readied quarantine facilities should more infections occur. The Israeli health ministry announced that Israelis returning from Italy would be required to go into quarantine at home for two weeks. Expanding its precautionary steps, the ministry said it was also now urging the public \u201cto reconsider the necessity of flights abroad in general, beyond the required isolation upon return from specific countries\u201d. It said: \u201cThe assessment is that there is a high probability the disease has already spread to other regions of Europe and many other places in the world.\u201d The ministry had already instructed Israelis returning from Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Thailand and South Korea to go into isolation at home for 14 days. The Georgian citizen who has tested positive for coronavirus was travelling from Iran crossed the border from neighbouring Azerbaijan on Tuesday, the country\u2019s health minister, Ekaterine Tikaradze, has said. Tikaradze said the man travelled by mini-bus with other 12 passengers and was immediately taken to hospital from the border checkpoint. The other people on the vehicle were tested and found not to have the virus, though they were held in quarantine nevertheless, she added. The Georgian prime minister, Giorgi Gakharia, has created a group to coordinate actions to try to prevent a disease outbreak in the country, his press service said. The group has decided to suspend travel between Georgia and Iran for two weeks. Here\u2019s a little more detail on the announcement that an 18th person has tested positive for coronavirus in France. The health minister, Olivier Veran, has said: \u201cThere is no epidemic in the country, just isolated cases.\u201d He added that 15 million protection masks would be made available. The health ministry director, Jerome Salomon, said that, out of the 18 cases, two people have died, 12 have recovered and four are still hospitalised. British Airways is cancelling dozens of flights serving Milan due to a drop in demand amid the coronavirus outbreak. The airline announced it was \u201cmerging\u201d some of its flights between Heathrow and the Italian city\u2019s Linate airport. About 22 return flights over the next two weeks are affected. BA flights to and from Milan Malpensa are continuing as normal. A spokesman for the airline said: To match reduced demand due to the continuing coronavirus issue, we are merging a small number of flights to and from Milan. We will be contacting customers on cancelled flights so we can discuss their travel options including alternative British Airways flights within two hours of their original departure time where possible, full refunds or booking for a later date of travel. We understand that some customers flying to/from northern Italy may wish to change their travel plans and have introduced flexible booking options. A further education college has closed its student accommodation and one of its departments as a precaution against Covid-19 spreading after staff and students returned from Italy. Shuttleworth College, part of Bedford College, told students on Wednesday that its outdoor education department would be closed until next week along with residential facilities, after students had been skiing in Piedmont. The college said: On Wednesday 26 February, following Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office advice released the same day, a total of 150 students at the Shuttleworth College campus near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, have been advised to go home and self-quarantine until Sunday evening. This follows a recent trip for a group of students who visited Pila, Italy, as well as a number of residential students who travelled over the half term break and who returned to campus on Sunday 16 February. No students are believed to be suffering symptoms and this is just a precautionary measure. Staff at the college campuses are reminding students, staff and visitors of the health and hygiene precautions to follow and the college remains open to other students. The Shuttleworth students returned from the trip on 16 February, before the 19 February danger period for northern Italy specified by Public Health England. The skiing took place at a resort close to the border with Switzerland, more than 200 km from the hotspots identified by the Italian government. In a sign of colleges and universities looking to avoid further disruption, the University of East Anglia has decided to cancel a student trip to Italy planned for Easter. A group of more than 20 UEA students and staff were to attend an international journalism festival in Perugia in April, but the course director decided to cancel the trip. Meanwhile, more than a dozen schools in the UK have shut because of coronavirus fears. Tudor Grange Academy Kingshurst, a secondary school in Birmingham with 1,500 pupils, announced on Wednesday that it was closing after students returning from a skiing trip to Italy fell ill. Its principal, Darren Turner, told parents: Early this morning, we were informed that six pupils who were on the trip are suffering from flu-like symptoms and so they are self-isolating and getting checked. A teacher who was on the trip is also self-isolating and has been tested. In order to help protect our school community, we took the difficult decision to close the school. Over the next 24-plus hours we will have specialist contractors in to deep-clean the whole school. The Georgian health minister has said the country has identified its first case of coronavirus, increasing the number of countries to which the virus has spread. An 18th case has also been confirmed in France, according to that country\u2019s health minister. A Nottingham-based firm that organises school trips to Italy, Halsbury, has said it took more than 50 groups to the country in the past two weeks; though none had gone to any of the 11 towns now covered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office\u2019s (FCO) advice. About 70 more trips are planned in the coming months and the firm said that, since none of those was heading to one of the quarantined towns either, it did not anticipate any cancellations. It said four groups who were due to travel to China have cancelled their trips, in line with FCO advice. Finland has confirmed its second case of the virus, according to the Finnish News Agency. It said the patient, a woman of \u201cworking age\u201d, was being treated at hospital in the capital Helsinki. She had travelled recently to Milan, in Italy. The news site Iltalehti said it was Finland\u2019s second case after an earlier case was confirmed in Lapland. Iran has imposed travel restrictions and suspended Friday prayers in areas hit by the virus. The official death toll from the virus currently stands at 19, with 139 confirmed cases. But there are fears these figures mask the true scale of the outbreak after a reformist website reported 50 deaths linked to the virus. A senior health official has confirmed Pakistan\u2019s first two diagnosed cases of coronavirus. Dr Zafar Mirza, special assistant to the prime minister on health, tweeted: One of the cases was detected in Pakistan\u2019s largest city, Karachi, a provincial official said earlier. The patient had travelled to Iran. It is not clear where the second infected person was based, or if they too had travelled to Iran. The Geneva International Motor Show, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, is set to go ahead next week, despite the advice of experts to cancel such events to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The organiser, Palexpo SA, has said it will ask exhibitors from at-risk areas to run \u201cnecessary checks\u201d to avoid spreading the virus. Switzerland confirmed its first case today linked to the outbreak in neighbouring Italy. The show takes place near the headquarters of the World Health Organization, which is currently trying to coordinate efforts to stop the spread of the disease. Prof Marc Lipsitch, the director of Harvard University\u2019s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, has urged organisers to continue cancelling large international events. Writing on his blog this week, he said: Most things we can do to slow the virus\u2019s spread \u2013 isolation, quarantine, social distancing, canceling public gatherings, treating cases with antivirals if these are proven \u2013 are temporary \u2013 once let up, transmission can resurge. And Prof Marcel Salath\u00e9, an epidemiologist at the Swiss EPFL institute, had a similar message: Pakistan has reported its first case of coronavirus, according to local media. The patient, a 22-year-old from Karachi, had recently returned from Iran. Russia has become the latest country to advise its citizens against travelling to Italy. The opening three races of the Formula One season are coming under increasing threat of cancellation as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread outside China. The Chinese Grand Prix has already been postponed but the spread of the virus in Italy and Japan has resulted in concern that the meetings in Australia, Bahrain and Vietnam may also be affected. On Wednesday, Ferrari announced the suspension of non-critical business travel as well as the restriction of external access to its factory in Maranello, located 140km from the centre of the outbreak in Italy, Codogno. A British couple quarantined in Costa Adeje Palace hotel, in Tenerife, have put out a video appeal to Boris Johnson to bring them home. In the video, broadcast by the BBC, Mandy Davis said: Nobody, not the hotel, not the Foreign Office, not the Spanish people. Nobody knows what the right thing to do is, because nobody\u2019s had this virus before. So please, let\u2019s sort something out, come and rescue us please Boris. And let\u2019s just get the hell out of here. Speaking alongside her husband, Roger, Davis added: I can assure you that we are cleaner than the people at home sitting on buses, trains, planes and whatever, because everything here has been sanitised over and over again. A 60-year-old teacher who fell ill with coronavirus has become the second fatality in France from the illness, AFP reports. The man died overnight in a hospital in the capital, bringing the coronavirus death toll in the country to two, said the health ministry\u2019s deputy head, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon. The first victim was an 80-year-old Chinese tourist who died in hospital in mid-February. The teacher, who worked at a junior high school in the town of Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois, about 80 km (50 miles) north-east of Paris, had not travelled to an area affected by the global coronavirus outbreak, said Etienne Champion, the director general of the health agency of the Hauts-de-France region. After feeling unwell he stopped work on 12 February, at the start of the mid-term school holidays. He was tested for the coronavirus in the emergency ward of a Paris hospital on Tuesday, shortly before he died. Apart from the teacher, France has reported four other new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: two in people returning from the Lombardy region of Italy, at the centre of Europe\u2019s biggest outbreak of the disease. Eleven people have recovered in France, bringing the total of diagnosed cases in the country to 17. Among the four still in hospital, a 55-year-old man from the same region as the teacher was in a serious condition in hospital, said Champion. A British teacher, living in a Chinese \u201cghost town\u201d, has been sharing video blogs of life at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. Ardit Ajeti, 24, from Wimbledon, in south-west London, was living and working as a PE teacher in Guangzhou when the virus outbreak resulted in the entire city being placed on lockdown. He says the Chinese government has forbidden residents from leaving the city after it was placed into a 14-day quarantine on Wednesday. Although supermarkets are not experiencing food shortages, restaurants have been banned from opening, with only takeaways and grocery stores allowed to sell food. Residential areas have been cordoned off, and citizens have to go through temperature checks before being allowed in and out of certain parts of the city. Videos posted on Ajeti\u2019s YouTube site show him exploring the city, with normally busy areas completely empty. Speaking to PA Media, he said: \u201cAll the facilities are closed, I\u2019ve not been able to go to the gym because they want everyone to avoid having close contact, so have just been working out at home. \u201cAt first, I was a bit worried; however, I think now I am getting used to it and it seems quite normal. The officials are not being horrible, they are just doing their jobs. \u201cSome schools are saying they will now not open until May, and universities have transitioned to teaching online. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be social, as all the bars and restaurants are closed.\u201d Although his school is closed and Ajeti is no longer able to teach, he said the Chinese government confirmed everyone would still be paid their full salaries. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has clarified advice on travel to Italy following the coronavirus deaths in the north of the country, after he was accused of creating confusion for British tourists. On Tuesday, when asked whether he would travel to the Lombardy region, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not planning to go, put it that way.\u201d His comments attracted criticism that he was contradicting official UK government advice that people should only avoid travel to towns in Lombardy that are under confinement. Giving an update to MPs on Wednesday, Hancock was asked by the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, about the \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d. Hancock replied: \u201cAll but essential travel is not recommended to the quarantined areas in northern Italy and the advice for those returning from northern Italy is very clear, which is if you are coming back from the quarantined areas then please self-isolate and if you\u2019re coming back from the whole of northern Italy then please self-isolate if you have symptoms. I hope that advice is clear.\u201d Ireland\u2019s Six Nations rugby matches against Italy in Dublin on the weekend of 6-8 March have been postponed \u2013 and possibly cancelled \u2013 because of the coronavirus outbreak. Philip Browne, the chief executive of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU), announced the decision on Wednesday afternoon after meeting a delegation of health officials led by the health minister, Simon Harris. Browne said: \u201cWe were then advised, formally, that the National Public Health Emergency team has determined that the series of matches should not proceed, in the interests of public health. The IRFU is perfectly happy to comply with this instruction.\u201d He added that the 7 March men\u2019s game at the Aviva Stadium as well as the women\u2019s match on 8 March and an Under-20s Six Nations fixture between the countries on 6 March may be held later: \u201cWe will immediately begin to work with our Six Nations partners to look at the possibility of rescheduling those matches. I would hope to have an update on that in the coming days.\u201d The IRFU had been expected to act after Harris said on Tuesday that Italy\u2019s multiplying cases of coronavirus made the games \u2013 which would draw thousands of Italian fans to Dublin \u2013 too risky. He had said: \u201cThe very clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game should not go ahead, that it would constitute a very significant risk,\u201d said Harris. What you need to know if you are told to self-isolate or your child is sent home from school: The Queen\u2019s granddaughter Zara Phillips and her husband, the former England rugby player Mike Tindall, will not be self-isolating despite returning from a skiing trip in northern Italy, where a coronavirus outbreak has been spreading. Phillips and Tindall were skiing in Bormio, a town in the Lombardy region of the Alps in northern Italy. The couple\u2019s management said the pair were following government guidelines and medical advice, although they currently did not have any symptoms of the infection and so would not be going into self-isolation. Here\u2019s a summary of events so far today: Ireland\u2019s rugby union matches against Italy has been called off due to fears about coronavirus. The decision to postpone the men\u2019s fixture on 7 March, the women\u2019s match on 8 March and Under-20s match on 6 March came after the intervention of the Irish government.

WHO expert who led a delegation to Wuhan has warned countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a pandemic. The virus has infected more than 81,000 people, and killed 2,762, the vast majority of cases in mainland China and in particular Hubei province. South Korea reported a further 284 new coronavirus cases, taking its total to 1,261. The authorities said they planned to test about 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the outbreak. British tourists quarantined in a Tenerife hotel where four former guests tested positive for coronavirus say they are desperate to return to the UK to avoid contracting the disease. They fear that being locked in the four-star hotel means they will face the same outcome as passengers onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus spread as the boat was quarantined off Yokohama. A hotel in the Austrian city of Innsbruck remains under lockdown after its Italian receptionist tested positive. Authorities say 62 people at Innsbruck\u2019s Europa hotel have been tested for possible infection with the virus, of which 12 have been quarantined for two weeks because they were in close contact with the receptionist. Greece has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus. The Greek health ministry said the patientwas a 38-year-old woman who had recently travelled to northern Italy. A 12th coronavirus patient in northern Italy has died. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 374, an increase of more than 50 on the day before.

He told the Commons the government had a four-point strategy: contain, delay, research and mitigate. Three more people died in Iran, bringing the total to 16 from almost 100 cases. And Latin America recorded its first case with a patient in Brazil testing positive. The decision to cancel Ireland\u2019s games against Italy came after the intervention of Ireland\u2019s health minister, Simon Harris, who told RTE news: \u201cThe very clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game should not go ahead and that it would constitute a significant risk, because a very large number of people will be travelling from what is now an affected region. So my department will be contacting the IRFU [Irish Rugby Football Union] in relation to this.\u201d Ireland\u2019s rugby matches against Italy have been cancelled over fears about coronavirus. The 7 March men\u2019s game at the Aviva Stadium as well as the women\u2019s match on 8 March and an Under-20s Six Nations fixture between the countries on 6 March may be staged later in the year. Nigel Scotland, one of the tourists in quarantine at a hotel in Tenerife, said many of his fellow guests were ignoring the advice to stay in their rooms. \u201cI counted 268 people on sun beds,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One. He said he also saw people swimming in the hotel pool. Another guest, Harley Mitford, told the Guardian he had seen guests swimming in face masks. Like Mitford, Scotland said he had not been contacted by UK officials despite Matt Hancock\u2019s claim that the Foreign Office had been in touch with the guests. He said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything. Our great hope would be to be flown home quickly, because we probably have to do another 14 days of self-isolation when we get back.\u201d Scotland added: \u201cStrictly speaking we\u2019re supposed to be in our rooms. My wife and I were visited by the doctor about half an hour. The rooms are quite small and you begin to feel confined and a bit trapped.\u201d British tourists quarantined in a Tenerife hotel where four former guests tested positive for coronavirus say they are desperate to return to the UK to avoid contracting the disease. They fear that by being locked in the four-star hotel they will face the same outcome as passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the virus spread as the boat remained quarantined off Yokohama. A lockdown was imposed on the 700 guests at the Costa Adeje Palace in La Caleta after an Italian doctor, who had stayed at the hotel was confirmed to have caught the virus on Monday night. He is being treated in isolation in hospital along with his wife and two other Italians in his travel group, who have since also tested positive. Harley Mitford, a student who checked into the hotel with his sister and stepfather on Monday, said he believed the quarantine was putting them at risk of contracting the disease. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: \u201cThe Italian guy who was infected had left before we came, so if they let us go, we couldn\u2019t have come into contact with him. \u201cIf we\u2019re kept in we\u2019re more likely to come into contact with people who came into contact with him. It\u2019s counterintuitive, and it\u2019s exactly what happened on the cruise ship.\u201d Here\u2019s video of Hancock\u2019s statement to the Commons: Donald Trump has announced he is to stage a news conference at the White House on coronavirus, to counter what he claims are efforts by news organisations to stoke fears over the scale of the outbreak. Two primary schools in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and one in Old Windsor, Berkshire, have closed over coronavirus outbreak fears, reports Richard Adams, the Guardian\u2019s education editor. The two schools in Spalding are in a federation and have posted the same notice on their websites: The school is closed as a precautionary measure because of a potential connection to the coronavirus by an individual within the school. The individual has been isolated and is being tested. Following advice from the Department of Health the school is being deep cleaned before reopening. St Peter\u2019s C of E middle school in Old Windsor \u2013 near Legoland \u2013 shut on Wednesday for deep cleaning. Andy Snipp, the headteacher, wrote on the school\u2019s Facebook page: I received information late last night that one of our students had returned from a half term break to a location which is broadly part of an affected area. Following the recent advice from the government and after speaking to the trust and members of the governing body, I took the decision as headteacher that we required a further anti-bacterial clean this morning and I would not have the available time and resources to complete this whilst also accommodating staff and students on site. In my opinion this was the correct and only course of action. Meanwhile King Edward VI Five Ways grammar school, in Birmingham, has said three staff are home with flu-like symptoms following a skiing trip to the Italian Alps, although it says the trip didn\u2019t go through the affected regions. A letter to parents said that three members of staff were absent from school with flu-like symptoms, and asked parents to keep their children away from lessons if they felt unwell. My colleague Andrew Sparrow, over on the politics live blog, has taken down the details of a statement made in the House of Commons by Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on coronavirus. Hancock says there have been 13 cases of the virus in the UK. Eight of those people have been discharged, he says. But the government expects more cases to arise, he says. He says the government has a four-point strategy for dealing with this: contain, delay, research and mitigate. He says the government will be rolling out a publicity campaign soon. Advice for travellers coming back to the UK from northern Italy and some other countries was published on Tuesday. He says the government is coordinating with its international partners to ensure it it ready for all eventualities. Responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, Hancock thanks Ashworth, and other MPs, for taking a responsible and proportionate approach. There are plans in place in case of the virus becoming a pandemic, he says. But he says the government is still working on the basis of plans to contain the virus. He says people should only travel to the quarantined areas in Italy if their travel is essential. He says it is important that the government is not advising the blanket closure of schools. Testing sites are available at all A&amp;E facilities in England, he says. But he says the NHS also wants to introduce home testing for the virus. That will allow the government to roll out testing for a much wider group of people, he says. The first person to have tested positive for Covid-19 in Greece is doing well, doctors say. The 38-year-old woman, who recently travelled to northern Italy where she is believed to have contracted the virus, is likely to spend weeks undergoing treatment in the specialist ward of Thessaloniki\u2019s Ahepa hospital, said Sotiris Tsiodras, heading the contagious diseases team at the ministry of health. Her relatives have been placed in quarantine, while an inquiry is under way to ascertain who she has been in contact with. \u201cThe young woman is in good condition and is being watched by a team of excellent doctors,\u201d Tsiodras told a packed news conference, emphasising how vital it was that people kept to basic hygiene rules such as regularly washing their hands. \u201cThose who have come from affected areas of northern Italy must stay at home and monitor their health and in the event of symptoms inform their doctor,\u201d he said, adding that the woman was otherwise in good health. Greek schoolchildren who had been travelling in Italy at the time of the outbreak continued to be brought back to Greece on Wednesday. There are concerns that after years of steep budget cuts as a result of its long-running debt crisis, Greece\u2019s public health system will struggle to cope if the disease cannot be contained. \u201cEveryone knows that our public hospitals are not in the best way,\u201d Andreas Mendis, of the country\u2019s Pasteur Institute, told local TV. \u201cBut on issues of public health we have a good record.\u201d Alarmed by the spread of the virus across Europe and in parts of the neighbouring Balkans, the Greek government announced an array of preventative measures on Tuesday. They include Greek authorities having the right to use private clinics and their medical services if needed to curb the disease. Authorities in the Canary islands have said guests at a Tenerife hotel which hosted an Italian couple who tested positive for coronavirus must be isolated for 14 days. Hundreds of tourists remained confined to the hotel for a second straight day on Wednesday as a precaution. The Italian doctor and his wife who tested positive were already in quarantine at a Tenerife hospital. Eight other Italians who travelled with them were showing no symptoms, according to reports. British holidaymakers are among those stuck at the four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace, in the south-west of the island. Relatives of an 82-year-old British widower, Alan Cunliffe, a retired builder from Wigan, have raised concerns after guests were sent a letter saying the hotel is \u201cclosed down\u201d and they must remain in their rooms until further notice. Jon Butler, Cunliffe\u2019s nephew, said: My uncle is stuck in the hotel currently on lockdown due to the coronavirus. He was supposed to be flying home on Friday. He\u2019s 82 and is there all alone. He has been stuck in his room all day without any information, no food, only water and is very concerned. He has not been contacted by the Foreign Office or any other officials, it seems and is in total limbo. Nor has the hotel or their staff been any help at all. Donald Trump has praised his health secretary and the Centres for Disease Control for doing \u201ca great job with respect to coronavirus!\u201d Facebook is banning ads that promise to cure coronavirus or incite panic around the outbreak in its latest attempt to prevent misinformation, PA Media reports. The tech firm said it is prohibiting advertising that creates \u201ca sense of urgency\u201d about the Covid-19 illness, such as those that \u201cimply a limited supply, or guarantee a cure or prevention\u201d. This includes ads for face masks that claim to be 100% guaranteed to prevent the spread of the virus. The rules also extend to those trying to sell related items on the social network\u2019s Marketplace platform. Facebook is already cracking down on posts that promote fake miracle cures for coronavirus, such as false suggestions that drinking bleach is a solution. A Facebook spokesman said: While we allow people to buy and sell masks on Facebook, we are taking a closer look at this group. We recently implemented a policy to prohibit ads that refer to the coronavirus and create a sense of urgency, like implying a limited supply, or guaranteeing a cure or prevention. French authorities are urgently trying to trace the source of the coronavirus infection that claimed the life of a 60-year-old citizen who died over night in the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital, in Paris, as five new infections were reported in the country. According to officials the individual had not travelled to either China or northern Italy. The French fatality was identified as a teacher from L\u2019Oise region, in northern France, who suffered a massive pulmonary embolism as a result of the virus. The teacher is the second infection identified in the L\u2019Oise region. There have been more new detections of coronavirus outside China than inside, in a major turning point in the international spread of Covid-19, the World Health Organization reports. In his opening remarks in a briefing on Covid-19, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the WHO, highlighted what appeared to be a slowing in the rate of new infections inside China, where the outbreak began, as well as a number of countries that appeared to have nipped incipient outbreaks in the bud. He said: Yesterday, the number of new cases reported outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time. The sudden increases of cases in Italy, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Republic of Korea are deeply concerning. There are now cases linked to Iran in Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait and Oman. There are now cases linked to Italy in Algeria, Austria, Croatia, Germany, Spain and Switzerland. Yesterday, a joint team between WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control arrived in Rome to review the public health measures that have been put in place and provide technical support. A WHO team will travel to Iran this weekend to provide support. The increase in cases outside China has prompted some media and politicians to push for a pandemic to be declared. We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic without a careful and clear-minded analysis of the facts. WHO has already declared a public health emergency of international concern \u2013 our highest level of alarm. Using the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralysing systems. It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true. We are in a fight that can be won if we do the right things. Algeria is not planning to ban public protests or suspend flights to Italy after the country\u2019s first case of the coronavirus was identified in an Italian man, a health ministry official was reported as saying by Reuters on Wednesday. Speaking at a news conference in Algiers, Djamel Fouar, the director of prevention and control of communicable diseases, said authorities were monitoring everyone who had had been in contact with the 61-year-old patient. The man is from Milan, in northern Italy, the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak, and travelled through Algiers to Ouargla, in southern Algeria, a centre for the oil and gas industry. Asked about a possible suspension of flights or a bar on the mass weekly protests that have rocked Algeria for more than a year, Fouar said such measures were \u201cnot on the agenda\u201d. However, he said authorities would reinforce controls on planes arriving in Algeria, particularly those coming from Italy. Irish rugby officials are expected to bow to pressure to cancel a Six Nations game between Ireland and Italy because of the coronavirus outbreak. There is also speculation that some St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations will be cancelled or restricted, Rory Carroll, our Ireland correspondent, reports. Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) representatives are due to meet the health minister, Simon Harris, at 12.30pm on Wednesday to discuss his recommendation to scrap the 7 March game against Italy at the Aviva stadium in Dublin. The IRFU requested the meeting to clarify \u201cspecific reasoning\u201d for the recommendation, which followed fresh National Public Health Emergency Team advice on travel and mass gatherings. Several thousand fans from Italy, which has reported more than 280 cases, were expected to travel to Dublin for the match. \u201cThe very clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game should not go ahead, that it would constitute a very significant risk,\u201d said Harris. The sport minister, Shane Ross, told RTE on Wednesday that cancelling the game would be disappointing but necessary and wise. The chief medical officer at the department of health, Tony Holohan, said other mass gatherings such as St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations on 17 March would be reviewed. St Patrick\u2019s festival organisers said in a statement: \u201cWe follow the advice and direction of relevant authorities in all matters of public safety.\u201d Parents whose children have been sent home from school over fears of the potential spread of coronavirus have been getting in touch with the Guardian. One mother told my colleague Molly Blackall that her daughters had just returned from a skiing trip to northern Italy, the European region worst-affected so far by the outbreak. Kate\u2019s* two daughters have been sent home from their school in Middlesbrough after two students returned from a school skiing trip in Italy with symptoms of coronavirus. As the school bus returned to the UK, parents were texted to say that the school would be closing and undergoing a deep clean. It was set to reopen on Monday, but this has been pushed back to Tuesday. \u201cBecause of the deep clean, there\u2019s nobody at the school at all to answer calls or give information, and there\u2019s no information on the website,\u201d Kate said. \u201cI need to know if my daughter is going to be sat in a classroom with kids who have tested positive.\u201d Kate\u2019s daughters are getting information from other children on group chats and social media, and are becoming scared about the spread of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of information across the country as a whole. It\u2019s made me paranoid,\u201d Kate added. * Not her real name Gwyneth Paltrow has shared a photograph of herself with a mask covering her mouth as she travelled to Paris. The actress \u2013 who starred in the 2011 thriller Contagion, about a deadly virus that swept the world \u2013 wrote on Instagram: \u201cEn route to Paris. Paranoid? Prudent? Panicked? Placid? Pandemic? Propaganda? Paltrow\u2019s just going to go ahead and sleep with this thing on the plane. \u201cI\u2019ve already been in this movie. Stay safe. Don\u2019t shake hands. Wash hands frequently.\u201d A government test in Brazil has confirmed the first case of coronavirus in Latin America, a source told Reuters on Wednesday. Brazil\u2019s health ministry declined to comment on the result of the test ahead of a news conference at 11am local time (1400 GMT), the agency reported. A person familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the results were not yet public. A 12th person has died in northern Italy of coronavirus, while the number of confirmed cases has risen to 374, an increase of more than 50 on the day before, the head of the civil protection agency said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. Angelo Borrelli told reporters the latest fatality was male and aged 69. All those who have died so far in the outbreak in Italy, which came to light on Friday, have been elderly and most had underlying health problems. Greece has reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus, according to AFP. A spokesman for the Greek health ministry said the patient, a 38-year-old woman who had recently travelled to northern Italy, was in a Thessaloniki hospital and in good condition. It comes after Greek authorities outlined the measures the country would take in the event of a mass outbreak, including a shutdown of public areas and travel restrictions. The measures, contained in a government decree, include temporary travel bans to and from countries with a large number of infections and enable beds to be requisitioned in hotels and private clinics. The decree also foresees the temporary closure of \u201cindoor public gathering areas\u201d such as schools, places of worship, cinemas, theatres, sports halls and businesses. \u201cWe are ready to do whatever is necessary to protect public health,\u201d said government spokesman Stelios Petsas. The German government sees no need to advise its citizens against travel to Italy, which has become a new frontline in the global outbreak of coronavirus, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are far from this scenario,\u201d the spokesman told a regular government news conference when asked about whether a travel warning was needed, according to a Reuters report. A government spokesman said the outbreak in Italy presented Europe with a new situation. Germany was working closely with its European partners to try to prevent the spread of the disease, he said. Nick Robinson, the BBC presenter, is beginning 48 hours of self-isolation while he awaits the results of a coronavirus test after returning from holiday in south-east Asia. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement on coronavirus after 12.30pm, according to a post on our politics liveblog. In an interesting reversal, travellers entering Beijing will be subject to 14 days quarantine if they have been to countries seriously impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The city\u2019s health commission spokesman, Gao Xiaojun, outlined the new rules at a press briefing on Wednesday. The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 80,000 people worldwide, the vast majority of them in China. There have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 16 in Iran and 11 in Italy, according to a Reuters tally. A hotel in the Austrian city of Innsbruck remains under lockdown after its Italian receptionist tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief, reports. The woman and her partner, both 24 and from Bergamo, in Lombardy, had driven to Innsbruck last Friday and contacted a clinic after coming down with a fever on Sunday. Authorities say 62 people at Innsbruck\u2019s Europa hotel have been tested for possible infection with the virus, of which 12 have been quarantined for two weeks because they were in close contact with the couple. All 62 people were reportedly in good health and the Italian couple\u2019s temperatures had subsided, health authorities in the Tyrol region said. The Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, had stayed at the same hotel in Innsbruck last Tuesday, the Kleine Zeitung newspaper reported on Wednesday, before the Italian receptionist had returned from Lombardy. Overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday, a 56-year-old Italian woman from Udine died while holidaying in the town of Bad Kleinkirchheim, Carinthia, in Austria. Austrian media reported doctors were testing whether the woman had been infected with the virus. In Vienna, a school was evacuated on Wednesday morning after it emerged that one of its teachers could have caught the virus while holidaying in northern Italy, Kronen Zeitung newspaper reported. Two cases of Corona virus have been confirmed in Germany. A 25-year-old man from the town of G\u00f6ppingen, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in the south-west of the country, was reported on Tuesday evening to have caught the virus on a trip to northern Italy. The man was said not to be in a serious condition. In the large state of North-Rhine Westphalia, a 47-year-old man was reported to be seriously ill with pneumonia after coming into contact with the virus. The man, who is believed to have a recent history of illness, is being monitored on an isolated unit in D\u00fcsseldorf. Spain has reported another case of coronavirus - the second in the Madrid area - bringing the total number of cases here to eight, Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, reports. The latest case once again concerns a person who had recently travelled to northern Italy, the location of Europe\u2019s biggest outbreak of the virus. As well as the two cases in Madrid, there are four cases in Tenerife - where hundreds of guests and staff remain under quarantine in a hotel - one in Barcelona and another in Valencia. Two people who tested positive for the virus in Mallorca and the Canaries a few weeks ago have now been given the all-clear. The medical director of Public Health England, Paul Cosford, has confirmed that the health agency is not advising that English schools shut over fears of a coronavirus outbreak. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday morning: Schools have to take difficult decisions given the complexity of issues that they are facing. What I would say is that our general advice is not to close schools. What we are clear about is if you have been in the area of northern Italy of concern and you have symptoms - it is a cough, shortness of breath or fever - then you do need to self-isolate, you need to phone NHS 111 and await advice for further assessment or testing. Of course if you\u2019ve been to one of the specific towns that are identified by the Italian government and essentially closed down, then our advice and requirement is to self-isolate anyway. Public Health England was available to talk to schools about their \u201cspecific circumstances\u201d and \u201chelp them make the right decisions for them\u201d, he said. A Chinese national with coronavirus is facing up to six months in jail in Singapore after being charged with allegedly giving false information about his whereabouts in the city, according to a Reuters report. Singapore\u2019s health ministry said it had charged the 38-year-old man from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus first surfaced late last year, and his wife who resides in Singapore for allegedly providing false information to authorities about their movements. The husband had been confirmed to be infected with the virus in late January, and has since recovered, while his wife had been quarantined due to her close contact with him. The health ministry said \u201cdetailed investigations\u201d had established their true movements and they were charged \u201cin view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information...and the risk they could have posed to public health\u201d. Charges under the Infectious Diseases Act are rare and this is the first case during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore. First time offenders under the Act can be fined up to S$10,000 ($7,147) or imprisoned for six months, or both. There is outrage brewing in Vietnam over the behaviour of a group of South Korean tourists from Daegu, at the centre of the their country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, who caused a fuss when Vietnamese authorities tried to put them in quarantine. The story, so far as I can gather from tweets with the hashtag #apologizeVietNam, is that after the South Korean tourists arrived in Vietnam they refused quarantine at the local specialist hospital, forcing authorities to instead isolate them in a four-star hotel. To add insult to injury, when the group returned to South Korea, they criticised the Vietnamese hospitality, in particular deriding the local speciality b\u00e1nh m\u00ec as \u201cjust some pieces of bread\u201d. Authorities in western Germany said on Wednesday that a man who contracted Covid-19 is in a critical condition and has been taken to a specialist hospital in D\u00fcsseldorf, the Associated Press reports. The health ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia state said the man was first hospitalised on Monday with serious pneumonia in the town of Erkelenz, near the Dutch border. He was then diagnosed with the virus and isolated in an intensive care unit before being transported to D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s University hospital. The man\u2019s wife was also isolated on suspicion of contracting the virus after showing symptoms. A German news agency reported that the man was in his 40s and had a pre-existing condition. Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index of the biggest companies listed in London has hit a new one-year low at the start of trading, writes Graeme Wearden, on the Guardian\u2019s business desk. Rising fears over Covid-19 have pushed the blue-chip index down by another 39 points, or 0.5%, to 6978 points at the start of trading. That\u2019s its lowest level since February 2019. Travel companies are leading the fallers, again, with the holiday firm TUI and budget airline easyJet both losing 3%. This means the FTSE 100 has fallen more than 5% this week, wiping out more than \u00a3100bn of value, as investors have been spooked by the surge in the number of coronavirus infections around the world. Our business liveblog has more details: The number of coronavirus cases continues to leap in South Korea, according to Reuters. The country has reported a further 115 infections on Wednesday afternoon, on top of the 169 new cases reported on Wednesday morning. The country\u2019s total tally of Covid-19 patients is now 1,261, according to Korea\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department for Education and Public Health England have issued updated advice for schools and colleges in England, following a number of schools sending staff and students home to self-isolate after returning from northern Italy, Richard Adams, the Guardian\u2019s education editor, reports. The area including Milan is mostly classed as \u201ccategory 2\u201d by Public Health England in terms of Covid-19 risk. The detailed advice states in part that students returning from the region without symptoms should continue going to school as normal. This is an extract from the updated advice: What to do if a pupil, student or staff member has travelled from a Category 2 specified country/area in the last 14 days If they are currently well: They are advised to self-isolate only if they develop symptoms. They can continue to attend work or education. They do not need to avoid contact with other people. Their family do not need to take any precautions or make any changes to their own activities.

Leaders of the Philippine church have urged priests to adapt the Ash Wednesday rite in order to reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus, AFP reports. Filipinos marked the holy day with a bow and a sprinkling of dust instead of a cross being daubed on their foreheads by priests. Churches have also discouraged worshippers from holding hands during mass. \u201cIt makes me feel safe,\u201d said Wendy Tamidles, a 19-year-old student, who was among thousands of people, some wearing surgical masks, who lined up at Baclaran church in Manila for services on Wednesday. There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Philippines, and one death. The Philippines is overwhelmingly Catholic, with 80%t of its people said to be believers. Local church officials have also \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that Catholics do not kiss or touch the cross during Good Friday services, which is usually common practice. \u201cWe are being cautious so that the coronavirus won\u2019t spread,\u201d said Victorino Cueto, the rector of Baclaran church. The Scottish government announced last night it was stepping up its preparations for an outbreak, after the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, chaired a resilience meeting to discuss preparations. The health secretary, Jeane Freeman, said it was \u201cexpecting an outbreak\u201d in Scotland but stressed the risk to individuals was low and that all tests so far had come back negative. A total of 412 people have been tested for the virus in Scotland so far. Preparations include: Establishing two testing laboratories in Glasgow and Edinburgh to speed up identification of confirmed cases. Supplying GPs\u2019 surgeries with face masks and ensuring hospitals are fully stocked with personal protective equipment. Updating public health legislation to make coronavirus a notifiable disease, thus requiring doctors to inform health boards about any cases of the disease. Several schools in the UK have closed today, while others have sent pupils home for fear they may have been exposed to coronavirus during ski trips to northern Italy, PA Media reports. Travellers returning from that part of the world have been told they may need to self-isolate and Public Health England announced that flu patients will now be assessed for coronavirus to see if it is spreading. Cransley School in Northwich, Cheshire, and Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough on Tuesday announced they would be closed for the rest of the week to carry out a \u201cdeep clean\u201d after pupils and teachers had returned from ski trips in northern Italy. Trinity Catholic College said a \u201csmall number of staff and pupils\u201d had started showing mild flu-like symptoms following their trip. Lutton St Nicholas and Gedney Church End primary schools in Lincolnshire also said they had closed \u201cbecause of a potential connection to the coronavirus by an individual within the school\u201d and St Christopher\u2019s C of E High School in Accrington told parents it would be shut on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Sandbach High School in Cheshire said students and staff who visited Aprica, in Italy\u2019s Lombardy region, were to stay indoors and self-isolate. A third Cheshire school, Brine Leas School in Nantwich, said its sixth form was closed due to staff shortages following government advice regarding travel to Italy. Students from Penair School in Truro, Cornwall, Salendine Nook High School in Huddersfield, Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School in West Derby and Newquay Tretherras in Newquay, have also been advised to stay home after returning from ski trips. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said official advice has been changed to say people who have been to anywhere in Italy north of Pisa should self-isolate if they develop flu-like symptoms on their return to the UK. Britons who have been in locked-down regions of Italy \u2013 including Lombardy and Veneto \u2013 were told they should self-isolate at home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms. Hello, this is Damien Gayle taking the reins of the coronavirus blog from London, where we are beginning to see commuters on our public transport systems wearing face masks as fear of the outbreak spreads. As usual, as well as the Guardian\u2019s network of correspondents, social media and news wires, I\u2019ll be relying on your tips, questions and suggestions to shape the day\u2019s live coverage. So please feel free to drop me a line at damien.gayle@gmail.com, or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. The World Health Organization expert who led a delegation to Wuhan has warned countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a pandemic. The virus has infected more than 81,000 people, and killed 2,762, the vast majority of cases in mainland China and in particular Hubei province. South Korea reported 169 new cases, reaching a total of 1,146, 90% of them in Daegu and North Gyeongsang. South Korean authorities said they plan to test about 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the outbreak. Mainland China reported its lowest daily death toll in more than three weeks, with 52 fatalities on Tuesday. Three more people died in Iran, bringing the total to 16 from almost 100 cases. Latin America recorded its first suspected case, with a patient in Brazil awaiting a second test to confirm the diagnosis. A US soldier based in a military camp in a town near Daegu has tested positive and is in self-isolation. Australia\u2019s ASX200 plunged 2.5% on Wednesday, wiping about $125bn from the index\u2019s value. The International Olympic Committee member, Dick Pound, has said the Tokyo Olympics could be cancelled if the virus threat is too great, and a decision would have to be made within two to three months. Japan cancelled its football league, and a Tokyo baseball team said it will play in an empty stadium this weekend. Preparations for an outbreak of coronavirus were under way in Afghanistan as the country confirmed its first case in the western province of Herat, which borders Iran. Seven more suspected cases have been identified in Herat, and three cases in the nearby provinces of Farah and Ghor. The affected Herat residents had recently returned from Qom in Iran, where the coronavirus outbreak has already killed at least 16 people and infected dozens of others, according to Iranian officials. Three more people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Bahrain, bringing the country\u2019s total to 26. The first 23 cases were all inbound travellers, identified and quarantined in \u201ca specialist hospital isolation centre\u201d, the kingdom\u2019s communication directorate said earlier. All but one were diagnosed at an airport before entering Bahrain, it said. The Philippines is the latest country to impose travel bans. It has announced it will refuse entry to any traveler from the South Korean province of Gyeongsang. Separately, Reuters reports that Kuwait has banned foreign ships from departing to or arriving from South Korea, Italy, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Iraq. Oil sector ships are excluded from the ban. The United Arab Emirates is \u201cwell prepared and equipped for the worst case scenarios\u201d as the coronavirus spreads in Middle East, an official from the UAE National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority told Reuters on Wednesday. The official said the UAE has enough facilities to quarantine patients and relevant bodies have been instructed to undertake \u201ca complete surveillance of all people entering the country\u201d. The UAE has reported 13 people have been diagnosed with the infection, of whom three have recovered and two are in critical condition. Iran, UAE\u2019s neighbour across the Gulf, reported on Tuesday a total of 16 virus-related deaths, the most outside China Thailand has reported three new cases today, taking total infections to 40, Reuters is reporting, citing Sukhum Kanchanapimai, permanent secretary at the health ministry. The patients are all Thai nationals. Two had returned from holidays in Japan\u2019s northern island of Hokkaido, and came into contact with the third. The AP has released a wrap of the current numbers. There are a total 81,002 confirmed cases around the world, and 2,762 dead. Mainland China: 78,064 cases, 2,715 deaths, mostly in Hubei South Korea: 1,146 cases, 11 deaths Japan: 860 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 4 deaths Italy: 323 cases, 11 deaths Iran: 95 cases, 15 deaths Singapore: 91 cases Hong Kong: 81 cases, 2 deaths Thailand: 37 cases United States: 57 cases Taiwan: 31 cases, 1 death Australia: 23 cases Malaysia: 22 Bahrain: 17 Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 17 United Arab Emirates: 13 cases United Kingdom: 13 France: 14 cases, 1 death Canada: 11 Kuwait: 11 Macao: 10 cases Iraq: 5 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 Spain: 6 Russia: 2 Israel: 2 Oman: 2 Austria: 2 Lebanon: 1 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Algeria: 1 Afghanistan: 1 Croatia: 1 Switzerland: 1 Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has called for sports and cultural events to be cancelled or postponed for the next fortnight, as the country tries to contain its outbreak. \u201cTaking into account that the next one to two weeks are extremely important in stopping the spread of infection, the government considers there to be a large risk of transmission at sports, cultural events and large gatherings of people,\u201d Abe told parliament. Five people have died of the Covid-19 illness in Japan, which has had at least 164 cases of infection in the general population, as well as 691 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which docked south of Tokyo. Businesses have been urged to recommend staff work from home, and a Tokyo baseball team said it would play games in an empty stadium this weekend. Meanwhile the Japanese minister in charge of the Olympics, scheduled for July, has sought to reassure people the games would go ahead despite comments from senior Olympics officials that it may have to be cancelled. Coronavirus fear has gripped the Australian market, driving the benchmark ASX200 index down more than 2.5% today. The market has fallen every day so far this week, wiping 6.3% - or about $125bn - from the index. All sectors have bit hammered, but the brunt of the pain is being felt by investors in stocks with heavy exposure to the Chinese economy and international travel. At about 3.40pm metals company and BHP spin-off South32 was down almost 7.5% while fund manager Magellan has been smashed, dropping 7.8%. But only 13 of the 200 stocks in the index have escaped a fall today, with every other company, including the big banks, feeling the financial fallout from the virus fears. The Diamond Princess cruise ship continues to be a major focus of the global outbreak. Passengers who were allowed off the virus-stricken ship are continuing to develop symptoms, and several of the 970 who were allowed off last week after testing negative have since developed the Covid-19 illness, including another Australian passenger announced today. Japan has come under criticism over its handling of the cruise ship, and several countries which repatriated its citizens from the ship required them to undergo further quarantining despite Japan\u2019s decision to release them. Japan\u2019s health minister Katsunobo Kato told parliament today the ministry had found 45 people with \u201ccertain symptoms\u201d, and had asked them all to see a doctor and take tests. The Hong Kong government has formally announced the relief package that SCMP reported earlier, including the HKD $10,000 for each permanent resident over the age of 18. Finance chief Paul Chan confirmed the \u201cexceptional measure\u201d was in light of current circumstances (months of unrest plus the coronavirus) and said it would not create long term financial burden. He said he made the decision \u201cwith a view to encouraging and boosting local consumption on the one hand, and relieving people\u2019s financial burden on the other\u201d. It will cost about HKD$71bn in total, he said, and is expected to benefit seven million people. There are 555 confirmed cases of infection in Chinese prisons, although no deaths so far, and a senior leader in the country\u2019s justice ministry has blamed it on law enforcement. Xiong Xuanguo, deputy minister of the justice ministry, has accused them of poor disease control efforts. \u201cThe transmission of the disease truly reflects some gaps in our management of prisons and in our prevention and epidemic control work,\u201d he said. The women\u2019s jail in the central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, is 100m from a hospital and both facilities are serviced by the same bus stop, Xiong told a news conference held by the information office of China\u2019s State Council or cabinet. For cases found at jails in the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, he added, local security forces did not report they had been in contact with individuals from Hubei province, the capital of which is Wuhan. \u201cOur police officers at every level did not make truthful reports,\u201d he said. This year\u2019s Olympic Games could be cancelled if the disease proved too dangerous, a senior International Olympic Committee member has said. Dick Pound, a former Canadian swimming champion and IOC member since 1978, estimated there was a two-to-three month window to make a decision, Gavin Blair reports. \u201cIn and around that time, I\u2019d say folks are going to have to ask: \u2018Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?\u2019\u201d Pound told Associated Press. As the Games draw near, he said, \u201ca lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic Village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there, building their studios.\u201d If the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as scheduled in Tokyo, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation\u201d, he said. All public elementary and junior high schools in the Japanese prefecture of Hokkaido will close for a few days from Thursday, according to Kyodo News agency. Hokkaido has 35 confirmed cases, the highest number in Japan outside of Tokyo. San Francisco has declared a local emergency over the coronavirus, despite having no cases, Reuters reports. It comes as US officials urged Americans to prepare for the spread of infections within their communities. California\u2019s fourth-largest city said it made the move to boost its coronavirus preparedness and raise public awareness of risks the virus may spread to the city. \u201cAlthough there are still zero confirmed cases in San Francisco residents, the global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness,\u201d the city\u2019s mayor London Breed said. The South China Morning Post is reporting the Hong Kong government is about to announce a relief package which includes HKD$10,000 (US$1,200) cash handouts for permanent residents aged over 18. The HK$120bn package to bring relief to the city after months of civil unrest and now the virus, is expected to be announced during the budget speech on Wednesday. A second person who visited Bali, Indonesia, has tested positive for the virus. According to Japanese and Indonesian media, the Tokyo man in his sixties visited Bali shortly before testing positive for Covid-19. According to the Jakarta Post, the man works at an aged care home, and returned to work for at least one day after presenting to a health clinic with cold-like symptoms and being discharged because he was not diagnosed with pneumonia. \u201cWe have started contact tracing. We found the hotel he stayed at during his visit to Bali,\u201d Bali Health Agency head Ketut Suarjaya told The Jakarta Post. It\u2019s the second case of someone who had visited Bali later testing positive for the virus on their return home. A Chinese man was diagnosed eight days after he retuned from the island earlier this month. Indonesia says it has no confirmed cases of the virus, and that 28 people from Bali who showed symptoms all tested negative. A US soldier has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a statement from US Forces Korea. The 23-year-old, who had been based in a US camp in a town near the South Korean city of Daegu, was in self-isolation at his off-base residence. He had visited Camp Walker in Daegu earlier in the week. South Korean authorities and US military health workers were tracing his contacts for people who might have been exposed. \u201cUSFK is implementing all appropriate control measures to help control the spread of Covid-19 and remains at risk level \u2018high\u2019 for USFK peninsula-wide as a prudent measure to protect the force,\u201d the statement said. An eighth Australian passenger from the Diamond Princess cruise ship has tested positive for the virus. His partner had already tested positive, and so he has been in isolation, and will now receive treatment. Back to the Australian authorities, who are giving a lot of detail about the response plans and current situation in the island country. Minister Greg Hunt says more than 3,000 tests have been done in Australia, of which only 15 in the general population have come back positive. Under Australian law and the official declaration by Murphy, the federal government has quarantine powers, as well as the individual states, and that includes forcible quarantining of people. (The context to this is a discussion on ABC TV\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday, which saw disturbing footage of Chinese authorities forcibly taking people from their homes and to quarantine. Expert panellists noted that Australia had the power to do the same.) \u201cThe states themselves have their own bio security arrangements and, for example, they have been monitoring the home isolation and they have powers. If they need them. We have powers if we need them.\u201d Just to jump in, while the Australian press conference continues, we brought you the updated infection numbers from China a short time ago. The death toll of 52 people on Tuesday is the lowest daily figure from mainland China in more than three weeks, AFP is reporting. The number of fresh cases has declined in China, with multiple provinces reporting zero new infections in recent days. Only five cases were reported outside the epicentre, the lowest in over a month. Amid questions on how long an event they are preparing for, Murphy notes that a slow paced outbreak puts far less pressure on the health system, even if it has a longer impact. \u201cThere\u2019s always a possibility with a new virus that it could persist and come back on a seasonal basis. We don\u2019t know these things.\u201d Health minister Greg Hunt says it is a possibility that events like AFL matches could be cancelled, but that it was a \u201clast resort\u201d. Asked about this year\u2019s Olympics in Japan, Hunt says the health of the general population and athletes is the priority, and assessments would be made closer to the date. Athletes will be the first to know, but in the meantime \u201cjust keep training\u201d. Australia is still contained, with no community transmissions, the country\u2019s chief medical officer has said. This means Australians don\u2019t need to start behaving in ways other than normal, or wear masks. But authorities are preparing \u201cbecause of the developing international scenario\u201d, and based on modified pandemic plans that have been developed for years. \u201cWe are working very closely with the states and territories who run the public hospitals with primary care, the general practices. Aged care is a big part of our plan,\u201d Professor Brendan Murphy has told reporters. Asked about the growing likelihood that a pandemic would be declared, Murphy said that \u201cdoesn\u2019t really change what we\u2019re doing at all\u201d. \u201cMore cases in Australia, more community transmissions in Australia, definitely does.\u201d In the eventuation of that, public health authorities would do contact tracing if it was a small outbreak. If it was bigger then authorities would respond differently where they were \u201cnot trying to fully contain but limit the spread of transmission\u201d. If it got to a certain size they might start closing schools or changing configurations of hospitals, he says. The message, essentially, is that authorities are flexible and will adapt to the circumstances. Chinese authorities have reported that 406 new cases were confirmed on Tuesday, a drop on Monday\u2019s 508, bringing the total number of cases in mainland China to 78,064, and 2,715 dead. Of the 406, 401 were in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. The previous day saw 499. 52 people died from Covid-19 in Hubei province on Tuesday, fewer than the 68 reported on Monday. There was one new confirmed case in the province of Shandong, two in Sichuan, one in Heibei, as well as four new confirmed cases in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan, according to Tencent. More Chinese provinces have downgraded their emergency response levels, within China\u2019s four-tiered alert system, Reuters is reporting. The northwestern Chinese regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang and the southwestern province of Sichuan have downgraded their emergency response level after assessing that health risks from the coronavirus outbreak have receded, state media has reported. The provinces of Gansu, Yunnan, Guangdong, Shanxi, Guizhou and Anhui have also cut their emergency response levels in the last few days. Some regions, including Fujian in the southeast, are also starting to dismantle emergency roadblocks designed to screen incoming vehicles and curb the contagion. China has quarantined 94 air passengers arriving from Seoul after three people on the flight were discovered to have fevers, state media reported Wednesday. The three passengers, all Chinese, arrived in the city of Nanjing on Tuesday morning and were discovered after customs personnel boarded the aircraft on landing to screen passengers for symptoms, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said. The three were immediately sent by ambulance to a hospital for isolation and testing, while 94 people who had sat near them on the plane were sent to a hotel to be quarantined, CCTV said. None of the three people with fevers had any history of travel to Wuhan, where the outbreak originated. Agence France-Presse has further detail from South Korea: An 11th person had died of the disease, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) added in a statement on its website - a Mongolian man in his 30s who became the first foreign national to fall victim to the outbreak. Yonhap news agency reported that he had been in hospital in the South awaiting a liver transplant. The vast majority - 90% - of the new infections were in Daegu, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city and the epicentre of the outbreak, and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang. Between them they account for more than 80% of the national total. The streets of Daegu - which has a population of 2.5 million - have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. Authorities urged the public to exercise extra caution, advising citizens to stay home if they have a fever or respiratory symptoms. \u201cThe government will mobilise all resources and means\u201d to try to control the outbreak, Prime Minster Chung Sye-kyun told a meeting in Daegu, where he is leading the government response, Yonhap news agency reported. Here\u2019s a bit more detail on the new cases in South Korea: Of the 169 new cases, 134 were from Daegu city, where a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which has been linked to outbreaks, is located. The BBC\u2019s correspondent in South Korea is reporting that an official in Daegu who had a meeting with the president has tested positive for coronavirus. South Korea has reported 169 more cases of new coronavirus, mostly in and around Daegu, bringing total infections to 1,146, according to the Associated Press. The impact of months of civil unrest and now coronavirus has seen Australian airline, Virgin, lose more than $130m in earnings on its flight routes to Hong Kong, my colleague Alyx Gorman reports from the company\u2019s half yearly call. The company had already said last year it would wind up its Melbourne-Hong Kong route, but keep the daily Sydney-Hong Kong flight, however then in February said the Sydney route would also end. The inpact of Hong Kong\u2019s months of protests and now coronavirus has prompted the airline to exit early. Virgin will cease all services to Hong Kong in March. CEO Paul Scurrah said: \u201cthe coronavirus meant we moved faster on a withdrawal.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much across the board with a leaning towards leisure destinations heavily reliant on Chinese tourism,\u201d said Scurrah of the other affected routes. The company said there was a potential $50m-55m impact on the Virgin Group\u2019s domestic earnings in 2H20, including $14m on Tigerair and $35m-40m on Virgin Australia Domestic. The domestic demand was impacted by low GDP growth and the Australian bushfire crisis. Air Canada announced Tuesday it is extending its suspension of flights between Canada and the Chinese cities of Beijing and Shanghai until April 10. The foreign ministry has advised Canadians against non-essential travel to China in light of the virus\u2019s rapid spread there. Australia\u2019s health authorities are well prepared in the event WHO declares a pandemic. Two weeks ago, the federal health department published an \u2018Emergency Response Plan\u2019. The document is periodically updated as more is understood about the virus, who is most at risk, and potential treatments. It states that \u201cthe novel coronavirus outbreak represents a significant risk to Australia\u201d. \u201cIt has the potential to cause high levels of morbidity and mortality and to disrupt our community socially and economically... the response to the novel coronavirus outbreak is now in the Initial Action stage,\u201d the document states. \u201cThe level of impact that the novel coronavirus has on the Australian community will depend on a number of factors. The most influential will be the clinical severity and transmissibility of the disease, and the capacity of the health system to cope with the demand and the need for specialist services.\u201d It is important to remember that for most people infected, symptoms are mild and most people recover. Some people show no symptoms at all. However as with influenza, vulnerable people including those with other illnesses, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and the elderly are at risk of more severe symptoms and even death. So even if coronavirus proves to have a relatively low death rate once more data is collected, that can still represents thousands of deaths if millions become infected. \u201cPublic communication will be used to provide an opportunity both to address any public concern caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak and to engage the public in strategies to manage the impact of the disease,\u201d the response plan states. \u201cIt is suspected that individuals with the novel coronavirus may be less infectious prior to the onset of symptoms than those with influenza. This would make isolation of identified cases more effective at reducing onward spread. The majority of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features. People in at-risk groups and those with comorbidities may experience more severe illness. At the peak of the outbreak, and increasingly when transmissibility is higher, primary care and hospital services may become stretched in areas associated with respiratory illness and acute care. Existing legislation is likely to be sufficient to support activities.\u201d I wanted to tell you that I got corona,\u201d said Iran\u2019s deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi. \u201cWe\u2019ll defeat corona. Be assured. I\u2019m saying this deep from my heart. This virus is democratic, and it doesn\u2019t distinguish between poor and rich or statesman and an ordinary citizen. \u201cMany might get infected, but we have enough effective medicine, take care of yourselves. Take care of the nurses and doctors who work heroically.\u201d Iran is emerging as a place of particular focus, where there are 95 confirmed cases and 16 deaths. Iran\u2019s deputy health minister said he has contracted the coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference, Martin Chulov reported. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, expressing serious concern that Tehran \u201cmay have suppressed vital details\u201d about the outbreak there. Neighbouring nations have reported cases among people who came from Iran, including nine in Kuwait. Kuwait\u2019s civil aviation authority announced on Tuesday it had suspended all flights with Singapore and Japan over coronavirus fears, state news agency KUNA reported. This follows the decision on Monday to suspend flights with South Korea, Iran, Thailand, Italy and Iraq. Food giant Nestle is postponing all business trips until 15 March, AFP reports. \u201cWe have asked all of our employees worldwide not to travel for business purposes until March 15 2020. We will review this measure in light of external developments,\u201d a company spokesman told AFP, quoting an internal note. The spokesman said that the company was not calling back expatriate employees but added: \u201cWe monitor the situation closely to ensure the safety of our employees.\u201d The benchmark ASX200 index opened down for the third day in a row, falling 1.7% by 11am as the coronavirus crisis continued to scare investors. There were falls across the board but companies exposed to China or international travel led the bourse down. Shares in Treasury Wine Estates, which makes prestigious wine Penfolds Grange and is a big exporter to China, dropped 4.3%. They\u2019ve been falling since last week and yesterday afternoon the company warned that it would fall short of its previous profit forecasts due to the outbreak. Fund manager Magellan was smashed for a third day running, falling almost 5%. Also facing a third day running of losses was stock in travel agency Flight Centre, which was down 3.9%. Airline Qantas fell 2.8%, its fourth loss in as many days. Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corporation fell 4.75% amid general weakness in the media sector - both Nine, which owns the former Fairfax papers, and Seven West Media, which owns the West Australian, have reported poor half-year results in the past couple of weeks. As mentioned earlier, this blog is a continuation of our coverage of the coronavirus. You can catch up on the earlier updates here, but below is a quick summary of the most recent developments. Italian authorities updated the death toll in the country to 11.Four additional deaths were reported in the country on Tuesday. New cases were confirmed in Spain and Switzerland. Concerns were growing at the spread of the virus on mainland Europe. A hotel in Tenerife where an Italian man who has tested positive for coronavirus was staying has been put on lockdown.One thousand guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel have been placed in isolation to halt any further spread of the disease. One British holidaymaker has described the situation as a \u201choliday from hell\u201d. Travellers returning to the UK from northern Italy may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Official government advice has been changed to say that those who have been to northern Italy, north of Pisa, should self-isolate if they develop flu-like symptoms on their return to the UK. Britons who have been in lockdown regions of Italy, including those in the Lombardy and Veneto region, should self-isolate at home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms. Some schools in the UK have closed or sent pupils homebecause they had recently returned from skiing visits to northern Italy. In Iran, the death toll due to the coronavirus has reached 16, a health ministry official told state TV on Tuesday. Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. The deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, has been infected and is under quarantine. Italian authorities announced on Tuesday the first positive coronavirus case in the south of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. Croatia and Austria became the latest European countries to confirm cases of coronavirus. Latin America has recorded what would be its first confirmed case of coronavirus on Tuesday as Brazilian authorities reported that a 61-year-old man in S\u00e3o Paulo had tested positive for the illness. According to the O Globo newspaper the man recently arrived back in Brazil\u2019s economic capital from Italy. He was being treated at one of Brazil\u2019s top hospitals, the Albert Einstein in S\u00e3o Paulo, on Tuesday. The results of a second test to confirm the virus are expected on Wednesday, Brazil\u2019s health ministry said. There are 80,415 confirmed cases across the world, and 2,708 deaths. The UN\u2019s health agency, WHO, has called for countries to \u201cprepare for a potential pandemic\u201d - a term used to describe an epidemic that spreads throughout the world - with poor countries at particular risk. From AFP: Even as the number of fresh cases declines at the epicentre of the disease in China, there has been a sudden increase in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Towns and cities in different parts of the world have been sealed off in an attempt to stop the contagion, while hotels in the Canary Island and Austria were locked down on Tuesday because of suspected cases. At the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, Bruce Aylward, who headed an international expert mission to China, hailed measures taken there but told reporters that other nations were \u201csimply not ready\u201d for reining in the outbreak. \u201cYou have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale... and it has to be done fast,\u201d Aylward said. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus. You can read our earlier updates here. The focus has been on Europe, where the outbreak is worsening, but we\u2019ll soon be hearing the latest from China, South Korea and Japan. Switzerland, Austria and Croatia have reported their first cases, and the death toll has risen in Italy to 11. Algeria has also confirmed its first case of the virus. In Geneva, Dr Bruce Aylward, who headed the joint WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan, called for countries to \u201cprepare for a potential pandemic\u201d. He hailed the measures taken in China, but told reporters that other nations were \u201csimply not ready\u201d for reining in the outbreak. He said countries needed to shift their mindset to preparing for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus and be ready to respond rapidly when it arrived, Reuters reported. Aylward told reporters on his return to Switzerland from Wuhan that China\u2019s \u201cextraordinary mobilisation\u201d to handle the virus outbreak showed how aggressive policy steps could curb the disease\u2019s spread. Authorities should prepare hospital beds, isolation zones and respirators for severe cases, Aylward said, adding: \u201cChina knows how to keep people alive.\u201d He said hundreds of thousands of people did not get the Covid-19 illness because of China\u2019s aggressive response. \u201cAccess the expertise of China. They have done this at speed and they know what they are doing. They are really, really good at it.\u201d The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has warned it is a matter of when, not if, the virus spreads to US communities.",

      "bodyText": "As of Thursday 27 February, 23 cases of coronavirus cases had been confirmed in Australia, with the federal department of health stating of those, 15 were people who had been in Wuhan, and 8 were passengers from the Diamond Princess repatriation flight from Japan, who are in quarantine in Darwin. 15 people have recovered and the rest are in a stable condition. Despite the mild symptoms and comparatively few cases in Australia, some people are nonetheless concerned about what they should do if they begin to experience flu-like symptoms given there are 82,164 confirmed cases globally. There have been 2,801 deaths, the vast majority of those in mainland China. And while symptoms are often mild, the virus is highly infectious. The Australian government and health authorities have encouraged the public to stay calm, with no cases of the virus transmitting between people in Australia. However, on Thursday the government announced they would be escalating their response to the global health issue. \u201cWhile the World Health Organisation is yet to declare the nature of the coronavirus and its move towards a pandemic phase, we believe the risk of a global pandemic is very much upon us,\u201d Scott Morrison said. What should I do if I feel unwell? For current information, the federal department of health website is a good source. Infectious diseases physician and Australian National University professor, Peter Collignon, said unless Australians had recently been in mainland China or had been in close contact with someone with a confirmed case of coronavirus, the advice for anyone feeling unwell was the same as for any other virus. \u201cThere is fear that\u2019s not reasonable in Australia at the moment,\u201d Collignon, who has also worked with the World Health Organisation, said. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry, it\u2019s not here and it\u2019s not spreading.

What if I have been to China recently? Those who have been in China in the past 14 days or who know they have been in contact with someone with the virus should isolate themselves by staying home for 14 days, the department of health said. If symptoms develop during this period, it is best to call a GP to book an appointment and alert them that you may be experiencing coronavirus so that staff can prepare ahead of time.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Defences buckle under force of water</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with the Guardian\u2019s best offerings for Thursday morning.</p> \n<p>Residents evacuated from properties in Ironbridge due to flooding are facing further misery with more wet weather impact expected today. A yellow weather warning of snow and ice has been issued for much of the Midlands including the river Severn in Shropshire where flood defences were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/26/shropshire-towns-in-flooding-danger-as-river-severn-rises\">buckled and breached by the pressure of water</a>. Flooding along parts of the Severn, which remained close to its highest levels in some areas, is likely until at least Sunday, the Environment Agency has said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a5d3285d-22e5-49b5-9783-6ca924ab40d3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iX-kD2jCVkY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The water overwhelmed the flood barriers at Ironbridge, in Shropshire, leading to an emergency evacuation and prompting concern that the world heritage site would suffer serious damage. Further down the river, at Bridgnorth, there was flooding in some areas that had not been inundated for a century. Water also breached the temporary flood barriers in the Worcestershire town of Bewdley, causing homes there to be evacuated. Across England this morning there are 92 flood warnings in place, meaning flooding should be expected, and 132 flood alerts, meaning possible flooding.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Trump on coronavirus: don\u2019t worry \u2013 </strong>Donald Trump has put the vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the US response to coronavirus. In a lengthy address last night Trump sought to reassure Americans that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-us-response\">risk to them remained \u201cvery low\u201d</a>. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d Trump said. Soon afterwards a person in northern California was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/us-coronavirus-california-case\">confirmed to have contracted Covid-19</a> without travelling outside of the US or having contact with a confirmed case. Trump\u2019s stance was starkly at odds with close ally Australia, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/how-will-australia-respond-if-the-coronavirus-outbreak-becomes-a-pandemic\">enacted an emergency response plan</a> that could include mass vaccinations and quarantining people in sports stadiums if necessary. \u201cThere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus,\u201d said Scott Morrison, the prime minister. In the UK, officials fear it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/matt-hancock-clarifies-coronavirus-travel-advice-after-criticism\">could take just 72 hours</a> for an outbreak the size of Italy\u2019s to take hold. The WHO has warned against using the term \u201cpandemic\u201d, which it says falsely indicates the spread can no longer be contained. The latest developments, as ever, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-live-updates-china-wuhan-hubei-south-korea-japan-trumpcases-infections-death-toll-outbreak-italy-latest-news\">at our live blog</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Tout kit on ticket site \u2013 </strong>The ticketing website Viagogo provides tools that experts say make it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/27/revealed-viagogo-toolkit-fraud-tickets\">easier for ticket touts to commit fraud</a>, evidence obtained by the Guardian has shown. The portal appears to make it possible to deploy similar techniques used by two touts jailed for fraud this week after being exposed by the Guardian. One of the counts of fraud related to \u201cspeculative selling\u201d, when touts advertise tickets that they do not yet own. Viagogo\u2019s \u201cinventory manager\u201d feature, a toolkit available only to touts, appears to make speculative selling possible. The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said the Guardian\u2019s findings should prompt action from regulators and law enforcement. Viagogo said it would remove listings and fine or block sellers if it was notified they did not comply with its rules but did not comment on its inventory manager tools.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Oxford child indecency case \u2013 </strong>An Oxford university lecturer has been suspended after he pleaded guilty to three counts of producing indecent photographs of a child. Philosophy tutor Peter King published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/27/oxford-lecturer-admits-producing-indecent-photographs\">controversial paper on the ethics of child pornography</a> in 2008. He is due to be sentenced next month. Oxford crown court confirmed that King pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent photos of a child between 2010 and 2018, involving thousands of images. He also admitted to one charge of possession of a prohibited image of a child. King\u2019s defence lawyer declined to comment.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Police delays let paedophiles off hook \u2013 </strong>Investigators are giving back to suspected paedophiles phones and computers that possibly hold child abuse images because officers do not have the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/phones-that-may-hold-child-abuse-images-returned-to-suspects\">time or technology to search the devices</a>, says a report from the inspectorate of constabulary. It found children are being put at risk by lengthy delays in investigations \u2013 in one case inspectors found 100 days passed after police were notified that a 10-year-old girl had been receiving indecent images from three men, with no effort in the meantime to find the perpetrators. \u201cIn some of the most concerning cases we have found that in addition to delays a lack of technology has resulted in prosecutions being discontinued, and, perhaps most troublingly of all, devices returned that may have contained indecent images,\u201d the report says.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Black and White ball \u2013 </strong>The phone tycoon David Ross, who arranged Boris Johnson\u2019s \u00a315,000 Caribbean holiday, and Jay Rutland, a businessman banned from City trading for \u201cmarket abuse\u201d, are among 11 Conservative supporters who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/26/carphone-warehouse-founder-helped-plan-exclusive-tory-fundraiser\">helped organise the party\u2019s fundraising ball</a>, the Guardian has learned from leaked documents. At the Battersea Evolution club on Tuesday the PM and ministers rubbed shoulders with wealthy supporters. Tickets are \u00a315,000 a table and the annual event raises millions.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Defences buckle under force of water Hello, Warren Murray with the Guardian\u2019s best offerings for Thursday morning. Residents evacuated from properties in Ironbridge due to flooding are facing further misery with more wet weather impact expected today. A yellow weather warning of snow and ice has been issued for much of the Midlands including the river Severn in Shropshire where flood defences were buckled and breached by the pressure of water. Flooding along parts of the Severn, which remained close to its highest levels in some areas, is likely until at least Sunday, the Environment Agency has said. The water overwhelmed the flood barriers at Ironbridge, in Shropshire, leading to an emergency evacuation and prompting concern that the world heritage site would suffer serious damage. Further down the river, at Bridgnorth, there was flooding in some areas that had not been inundated for a century. Water also breached the temporary flood barriers in the Worcestershire town of Bewdley, causing homes there to be evacuated. Across England this morning there are 92 flood warnings in place, meaning flooding should be expected, and 132 flood alerts, meaning possible flooding. * * * Trump on coronavirus: don\u2019t worry \u2013 Donald Trump has put the vice-president, Mike Pence, in charge of the US response to coronavirus. In a lengthy address last night Trump sought to reassure Americans that the risk to them remained \u201cvery low\u201d. \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d Trump said. Soon afterwards a person in northern California was confirmed to have contracted Covid-19 without travelling outside of the US or having contact with a confirmed case. Trump\u2019s stance was starkly at odds with close ally Australia, which has enacted an emergency response plan that could include mass vaccinations and quarantining people in sports stadiums if necessary. \u201cThere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus,\u201d said Scott Morrison, the prime minister. In the UK, officials fear it could take just 72 hours for an outbreak the size of Italy\u2019s to take hold. The WHO has warned against using the term \u201cpandemic\u201d, which it says falsely indicates the spread can no longer be contained. The latest developments, as ever, at our live blog. * * * Tout kit on ticket site \u2013 The ticketing website Viagogo provides tools that experts say make it easier for ticket touts to commit fraud, evidence obtained by the Guardian has shown. The portal appears to make it possible to deploy similar techniques used by two touts jailed for fraud this week after being exposed by the Guardian. One of the counts of fraud related to \u201cspeculative selling\u201d, when touts advertise tickets that they do not yet own. Viagogo\u2019s \u201cinventory manager\u201d feature, a toolkit available only to touts, appears to make speculative selling possible. The Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said the Guardian\u2019s findings should prompt action from regulators and law enforcement. Viagogo said it would remove listings and fine or block sellers if it was notified they did not comply with its rules but did not comment on its inventory manager tools. * * * Oxford child indecency case \u2013 An Oxford university lecturer has been suspended after he pleaded guilty to three counts of producing indecent photographs of a child. Philosophy tutor Peter King published a controversial paper on the ethics of child pornography in 2008. He is due to be sentenced next month. Oxford crown court confirmed that King pleaded guilty to three counts of making indecent photos of a child between 2010 and 2018, involving thousands of images. He also admitted to one charge of possession of a prohibited image of a child. King\u2019s defence lawyer declined to comment. * * * Police delays let paedophiles off hook \u2013 Investigators are giving back to suspected paedophiles phones and computers that possibly hold child abuse images because officers do not have the time or technology to search the devices, says a report from the inspectorate of constabulary. It found children are being put at risk by lengthy delays in investigations \u2013 in one case inspectors found 100 days passed after police were notified that a 10-year-old girl had been receiving indecent images from three men, with no effort in the meantime to find the perpetrators. \u201cIn some of the most concerning cases we have found that in addition to delays a lack of technology has resulted in prosecutions being discontinued, and, perhaps most troublingly of all, devices returned that may have contained indecent images,\u201d the report says. * * * Black and White ball \u2013 The phone tycoon David Ross, who arranged Boris Johnson\u2019s \u00a315,000 Caribbean holiday, and Jay Rutland, a businessman banned from City trading for \u201cmarket abuse\u201d, are among 11 Conservative supporters who helped organise the party\u2019s fundraising ball, the Guardian has learned from leaked documents. At the Battersea Evolution club on Tuesday the PM and ministers rubbed shoulders with wealthy supporters. Tickets are \u00a315,000 a table and the annual event raises millions. One donor paid \u00a360,000 for gold and silver versions of the Brexit Day coin and a signed copy of the withdrawal agreement. The auction also included a game of tennis with Johnson and lunch with the justice secretary, Robert Buckland \u2013 in a prison restaurant. Electoral commission figures show that Johnson\u2019s party raised more than \u00a35.67m in large donations \u2013 amounts of more than \u00a37,500 \u2013 compared with \u00a3218,500 given to Labour in the run up to the general election. Today in Focus podcast: Convicting Weinstein After a jury returned a guilty verdict on two of five charges against Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer is now awaiting sentencing. Guardian US reporter Lauren Aratani discusses covering the trial and what the verdict means for the #MeToo movement. And: the latest in the coronavirus outbreak.

AMSA did not \u2013 I repeat, did not \u2013 advise against the exemption application. </p> <p>The operator has committed to a timetable to comply with the requirements and has agreed arrangements to manage animal welfare with the department of agriculture. Now, on this basis, I have approved one temporary exemption to the twin-tier requirements for the vessel. The House should note that the exemption only relates to twin-tier requirements.

      "bodyText": "Sigh. That brings us to the end of this week\u2019s blog \u2013 but not the end of the sitting. The parliament will resume on Monday, when no doubt all of the same issues will be brought up again. Make sure you stay up to date with the Guardian tomorrow, when we will bring you the next sports grants inquiry hearing, as well as the regional grants inquiry \u2013 plus everything else. A very big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp, as well as everyone else in the Guardian brains trust. And to you, as always, for following along. It means the world and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. Yes, you. Thank you. Have a wonderful weekend \u2013 and take care of you. The day, as seen by Mike Bowers: One is not impressed. \u201c \u201c When the courtyard light is a gift to photographers Waiting for a m8 Just once again \u2013 we are talking about these sports rorts, because Georgina Downer presented a giant novelty cheque of taxpayer funds with her face on it, to a sports club, when she was merely a candidate for the seat of Mayo. Whoever came up with that idea has to be in the biggest of dog houses. The inquiry will now go until June. That means it will have dragged on for six months by the time it reports back. Just drip, drip, dripping revelations. Fantastic. Great move. Well done. Anthony Albanese finishes with this on the sports grants affair: Why is it the PM was consulted on April 10 before the announcements on April 11, the letter from Senator McKenzie to Sport Australia, if they weren\u2019t having input? And we know there are over 130 emails between the PM\u2019s office and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office. This is a red hot rort. And today we raised the issue of a football club in Scott Morrison\u2019s own electorate that received a $50,000 grant for a project that had already been built, had already been opened. What was the money for here? On their own Facebook site, they thanked the St George Football Association and the local council for receiving the money for the upgrade in their facilities. This whole program goes right to the PM\u2019s office and is all about politics and treating taxpayers\u2019 funds as if they were Liberal-National party funds. Is that stimulus more urgent now, Patricia Karvelas asks, than when it was first called for? Anthony Albanese: Well, the truth is that well before the bushfires, or this virus, we had an economy where wages were flat, where economic growth was downgraded three times in terms of its predictions, productivity was going backwards, consumer demand was very flat. There\u2019s nothing new about the fact that this government has presided over a lack of having an economic plan for jobs and an economic plan for growth. They had cuts in terms of skills. We have seen figures released yesterday about a massive decline in the number of apprenticeships. There\u2019s no doubt they are linked to the cuts that have been made to Tafe in particular. So we think that, as we have been saying for a long period of time, since June, that the government needs to actually have less focus on itself and on politics and more plans for what the economy actually needs. On whether Labor believes the economy needs to be stimulated, Anthony Albanese says: Well, what we said in June of last year was that stage two of the tax cuts should be brought forward. We said it then. We still think it now. We think that in terms of some of the infrastructure measures \u2013 it would be nice if this government stopped pork barrelling and actually did infrastructure projects that will boost productivity and boost the economy. We have maintained that position. Anthony Albanese continues: Well, certainly we have not sought to play politics with this. That\u2019s why the PM\u2019s statement is so extraordinary. He hasn\u2019t after the decision was made, he hasn\u2019t sought to offer a briefing. He stood up after he shut down parliamentary question time and just said this was going to occur. The opposition will receive a briefing but it seems to us the initial statements that Chris Bowen has made inquiries is that this is pretty similar essentially to the announcement that was made, or maybe even identical to the announcement that was made on the 18th. Patricia Karvelas just asked Anthony Albanese about the \u201cplaying politics\u201d allegation: What happened this morning was that there were divisions called by the government because they were shutting down a debate. Moving that members be no longer heard. Catherine King moved a motion before the parliament to suspend standing orders. As you know, in order to suspend standing orders, you need 76 votes. Labor\u2019s only 68 when everyone\u2019s here and everyone isn\u2019t here. And they chose, rather than actually listen to King, a 10-minute speech about some rorts that have occurred in infrastructure and a second to speak and a 25-minute debate, they were the ones who initiated votes this morning because they\u2019re addicted to shutting down debate in the parliament. Just on the \u2018where was Anthony Albanese\u2019 question raised in the press conference there, we are told that the meeting wasn\u2019t confirmed until the last minute. Albanese was with the prime minister at the time. Chris Bowen went to the meeting in his place, as did some of Albanese\u2019s staff, once the briefing was confirmed and received apologies for the late confirmation of the meeting. As for the advice the government has released, Labor says that is the same as was released publicly on 18 February. Scott Morrison finishes that press conference with this message: The key message that I really want to get across to Australians today is because of the actions we\u2019ve taken, on the coronavirus, we\u2019ve got ahead. We intend to stay ahead. And together we will get through this. Greg Hunt: Just in terms of briefings with Labor. On the third of February, we briefed the opposition and these will generally involve either the chief medical officer or the deputy chief medical officer and members from my staff. The third of February, Senator Keneally, Senator Wong, Joel Fitzgibbon, Jim Chalmers, on 12 February, the leader of the opposition, between the 12th and the 23rd of February, regular briefings in particular with the shadow health minister\u2019s office. On the 24th of February, shadow health minister Chris Bowen. And last night, a briefing for the leader of the opposition and Chris Bowen. I understand that at the last minute the leader of the opposition was unable to attend last night\u2019s briefing at approximately 7.30pm. His office was present. Chris Bowen was there. I\u2019ll leave it to the leader of the opposition, I believe approximately 7.30 last night. And we will continue to provide those briefings. It is appropriate for the national security committee to meet today. It would have been ideal if it had been able to meet uninterrupted because they were notified that we were meeting for this very purpose. But we\u2019ll continue to provide those briefings and they\u2019ll have to explain that. Scott Morrison: Can I thank Zali Steggall and Rebekha Sharkie who agreed to support the government on any procedural motions that they may have been engaged in this afternoon and enable us, the minister for health and I, to undertake the press conference. Q: Mr Albanese suggested you\u2019re acting politically and without decency by not briefing the opposition before you made this announcement. How do you react to that? Scott Morrison: I react in a very disappointed way. I\u2019ll allow the health minister to go through the briefings that we provided to the opposition quite regularly. I\u2019ve got to say today I was very disappointed. The national security committee met this morning. It became apparent fairly early in the sitting day that the opposition was keen to be very disruptive in the parliament today. I understand that. That\u2019s politics. We asked the opposition whether pairs could be provided for myself, the health minister, other house members of the national security committee which meant that we\u2019d be able to undertake that meeting uninterrupted. Sadly, that request was declined by the opposition. And they proceeded to go about their business which resulted in seven interruptions to that meeting today. At a time we were trying to plan for the impact of a global pandemic on the coronavirus, well, they chose politics. On the question of what the economic boost Scott Morrison was talking about actually means, the prime minister says: You need to be able to build on plans. That\u2019s what scalable means. The Treasury and the treasurer are working on those presently. Those responses, those recommendations are not yet before the government but they\u2019ve been tasked. And that\u2019s an important part of our preparedness in looking ahead over the next few months. And you do this against a range of possible scenarios. The treasurer indicated just a few days ago and he confirmed that again today Treasury has not yet finalised what their initial assessment of what they think they believe the potential impact should be. Whether that\u2019s over the first March quarter of the year. But you would obviously expect it to have a very real impact with the level of decline that we\u2019ve seen obviously in travel to Australia. This is not unique to Australia. It\u2019s obviously happening everywhere. And of course the number of students that haven\u2019t been able to arrive in Australia at this point from the beginning of the year. And that\u2019s not just the fact they\u2019re not in a university, it means they\u2019re not in the country which means they\u2019re not participating in the economy. The second round effects of these issues is what can be impacted. So that\u2019s what is been addressed and that\u2019s the work that\u2019s being tasked. Health ministers will gather tomorrow to discuss the response, now that the emergency plan is being put into action. Sabra Lane, from the ABC\u2019s AM program, did a very good interview this morning about what a pandemic declaration would mean. You can find that here. She asked professor Alexandra Phelan what it would mean if Australia enacted its emergency plan (as is happening here). There\u2019s a national health security law agreement. State and territory governments agree to work with the federal government and they work together. I mean at the end of the day we are a federation and states and territories still retain primary power for hospitals and public health. And having that sort of agreement for leadership from the national level is a good strategy. I mean, ultimately I think, it would be good if Australia has something like, in the future, a CDC that could be an independent body to lead a response. The travel ban to China will continue for another week. There is a significant change of language here with Scott Morrison when it comes to boosting the economy. From almost ruling it out, to considering it if it was \u201ctargeted, modest and scalable\u201d: I said the other day this is a health crisis, not a financial crisis, but it is a health crisis with very significant economic implications. The Treasury secretary and the treasurer, who is a member of the National Security Committee, is part of those discussions today and he and I made some comment on these matters several days ago. What the treasurer is working on with the Treasury is, the advice is if we are to take any actions here, and that is still subject to advice from Treasury, which have not confirmed their advice, that any such measures would only be effective if they were targeted and modest and scalable. We are quite aware of where the virus is impacting, in particular sectors more than others, obviously in the travel sector, it\u2019s having a big impact in the education sector. Also, as I mentioned, the others and the impact of supply chain breakdowns, not just now between Australia and China but in the more broader global pandemic stage, those impacts would also be quite relevant. We are aware, particularly, the export industry and the marine sector, there are particular issues there, particularly in North Queensland, and these problems are present in many other places and the Treasury is doing that work now and the treasurer will be leading a response to that. Scott Morrison: I want to stress, and I\u2019m sure Dr Kelly will enforce this point, there is no evidence before us that children are at any greater risk as a result of what has occurred more recently, but we do believe to take care of our kids that we needed an even greater abundance of caution to ensure that should the coronavirus move to an extreme level or there is any particular risk that is associated with children, particularly those attending school, that we have the preparedness and arrangements in place with states and territories. I want to thank all the states and territories for the engagement, whether it\u2019s on this issue or any other issues, health issues that are associated. Have tasked the minister of home affairs working with his counterparts in the states and territories to ensure service and plans in place, that we are aware of any gaps that would need to be filled at any and every level of what the virus be extended to again. I know the states are already working and are well advanced with their own plans on these issues and I commend each of the premiers and first ministers for their leadership and in showing that they are taking the same actions as we are to ensure continuity of service of more extreme cases. There is no need for us to be moving to having mass gatherings of people stopped \u2013 if you want to go to the football and the cricket and play with your friends down the street, you can go out to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal. If you do go out for a Chinese meal (and I encourage you to do so, if you can, because it is delicious and also, because these small businesses really, really need our help right now) I hope it is succulent. Scott Morrison has implemented Australia\u2019s emergency response plan to deal with coronavirus. He says while the World Health Organization hasn\u2019t yet declared it a pandemic, he believes it is upon us, and it is time to enact the plan. Scott Morrison is giving an update on Covid-19. It is now spreading faster outside of China, for the first time. While I am still wearing my ranty pants about the wellbeing budget mocking that Josh Frydenberg has engaged in ALL week, Jacinda Ardern is visiting Australia this week, and New Zealand DOES have a wellbeing budget, as part of its annual budget statement. So we are now also mocking one of our closest allies. Get. In. The. Bin. Friday is shaping up as a very busy day. The prime minister is holding a press conference at 3.45pm in the PMO courtyard, the most serious of press conference locations. The Senate inquiry into the sports grants affair has been extended until 24 June. For the context: Question time ends. It\u2019s time for the matter of public importance \u2013 which is on sports grants. Pat Conroy starts with \u201cthis is a corrupt government, this is a corrupt government\u201d, which he is asked to withdraw. He does. Changing it to \u201cthis is a government that oversees corrupt processes\u201d, which someone tries to make him withdraw, but it is allowed. This is also because Labor is using it as well, moving to shut down members from the government from speaking, in revenge for the government shutting down its members. Here is the latest motion to be shut down: That the House: 1) notes: a) Sport Australia has told the Parliament today that it provided a brief to Senator McKenzie on 3 April 2019 recommending 245 sports projects be approved; b) Senator McKenzie wrote to the Prime Minister on 10 April, the day before he called the election, attaching a spreadsheet with projects she intended to approve by electorate, including party details; c) on 11 April, the day the Prime Minister called the election, Senator McKenzie provided a brief to Sport Australia dated 4 April approving 228 projects for funding; d) 73 per cent of projects approved by Senator McKenzie were not recommended by Sport Australia; e) Sport Australia received the approved sports rorts list from Senator McKenzie after the election had been called and after caretaker conventions had commenced; f) the Government approved a $50,000 grant to the Sans Souci Football Club in the Prime Minister\u2019s own electorate despite the fact the project had already been built, had already been officially opened and was therefore ineligible for funding; and g) the Prime Minister is the masterchef of cooking the books; and 2) declares the Prime Minister has repeatedly misled the Parliament and he should have the integrity to correct the record as required by House practice; and 3) calls on the Prime Minister to provide a full and frank account as to why he has used taxpayer money to advance his own Government\u2019s partisan political interests. Labor has returned to the signed brief of sports grants, asking how it could have been signed on 4 April if Bridget McKenzie only sought the prime minister\u2019s feedback on 10 April. Mathias Cormann rejected the characterisation of communication with the PMO on 10 April, explaining communication was to \u201cmake arrangements with respect to announcements\u201d. Asked what steps Scott Morrison took to assure himself the brief was not backdated, Cormann pointed to the Sport Australia evidence the brief was \u201cdated 4 April\u201d. Asked if he can rule out that the brief was backdated, Cormann again pointed to the Sport Australia evidence the brief was \u201cdated 4 April\u201d. The standard of \u2018debate\u2019 in the Australian parliament today: Anthony Albanese is now moving a motion to suspend standing orders, over the sports grants revelations today. It will fail. Scott Briggs, a close ally of Scott Morrison, has left the board of a consortium bidding for the highly controversial contract to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system. Briggs, a former deputy director of the New South Wales Liberal party, was heading up a consortium named Australia Visa Processing, which was one of the frontrunners for the $1bn visa processing contract. Briggs is also a former colleague of the current immigration minister, David Coleman. The Guardian recently revealed that the Liberals had mistakenly disclosed a $165,000 donation from a separate company set up by Briggs, Southern Strategy. The donation was initially declared but then scrubbed from the party\u2019s donation records after questions from the Guardian. Labor\u2019s Andrew Giles has seized on Briggs\u2019 departure, saying it shows the \u201ccomplete chaos\u201d of the government\u2019s plan to privatise the visa system. \u201cWe also know fundamentally that this is just a bad idea,\u201d Giles told reporters this morning. \u201cAustralians don\u2019t want our visa system sold off to the highest bidder. Even Peta Credlin has acknowledged that this is a threat \u2013 not only to our national security, but our border security.\u201d Corporate documents confirm Briggs is no longer a director of Australian Visa Processing. The Australian Financial Review reported that he has taken a job with DPG Advisory Solutions, a lobbying firm headed by David Gazard. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Why did the government approve a $50,000 grant to the Sans Souci Football Club, in his own electorate, despite the fact the project had already been built, had already been officially opened, and was ineligible for funding? Isn\u2019t the prime minister the MasterChef of cooking the books when it comes to the corrupt sports rorts scheme? And there\u2019s the project opening ... (he shows a prop and is shut down). Morrison: Thank you. Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I\u2019m sure the member would be able to find out by reading the report, the project was approved for funding by the then minister for sport based on its assessed eligibility by Sport Australia. \u201cRort, rort, rort,\u201d yells Ed Husic, loud enough to be heard across the building. The problem is \u2013 the projects were not ineligible when they were put forward by Sport Australia. But the minister\u2019s office took so long to make any decisions, by the time the grants were awarded, almost half the projects were ineligible. Labor has asked about Damian Drum roping the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, in to help keep the DP Jones aged care centre in Murchison open, as first reported by Guardian Australia. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, confirmed that Drum arranged for McCormack to visit on 31 October and explained that a grant was given because the circumstances were \u201cquite unique\u201d and it needed a \u201ctailored solution\u201d. The centre had connections to other community services including a doctor, community house and pharmacist, he said. Colbeck explained the government wanted a new provider to take the centre over and that \u201cadditional resources were provided to extend the period of administration so negotiations with prospective providers could be undertaken\u201d. No real answer was given on the question of whether McCormack lobbied the prime minister. Indirectly Colbeck rejected the idea the move was to shore up Drum\u2019s vote in the Nationals party room, by again repeating it was done to keep the centre open. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister, who has claimed in this parliament that the approval of the corrupt sports rorts scheme was made on 4 April. How is that consistent with the fact that the audit office has found that Senator McKenzie wrote to the prime minister, advising him of projects she intended to approve on 10 April, prior to her providing the documentation on 11 April? If you weren\u2019t in charge, why was the minister asking for your permission? Morrison: The member is unaware, I think, of the way this program operated. (very loud interjections) ... Mr Speaker, as I have advised the House on numerous occasions, the decision-maker in this process was the minister for sport, not the prime minister. There was no authorisation provided by me as prime minister on the projects. Those authorisations were provided on 4 April, according to the approval of the brief by Senator McKenzie, on that date, as advised by Sport Australia. Peter Dutton has also picked up on the word of the day \u201cplan\u201d, saying it at least 13 times in three minutes (and seven seconds \u2013 he was given extra time after being interrupted). Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister and I say, given the audit office and Sport Australia have both confirmed that the sports rorts projects were approved on 11 April, the day the election was called, why was the brief approving the project backdated by the government by a week to 4 April? Didn\u2019t the government know the decision was dodgy and it was trying to cover its tracks? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The leader of the opposition is being untruthful. He\u2019s being completely untruthful. The brief from Senator McKenzie that actually provides, gives the authority, for the approval of these projects, Sport Australia confirmed was dated 4 April 2019. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, who just told parliament that Senator McKenzie provided the advice on 4 April. Doesn\u2019t this directly contradict the Sport Australia evidence today in the Senate that this advice was provided at 8.46am on the day the parliament called the election? Will the prime minister correct the mislead of this parliament? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I don\u2019t accept the leader of the opposition\u2019s mischaracterisation of this at all. The leader ... I hope the leader of the opposition was more truthful when he appeared as a witness at the criminal conspiracy trial, Mr Speaker ... Tony Burke interrupts with a relevance point, but Morrison is allowed to continue. Morrison: I will repeat what I said earlier. Sport Australia advised the committee this morning that they received a brief from Senator McKenzie that was dated 4 April 2019. That\u2019s what occurred. While we enter the 10th circle of hell, which is another \u201calternative plan\u201d dixer, it might be worth popping back to the 90-second statements made ahead of question time, where the LNP MP Ross Vasta decided today, of all days, was the perfect time to talk about a sports club grant (which was awarded under the community development grant program): I would like to congratulate the Australian Academy of Martial Arts on the official opening of their new training facility, or dojo, in Mount Gravatt last week. As AAMA continue to grow, the need for a new dojo became apparent when they approached me about community grants. I was more than happy to help. I was very pleased to be able to support this upgrade with a $185,000 Morrison government grant to help the club continue its 47-year legacy in the Mount Gravatt community. At the official opening, I met with AAMA founder, Shihan Graham Keller, who provided us with a special martial arts demonstration. With a 47-year legacy in the region, it\u2019s so important that we support our local sporting clubs to help them remain a part of their community for years to come. The funding contribution from our government not only helped build this fantastic new dojo but it also means the volunteer-operated club will be able to continue offering affordable karate tuition fees for families. Martial arts is a great inclusive sport for women, children and families. Teaching philosophies such as courtesy, self-discipline, self-defence and fitness, I\u2019m glad the Morrison government is helping AAMA continue its teachings in the community for all ages and abilities. I also would like to acknowledge the state government and the Brisbane city council for their contribution to complete this project. An inclusive community is a happy community. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question again goes to the prime minister, and I refer to his previous answer. How could the minister\u2019s decision be made on 4 April if Senator McKenzie sought the agreement of the prime minister and his office on 10 April? Can the prime minister guarantee that the document by minister McKenzie was not backdated? Morrison: Mr Speaker, as I responded earlier, as Sport Australia advised the committee this morning, Senator McKenzie\u2019s authority, approval, of the projects was dated and provided on 4 April 2019. Mr Speaker, what the member has suggested is that there was some requirement for the prime minister ... (There are interjections.) Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. The premise of the member\u2019s question is false. The prime minister is not the decision-maker in relation to the program that he has suggested. As I\u2019ve said on numerous occasions, the authority for making, the ministerial authority on these decisions was the minister for sport. The minister for sport, Mr Speaker, authorised those arrangements, and that authorisation is dated 4 April 2019. Siri, show me what fudging looks like. And the idea of a wellbeing budget has been floated previously \u2013 by Josh Frydenberg\u2019s own side of politics. Here is Tim Fischer, the former Nationals leader and deputy prime minister, writing in the Australian in 2006: Jigme Singye Wangchuck also created the concept of gross national happiness, not as some vague feel-good dogma for meditation but as a serious attempt to ensure government policies reached beyond the fiscal to ensure general wellbeing and happiness. It is based on four carefully worked out pillars to give gross national happiness great depth and is now used by Indigo Shire in northeast Victoria. The concept is being taken up worldwide, especially in Canada, which has introduced gross national happiness in the form of a quarterly index timed to match the four seasons. Government MPs are now wetting themselves laughing over yoga positions. Tim Wilson almost breaks his desk he slaps it so hard. Josh Frydenberg: So, I thought to myself, what position would he be assuming at the dispatch box? Was it position number five, the downward dog, Mr Speaker? No. Was it position number six, the reclining pigeon, Mr Speaker? No, no, no, no. Position number seven, Mr Speaker, the twisted deer, Mr Speaker. But then the vision came to me, then the vision came to me through the incense, Mr Speaker. What was the position, number eight? It was the sleeping swan, Mr Speaker! He comes with an illustration, but is told to put it away. I know I have harped on about this, but it is really, really disappointing the treasurer is continuing with this attack. It\u2019s been every day this week now, and it\u2019s low. Because we know governments should be looking at the wellbeing of their people. It\u2019s one of their main jobs. And there are plenty of examples of western nations, similar to our own, which have put out a statement, with the budget, listing how it applies to improving the welfare of the people. Laughing about yoga poses, elements of eastern cultures and religions, and the idea of looking after the most vulnerable people in our society is not only juvenile, it shows contempt for large sections of the community the government claims to represent. Josh Frydenberg: And they are inspired, they are inspired by their spiritual leader, the member for Rankin, Mr Speaker. The member for Rankin, Mr Speaker. And I was thinking yesterday, I was thinking yesterday, as the member for Rankin was coming into the chamber fresh from his ashram deep in the mountains of the Himalayas, barefoot into the chamber, robes flowing, incense burning, beads in one hand, wellbeing budget in the other, I thought to myself, what would the yoga position that the member for Rankin would assume? Tony Burke asks about relevance. Tony Smith: The question did ask about alternative policies, and, uh ... I\u2019m listening very closely. I\u2019m just going to point out to the treasurer that no one would enter the chamber in the way he says, because it would breach the dress code in the standing orders. Josh Frydenberg is once again heaping shit on the idea of a wellbeing budget. How good is a government that cares? Labor\u2019s first two questions in the Senate are about the timeline of Sport Australia receiving the final list of projects to receive sports grants at 8.46am on 11 April 2019, 17 minutes after parliament was prorogued and the government entered caretaker mode. Anthony Chisholm suggests this was a \u201cbreach of the caretaker conventions\u201d. Mathias Cormann: \u201cThe minister did nothing of the sort.\u201d Cormann notes Sport Australia\u2019s evidence that although it RECEIVED the brief on 11 April, it was DATED 4 April. Chisholm suggests this was \u201cbackdated\u201d to 4 April after Bridget McKenzie sought feedback from the prime minister on 10 April. Cormann repeats it was \u201cdated\u201d 4 April and accuses Labor of making \u201cfalse assertions\u201d. Dated or backdated \u2013 who to believe? Andrew Wilkie to Michael McCormack: Deputy prime minister, following the shocking deaths of thousands of sheep aboard the Awassi Express in 2017, some weak reforms to the live animal export industry were announced. But it now turns out that, despite most Australians still opposing this cruel trade, even the flimsy reforms have been quietly dumped. Deputy prime minister, this week, why did you ignore the advice of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and approve a live animal export ship failing ventilation requirements? And how can the community ever believe that the government cares about animal welfare when even the half-baked safeguards we do have are ignored on a ministerial whim? McCormack (who is reading from this answer, very diligently): Mr Speaker, there is a commitment to phasing out two-tier vessels for live sheep exports. A ban on two-tier vessels was implemented through marine order 43, as the member for Clark would be aware, on 1 January. Where existing vessel operators require further transition time and can demonstrate genuine intent to comply with the new standards, they are able to apply for limited and temporary extensions for two-tier decks carrying sheep. Any application will be considered on a case-by-case basis, individually. They must say why they are unable to meet deck heights. As a condition for any exemption, any exemption whatsoever, exporters will also need to have an animal welfare management plan that has been approved by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment. My department has been working very, very closely with the livestock transport trading company, the exemption applicant, since 18 December last year, to agree to a plan to enable them to meet the requirements under marine order 43, with clear milestones to ensure that they are meeting their commitments. And my department consulted with AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, as the administrator of marine orders, including number 43. AMSA did not \u2013 I repeat, did not \u2013 advise against the exemption application. The operator has committed to a timetable to comply with the requirements and has agreed arrangements to manage animal welfare with the department of agriculture. Now, on this basis, I have approved one temporary exemption to the twin-tier requirements for the vessel. The House should note that the exemption only relates to twin-tier requirements. It is only in relation to this decking and associated ventilation, and only for sheep. If the vessel doesn\u2019t comply with the agreed requirement, the exemption will be revoked. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that 73% of the projects approved by Senator McKenzie in the spreadsheet she provided to him were not recommended by Sport Australia, and that he obtained the spreadsheet from Senator McKenzie the day before he called the election? Morrison: What I can confirm is what I have just said previously in answer to the previous question, and that the authority for approving those projects was signed, dated 4 April 2019, for the third round of community sport infrastructure grants, Mr Speaker. I can also confirm that the emails in relation to these matters in question were tabled on 13 February in compliance with an order for the production of documents from the Senate. The emails reflect general communication in the program, including the coordination of events and media engagements. In related news, my eye has twitched so hard, it\u2019s now flying around the room. Paul Karp tells me Labor is asking the same questions in the Senate about the sports grants affair \u2013 and is getting the same answers. Michael McCormack is delivering a dixer with the dazzle of a poorly tuned piano, and Christian Porter looks like he is drifting off to his happy place, which I assume is a mirror. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. The prime minister has claimed his only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was passing along information. Why, then, on the day before he called the election did the prime minister obtain a colour-coded spreadsheet from Senator McKenzie with projects she intended to approve, listed by party and electorate? Morrison: I would refer the member simply to the evidence provided today that Sport Australia advised the committee this morning that they received a brief from Senator McKenzie dated 4 April 2019, approving the third round of the community sport infrastructure grants. Scott Morrison is taking a dixer on the differences between a plan and a goal. Or something. He doesn\u2019t seem to be mentioning the plan for a surplus, which was ticked off as a goal achieved ahead of time, but now looks like it is going back in the aspiration column. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: The aged care minister has said about the closure of an aged care home in my electorate, decisions of this nature are a matter for the organisation\u2019s management, and refuses my community\u2019s request for assistance. How can that be the government\u2019s position when it gave more than half a million dollars to an aged care home in the member for Nicholls\u2019 electorate, to a home which is now closed? Greg Hunt takes it: One of the things that we have done is established a Business Improvement Fund for aged care facilities in rural and regional areas. That was something that was announced in January. And, in particular, we have established that program precisely to address the issue of aged care facilities in rural and regional areas that are facing pressures. And so that is what we have done. That fund is there. That is available to people from all electorates. ... But, directly in relation to the member\u2019s question, with regards to her facility, I\u2019m not aware of the dates or the details, which were not provided. I\u2019m happy to deal with them. But the Business Improvement Fund was announced in January. In relation to the other facts put forward, they are incorrect. I say that because the program, working with the administrator, with regards to Murchison, began last year and it\u2019s part of an ongoing program of working with the administrator. And it also has an independent contractor advising. Scott Morrison gets ahead of question time on indulgence to congratulate Bob Katter on his 50th wedding anniversary (he\u2019s not in the chamber). Anthony Albanese joins in on the congratulations, as does Tony Smith, who adds that the member\u2019s absence means \u201cone less difficult question I have to deal with\u201d. It\u2019s time for who\u2019s that MP? It\u2019s Andrew Wallace. He\u2019s an LNP backbencher from the Sunshine Coast. It\u2019s OK if you didn\u2019t know that. Asked about the Nationals (and some Liberals) who claim a net zero 2050 emissions target would bring about end of days, Trent Zimmerman tells the ABC: No one is saying that getting to 2050 with a net zero target is an easy task. It is a challenge. We know in many areas we are doing really well. One of the major forecasters predicted on the weekend that we will get to 84% renewables in the system by 2050 based on current policy settings. That is the type of work that we need to build on. We obviously have some important initiatives in place to encourage, for example, renewable energy entering the market. But there will be more that we have to do and it is working with those communities. I think getting the plans right, making sure they are feasible, is so important because the alternative approach, which Labor has done, announcing a policy without any plans to back it up, actually creates an understandable anger within part of the community. On the subject of a 2050 net zero emissions target though, Trent Zimmerman is a lot more bolshie. I think it is a target we need to look at. We have a good target for 2030 but we need to look beyond that as we head into Glasgow. There is obviously a lot of interest around the world of a net zero target, but I also accept the basic proposition that targets are meaningless unless you have the plan to actually outline to the community how you are going to deliver it. That is why I support the government doing its due diligence, outlining a roadmap that will be released very soon, and being able to assure the community that firstly it is achievable, not just basically a target without backing, and secondly it will provide opportunities for Australians going forward. I think if we get it right, this will provide more opportunities. Trent Zimmerman is speaking to the ABC about the North Sydney pool, which received funding from a government program set aside for regional projects: In relation to the swimming pool projects, I can only speak about my own experience, and in this case you had an internationally famous pool used by tens of thousands of Sydneysiders and visitors that on the advice of the local council was at risk of actually failing and being forced to close. The council has already had to start restricting access to its grandstands. So the need for funding for projects like this I think is very tangible. In this case, the council provided to us a detailed cost assessment of detailed data analysis in that form the basis for us being able to make that election commitment. From the sports grants program, there have been lessons, we are committed to implementing the auditor general public recommendations and that is exactly what we would do. We are in the downhill slide to question time \u2013 because obviously time flies when you are slowly dying inside. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to work out that sports grants will feature fairly prominently. Labor has also backed the government\u2019s small and medium business fund. From AAP: Small and medium businesses will soon be able to access a new $540m investment fund to stimulate growth. Labor will back the coalition government\u2019s election promise, paving the way for legislation to pass federal parliament. Eligible Australian businesses will be able to access investments of between $5m and $15m, provided they can demonstrate three years of growth and profitability. The Australian Business Growth Fund will get $100m from taxpayers with each of the big four banks matching the contribution. HSBC and Macquarie Group will tip in $20m apiece to give the fund an initial $540m, which is estimated to rise to $1bn as it matures. Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson criticised spending $100m of public money on a fund run by the big banks. \u201cWhy give them a leg up by essentially giving them control of an enormously influential private equity fund in the area of small and medium enterprise financing,\u201d he told parliament. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick raised concerns the fund\u2019s investment instructions were not public. \u201cIt begs the question, why do you ask the Senate to vote on it when we are blind to the mandate,\u201d he said. A Labor motion to set up a Senate inquiry into Holden\u2019s withdrawal from Australia has passed. The inquiry will look at: (a) The impacts of that decision on: (i) Holden employees. (ii) The Holden dealership network (small and medium sized businesses and family enterprises, and their employees). (iii) The Holden research and development facilities. (iv) Owners of Holden vehicles (including service and repair) (b) The role of the Franchise Code and the Government\u2019s proposed dealership amendments to the Franchise Code. (c) Government or other policy settings on manufacturing, research and development, business support and transition, and employee support. (d) Any related matters. Brendan O\u2019Connor says it is necessary: We are losing one of Australia\u2019s most loved and iconic brands due in part to the inaction of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. The prime minister needs to do more than just \u2018watch\u2019 and take action to ensure the 200 dealers and 9,000 workers are properly supported. If only this government could find some of the enthusiasm it used to goad Holden to leave Australia, and channel it into supporting small businesses and their staff. This motion, from Larissa Waters, just failed the Senate \u2013 the day after a vigil for Hannah Clarke and her children was held in parliament: Pauline Hanson called a vote on the motion (Waters puts forward this motion every fortnight, with the updated figure of women who have been killed in domestic and family violence incidents \u2013 a lot of the time it is passed on the voices). Once the vote was called, Hanson, Malcolm Roberts, the government and Jacqui Lambie voted it down. The Senate notes that: (a) Since the last sitting of the Senate, two more women have been killed by violence in Australia taking the national toll since the start of 2020 to nine, as reported by Counting Dead Women Australia from Destroy The Joint. (b) There is no national government reporting program to record the ongoing toll of women killed by violence in real time and ensure that these horrifying statistics receive ongoing public attention. (c) On average, one woman is murdered every week by her current or former partner. (d) According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey 2016: (i) More than 370,000 Australian women are subjected to violence from men each year. (ii) 1 in 3 Australian women has experienced physical violence. (iii) 1 in 5 Australian women has experienced sexual violence. (iv) 1 in 6 Australian women has experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner. (v) 1 in 4 Australian women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. (vi) Australian women are nearly three times more likely than men to experience violence from an intimate partner. And: (vii) Australian women are 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalised for assault injuries arising from family and domestic violence than men, with hospitalisation rates rising by 23% since 2014-2015. (The motion continued, you can find it here). The baboons live on. However his baby making abilities, do not. And the hearing ends. It will resume tomorrow, where the department of health and Kate Palmer, the former chief executive of Sport Australia, will appear. Sports Australia\u2019s Luke McCann tells Katy Gallagher he met with the minister\u2019s office and the department of health ahead of today\u2019s appearance, where the Anao report was discussed. He says it was a general discussion. Sport Australia witnesses have said in the third and final round of the community sport infrastructure grant program, it recommended 225 projects on 3 April, the minister approved 228, but there were only 61 projects in common. This explains why the Australian National Audit Office found a massive discrepancy, with 73% of projects funded by the minister but not recommended by Sport Australia. There\u2019s also more detail on timing. The final list went to the prime minister\u2019s office on 10 April. On 11 April, Sport Australia received a signed brief from Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office, signed and dated 4th April. Labor is trying to establish: Why there were lots of changes at the last minute Whether the minister waited for input from the prime minister Why the minister dated the approval 4 April, if it was only provided to Sport Australia at 8:46am 11 April, 17 minutes after the government entered caretaker mode. Ian Thorpe has joined the campaign against the religious discrimination bill. Thorpe says his preference is the bill be scrapped, to ensure protections for LGBTI people are maintained. The federation chamber was shut down for \u201cdisorderly behaviour\u201d \u2013 which was Labor moving to shut down government MPs from speaking. At least according to the deputy speaker, Trent Zimmerman: I made it clear before the federation chamber was suspended that the type of conduct that we\u2019re seeing this morning has been deemed by the Speaker to be an abuse of the forms of the House and disorderly conduct. I alerted to the chamber to the consequences of this continuing. I\u2019m therefore deeming that the Federation Chamber is experiencing disorderly behaviour, according to standing order 187. I therefore adjourn the Federation Chamber until 10.30 am on Monday 2 March. Ed Husic, who may now be able to call himself a regional MP, given that North Sydney has received a grant from a regional fund (with the justification from the mayor being, well, the pool is used by regional people) managed to bring some Husic humour to the situation in the chamber this morning: We found out that $10 million was spent by this government for \u2018the noted country town of North Sydney\u2019 so that it could get a swimming pool upgrade, which is fantastic! When challenged on why North Sydney got $10 million, in another example of the rorts that have been uncovered in the last few months, the mayor described this as a totally justifiable decision on the basis that people from the country would swim in North Sydney and this would justify a regional grant. I\u2019ve heard of Pitt Street farmers but not Boorowa backstrokers \u2013 and that\u2019s what this is facilitating in this place. The member for North Sydney is singing \u2018I\u2019ve been everywhere man\u2019 \u2013 from Waverton to Wollstonecraft, from Mosman to Artarmon, from Chatswood to Cremorne, from Naremburn to Castlecrag! This is a joke. It goes to show you how bad this government is when they try to funnel into North Sydney $10m of money that was supposed to support the regions. But who knows, this could be a plan by the member for North Sydney to usurp the deputy prime minister by becoming a National party MP in North Sydney. I think this is what we are looking at; they could have a National party MP from North Sydney. That\u2019s the type of A-grade rorting that the National party has become renowned for \u2013 and now they\u2019re bringing it to North Sydney. What an absolute embarrassment it is that you could use taxpayer funds in that way. Leftwing warrior Peter Dutton (leftwing is all things, according to the home affairs minister, who once said annoying \u201cdirty lefties\u201d was \u201ctoo easy\u201d, has bolstered his leftwing credentials by backing a change to the national anthem. Cathy Freeman has backed changing \u201cwe are young and free\u201d to \u201cwe are one and free\u201d, given that Australia\u2019s Indigenous people represent one of the oldest cultures in the world. Dutts is into it. WITHIN REASON. I think there should be a conversation about it. I don\u2019t have any opposition to it,\u201d he told Ray Hadley. I don\u2019t know whether it starts a slippery slope, if people want to change other parts or drop off other verses.\u201d But then reverts back to full Dutts. It annoys me beyond description when you see athletes representing our country and refuse to sing the national anthem. I think it\u2019s an outrage.\u201d Yup. THAT\u2019S the outrage. Sarah Hanson-Young won the Greens hunger games and retains environment as one of her portfolio areas. (There was some scuttlebutt she may have lost it following the leadership change.) So the redacted portfolio change is ... dental health. So the SA senator will now have responsibility for environment, water, and dental health. The more you know. Turns out there have been a few instances of \u201ccovering your arse\u201d entered into the hansard over the years. Which makes sense. This is Australia after all. 09 Jun 1999 \u2013 Stephen Conroy Mr Spier \u2014We do not, senator. I think that is playing with semantics. We cannot say in all cases or in no cases \u2014 Senator Conroy \u2014 You are covering your arse I know. I am now asking you to tell us in which cases you consider the introduction of a GST will see an increase of 10%. And if you are saying there are not any, then why do you qualify it in the letter? 29 Apr 2011- TURNER, Ms Robin Leslie, Member, Apology Alliance Australia Chair: Of your son? Ms Turner : Of my son. I think in today\u2019s world that is called covering your arse. Mike Bowers has attempted to show you the shut down Federation Chamber, but we can\u2019t, because \u2013 p a r l i a m e n t. This was the official response to the request: I\u2019m afraid photography in the Federation Chamber is only permitted to take still photographs of proceedings. That doesn\u2019t include when the government has cancelled proceedings, apparently. Some interesting evidence just now about how the program evolved over time: In the first round, Sport Australia provided Bridget McKenzie with the raw scores of 1,924 projects it had assessed, and a list of projects that already reflected projects the minister was \u201csupportive of\u201d. That is, it did not provide an independent list of its own recommendations. Luke McCann: \u201cThe minister was advising us which grant applications she was supportive of.\u201d But by round three, Sport Australia provided \u201ca list of our recommendations\u201d. McCann: \u201cIn our view, as we worked through the iterative process, we needed to be better at providing our advice, to be consistent with better practice.\u201d So, in the first round Sport Australia was accommodating the minister\u2019s wishes, and by the last round, it wanted it ON RECORD what their independent view was. Sport Australia witnesses reject the suggestion they had worked out the program was a \u201crort\u201d and wanted their view on record. A petition to evacuate the remaining 200 or so Australians still trapped in Wuhan has collected more than 600 signatures in less than a day. Earlier, Guardian Australia broke the story of the 18-month toddler, Chloe Luo, who is still trapped in the locked-down Hubei province, as well as 78-year old Garry Ridder and many more. This is despite the evacuation flights supposedly prioritising \u201cthe isolated and vulnerable\u201d, according to Scott Morrison. So far more than 500 Australians have already been evacuated out of Wuhan, across two Australian government flights, and 170 have been evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. But the government says there are no plans for a third evacuation flight out of Wuhan. \u201cThese people should be treated the same as those Australians from Hubei and 170 from [the] Japan cruise who have already safely returned home,\u201d the petition says. The Greens are making a portfolio reshuffle announcement at 11.30. This is how they announced it. WHO: - Leader of the Australian Greens Adam Bandt MP - Australian Greens Spokesperson for \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 Sarah Hanson-Young The federation chamber has been adjourned for the rest of the day (it\u2019s the chamber where overflow speeches from debates go) after it was shut down by Labor motions seven times yesterday. I know this seems a little inside baseball, but a parliamentary chamber has been closed down over a debate about parliamentary debate. Labor is moving to close down a member speaking in the House of Representatives. It\u2019s Gladys Liu this time. That brings a division, which means all the MPs have to file into the House. Janet Rice has been probing what the purpose of the blank forms provided by Sport Australia were, and whether they were connected to the new (/late) applications that lobbed shortly thereafter. Luke McCann confirms that Sport Australia records indicate the forms were \u201cfor new applications to be submitted under a potential round three\u201d. After Sport Australia raised concerns on 5 March, the minister\u2019s office advised they were \u201cfor the purpose of advocating in the budget process\u201d. Rice asked if Sport Australia felt it had been \u201clied to\u201d. McCann responds that they took the minister\u2019s office \u201cat face value\u201d and it was \u201cnot for [him] to comment\u201d on whether the blank forms were used to help five new clubs apply late. Yup. A whip\u2019s alert has just gone out. WHIP\u2019S ALERT 27 FEB \u2013 THE FEDERATION CHAMBER HAS BEEN ADJOURNED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. The federation chamber has been suspended (at around 10.04am). This dates back to a battle the opposition and government are waging against each other. Because Labor\u2019s attempts to debate the sports grants (and other matters) keep getting shut down, it has been calling divisions on government MPs to shut down their speeches. That has been annoying a lot of government backbenchers \u2013 they don\u2019t get to deliver their speeches that they put on their social media, plus, quorums keep getting called, so they have to stop whatever business they are doing and run into the chamber. Labor is making the point that stopping debate is really fricking annoying and goes against democratic principles. Sensing that Labor would continue its tactics today, the government has taken the step of just shutting the chamber down. The parliament has passed a bill changing how welfare recipients report their income. From AAP: Welfare recipients will now report income as it appears on a payslip rather than estimating a figure based on hours worked over a fortnight. Legislation passed the Senate on Thursday making changes to Centrelink reporting expected to save the federal budget $2.1bn over four years. People reporting income to Centrelink currently have to estimate a figure based on how many hours worked in a fortnight and rate of pay, taking into account penalty rates. Under the new system, which will come into place in July, welfare recipients will be able to enter details on their payslips. The changes would also allow welfare recipients\u2019 employment and income data to be pre-filled online, the same as tax returns. The government hopes Centrelink payments will become more accurate, preventing people being owed money or paid too much. Labor amended the bill to include a one-year review of the new system, meaning it will return to the lower house for final approval. An online portal will be set up to help people with the change, with videos and written examples to help explain the system. The changes will impact about 550,000 Australians. The bill also marks the start of single-touch payroll for welfare recipients. That means a person\u2019s income data from the Australian Taxation Office will be automatically uploaded to the government system so bureaucrats can double-check figures. It comes after the government\u2019s robodebt debacle saw many people served with notices for money they didn\u2019t owe. The system, which has now been wound back, was recently declared unlawful by the federal court and is the subject of a separate class-action lawsuit. This explanation is not going to age well. Katy Gallagher has asked Sport Australia when Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office sent back the final list of her decisions on round three of grant funding. A brief went from Sport Australia to McKenzie on 4 April 2019, the prime minister\u2019s office gave some feedback on 10 April, and Luke McCann replies that McKenzie\u2019s final decision came through at 8:46am on 11 April 2019. Gallagher suggests that parliament was dissolved at 8:30am and \u201cwe were in caretaker at that point in time\u201d. McCann says he was not aware of this. John Wylie says he won\u2019t comment on the \u201clegal basis\u201d minister Bridget McKenzie used to award the grants. The auditor general wrote in its report that it was \u201cunclear\u201d what the legal basis was. Wylie says he won\u2019t comment on the minister\u2019s legal basis, but he is confident that Sports Australia acted appropriately. Eric Abetz is probing how 272 projects were assessed as eligible by Sport Australia but then became ineligible by the time funding agreements were signed. Luke McCann suggests that although eligibility criteria stated work must not have commenced, applicants were confused about the \u201cinterpretation of commencement\u201d. He suggested that if the audit office took a \u201cvery narrow interpretation\u201d even seeking a development approval may result in a project being ineligible. But McCann then conceded he didn\u2019t know how the ANAO assessed 272 projects were ineligible (43%). Clubs were \u201cexplicitly advised\u201d they should not commence work until an agreement was signed, and this was defined as \u201cundertaking of any activities that contribute to physical upgrades ... this includes site clearing, earth works, building works, or any form of early works\u201d. This doesn\u2019t sound like a DA would make a project ineligible. Nevertheless, Abetz summarises that this sounds like \u201ctechnicalities at their absolute worst\u201d being used to describe projects as ineligible. There was an interesting short exchange in the hearing that reflects the different starting points of Sports Australia and the minister. The Liberal senator Eric Abetz has been trying to set up an argument that Bridget McKenzie had discretion to approve these sports grants under criteria she considered important. Abetz asked the Sports Australia chairman John Wylie whether he thought it would have been fair if 20% of electorates had missed out on money. Wylie said distribution of funds across electorates wasn\u2019t a consideration for bureaucrats engaged in a merit selection process. Considering what\u2019s going to to particular electorates is \u201cnot our job\u201d, Wylie notes Then there was this gem from Richard Colbeck: And the actual transcript from the committee hearing where the auditor general\u2019s office DID correct Eric Abetz: Eric Abetz: Thank you. I just wanted to clarify that. The next issue I seek to clarify: you found that no ineligible project or application was funded? Brian Boyd: No, that\u2019s not what we found. To go to the start of chapter 3, which is the chapter on assessment, the finding there was: ineligible applications were identified and no applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding. That\u2019s the Sport Australia eligibility assessment process. What then happened was that late applications were taken on board, which were ineligible under the guidelines; amendments were made for existing applications, which were ineligible under the guidelines, and they were funded. But at the time, to say this relates to the Sport Australia assessment process, Sport Australia removed from its list those it assessed as ineligible \u2013 that\u2019s what that finding is. Subsequent letters say there were the five new applications and the four amended applications. Then, because things took longer, because you were now running two rounds rather than three and funding agreements were in place, you had eight projects where, according to the details provided by the proponent, the project had been completed before the funding grant was signed. They\u2019re ineligible under the program. There were 270-something where the project had started before the funding agreement was in place, which is also ineligible under the program. We get to around 43% of those which were awarded funding which by the time the funding agreement was signed were ineligible. Sport Australia has explained why Bridget McKenzie approved late applications for a number of projects, and for the most part it\u2019s because they had won state government funding but needed federal funding as well. Luke McCann explained: Katanning Country club: the Western Australian state government indicated support if it received federal funding. Westbury bowling club: the club was unable to utilise the green for six months of the year due to drainage, which was \u201cnot viable for club in a small town\u201d. The club would close which would be \u201cdevastating on the community\u201d. Belgrave reserve netball: had grown exponentially and the minister believed the project was \u201cvital to the continuation of the club\u201d. Yeppoon swans: had concrete cancer in their light poles, they needed to remove lights, and without a grant their fields would be unusable except in daylight. Nagambie foreshore walk: the Victorian state government would contribute majority if federal government supported it. Pennant Hills AFL: got $1m from NSW state government but the project wouldn\u2019t proceed without federal government funding. Eric Abetz is now asking questions. It was the Liberal senator\u2019s questioning at the last hearing which revealed that almost half of the projects funded by the program were ineligible under the rules, by the time the minister\u2019s office granted funding. Fantastic. Great move. Well done Eric. Chair John Wylie says it\u2019s the view of Sports Australia that Bridget McKenzie was the decision-maker, under the rules. Of the 2,000 applications made, 1,300 clubs missed out. John Wylie, chair of Sports Australia, said it showed \u201cdue stewardship\u201d of the community sports infrastructure grant program by raising risks with the minister (Bridget McKenzie\u2019s) office. So far chief operating officer Luke McCann has given two instances of Sports Australia\u2019s Robin O\u2019Neil raising concerns: First on 5 December 2018 he \u201coutlined risks with the methodology and process, in terms of the approval process\u201d; And on 5 March 2019 he raised concerns that McKenzie\u2019s office had asked for an application form after applications had closed. Rob Dalton, acting chief executive officer, says Sports Australia was \u201ccomfortable risks were managed because we communicated them\u201d. Witnesses take on notice (1) if they can provide written minutes of its audit and risk committee and (2) whether the minister\u2019s office responded to the above concerns. Everyone repeats that the minister is the decision-maker, it\u2019s not Sports Australia\u2019s job to monitor how decisions are made. Speaking of the ABC, Lucy Barbour, a very excellent regional and rural affair reporter with the broadcaster, had a story this morning with Pat Conaghan calling for a raise to Newstart. The Cowper Nationals MP (mid-north coast NSW) has looked around and seen the growing poverty in his electorate and told Barbour it is beyond time the rate (basically $280 a week, a figure which has not changed in real terms for two decades) was raised. Conaghan has a fan in Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie: It\u2019s not right that in Australia, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, we have one in six children living below in the poverty line. One third of single parent families live in poverty in Australia and we know how hard it is for single parents, who are mostly women, to get by on Newstart while looking for paid work that allows for their caring responsibilities. By increasing Newstart, the government can reduce our unacceptable adult and child poverty rates, while boosting the economy to create jobs, especially in regional areas. In the wake of the devastating bushfires and drought, regional communities are really struggling and increasing Newstart is one of the best ways to kick start these local economies, creating jobs. Queensland LNP senator James McGrath, who is in a deadlocked battle with Amanda Stoker for the LNP\u2019s Liberal Senate spot, is continuing his battle against the ABC. The pair are attempting to out-conservative each other, as they fight for the number one spot on the ticket. The number two spot goes to a National. The number three spot is never guaranteed. So, in the grand tradition of Queensland sending young-fogies to Canberra, senator \u2018I don\u2019t know what the youth are into\u2019 McGrath, is waging war against the national broadcaster. It has taken a while (there was a very long introduction) but we have the first revelation. Sports Australia first raised concerns to Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office on 5 March (before the election, but when one was very much on the cards). Sports minister Richard Colbeck was asked about a North Sydney pool receiving $10m from a fund earmarked for regional facilities (so many Nationals will be just THRILLED to learn North Sydney is now regional). He told the ABC: I go back to the original statement that was said when the prime minister announced the project. They were clearly election commitments the administration of the program now is about delivering on the commitments that we made during the election campaign. (Also, points to anyone who could point out Colbeck in a lineup. No one does \u2018generic middle aged white guy\u2019 quite like the Australian parliament.) Just a reminder, given that it is technically #tbt \u2013 this entire sports grant affair was referred to the auditor general by Labor because someone thought it would be a great idea to allow Georgina Downer to present a giant novelty cheque with her face on it, to a sports club, while she was just a candidate. Sports Australia is up today. Featured are: John Wylie, chair Robert Dalton, acting chief executive officer Luke McCann, chief operating officer Meanwhile, from a MP who spent the summer watching the impacts of climate change \u2013 worsening natural disasters \u2013 comes this story. Labor\u2019s Mike Kelly, the member for Eden-Monaro, spoke to SBS news about his summer. And why he believes the climate change \u201cdebate\u201d in the political class is \u201ccriminal\u201d. A vigil was held for Hannah Clarke and her children, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey, last night in parliament house. Scott Morrison: We acknowledge the Ngunnawal people past, present and [inaudible] future. We gather here tonight, there are no parties, there are no aisles, there are no MPs, or senators, staff, it is just people who are grieving and shocked and saddened, angry, frustrated. And the only words I can offer tonight are four names, Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah, and Trey. We must speak their names. We must remember their names. We must remember them, their souls, their lives, their hopes, their dreams, their strength, their courage. All of that was taken away in a murderous act of violence, which none of us here can comprehend. We\u2019ve just sung Amazing Grace and I can only think that the only response is to seek to understand this, is just to understand grace [inaudible]. The families of Hannah and her children, they have shown such strength and such grace, and we want to stand with them here tonight. We stand with them, with our hearts and everything we have to let them know that they won\u2019t stand alone. But to all of those others who face the same dangers this day and every day, to those who have had the same thing stolen from them through murderous acts of violence in the past, we also remember you here tonight. And we gather, and we remember. We give thanks for what we each have, because times like this remind us of [inaudible]. I want to thank everybody for coming here tonight [inaudible] and the spirit in which we come. It\u2019s a good thing we do tonight, and I thank those who\u2019ve gathered us here tonight Back on Angus Taylor for a moment \u2013 the energy minister was also asked on ABC Breakfast if he had confidence none of his current or former staff altered the document which was used in a political attack against Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore: Q: Just one more question, really briefly if I may, because this is the first time we had the opportunity since the ADF continues for that investigation into that document. Do you have confidence that none of your current or former staff was used to falsifying the document you used against Clover Moore. Taylor: We had two police forces, the New South Wales police and the AFP considered and closed this matter. Q: I\u2019m asking you about you? Do you have ... Taylor: And closed this matter. There\u2019s a political referral from the Labor party. It\u2019s been considered twice over now. They have closed the matter. And I\u2019m focused on making sure we get Australia affordable, reliable energy while we bring down our emissions not just through to 2030, but beyond. That\u2019s my focus. That\u2019s what the Australian people want us as a government to do and me as the relevant minister to do and I\u2019ll keep focusing on that everyday. In case you haven\u2019t seen it, Chris Knaus has this story: The prime minister\u2019s department broke the law by inexplicably delaying a freedom of information request about allegations the former public service commissioner improperly aided the rightwing Institute of Public Affairs. Findings delivered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in November found the department had failed to process the FOI in legal timeframes, according to documents obtained by the Guardian. It was a recurring problem at the department in 2017/18. The OAIC found the department met the legally-imposed deadlines in just 35% of FOIs that year. Anthony Albanese was very quick out of the blocks this morning. He stopped by doors (which MPs only go through when they have something to say to the media). This prime minister treats the parliament with contempt. There are real questions to answer about his office and his involvement with this sports rorts sage. The fact is that there were 136 emails between his office and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office. The fact is a list given to his office by the minister\u2019s office in stage three of which 76% of the projects chosen were not those chosen by Sport Australia. And the fact is, the prime minister continues to mislead parliament. He says that all projects were eligible. What we thought was, \u2018Well, what does that mean anyway?\u2019 Because I\u2019m eligible to play the Davis Cup, but I won\u2019t get to play because I am not as good as another 20,000 players who could be chosen ahead of me around Australia. But, this prime minister didn\u2019t even get that right. Because we know that in 43% of cases, in terms of this sports rorts saga, they weren\u2019t eligible projects. And we heard that from the Australian National Audit Office. Then we know that there was actually these colour-coded documents that were going between Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office. But Mr Gaetjens, the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff, who was investigating as head of Prime Minister and Cabinet, whether the prime minister\u2019s office had any involvement, only got one copy of the colour-coded list, which was colour-coded in terms of rort here, rort there. And we saw yesterday, the prime minister speak about members making applications on behalf of their electorates. Bear in mind that this was taxpayers\u2019 funds. This wasn\u2019t election commitments. This is something that was in the budget. And he referred to the member for Lindsay, who of course, wasn\u2019t a member of parliament at that time. It just shows that the prime minister was saying that this was a Liberal party and National party fund, but it was actually taxpayers\u2019 funds. The prime minister treats taxpayers\u2019 funds as if they\u2019re his own. This is not a new conspiracy. Here is Graham Readfearn writing on it in 2014. What is damaging about it though, is that it is increasingly creeping into our political debate, lending it legitimacy. In case it has to be said, the BoM has not changed climate records as part of a global conspiracy to convince you that climate change is real. It is not part of a leftie/Illuminati/alien agenda to pull the wool over your eyes. Sometimes, the weather stations have to be moved. And when that happens, you make adjustments for changes in the environment. Any changes the bureau make, are peer-reviewed. They have to go through a rigorous, independent, academic process. As Readfearn reported in 2014: At Bourke, for example, the station had been moved three times in its history. Detective work had found that a noticeable shift in the readings in the 1950s had likely been due to changes in vegetation around the instrument. At Amberley, the bureau noticed a marked shift in the minimum temperatures it had been recording, which was also likely due to the station being moved. Another site at Rutherglen had data adjusted to account for two intervals \u2013 1966 and 1974 \u2013 when its thought the site was moved from close to buildings to low-flat ground. I\u2019ll let you know if they start selling tin-foil hats in the parliament gift shop. In the midst of that, George Christensen moved to extend Craig Kelly\u2019s speaking time. He was also denied. Kelly joins Liberal senator Gerard Rennick in accusing the Bureau of changing it\u2019s records. He hasn\u2019t received a briefing from the bureau or anything. But he did read someone from the IPA writing about it once, and that\u2019s good enough for him. And of course, there was Liberal senator Jim Molan\u2019s admission that he doesn\u2019t rely on evidence for his climate change views, which are \u2018he could be convinced\u2019 it is happening. But it is good that the government is completely as one that climate change is happening. Completely. As. One. Craig Kelly continues. Now, with a bigger audience: Kelly: I\u2019m pleased that the Labor party actually called that \u2013 because there are many members here in the chamber to hear these facts I\u2019m talking about. Our historic Marble Bar temperature record, the longest heatwave in the nation, the longest heatwave record in the world, is no longer \u2013 because our Bureau of Meteorology staff, sitting in their offices in Canberra, have looked back into the past and found that the people taking that temperature record almost 98 years ago made a mistake and measured it too hot. I will give you a few examples. On 7 March 1924, the raw recording at Marble Bar was 40.8C. But, as I said, 98 years later, someone sitting in an office in Canberra worked out that they made a mistake and the temperature was actually only 39C \u2013 1.8C cooler. On 15 February 1924, the raw recording from Marble Bar was 44.3C. Again, they didn\u2019t know what they were doing and they read it wrong; we know that because of the adjustments that have been made almost 100 years later. The true temperature, according to the BoM, was 43.2C, down 1.1C. Yet there was one day they actually got the temperature right. On 23 January 1924 they recorded 44C up at Marble Bar. Yet the bureau says that number was right! This cooling of the past temperature records has reduced that 160-day world record heatwave back in 1923-24 to 128 days, which makes it no longer a record (Tony Burke moves to adjourn the debate, but cannot): What a shame that the manager of opposition business doesn\u2019t want to hear the facts. Here we have a historic record that should make us all realise what our pioneers went through, living through the longest heatwave in history. But this is no longer. The past has been changed according to the Bureau of Meteorology. They know better today, sitting in an office 4,000 miles away, what the temperature was back in \u2013 (Time expired). Reading through the hansard from yesterday, and it seems Craig Kelly has dived wholeheartedly into the exciting range of tin foil hats, Here he is talking on an appropriation bill: When I was at school, I remember hearing the story of the world\u2019s longest heatwave. The record was set in Marble Bar in 1923-24. For 160 days, it was\u2014using the old measurement\u2014over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. That gave me a greater appreciation of the struggles and the efforts of previous generations of Australians, and the hardships that they went through to build this country up. The Bureau of Meteorology used to have a whole page about this record, the Marble Bar heatwave of 1923-24, on their website, under \u2018Climate education\u2019. It said: The world record for the longest sequence of days above 100\u00b0Fahrenheit (or 37.8\u00b0 on the Celsius scale) is held by Marble Bar in the inland Pilbara district of Western Australia. The temperature, measured under standard exposure conditions, reached or exceeded the century mark every day from 31 October 1923 to 7 April 1924, a total of 160 days. Surprise, surprise! That\u2019s no longer on the Bureau of Meteorology website. It has disappeared, maybe down a memory hole. I\u2019m not sure. It gets more interesting. There\u2019s a gentleman called Chris Gillham, a researcher from Western Australia, who has found out that, as the bureau have... (Labor attempts to move that he no longer be heard. It loses the division) Sports rorts is back in the spotlight, with the Senate inquiry into the government program up first thing this morning. Sports Australia will appear at the committee today. This comes after the auditor general answered some questions on notice on the issue revealing 136 emails were exchanged between Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office (as the then minister) and Scott Morrison\u2019s office about the program, including one the day before the election was called. Morrison has maintained that his involvement was limited to representations, and the auditor general said it didn\u2019t believe the prime minister was any more or less successful in those representations than anyone else. But as Paul Karp reported yesterday, it\u2019s not going to slow down: Scott Morrison has been drawn further into the sports grants controversy after it was revealed his office exchanged 136 emails with the former sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office about the program and one of the clubs in his electorate received funding despite being ineligible. On Tuesday Labor pressed the issue on multiple fronts, as clubs that missed out came forward to complain to a Senate inquiry, and a Senate order for production of documents revealed Morrison attended an event at the Sans Souci Football Club, which was given $50,000 despite its project nearly having been completed. Meanwhile, the government is also facing questions about how $10m, which was part of a program meant to help put pools and changing facilities in regional areas, ended up in a North Sydney pool complex. It led to this exchange between Angus Taylor and an ABC Breakfast host over whether or not North Sydney was \u201cregional\u201d. Q: How would you describe North Sydney then? Taylor: Well, North Sydney is like every other part of Australia \u2013 lots of kids ... Q: Is it regional? Is it rural? Taylor: And adults who want to play sport and they need investment. Q: Is it regional or rural, Mr Taylor? Taylor: It\u2019s clear - North Sydney is in Sydney. There\u2019s no doubt about that. But my point is a broader one which is the one type of infrastructure investment that is very clearly in need of more investment and support from government that I see again and again and again is sporting infrastructure. It\u2019s hugely important. Meanwhile, Jacqui Lambie has reiterated she will not negotiate with the government over its ensuring integrity bill, until it releases the Gaetjen\u2019s report into sports rorts. Morrison will not do that. And so you have a situation where most non-government senators are doing all they can to disrupt government business in the Senate, in a bid to force the government into releasing the report. We don\u2019t know what Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff turned departmental head looked at, how many versions of the colour-coded spreadsheets he examined, or who he talked to. We don\u2019t know what it says \u2013 only what the prime minister says it says. That will most likely come up in the hearings as well. We\u2019ll have all of that and more as the day unfolds. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>This week the Department of Health highlighted the UK\u2019s \u201cinfluenza pandemic preparedness strategy\u201d, originally published in 2011. It remains the core public document to guide the likely public response.</p> \n<p>These are some of its key points:</p> \n<h2>1. What is a pandemic? How is it defined?</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Influenza pandemic planning in the UK has been based on an assessment of the \u201creasonable worst case\u201d. This is derived from the experience and a mathematical analysis of influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza in the 20th century. This suggests that, given known patterns of spread of infection, up to 50% of the population could experience symptoms of pandemic influenza during one or more pandemic waves lasting 15 weeks, although the nature and severity of the symptoms would vary from person to person. (Para 2.19)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the scenario for which that health and other public officials should have prepared for. Given there have only been 13 confirmed cases and no deaths in the UK, it is clear that the current coronavirus situation is nowhere near as bad at this stage. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>For deaths, the analysis of previous influenza pandemics suggests that we should plan for a situation in which up to 2.5% of those with symptoms would die as a result of influenza, assuming no effective treatment was available. (Para 2.20)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is a top-end assumption. Expert estimates, cited by the World Health Organization on Monday, indicate the death rate in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak, is between 2% and 4% \u2013 but more widely across China the figure is at 0.7%. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Influenza pandemics are intrinsically unpredictable. Plans for responding to a future pandemic should therefore be flexible and adaptable for a wide range of scenarios, not just the \u201creasonable worst case\u201d.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>An important qualification.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Taking account of this, and the practicality of different levels of response, when planning for excess deaths, local planners should prepare to extend capacity on a precautionary but reasonably practicable basis, and aim to cope with a population mortality rate of up to 210,000 \u2013 315,000 additional deaths, possibly over as little as a 15-week period and perhaps half of these over three weeks at the height of the outbreak (Page 17)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This appears stark, although numbers are necessary to determine a response, particularly in the health service.</p> \n<h2>2. How many people could get ill? What impact will that have?</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Up to 50 per cent of the workforce may require time off at some stage over the entire period of the pandemic. In a widespread and severe pandemic, affecting 35-50 per cent of the population, this could be even higher as some with caring responsibilities will need additional time off. Staff absence should follow the pandemic profile. In a widespread and severe pandemic, affecting 50 per cent of the population, between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of staff may be absent on any given day. These levels would be expected to remain similar for one to three weeks and then decline. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The assessment tells planners they have to expect widespread sickness absence from work. Elsewhere it assumes the average sick leave could be a week and half. If half the population was affected, the impact on the economy could be \u00a328bn, although such figures are highly speculative.</p> \n<h2>3. What would the impact be on schools - could they be closed?</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There is modelling data highlighting the potential benefit of school closures in certain circumstances, both in terms of protecting individual children from infection and in reducing overall transmission of the virus in the population. However, to be effective prolonged closures are required. This would involve schools over a wide area, but carries a risk that social mixing of children outside school would defeat the object of the closures. (Para 4.23)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This one of the clearest elements of the document, as it describes how closing schools could help not only youngsters but also prevent wider transmission. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Using a precautionary approach in the early stages of an influenza pandemic and depending on the public health risk assessment, directors of public health may advise localised closures (individual schools or catchment areas). (Para 4.24)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This spells out that if closures were deemed advisable \u2013 and currently they are not - this would only happen in a \u201chigh impact\u201d situation, and should not be the focus of school planning.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Once the virus is more established in the country, the general policy would be that schools should not close \u2013 unless there are specific local business continuity reasons (staff shortages or particularly vulnerable children). This policy will be reviewed in light of information about how the pandemic is unfolding at the time. (Para 4.24)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This seems surprising, that schools should stay open if the pandemic virus were to become more established, although it wisely says that would be subject to review.</p> \n<h2>4. What about national and international travel? Will there be lockdowns?</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There are no plans to attempt to close borders in the event of an influenza pandemic. The UK generally has a high level of international connectivity, and so is likely to be one of the earlier countries to receive infectious individuals. Modelling suggests that imposing a 90% restriction on all air travel to the UK at the point a pandemic emerges would only delay the peak of a pandemic wave by one to two weeks.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Closing borders is pointless, the document argues, making clear there are limits to extreme measures. Already Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has noted that Italy was one of the few countries to try temperature screening at airports only for the country to have the largest number of cases in Europe.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>There is also a lack of scientific evidence on the impact of internal travel restrictions on transmission and attempts to impose such restrictions would have wide-reaching implications for business and welfare. </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The assumption is that Italian-style lockdowns will not be applied in the UK. Government planners are keen to minimise the economic impacts, although the reality is that in a serious situation people will be reluctant to travel, and many essential services will be affected by sick leave.</p> \n<h2>5. What about law and order in a crisis?</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>In a severe pandemic, factors such as pressures on the health services, potential prioritisation of clinical countermeasures, measures to control the spread of infection, possible shortages of basic necessities or short-lived disruption to essential services could result in disturbances or threaten breakdowns in public order. (para 7.15)</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This may be the most alarmist passage in the document, although immediately after the manual emphasises the importance of \u201cpreserving the rule of law, maintaining the democratic process and ensuring public safety\u201d.</p> \n<p>The military may be called upon to provide assistance, although planners are also warned that \u201cpandemic resilience plans should not therefore assume that local military units would provide support or have personnel available\u201d.</p> \n<p>You can read the full document here:<br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Full text of document\"> \n <iframe class=\"scribd_iframe_embed\" title=\"UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy 2011\" src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/448917193/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;show_recommendations=false&amp;access_key=key-0jCoYjhjzCOSBprgdXX8\" data-auto-height=\"true\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.7068965517241379\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2017/02/annotation-enhancer\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "The Australian Grand Prix will go ahead next month despite concerns that the spread of coronavirus may impact the start of the Formula One season, the Victorian government has said. Concerns about the viability of the season are growing with the spread of the outbreak in northern Italy, where Ferrari and the Alpha Tauri team are headquartered. On Wednesday local time, Italian authorities said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases had surged to 400, with 12 deaths. The Formula One chief executive, Chase Carey, told reporters that the three opening races \u2014 Melbourne, Bahrain and Hanoi \u2014 would go ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re heading to Melbourne, heading to Bahrain and heading to Hanoi,\u201d he said. The track in Albert Park has been under construction for a month and the Victorian sports minister, Martin Pakula, said the race would go ahead as planned. \u201cMelbourne is the only city in the world to host a Formula One race and a Grand Slam tennis tournament, and we look forward to the Grand Prix celebrating 25 years at Albert Park on March 15,\u201d Pakula said. Andrew Westacott, the chief executive of the Australian Grand Prix corporation, said whether the race went ahead would be matter for the government. Neither the Australian government nor Formula One management have suggested the date may have to change. \u201cWe take guidance from the chief medical officers in Australia and ultimately from government,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cGovernment and health officers will look at things medically and economically and assess risk.\u201d It is one of the four biggest sporting events held in Melbourne each year, following the Australian Open, AFL grand final and spring racing carnival. The Australian Grand Prix corporation said attendance at the 2019 Grand Prix was the highest since 2005, giving an \u201cestimated attendance\u201d of 324,100 over the four-day event. It receives substantial government funding. In 2019 that came to $60.2m, more than half of the cost of running the event. The contract for the city to host the event has been extended to 2025. Felicia Mariani, the chief executive of the Victorian Tourism Industry Council, said Victoria could not afford for the event to be cancelled. \u201cVictoria and Victorian tourism, already reeling under the weight of bushfires and now the coronavirus, can hardly afford either the reputational or economic damage that would come from a cancelled or downscaled Grand Prix,\u201d Marini said in a statement to Guardian Australia. \u201cVictoria is reliant on hallmark international events like the Grand Prix to boost visitation, inject much needed funds back into its economy and help rebuild the hard-hit tourism sector. \u201cSafety is paramount, however, and if it comes to the point of cancellation, the industry needs to brace itself and be ready to respond accordingly.\u201d The Australian government extended its travel ban for China on Thursday, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said that \u201cfurther travel bans were not recommended.\u201d Australia has enacted its emergency response plan to the coronavirus, with Morrison saying \u201cwe believe the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us.\u201d Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, told reporters in Melbourne it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that a pandemic would be declared and that \u201cliterally dozens\u201d of people had been working on the state\u2019s contingency plans for months.

But to stay ahead of it we need to now elevate our response to the next phase.\u201d</p> <p>Globally, 82,000 people have been confirmed as having coronavirus, leading to 2,800 deaths. The vast majority of infections \u2013 and deaths \u2013 have occurred in mainland China but in recent days the number of new infections outside of China have raised concerns containment measures have failed.</p> <p>On advice from the chief medical officer, the Australian government has chosen to extend its travel ban from China into a fifth week.

Fifteen of those cases were contracted in Wuhan, in central China, or via contact with someone who had been to that city, the epicentre of the outbreak. Another eight are from passengers who were on board the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship.</p> <p>\u201cThe likelihood is somewhere sometime there is a further round of cases that may make it to Australia, this becomes a truly global event,\u201d Hunt said.</p> <p>\u201cWith the number of countries that are now affected, we have to be realistic about the likelihood of containment strategies into the weeks ahead.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt said Australia would now move to a \u201cfull preparation phase for all of the supply chains\u201d and ensuring the \u201cnational medical stockpile\u201d was sufficiently prepared for a widespread outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cPrimarily now it moves to a formal engagement with the states where we are doing all of that work across medical stockpile, personal protective equipment, supply chain, in particular personnel.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we\u2019re most focused on is to make sure we have the personnel capacity if there is a surge within our hospitals and medical system, in the event of a pandemic.\u201d</p> <p>Hunt said if the coronavirus did break out in Australia, the emergency response plan for Covid-19 aimed to slow its spread and minimise its impact.</p> <p>The government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said researchers continued to learn more about the disease watching its rapid spread across countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.</p> <p>\u201cNow we know more about this virus, how it spreads, how infectious it is, how likely it is to cause severe illness and in which type of people it may cause severe illness. I would stress that for 80% of people it\u2019s a mild illness,\u201d Kelly said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-map-how-covid-19-is-spreading-across-the-world\">Coronavirus map: how Covid-19 is spreading across the world</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd so we\u2019re preparing for all eventualities in terms of when it may or may not come to Australia, and how many people might get infected.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the government downplayed the need for economic stimulus to support the Australian economy through the inevitable disruptions to supply chains and shifts in consumer behaviour.</p> <p>But on Thursday, Morrison said the government was looking at measures that were \u201ctargeted and modest and scalable\u201d. He said the virus was impacting trade and tourism, and there were also second-round effects that would dampen economic activity.</p> <p>Morrison used the example of overseas students not being able to attend university because of the travel bans.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not just the fact they\u2019re not in a university, it means they\u2019re not in the country which means they\u2019re not participating in the economy. The second-round effects of these issues is what can be impacted. So that what is being addressed and that\u2019s the work that\u2019s being tasked.\u201d</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s step-up sparked conflict between the government and the opposition. Morrison blasted Labor for disrupting the parliament with divisions at a time when the national security committee was deliberating. Labor expressed frustration that Morrison was escalating the Australian response without briefing the opposition.</p>",

Guardian Australia understands the government is working up stimulus options for the education and tourism sectors \u2013 which have been hard hit by the virus \u2013 and is considering support for export industries. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters on Thursday afternoon, after a meeting of the national security committee of cabinet, that \u201cbased on the expert medical advice we have received, there is every indication that the world will soon enter a pandemic phase of the coronavirus\u201d. The risk of a pandemic is upon us. Morrison said the federal and state governments would activate their pandemic plans, preparing for widespread transmission of the disease. The Australian government\u2019s plan \u2013 the health sector emergency response plan for Covid-19 \u2013 involves an escalating series of responses, from self-isolation of suspected cases, enforced quarantining of known infectious patients, up to the closure of schools, cessation of public transport and advice \u2013 even orders \u2013 for people to work from home. Under complementary state government pandemic plans: sports stadia may be sequestered as quarantine sites; police could be ordered to guard critical medical supplies, and governments may order entire suburbs, cities or groups of people to undergo mass vaccinations (once a vaccine is developed). Under worst-case scenarios being contemplated by state and federal governments, forecasts say a pandemic outbreak could last up to 10 months, and 40% of the country\u2019s workforce could be sidelined by illness or caring for family members. Morrison said while the government\u2019s response was being escalated, people should not \u2013 at this stage \u2013 dramatically change their daily routines. \u201cThere is no need for us to be moving to having mass gatherings of people stop: you can go to the football and the cricket and play with your friends down the street, you can go out to the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal. \u201cYou can do all of these things because Australia has acted quickly, Australia has got ahead of this at this point in time. But to stay ahead of it we need to now elevate our response to the next phase.\u201d Globally, 82,000 people have been confirmed as having coronavirus, leading to 2,800 deaths. The vast majority of infections \u2013 and deaths \u2013 have occurred in mainland China but in recent days the number of new infections outside of China have raised concerns containment measures have failed. On advice from the chief medical officer, the Australian government has chosen to extend its travel ban from China into a fifth week. It will continue to be reassessed weekly by the national security committee of cabinet. The Australian government\u2019s travel advice for citizens going to China remains at the highest level: Do not travel. Morrison said there was no need, at this stage, for the government to impose travel bans for other countries despite rising infection rates. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said he would meet with state and territory health ministers on Friday to discuss supply chains of critical medicine, and the potential establishment of dedicated fever clinics if the capacity of hospitals to deal with cases is overwhelmed. \u201cThe national security committee today heard of the high likelihood and high probability that the world would soon enter formally into a pandemic stage, which has led to the invocation and implementation and activation of the coronavirus pandemic preparedness plan,\u201d Hunt said. He stressed that Australia remained in the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase of dealing with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Currently, there are 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia. Fifteen of those cases were contracted in Wuhan, in central China, or via contact with someone who had been to that city, the epicentre of the outbreak. Another eight are from passengers who were on board the virus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. \u201cThe likelihood is somewhere sometime there is a further round of cases that may make it to Australia, this becomes a truly global event,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cWith the number of countries that are now affected, we have to be realistic about the likelihood of containment strategies into the weeks ahead.\u201d Hunt said Australia would now move to a \u201cfull preparation phase for all of the supply chains\u201d and ensuring the \u201cnational medical stockpile\u201d was sufficiently prepared for a widespread outbreak. \u201cPrimarily now it moves to a formal engagement with the states where we are doing all of that work across medical stockpile, personal protective equipment, supply chain, in particular personnel. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re most focused on is to make sure we have the personnel capacity if there is a surge within our hospitals and medical system, in the event of a pandemic.\u201d Hunt said if the coronavirus did break out in Australia, the emergency response plan for Covid-19 aimed to slow its spread and minimise its impact. The government\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said researchers continued to learn more about the disease watching its rapid spread across countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea. \u201cNow we know more about this virus, how it spreads, how infectious it is, how likely it is to cause severe illness and in which type of people it may cause severe illness. I would stress that for 80% of people it\u2019s a mild illness,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re preparing for all eventualities in terms of when it may or may not come to Australia, and how many people might get infected.\u201d Earlier in the week, the government downplayed the need for economic stimulus to support the Australian economy through the inevitable disruptions to supply chains and shifts in consumer behaviour. But on Thursday, Morrison said the government was looking at measures that were \u201ctargeted and modest and scalable\u201d. He said the virus was impacting trade and tourism, and there were also second-round effects that would dampen economic activity. Morrison used the example of overseas students not being able to attend university because of the travel bans. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not just the fact they\u2019re not in a university, it means they\u2019re not in the country which means they\u2019re not participating in the economy. The second-round effects of these issues is what can be impacted. So that what is being addressed and that\u2019s the work that\u2019s being tasked.\u201d Thursday\u2019s step-up sparked conflict between the government and the opposition. Morrison blasted Labor for disrupting the parliament with divisions at a time when the national security committee was deliberating. Labor expressed frustration that Morrison was escalating the Australian response without briefing the opposition.",

      "bodyText": "Cleaners dressed in hazmat suits and face masks entered the Sydney headquarters of services giant Broadspectrum on Thursday to protest at the company\u2019s lack of transparency surrounding recent offers of coronavirus-related cleaning work to its employees. The protests came after reports this week that cleaners contracted to work in New South Wales government schools under Broadspectrum were offered work cleaning novel coronavirus quarantine areas in Japan. The offers initially came by text message, offering an \u201call expenses paid\u201d trip to Japan to \u201cearn some good money\u201d cleaning. Some cleaning staff said their supervisors then offered the work in face-to-face meetings with them, and that they were offered between $5,000 and $6,000 for the work. Some workers were told they would be cleaning the coronavirus-riddled cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan for six days. Others were told they would be cleaning the quarantine station that housed staff and patrons after they had disembarked from the ship. Broadspectrum has since told media they would not be working on the Diamond Princess. The United Workers Union (UWU), which represents the cleaners, said they were yet to confirm where workers were actually being asked to clean. Georgia Potter Butler, an organiser with UWU, said the protests were sparked by the \u201chaphazard\u201d way the offer was made to staff and the question marks over the basic conditions that would be provided to those who took up the job. More than 50 people attended the protests, with workers and activists entering Broadspectrum\u2019s Parramatta premises at about midday and protesting for around half an hour. They were evicted after a fire alarm was activated and the building evacuated. The union was concerned about the hours of work required of those who took up the offer, the conditions under which they would be required to work, the lack of specific training, and the lack of health screening of volunteers for pre-existing conditions that may make them extra vulnerable to the virus. Upon their return to Australia, the workers would also be required to spend 30 days in quarantine, unpaid. \u201cWe don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s cost-effective to fly school cleaners from NSW, put them up for six days over there and have them off work for a month rather than hire local workers,\u201d Potter Butler said. \u201cBroadspectrum just haven\u2019t come out to assuage any of our concerns.\u201d UWU believes up to a dozen people may have taken up the offer, despite the union advising otherwise. \u201cThese are really low-paid workers \u2013 an opportunity to earn a bit of extra money did entice some, who were literally packing on Monday night to get on the plane,\u201d Potter Butler said.

Australia\u2019s benchmark stock exchange index, the ASX200, fell on Thursday for the fourth day running, slipping 0.75% after overseas markets that had been set to rally were gripped by virus panic on Wednesday afternoon. Air New Zealand cut more routes into Asia, following the lead set by Qantas last week, and warned the outbreak would cut profit by up to $100m. Travel agency Flight Centre also slashed its profit forecast, telling the market earnings would be $50m less because companies have banned their workers from travelling to China and tourists have started reconsidering their holiday plans. Business across Asia \u2013 and the world \u2013 has started to feel the impact as supply chains that are heavily dependent on Chinese industry freeze up and spooked consumers stop spending on anything but essentials. Car sales will be down 2.5% this year, ratings agency Moody\u2019s predicted, following on from a 4.6% drop last year. The agency had been predicting the industry\u2019s sales decline would slow to 0.9%, but changed its forecast on Thursday due to weaker demand and disrupted supply chains caused by the virus.

The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, also indicated that England rugby fans should still proceed with plans to attend the Six Nations fixture with Italy in Rome on Saturday week despite speculation that it may be cancelled. Schools \u201cwill have to make their own decision\u201d but the government had given clear advice based on medical opinion that there was no need to close, he told BBC Breakfast on Thursday. The government was accused on Wednesday of giving inconsistent and conflicting advice as growing numbers of schools closed over coronavirus fears and thousands of pupils were sent home. At least eight schools in the UK have closed, while others \u2013 including that attended by Prince George \u2013 have sent pupils home amid fears they may have been exposed to coronavirus during trips to northern Italy. \u201cThey will have to make their own choice. The Department for Education is available to them to advise them, to support them, to answer their questions if they have got concerns, but we don\u2019t see a reason why schools should be closing at the moment,\u201d said Jenrick. When it was put to him that it left some parents who might have to look after their children facing a dilemma, he nodded his head and said \u201cabsolutely\u201d . Speculation about England\u2019s forthcoming rugby match with Italy comes after the Six Nations game between Ireland and Italy in Dublin on 7 March was this week postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. Italy\u2019s final match of the championship is against England in Rome on 14 March. The former England player Kyran Bracken said he was very surprised that a quick decision like that taken in Ireland had not been made. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine 10,000 supporters going across to Italy so that seems strange to me,\u201d he told BBC Breakfast. Asked earlier on the same programme about England fans with tickets to go and see the game in Rome, Jenrick said: \u201cYeah, if the Foreign Office advice remains as it is and it isn\u2019t to avoid travel to that location, then absolutely continue to go about everyday life.\u201d \u201cThere are precautions that we can all be taking at home or abroad, including washing our hands whenever we can and ensuring that [if] we do end up having any of the symptoms of the coronavirus then seeking medical advice as soon as possible.\u201d The latest developments come as travellers returning to the UK from northern Italy were told they may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of illness. Authorities in Italy have reported that the number of people infected in the country has risen to 400 and 12 people have died. In London, the energy firm Chevron asked about 300 British employees to work temporarily from home after a worker in its Canary Wharf office reported a flu-like illness. Public Health England said even if there had been a suspected case in the workplace, there was no need to close or send staff home while test results were awaited. It said most possible cases turn out to be negative. Elsewhere, the Foreign Office denied there were any plans to evacuate about 168 Britons who remain in a coronavirus-hit hotel in Tenerife. However, it has arranged for written messages to be put under the doors of the rooms of British guests, asking them to get in contact.",

So far, the virus has killed nearly 3,000 people and infected more than 82,000, prompting warnings that the world is fast approaching a \u201ctipping point\u201d. Saudi Arabia announced the ban late on Wednesday after more than 330 cases were confirmed around the Middle East, most of them in Iran. Authorities in Riyadh said the ban was temporary, but did not say how long it might last. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. \u201cThe kingdom\u2019s government has decided to [suspend] entry to the kingdom for the purpose of umrah and visit to the prophet\u2019s mosque temporarily,\u201d the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement. It said tourist visas would be suspended \u201cfor those coming from countries in which the spread of the new coronavirus is a danger\u201d and urged Saudi citizens not to travel to countries where the disease was proliferating. The umrah, which refers to the Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of year, attracts millions of devout Muslims from all over the globe each year. There was no clarity over how the move would affect the annual hajj pilgrimage, due to start in late July.

The latest drastic measures came as: China\u2019s health authority reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. Iran\u2019s state-run Irna news agency reported that the country had confirmed 245 cases and 26 deaths.

The man \u2013 who is showing mild symptoms of the virus \u2013 was among the 2,500 Spaniards who travelled to Milan on 19 February to watch Valencia play Atalanta in the Champions League. Denmark recorded its first case \u2013 a man returning after a skiing holiday in Italy \u2013 while Estonia, Pakistan, Brazil, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among the countries that have reported their first cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours.

      "body": "<p>A society that lets thousands of its citizens die from needless, preventable causes is broken. Every day we wake up to increasingly alarming headlines about coronavirus, but where is the panic about the tens of thousands who are already dying unnecessarily? Britain\u2019s rate of excess winter deaths is twice that of Finland, yet London\u2019s average temperature in January is 10C higher than that of Helsinki. </p> <p>\u201cExcess winter deaths\u201d is a clinical phrase lacking in humanity: it refers to the increased numbers of people sent to their graves in colder months. Such is our damning reality that, when adjusted for seasonal temperature differences, <a href=\"https://www.e3g.org/docs/E3G_NEA_Cold_homes_and_excess_winter_deaths_2018.02.pdf\" title=\"\">Britain has the worst record in Europe apart from Ireland</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/03/government-fuel-poverty-target-ippr-energy-efficiency\">Government 'will miss fuel poverty target by more than six decades'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On average, there are 32,000 more deaths between December and March than the rest of the year. Many have perished because of the refusal of a society with abundant wealth and resources to provide for its most vulnerable citizens. An average of <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/E3G-NEA-Cold-homes-and-excess-winter-deaths.pdf\" title=\"\">9,700 deaths each year</a> are believed to be caused by living in a cold house, according to research by National Energy Action (NEA) and the environmental group E3G. According to its figures, that is as many as those whose lives are cut short by breast or prostate cancer. While, sadly, we do not have the ability to cure all forms of cancer, we do have the means to ensure all have a warm home. Indeed, 6,900 of those deaths were linked to the 25% coldest homes in the country.</p> <p>Let us be frank. If thousands of people were dying needlessly each year in affluent neighbourhoods and suburbs, wouldn\u2019t this be treated as a national emergency, and wouldn\u2019t action have been taken sooner?</p> <p>Poverty kills: this isn\u2019t hyperbole, but fact. Some 10% of the total deaths, significantly more than 3,000, are directly linked to fuel poverty itself. These are older people \u2013 perhaps those who survived war, and who helped build the country \u2013 dying of cold because they don\u2019t have the money to pay their energy bills.</p> <p>Despite the rightful protection of the triple lock on pensions, we still live in a society in which <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/latest-news/articles/2017/december/300000-more-pensioners-living-in-poverty/\" title=\"\">1.9 million pensioners languish below the poverty line</a>, a statistic that compares harshly with other wealthy, developed nations. How did we end up with such a shameful record?</p> <p>\u201cBritain has the worst housing stock in western Europe in terms of retaining heat and energy efficiency,\u201d E3G\u2019s Pedro Guertler tells me. That has led Britain to be described as the <a href=\"https://www.e3g.org/docs/ACE-and-EBR-fact-file-2013-03-Cold-man-of-Europe.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201ccold man of Europe\u201d</a>. Here is another dimension of a housing crisis that has deprived millions of people of secure, affordable places to live: one that actually endangers lives. Older people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 such as respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular problems \u2013 are those most at risk.</p> <p>It is a needless drain on resources and money, too. Solving the crisis would save England\u2019s NHS an estimated \u00a31.36bn. It would also mean fewer patients taking up beds or adding to waiting times in GPs\u2019 surgeries and A&amp;E departments. But such has been the false economy of austerity.</p> <p>A public health approach to cold homes makes sense: as NEA\u2019s Peter Smith tells me: \u201cLocal authorities have increasingly accepted the link between poor housing and health. If you\u2019ve got a broken boiler and poor insulation, you\u2019ll only wind up in hospital, so it\u2019s better to fix heating or insulation so you can stay in homes longer.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, it\u2019s predicted that by this year local authorities will have lost about <a href=\"https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\" title=\"\">60% of their budgets</a>, leaving vital services such as public health squeezed and cut, particularly in poorer areas. According to the <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\" title=\"\">Institute for Public and Policy Research</a>, \u201calmost \u00a31 in every \u00a37 cut from public health services has come from England\u2019s 10 most deprived communities \u2013 compared to just \u00a31 in every \u00a346 in the country\u2019s 10 least deprived areas\u201d.</p> <p>The danger is that we end up with what Smith describes as a \u201ccarousel of people with poor health\u201d (typically respiratory or circulatory illnesses) becoming sick and being sent to hospital and then removed quickly because of bed blocking; they are then sent back to the very cold conditions that made them ill in the first place. An urgent priority should be to reverse life-destroying cuts to public health. </p> <p>Research by Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, has <a href=\"http://www.instituteofhealthequity.org/resources-reports/the-health-impacts-of-cold-homes-and-fuel-poverty\" title=\"\">uncovered</a> other public health consequences, such as mental ill-health and isolation, because pensioners feel unable to invite friends into their cold homes. </p> <p>For years, this crisis has been widely ignored and neglected. When George Osborne was chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/nov/25/green-campaigners-condemn-cuts-energy-efficiency-scheme\" title=\"\">he slashed the UK\u2019s key energy efficiency programme</a>, which was specifically aimed at the poorest homeowners. Given the thousands who die from fuel poverty, this alone should be a scandal that follows Osborne to his grave. But there has, finally, been some movement: the Tory manifesto committed to \u00a36.3bn over half a decade on energy efficiency measures to reduce fuel bills in 2.2m homes. Pressure should be exerted on Boris Johnson\u2019s administration to abide by these commitments. The coming budget will be a key test.</p> <p>There\u2019s another priority too: this week, NEA and the <a href=\"https://fairbydesign.com/about-us/\" title=\"\">Fair by Design movement</a> \u2013 which focuses on tackling the \u201cextra costs of being poor\u201d \u2013 launched a campaign to <a href=\"https://fairbydesign.com/news/whd-campaign/\" title=\"\">defend and extend the warm home discount scheme</a>. The programme provides up to \u00a3140 towards energy bills for pensioners, but is at risk of ending in a year\u2019s time. It should be extended to poor working-age families too. As things stand, they have to know if they are eligible, and apply to their supplier each year. And there are limited spaces, meaning up to 2m households could be missing out.</p> <p>There is, of course, room to be more ambitious still. A mass insulation programme for all homes and businesses would create skilled jobs, stimulate the economy, bring down fuel bills, save lives and reduce carbon emissions. Although the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/07/energy-bills-to-rise-by-more-than-100-pounds-for-15m-households-as-price-cap-lifted\" title=\"\">introduced a partial energy bill cap, prices rose again last year</a>, so there should be urgent action to make them affordable. </p> <p>As the <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/funding-and-partnerships/our-partnerships/health-equity-in-england-the-marmot-review-10-years-on?gclid=CjwKCAiAy9jyBRA6EiwAeclQhCk8P8kovadrJ2nZpCyqTHTMSQddjBUtfQyQPLYUXXfxE9ipmKdQiRoCVfYQAvD_BwE\" title=\"\">Marmot review on health inequality in England in the last decade uncovered this week</a>, life expectancy has stalled for the first time in over a century; for the most deprived women, it has gone backwards. Both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\" title=\"\">austerity</a> and a social order that prioritises money over human lives is to blame. The needless deaths of tens of thousands of people is just one part of the story. We cannot, sadly, go back in time and save them . But we can, and must, demand that the government prevents any more people unnecessarily dying this way.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "A society that lets thousands of its citizens die from needless, preventable causes is broken. Every day we wake up to increasingly alarming headlines about coronavirus, but where is the panic about the tens of thousands who are already dying unnecessarily? Britain\u2019s rate of excess winter deaths is twice that of Finland, yet London\u2019s average temperature in January is 10C higher than that of Helsinki. \u201cExcess winter deaths\u201d is a clinical phrase lacking in humanity: it refers to the increased numbers of people sent to their graves in colder months. Such is our damning reality that, when adjusted for seasonal temperature differences, Britain has the worst record in Europe apart from Ireland. On average, there are 32,000 more deaths between December and March than the rest of the year. Many have perished because of the refusal of a society with abundant wealth and resources to provide for its most vulnerable citizens. An average of 9,700 deaths each year are believed to be caused by living in a cold house, according to research by National Energy Action (NEA) and the environmental group E3G. According to its figures, that is as many as those whose lives are cut short by breast or prostate cancer. While, sadly, we do not have the ability to cure all forms of cancer, we do have the means to ensure all have a warm home. Indeed, 6,900 of those deaths were linked to the 25% coldest homes in the country. Let us be frank. If thousands of people were dying needlessly each year in affluent neighbourhoods and suburbs, wouldn\u2019t this be treated as a national emergency, and wouldn\u2019t action have been taken sooner? Poverty kills: this isn\u2019t hyperbole, but fact. Some 10% of the total deaths, significantly more than 3,000, are directly linked to fuel poverty itself. These are older people \u2013 perhaps those who survived war, and who helped build the country \u2013 dying of cold because they don\u2019t have the money to pay their energy bills. Despite the rightful protection of the triple lock on pensions, we still live in a society in which 1.9 million pensioners languish below the poverty line, a statistic that compares harshly with other wealthy, developed nations. How did we end up with such a shameful record? \u201cBritain has the worst housing stock in western Europe in terms of retaining heat and energy efficiency,\u201d E3G\u2019s Pedro Guertler tells me. That has led Britain to be described as the \u201ccold man of Europe\u201d. Here is another dimension of a housing crisis that has deprived millions of people of secure, affordable places to live: one that actually endangers lives. Older people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 such as respiratory illnesses or cardiovascular problems \u2013 are those most at risk. It is a needless drain on resources and money, too. Solving the crisis would save England\u2019s NHS an estimated \u00a31.36bn. It would also mean fewer patients taking up beds or adding to waiting times in GPs\u2019 surgeries and A&amp;E departments. But such has been the false economy of austerity. A public health approach to cold homes makes sense: as NEA\u2019s Peter Smith tells me: \u201cLocal authorities have increasingly accepted the link between poor housing and health. If you\u2019ve got a broken boiler and poor insulation, you\u2019ll only wind up in hospital, so it\u2019s better to fix heating or insulation so you can stay in homes longer.\u201d Unfortunately, it\u2019s predicted that by this year local authorities will have lost about 60% of their budgets, leaving vital services such as public health squeezed and cut, particularly in poorer areas. According to the Institute for Public and Policy Research, \u201calmost \u00a31 in every \u00a37 cut from public health services has come from England\u2019s 10 most deprived communities \u2013 compared to just \u00a31 in every \u00a346 in the country\u2019s 10 least deprived areas\u201d. The danger is that we end up with what Smith describes as a \u201ccarousel of people with poor health\u201d (typically respiratory or circulatory illnesses) becoming sick and being sent to hospital and then removed quickly because of bed blocking; they are then sent back to the very cold conditions that made them ill in the first place. An urgent priority should be to reverse life-destroying cuts to public health. Research by Michael Marmot, director of the UCL Institute of Health Equity, has uncovered other public health consequences, such as mental ill-health and isolation, because pensioners feel unable to invite friends into their cold homes. For years, this crisis has been widely ignored and neglected. When George Osborne was chancellor, he slashed the UK\u2019s key energy efficiency programme, which was specifically aimed at the poorest homeowners. Given the thousands who die from fuel poverty, this alone should be a scandal that follows Osborne to his grave. But there has, finally, been some movement: the Tory manifesto committed to \u00a36.3bn over half a decade on energy efficiency measures to reduce fuel bills in 2.2m homes. Pressure should be exerted on Boris Johnson\u2019s administration to abide by these commitments. The coming budget will be a key test. There\u2019s another priority too: this week, NEA and the Fair by Design movement \u2013 which focuses on tackling the \u201cextra costs of being poor\u201d \u2013 launched a campaign to defend and extend the warm home discount scheme. The programme provides up to \u00a3140 towards energy bills for pensioners, but is at risk of ending in a year\u2019s time. It should be extended to poor working-age families too. As things stand, they have to know if they are eligible, and apply to their supplier each year. And there are limited spaces, meaning up to 2m households could be missing out. There is, of course, room to be more ambitious still. A mass insulation programme for all homes and businesses would create skilled jobs, stimulate the economy, bring down fuel bills, save lives and reduce carbon emissions. Although the government has introduced a partial energy bill cap, prices rose again last year, so there should be urgent action to make them affordable. As the Marmot review on health inequality in England in the last decade uncovered this week, life expectancy has stalled for the first time in over a century; for the most deprived women, it has gone backwards. Both austerity and a social order that prioritises money over human lives is to blame. The needless deaths of tens of thousands of people is just one part of the story. We cannot, sadly, go back in time and save them . But we can, and must, demand that the government prevents any more people unnecessarily dying this way. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist",

Taiwan outlawed the consumption of dog and cat meat in 2017. \u201cDog eating has become increasingly controversial in China, with frequent violent clashes between dog thieves and angry dog owners,\u201d said Wendy Higgins, director of international media at Humane Society International (HSI). \u201cThere is a growing and vocal Chinese opposition to the dog and cat meat trade, and young people in China are far more likely to think of dogs as companions than cuisine,\u201d she said. The draft regulation is now in a public comment phase running until 5 March and no timeline has been given for the final determination. If the ban goes through, other animals identified as potentially carrying disease \u2013 such as turtles, snakes, some birds and insects \u2013 could be included on a list of prohibited animals for consumption in line with national rules that are expected in the coming months. Under the Shenzhen ban, fines for serving banned animals at restaurants would range from 20,000 to 200,000 yuan (\u00a32,200\u2013\u00a322,000). HSI has estimated that between 10 and 20 million dogs are killed in China for their meat annually, while protection group Animals Asia puts the figure for cats at roughly 4 million a year. \u201cThe vast majority of dogs caught up in the trade in China are stolen pets and strays snatched from the streets,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cAfter being stolen or snatched, the animals are crammed in small cages in their hundreds, unable to move, and piled on the back of trucks, packed so tightly they can break limbs.\u201d Animal protection groups have long been concerned with practices used in the dog meat trade, from rearing and theft to transport and slaughter.",

So we thought it would be useful to give our staff some example scripts where we could both acknowledge the stress and the anxiety and the paranoia underlying that comment, but nonetheless express in no uncertain terms that we viewed that comment as inappropriate, that the department fully supports our staff to continue treating that patient, and that we don\u2019t want to tolerate what we see as racism.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5753ed8f08e1332474b04d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-27T05:37:57.551Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>OK we have sought confirmation and the plan announced by Austalia\u2019s government today is <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/2020/02/australian-health-sector-emergency-response-plan-for-novel-coronavirus-covid-19_1.pdf\">this one</a>, written about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/how-will-australia-respond-if-the-coronavirus-outbreak-becomes-a-pandemic\">by my colleague Ben Doherty</a> earlier this week. </p> \n  <p>The emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>the clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised)</li> \n   <li>its transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5)</li> \n   <li>the capacity of the health system to treat infected patients</li> \n   <li>the effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreading</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/how-will-australia-respond-if-the-coronavirus-outbreak-becomes-a-pandemic\">How will Australia respond if the coronavirus outbreak becomes a pandemic?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5750b58f0811db2faff62d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-27T05:22:41.340Z\">5.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>There\u2019s a question on economic impacts.</p> \n  <p>\u201cObviously the impact of a breakdown in supply chains or travel or right across the many sectors, there will be an impact on the economy,\u201d says Morrison.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I anticipate it will have a very real effect.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs I said, it\u2019s a health crisis, not a financial crisis.

You can follow the latest updates on our new live blog: Here\u2019s a recap of what has happened so far today: Coronavirus could trigger economic damage on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, analysts have warned, amid growing concerns over the fallout from the deadly disease. The death toll in Iran has risen to 26, with almost 250 people diagnosed with the virus. Two more people have died from coronavirus in Italy, bringing the death toll to 14. The number of confirmed cases has risen to more than 520. Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife, and the patients have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London. Saudi Arabia has taken the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time. The Japanese government has ordered the closure of all schools and museum for a month. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned an epidemic that is on the way\u201d. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died. The official death toll from covid-19 cases in Iran has increased to 22 people. Officials also said that 141 people have tested positive for the virus, but experts fear Iran is under reporting the true scale of the outbreak. More cases have been reported all over the world including in Switzerland, Kuwait, Spain, South Korea and Austria. Estonia, Denmark, Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. Donald Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans \u201cremains very low\u201d and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a \u201cfew days\u201d. But Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. Australia has extended its travel ban on China and enacted its emergency response plan, because \u201cthere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus\u201d, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Dr Michael Ryan, executive director of WHO health emergencies programme, said that no decision is impending on the fate of the Tokyo Olympics. He said: My understanding is no decision will be taken in the near-term regarding the future of the Olympics ... Everyone is working together to try to preserve what is a fantastic global event. Tedros said the WHO is now more concerned about new cases outside China, especially the \u201cepidemics\u201d in Iran, Italy and South Korea. He said: It is what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world \u2013 that\u2019s now our greatest concern. Outside China, there are now 3,474 cases in 44 countries and 54 deaths. We\u2019re at a decisive point. For the past two days, the number of new cases reported in the rest of the world has exceeded the number of new cases reported in China. To countries that have reported their first cases in the last 24 hours, including Greece, North Macedonia, Norway, Pakistan, and Romania, Tedros said: My message to each of these countries is, this is your window of opportunity. If you act aggressively now, you can contain this virus, you can prevent people getting sick, you can save lives. The World Health Organization has urged people to keep calm, saying that ministers across the world need to be able to answer questions on how they are preparing to halt the spread of the virus. The WHO\u2019s message continues to be that the virus \u201chas pandemic potential\u201d and it is helping every country to prepare. The director-general of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, said countries needed to be ready to detect cases early and isolate patients. They needed the right measures at airports and border crossings. He said countries needed to be ready to fight rumours and misinformation. \u201cThis is not a time for fear but a time for taking action now to prevent infection and save lives now,\u201d Adhanom said. \u201cFear and panic does not help,\u201d he added. The New York Times has some alarming detail about the first person-to-person transmission of Covid-19 within the United States (see earlier). A California coronavirus patient had to wait days to be tested because of restrictive federal criteria, despite doctors\u2019 suggestions. Doctors at the University of California, Davis, Medical Center considered the novel pathogen a possible diagnosis when the person was first admitted last week. But the federal agency that conducts the testing did not administer the test until days later because the case did not fit the agency\u2019s narrow testing criteria, university officials said in a letter to the campus community. The consumer healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser (RB) says the coronavirus outbreak has helped to drive greater demand for its Dettol and Lysol hygiene products. The company said it was working alongside public health authorities across the world in an attempt to provide people in areas affected by the virus with more information about the necessary hygiene measures. It added that the outbreak had resulted in \u201cincreased online activity\u201d for its consumers in China, but that the firm was \u201cseeing some disruption to offline retailers, distribution channels and the supply chain connected to China\u201d. A man from Derbyshire who travelled to the H10 hotel in Tenerife for four nights has confirmed that British guests are desperate to return to the UK to avoid contracting the disease. \u201cNone of the Brits staying here feel safe\u201d, he told PA. The 60-year-old said: \u201cWe have been told to stay in our rooms but the hotel has no way of enforcing it. We have a WhatsApp group for all of the Brits and we don\u2019t feel safe. We think this is going to end up worse than that ship [the Diamond Princess]. \u201cI don\u2019t think confusion would be the right word to describe it \u2013 they are just not able to enforce quarantine conditions. People are able to walk around the buildings and some are even going in the pool. People are walking about and interacting with each other and not wearing masks. They served a buffet-style dinner last night, and people were milling about without masks, touching utensils \u2013 the virus is bound to spread. \u201cIt\u2019s totally crazy. We feel we are just being quarantined until we eventually get it [Covid-19]. No one seems to be helping, and the consulate aren\u2019t helping us \u2013 why can\u2019t they bring us home? We are in a quarantine that is not being followed and it is not safe. \u201cI ran out of medication and visited the front desk as I was told more would be brought in. But they were unable to find my medication. Eventually, I was given some but I\u2019ve been told now they won\u2019t give out more than one day\u2019s worth at a time, so I have already run out again and will need to go back. They couldn\u2019t give me any information about why this was.\u201d Streets and shops in Codogno in northern Italy have been left eerily empty after the town was placed under lockdown due to the new coronavirus outbreak. The virus has so far killed 14 people in Italy, and cases across the country had reached 528. Italian churches are stepping up measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, calling on priests not to distribute holy communion wafers directly on to worshippers\u2019 tongues and urging congregations to avoid exchanging handshakes during mass. The Catholic archdiocese of Messina in Sicily made the recommendations in response to the rapid rise in infections in Italy. In an official statement, the religious authorities of the Sicilian province wrote: \u201cIn the face of the spread of the coronavirus, it is considered appropriate to comply with some provisions and hygiene measures. As a precaution we are advising to distribute the Eucharist preferably into the hands of the faithful, and to avoid the physical contact from a peaceful handshake.\u201d The number of patients infected with coronavirus in Iran has risen to 245, with 26 deaths, according to Kianoush Jahanpour, a spokesman of the Iranian Health Ministry. He added that 106 new cases of coronavirus-positive patients had been diagnosed since Wednesday noon, voicing regret that seven of them had passed away. Insurers and travel companies should not be asking people for GP letters to get holiday refunds for trips they cannot go on due to the coronavirus. The Royal College of GPs said it had heard reports of businesses asking for GP letters in order for people to cancel holidays due to Covid-19. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: Insurers and travel companies should be basing their decisions to offer refunds on advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Public Health England, not letters from GPs. It is not a good use of GPs\u2019 time to be writing letters for patients who are not ill but have plans to travel \u2013 and GPs will always base their decisions on official advice. Patients will undoubtedly have good and sensible reasons for not wanting to travel to certain places because of Covid-19, but this is not the same as being unable to travel due to existing illness, and it should not become the GP\u2019s responsibility to give patients advice about where not to travel.\u201d Hammersmith Surgery in west London was closed this morning after a suspected coronavirus case, but those who work there said that they would be reopening at 1pm. Patients received a message saying that the surgery had to close \u201cimmediately\u201d due to an \u201cincident\u201d and that any appointments booked would have to be frozen.

Thanks Jacob Rees-Mogg expressed concern about the plight of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is being held in Evin jail in Tehran. He added that UK officials were trying to find out more information and said that, while the Iranian authorities had denied any outbreak of coronavirus at the prison, he would \u201cnot always take as authoritative\u201d such remarks. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini airport while travelling to show her young daughter, Gabriella, to her parents in April 2016. She was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations, which she denies, of plotting to overthrow the Tehran government. Responding to concerns raised by Labour, Rees-Mogg told the Commons: \u201cIt is a particular concern that the coronavirus has been rumoured \u2013 but I emphasise rumoured and not confirmed \u2013 to be in the prison in Evin where Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is. \u201cThe UK ambassador to Iran has raised this with the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs and we\u2019re in contact with our international partners on this issue. \u201cThe Iranian authorities have denied this at the moment, but I must confess I for one would not always take as authoritative denials issued by the Iranian government.\u201d He added: \u201cThe government is trying to do what it can in this very serious issue.\u201d Two more people have died in Italy from coronavirus, bringing the death toll to 14. In a statement the Civil Protection agency said the number of confirmed cases had risen from 420 to 528. The agency\u2019s chief, Angelo Borrelli, had earlier told reporters that officials were still seeking confirmation that coronavirus was responsible for the latest two deaths. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the Commons on Wednesday that the Foreign Office had been in touch with the estimated 160 British guests quarantined in Tenerife. At the time guests in the hotel said they had had no contact with the Foreign Office. But overnight letters from the British consulate in Tenerife, were posted to every UK guest at the Costa Adeje Palace in La Caleta. British guests at the hotel have demanded help getting home and fear that staying in hotel will increase their chances of catching the virus. The letter stopped well short of offering guests any help in getting home. It said: \u201cWe aware of your situation at the hotel and would like to reassure you that we are in direct contact with the local authorities and hotel management daily.\u201d NHS staff have been asked to shave their beards to allow masks to fit more securely in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus, according to the Sun. Bosses at Southampton University NHS Trust sent a mass email to tackle a \u201cknown problem\u201d with ill-fitting masks on hairy faces. The medical director, Derek Sandeman, attached an image with 36 different kinds of facial hair showing whether they were acceptable or not based on whether they fitted inside a mask. Small, pencil-type moustaches such as the \u201cZorro\u201d and \u201cPainter\u2019s Brush\u201d are allowed, but fuller growths including \u201cmutton chops\u201d and the \u201cchin curtain\u201d are out, according to the image. However, staff with beards for religious or cultural reasons are exempt. The memo states: \u201cYou will see that the presence of facial hair compromises the ability to protect any individual through a mask. \u201cI am writing to ask those who do not have a strong cultural or religious reason for a beard and who are working in at-risk areas to consider shaving. \u201cI recognise for some this is a big ask, that beards are so popular at present. However I do believe this is the right thing to do.\u201d Prof Christl Donnelly, a leading statistical epidemiologist, has warned that based on death tolls, the outbreaks in Italy and Iran are likely to be far greater than confirmed cases in both countries suggest. Iran has reported 22 deaths but just 141 cases, and Italy has reported 12 deaths and 470 case. Donnelly, who works at the University of Oxford and WHO Collaborating Centre for Infectious Disease Modelling, at Imperial College London, said her research suggested the number of cases in both countries was likely to be over 1,000. In a comment distributed by the Science Media Centre, she said: \u201cIt is not surprising that we have seen additional cases today. The estimate from our work at Imperial College London is that about 1% of infections with the virus responsible for Covid-19 are fatal, so the total of 12 deaths to date in Italy suggests many more than the 470 cases detected so far. Our best estimate would be over 1,000 cases. Each undetected case creates at least the potential for onward spread. This combined with frequent travel to and from affected regions, means that all countries are at risk of detecting cases both in travellers and those they came into contact with.\u201d One of the two new cases in the UK is likely to be a parent from Burbage primary school in Buxton, Derbyshire, which says it has had a confirmed case. Parents were told the 350-pupil school would be closed on Thursday due to a \u201cconfirmed case of coronavirus amongst our parent population\u201d. The message said the closure was a \u201cprecautionary measure and to enable a deep clean to be completed\u201d. Buxton Medical Practice also shut its doors, saying it had a confirmed case. Here\u2019s a summary of today\u2019s events Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife, and the patients have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London. Saudi Arabia has taken the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time. The Japanese government has ordered the closure of all schools and museum for a month. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned an epidemic that is on the way\u201d. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died. The official death toll from covid-19 cases in Iran has increased to 22 people. Officials also said that 141 people have tested positive for the virus, but experts fear Iran is under reporting the true scale of the outbreak. More cases have been reported all over the world including in Switzerland, Kuwait, Spain, South Korea and Austria. Estonia, Denmark, Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. Donald Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans \u201cremains very low\u201d and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a \u201cfew days\u201d. But Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. Australia has extended its travel ban on China and enacted its emergency response plan, because \u201cthere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus\u201d, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison. More on the latest UK cases: Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15, the Department of Health said on Thursday. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife, and the patients have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London, the DHSC said. Of the 13 people in the UK who had previously tested positive for Covid-19, eight have been discharged from hospital. Four of those who remain in hospital are Britons who caught the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and were flown back to the UK on Saturday. Another 168 Britons have been told to isolate themselves at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife. An Israeli man who returned from Italy four days ago has tested positive for Covid-19, according to Israel\u2019s health ministry. The unidentified man is the third Israeli with the virus, but the first who was not already in quarantine when tested. There are concerns he may have infected others. The country\u2019s interior minister, Aryeh Deri, said he planned to bar non-Israelis from travelling to Israel from Italy as a preventive measure. \u201cWhat can I do, the virus has spread in Italy,\u201d Deri told the local Ynet news site. Israel has already barred entry to foreign nationals who were in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, Thailand, Japan and South Korea in the past 14 days. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia cautions against reading too much into the case of a Japanese woman who has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time. In remarks distributed by the Science Media Centre he said: So there are a two possibilities 1. This is indeed a relapse of the illness \u2013 This was seen in Sars but in someone who was being treated with steroids. It is possible that the illness could be biphasic as suggested by Dr Tierno, though this is unlikely to be common, based on current information. 2. She has a prolonged excretion of virus from her initial infection and tests were either not done or were not done sufficiently well or enough to confirm clearance. It does appear that swabs for the virus are not 100% reliable. In this case it is even possible that the recent sore throat may be unrelated. Covid-19 tends to cause upper respiratory tract symptoms rather less frequently than did Sars. I would caution against reading too much into this report, given the lack of information. However, the report reinforces the fact that we have to investigate all such findings really thoroughly and report such information if we are to make the best decisions based on sound scientific evidence. At this time I would counsel against changing management guidelines based on this case but we do need to always keep them under review. Local health authorities have confirmed that a second person has tested positive for the coronavirus in the eastern Spanish region of Valencia, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 14. According to reports in the Spanish media, the man \u2013 who is showing mild symptoms of the virus \u2013 was among the 2,500 Valencia fans who travelled to Milan on 19 February to watch their team play Atalanta in the Champions League. The president of France, Emmanuel Macron, has called the coronavirus outbreak a \u201ccrisis, an epidemic that is on the way\u201d. Macron was speaking to doctors and other healthcare professionals at a Paris hospital. Buxton Medical Practice in Derbyshire has urged people not to go to the practice on Thursday due to a confirmed case of coronavirus, PA reports. In a message to prospective patients, a spokesman said: We have a confirmed case of the coronavirus. We are liaising with Public Health England and the CCG to ensure all appropriate actions are taken. Please do not come to the practice. A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time, in what authorities say is the first such case, Reuters reports. The woman, in her 40s and a resident of Osaka in western Japan, tested positive on Wednesday after developing a sore throat and chest pains, the prefectural government said. She first tested positive on 29 January and was discharged from the hospital after recovering on 1 February, before testing negative on 6 February. The health ministry confirmed the case was the first in Japan where a patient tested positive for coronavirus for a second time after being discharged from hospital, Japanese media said. Though a first in Japan, cases of second positive tests have been reported in China. Saudi Arabia has taken the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country five months before the annual hajj pilgrimages, in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus, after 240 cases were confirmed around the Middle East, most of them in Iran. Authorities in Riyadh said the ban was temporary, but did not say how long it might last. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. \u201cThe kingdom\u2019s government has decided to [suspend] entry to the kingdom for the purpose of umrah and visit to the prophet\u2019s mosque temporarily,\u201d the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died. A 61-year-old man, a school teacher from the Oise region, who died overnight on Tuesday of a pulmonary embolism after contracting the coronavirus, was said to have had no link to any of the areas at risk. The same goes for a 55-year-old French man, said to be a civilian member of staff at a military air base at Creil, also in the Oise, north of Paris, who is currently in a critical condition in intensive care in hospital in Amiens. The man was diagnosed as carrying the coronavirus on Wednesday. A third man, aged 36, who returned from Lombardy in Italy with the virus, is in hospital in Strasbourg. His condition has been described as not serious for the moment. \u201cThe two patients from the Oise have not been near the zones where there is a risk. That\u2019s why they were not at first considered to be possible cases of coronavirus,\u201d said Etienne Champion, director of the regional health agency. \u201cOur investigations are continuing to establish the source of these two contaminations,\u201d Champion added. The health authorities said they were contacting all those who might have come into contact with the technology teacher, including hospital staff, and his school colleagues, pupils from the four classes he taught and parents. Champion said the teacher had been off sick since 12 February. The school at Cr\u00e9py-en-Valois is currently closed for the half-term holidays. \u201cKnowing that the period between incubation and appearance of the illness is a maximum 14 days, only those children and adults who have been in contact (with him) and who show symptoms should make themselves known. We have passed the incubation period so anyone who is not ill today is not likely to have contracted it,\u201d he added. On Thursday morning, President Emmanuel Macron visited the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital where the teacher died after being transferred \u201cin a grave condition\u201d with breathing difficulties from a hospital in Creil. The first death in France was an 80-year-old tourist from China. The prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has ordered all primary and secondary schools to close from 2 March until the spring break, typically around the end of March. He was speaking at a meeting of the government\u2019s task force to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in Switzerland has increased to four, the Swiss health ministry has said. At least one of the new cases is linked to the outbreak in northern Italy. In a statement the ministry said: A person from the canton of Geneva and two people in the canton of Graub\u00fcnden have tested positive for the new coronavirus. The person in the canton of Geneva returned to Switzerland from the region of Milan a few days ago. All three are being treated in hospital in an isolation unit. Their health condition is good. The number of cases in Switzerland that have tested positive has therefore risen to four ... In view of the rising number of confirmed cases around the world, and particularly in northern Italy, it is likely that further cases will occur in Switzerland. The medical services are well prepared to identify and deal with suspected cases and treat further patients. There is no reason why schools should currently be closing due to fears about coronavirus, a government minister has said after some shut their doors following travel abroad by staff and pupils. The housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, also indicated that England rugby fans should still proceed with plans to attend the Six Nations fixture with Italy in Rome on Saturday week despite speculation that it may be cancelled. Schools \u201cwill have to make their own decision\u201d but the government had given clear advice based on medical opinion that there was no need to close, he told BBC Breakfast on Thursday. Covid-19 fears have driven European stock markets down to a fresh four-month low this morning. The latest two cases in the UK are among people who have travelled to Italy and Tenerife. The patients are being treated in Liverpool and London. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said: The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife and the patients have been transferred to specialist NHS infection centres in Royal Liverpool Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital, London. It comes after the authorities in Italy reported that the number of people infected in the country grew to 400 and 12 people have died. And 168 Britons have been told to isolate themselves at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife. Two more patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15, according to the the Department of Health and Social Care. The number of confirmed cases in South Korea has increased by 171 (more than 10%) from 1,595 to 1,766, according to the Yonhap news agency. Saudi Arabia has banned travel to the holiest sites in Islam over virus fears, AP reports. The extraordinary decision by Saudi Arabia stops foreigners from reaching the holy city of Mecca and the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day. The decision also affected travel to Prophet Muhammad\u2019s mosque in Medina. Authorities also suspended entry to the kingdom to those with tourist visas from nations affected by the new virus. The decision showed the worry about the outbreak potentially spreading into Saudi Arabia, whose oil-rich monarchy stakes its legitimacy on protecting Islam\u2019s holy sites. The centre of the outbreak in the Mideast\u2019s most-affected country, Iran, appears to be in the holy Shia city of Qom, where the faithful in reverence reach out to kiss and touch a famous shrine. Iran now has the highest death toll from the virus 22 dead amid 144 confirmed cases outside of China, where the outbreak began. There have been no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Saudi Arabia amid the outbreak. Disease outbreaks always have been a concern surrounding the hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life, especially as pilgrims come from all over the world. The official death toll from covid-19 cases in Iran has increased to 22 people, according to the state-run IRNA news agency. It also confirmed 141 cases of the virus, a day after officials imposed travel restrictions and a suspension of Friday prayers. A graphic published by the agency shows that the virus has spread to 20 of Irans 31 provinces. The hardest-hit among them remained the province home to the holy Shia city of Qom, with 63 confirmed cases. Experts fear Iran is underreporting the number of cases of the new virus as cases across the wider Persian Gulf have emerged in recent days linked back to the Islamic Republic. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Kuwait now has leapt from 26 to 43, according to a health ministry official. The official said that all the cases involved people who had been to Iran, Reuters reports. Updated advice from the Department for Education tells schools not to send pupils home unless they have had contact with a confirmed case of covid-19. The update comes after at least 13 schools closed amid accusations of inconsistent and conflicting advice. The advice says: Currently there are minimal cases outside the risk areas and therefore the likelihood of an individual coming into contact with a confirmed case is low. There is no need to advise any of these pupils, student or staff to avoid normal activities or educational settings unless they have had contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19. It says that pupils and staff should only be asked to self-isolate if they have travelled to a category 1 specified country or area in the past 14 days. AP has the latest breakdown of confirmed cases and deaths from the virus: Mainland China: 2,744 deaths among 78,497 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 81 cases, 2 deaths Macao: 10 cases South Korea: 1,595 cases, 13 deaths Japan: 894 cases, including 705 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 7 deaths Italy: 447 cases, 12 deaths Iran: 139 cases, 19 deaths Singapore: 93 United States: 60 Thailand: 40 Taiwan: 32 cases, 1 death Bahrain: 33 Australia: 23 Malaysia: 22 Kuwait: 26 France: 17 cases, 2 deaths Germany: 21 Vietnam: 16 United Arab Emirates: 13 United Kingdom: 13 Spain: 12 Canada: 12 Russia: 5 Iraq: 6 Oman: 4 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 Croatia: 3 Israel: 2 Pakistan: 2 Finland: 2 Austria: 2 Lebanon: 2 Egypt: 1 Algeria: 1 Afghanistan: 1 Greece: 1 North Macedonia: 1 Georgia: 1 Estonia: 1 Belgium: 1 Romania: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Cambodia: 1 Sweden: 2 Norway: 1 Denmark: 1 Switzerland: 1 Brazil 1 I\u2019ll be handing over this blog shortly to my colleagues in London. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest developments: China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. There are 334 new cases in South Korea, mostly in Daegu. Estonia, Denmark, Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. Stocks in Asia are headed for their worst week for two years after more heavy losses on Thursday Australia has extended its travel ban on China and enacted its emergency response plan, because \u201cthere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus\u201d, prime minister Scott Morrison said. US vice-president Mike Pence has been appointed by Donald Trump to lead and coordinate the US\u2019s response to the coronavirus. Trump said the risk to Americans is \u201cvery low\u201d but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn\u2019t think is inevitable, in contradiction to US health authorities who expect to see more cases. Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. Another case linked to Iran: Iraq has confirmed its sixth case of coronavirus, in a young Iraqi man in Baghdad who had traveled from Iran, the health ministry said today. Stocks in Asia are headed for their worst week for two years after more heavy losses on Thursday (all except mainland China shares): Nikkei closed down 2.13% Kospi in Seoul lost 0.7%. ASX200 in Sydney down 0.7% for the day. Hang Seng off 0.7% Shanghai Composite up 0.12% FTSE100 set to lose 2% this morning; S&amp;P500 futures off 1.5% US 10-year bond yields hit another record low Brent crude was down 63 cents, or 1.2%, at $52.80 a barrel Gold jumped $8.50 to $1,651.50 per ounce, silver rose 17 cents to $18.00 per ounce. Copper fell 2 cents to $2.58 per pound. North Korea, which has reported no cases of Covid-19, has postponed the start of the new school term. From AFP: \u201cSchool breaks for students have been extended as a preventive measure against the infection,\u201d the Korean Central Broadcasting Station reported, according to Yonhap news agency. The measure would apply to daycares, kindergartens and universities, it said, without specifying when schools would reopen. The North has banned tourists, suspended international trains and flights and placed hundreds of foreigners in quarantine, under tight restrictions the Russian ambassador has described as \u201cmorally crushing\u201d. Pyongyang planned to maintain the entry ban on foreigners until the virus can be properly diagnosed, treated and cured, a health official told the Choson Sinbo, a North Korean propaganda outlet based in Japan. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said it provided Pyongyang with 1,500 coronavirus diagnostic test kits at its request \u201cdue to the persisting risk of the new COVID-19\u201d. Denmark and Estonia have reported their first cases, according to local media. The Danish man is reported to have recently returned from a skiing holiday in northern Italy. He has been put in isolation in his own home. Interfax reported the Estonian case is an Iranian man. \u201cWe are talking about a permanent resident of Estonia who is not a citizen of Estonia,\u201d Interfax reported, citing Estonian Minister of Social Affairs Tanel Kiik. Chinese immigration authorities have said regions of the country which are at low risk for the virus should resume visa and passport services for foreign and domestic travellers. They said this would help get the nation back to work, Reuters is reporting. Medium-risk areas should do the same depending on the state of the epidemic within their borders, the China Immigration Administration also said. The immigration authority said on its official Weibo account that it would roll out measures to facilitate such moves, without providing further details. Some more detail from the AP on that new case in the US, which could be the first in the country with no known connection to travel abroad or another known case. Health officials say this is a possible sign the virus is spreading in a US community. California officials said the person is a resident of Solano County, northeast of San Francisco, and is getting medical care in Sacramento County. They said they have begun the process of tracking down people who the patient has been in contact with, a process known as contact tracing. The patient was brought to UC Davis Medical Center from another Northern California hospital on 19 February but it was four days before the CDC heeded a request to test the patient for COVID-19, according to an email sent to employees Wednesday by the hospital\u2019s interim CEO, Brad Simmons, and David Lubarsky, CEO of UC Davis Health. The patient arrived on a ventilator and special protection orders were issued \u201cbecause of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,\u201d according to the email, which was sent to employees. The hospital asked the CDC to test for the coronavirus but testing was delayed until Sunday \u201csince the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19,\u201d the email said. The hospital, which has treated other coronavirus patients, has been taking infection prevention precautions since the patient arrived. The email said officials believe there was only a small chance that others at the facility were exposed to the virus. \u201cNevertheless, a small number of medical center employees have been asked to stay home and monitor their temperatures,\u201d the email said. In Australia, the Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says hospitals have reported racism toward both medical staff and patients as fears of coronavirus grow. Mikakos told reporters at the Royal Children\u2019s hospital in Melbourne on Thursday: \u201cFear and anxiety around this coronavirus is not an excuse for racist behaviour. We will not tolerate it here in our public hospitals. People cannot pick and choose the doctors and nurses that attend to them.\u201d The director of emergency medicine at the Royal Children\u2019s, Dr Stuart Lewena, said a member of their medical staff was told by the parents of a child they were treating last week that \u201cthey weren\u2019t comfortable with her treating their child due to the risk of coronavirus, and it was clear that message was said on the basis of her race.\u201d \u201cWe intervened on that stage to highlight to that family that message was not acceptable and we\u2019ve been supporting that staff member.\u201d Lewena said three other staff members at the hospital had since reported that they had also had racist remarks directed toward them about coronavirus, but they had just \u201ctolerated it.\u201d He said staff had been told not to tolerate those comments, and the hospital provided staff with scripts for how to respond to racism linked to the coronavirus. Lewena again: \u201cUnderstandably if a person is confronted with such a message often words don\u2019t come easily to hand. So we thought it would be useful to give our staff some example scripts where we could both acknowledge the stress and the anxiety and the paranoia underlying that comment, but nonetheless express in no uncertain terms that we viewed that comment as inappropriate, that the department fully supports our staff to continue treating that patient, and that we don\u2019t want to tolerate what we see as racism.\u201d OK we have sought confirmation and the plan announced by Austalia\u2019s government today is this one, written about by my colleague Ben Doherty earlier this week. The emergency response plans says impact of the outbreak will be determined by: the clinical severity of the outbreak (how severe cases are, and many people need to be hospitalised) its transmissibility (how easily it is spread, currently it has a preliminary reproduction number of 1.4 to 2.5) the capacity of the health system to treat infected patients the effectiveness of interventions to treat the illness or stop it spreading There\u2019s a question on economic impacts. \u201cObviously the impact of a breakdown in supply chains or travel or right across the many sectors, there will be an impact on the economy,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cAnd I anticipate it will have a very real effect.\u201d \u201cAs I said, it\u2019s a health crisis, not a financial crisis. But it\u2019s a health crisis with very real economic impacts and the Government is extremely mindful of that and we want to be able to get our responses right. I can say, though, in terms of broader, larger, fiscal stimulus-type responses, that is not the advice we\u2019re receiving from Treasury.\u201d Q: Does Australia have sufficient quantities of medications like paracetamol. We have a national medicine stockpile, and there is are surveys and monitoring of any supply chain risks, says Hunt. Q: Will there be further extensions of the travel ban? A: It\u2019s being monitored weekly, says Morrison. \u201cThe advice we received today was that on the balance of risks, further travel bans were not recommended.\u201d Q: Will you be screening everyone off any flight, who looks sick? A: \u201cThis is what we\u2019ve tasked the Commissioner of Border Force to come with a plan for us.\u201d Questions now, and the first one is: what does this plan mean in practical terms? Hunt: \u201cThe position in relation to quarantine powers actually came with the activation of the biosecurity act and the chief medical officer\u2019s declaration on January 21. What this does is it now moves to a full preparation phase for all of the supply chains, the medicines, we\u2019re working on national inventories and the national medical stockpile.\u201d Hunt will meet with the council of Australian governments tomorrow. The health minister Greg Hunt is explaining that the declaration in January by the country\u2019s chief health officer, that this was a disease of pandemic potential, triggered a series of actions in Australia, including the engagement of various state and national bodies like the national critical care and trauma centre (which usually runs responses and deployments to overseas natural disasters). As a quick aside, Morrison says the travel ban for China will continue, and will be monitored weekly. We are well into this announcement by Morrison that Australia is getting ahead of the World Health Organisation and is implementing a pandemic response plan, despite the WHO not declaring a pandemic. He is yet to provide any detail of what this plan is, or how/if it will change anything for Australian people\u2019s daily life. When we have some, we\u2019ll bring it to you. While Morrison\u2019s announcement has some sense of alarm to it, he is also reassuring people. \u201cThere is no need for us to be moving to having mass gatherings of people stop. You the football and the cricket and play with your friends down the street, you can go after the concert and you can go out for a Chinese meal. You can do all of these things becauseAustralia has acted quickly, Australia has gone ahead of this at this point in time. But to stay ahead of it we need to now elevate our response to the next phase.\u201d The Australian Border Force commissioner will report to government \u201cas possible on additional measures that would be required a tour various ports of entry to ensure we are able to identify any persons coming from wherever in the world that may require additional information in terms of being self quarantined or other forms of quarantine that may be necessary The education minister will engage with state counterparts on the management of schools. An \u201ceven greater abundance of caution\u201d is needed to take care of children, even though there\u2019s no evidence they are any more at risk than other people. The minister for home affairs will oversee \u201ccontinuity\u201d between states and federal governments. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has announced the implementation of a Coronavirus emergency response plan. \u201cThere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus,\u201d he has just told reporters. \u201cWhile the WHO is yet to declare the nature of the coronavirus and its move towards a pandemic phase, we believe the risk of a pandemic is very much upon us and we as a government need to take steps necessary to prepare for such a pandemic.\u201d The move comes after the national security committee met on Thursday. The rate of transmission outside of China is \u201cfundamentally changing\u201d the way authorities in Australia need to manage the issue, Morrison said. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt earlier told the country\u2019s parliament that they were as well-prepared as anywhere else. \u201cThe arc of the virus continues to expand,\u201d he said, noting the growing list of countries diagnosing cases. \u201cWe are not immune but we are well prepared.\u201d The Australian prime minister and health authorities will have a detailed update shortly. The country has more than 20 cases, including a number from the Diamond Princess cruiseship, but no community transmissions. Via the AP, South Korea has followed China in expressing dismay at travel restrictions imposed by other countries. About 40 nations and regions so far have prohibited or restricted South Korean visitors, according to Lee Lee Tae-ho, Seoul\u2019s second vice minister of foreign affairs, who described such moves as excessive and said his government has been effectively utilising its world-best quarantine capabilities. But calls have grown inside South Korea for expanding its own entry ban, which currently covers only visitors from China\u2019s Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital. China has put Wuhan and nearby cities on lockdown, many airlines have reduced Chinese flights, and many places have increased monitoring of arrivals from China, all resulting in far few Chinese arrivals around the globe. Lee said the inflow of Chinese into South Korea has been reduced by more than 80%. On Wednesday evening, local time, US president Donald Trump indicated he was considering further travel restrictions on people from countries with outbreaks - adding to those already in place for travellers from China - but said now was not the right time. Hello and welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus. Here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest developments. If you\u2019re looking for more detail you can catch up with the earlier blog over here. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new cases. There were 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. There are 334 new cases in South Korea, mostly in Daegu. Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. US vice-president Mike Pence will lead and coordinate the US\u2019s response to the coronavirus. President Donald Trump said the risk to Americans is \u201cvery low\u201d but that plans are in place for a spread of the virus, which he doesn\u2019t think is inevitable, in contradiction to US health authorities who expect to see more cases. Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. US secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, says \u201cwe can expect to see more cases in the US\u201d, and while containment is working, \u201cthe degree of risk can change quickly\u201d. The National Institute of Health said a vaccine is at least 12-18 months away, so will not help this current outbreak, but may assist a seasonal return. The answer right now is containment. Trump said \u201cit\u2019s not the right time\u201d to extend travel restrictions to other affected countries like Italy and South Korea. Stock markets in Asia saw mounting losses on Thursday\u2019s open. Prestigious sporting events are at risk, with organisers of the Six Nations, the Cheltenham Festival, the Giro d\u2019Italia, Euro 202 and the Tokyo Olympics all monitoring the situation. A number of countries have extended travel bans due to virus fears, including Fiji, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. About 40 nations and regions so far have prohibited or restricted South Korean visitors, according to Lee Lee Tae-ho, Seoul\u2019s second vice minister of foreign affairs.",

Here are the key developments on Thursday: Coronavirus could trigger economic damage on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, analysts have warned, amid growing concerns over the fallout from the deadly disease. The death toll in Iran has risen to 26, with almost 250 people diagnosed with the virus. Two more people have died from coronavirus in Italy, bringing the death toll to 14. The number of confirmed cases has risen to more than 520. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said that if the coronavirus becomes a pandemic schools in the UK could close for two months. He also said that while the coronavirus presents \u201csome challenges\u201d, he does not think the world is facing anything on the level of the deadly Spanish flu in 1918. Two further patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of UK cases to 15. The virus was passed on in Italy and Tenerife, and the patients have been transferred to specialists at the Royal Liverpool hospital and the Royal Free hospital, London. Northern Ireland reported its first case: a man who had returned from northern Italy via Dublin airport. Saudi Arabia has taken the unprecedented step of banning foreign pilgrims from entering the country in an effort to halt the spread of coronavirus. The country has yet to report a case of the virus. A woman working as a tour bus guide in Japan has tested positive for coronavirus for a second time. The Japanese government has ordered the closure of all schools and museum for a month. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned an epidemic that is on the way\u201d. There are now 18 confirmed cases of coronavirus in France and two people have died. More cases have been reported all over the world including in Switzerland, Kuwait, Spain, South Korea and Austria. The Netherlands, Estonia, Denmark, Pakistan, Georgia, Norway, North Macedonia, Greece and Romania are among countries to report their first case of coronavirus in the last day. China\u2019s health authority has reported another drop in the number of new infections, with 433 new confirmed cases and 29 deaths in mainland China on Wednesday. Donald Trump has sought to play down the threat from coronavirus despite mounting concerns about unchecked worldwide contagion. In a press conference in Washington, the US president said the danger to Americans \u201cremains very low\u201d and predicted that the number of cases diagnosed in the country, currently on 15, could fall to zero in a \u201cfew days\u201d. But Anne Schuchat, deputy director of the US CDC, said \u201cthe trajectory of what we are looking at over the weeks and months ahead is very uncertain\u201d, and authorities should \u201cdust off\u201d their pandemic preparedness plans. Australia has extended its travel ban on China and enacted its emergency response plan, because \u201cthere is every indication the world will soon enter the pandemic phase of the virus\u201d, said the prime minister, Scott Morrison.",

      "body": "<h2>CITY SLICKERS</h2> <p>The Fiver has always loved post-coital awkwardness. OK, OK, The Fiver has always loved the <em>idea</em> of post-coital awkwardness. We never did get to experience an abhorgasm, but the idea fascinates us on both a primal and philosophical level. As such, we\u2019ve taken great interest in Manchester City\u2019s Big Cup campaign, which could yet end with a public display of post-coital awkwardness, not to mention an excruciating lack of eye contact, between City and Uefa in Istanbul on 30 May.</p> <p>The relationship between the two has been strained since 2012, when Uefa decided that tardiness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/11/manchester-city-fined-porto-racism\">was a greater offence than racism</a>. City fans regularly boo the Big Cup anthem, and their match against Real Madrid was punctuated by chants from the away fans of \u201cEff Uefa!\u201d And they yet might! <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/26/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-last-16-first-leg-match-report\">City\u2019s impressive 2-1 victory</a> was a statement of Big Cup-winning intent, not to mention an emphatic two fingers in the direction of anyone and everyone connected with Uefa. With all due respect to Lierse and Total Network Solutions, it was the first time City have ever won away to a European superpower in a knockout game. It was also the first time under Pep Guardiola that they have really looked like a team that might win Big Cup, and should do all sorts for their confidence, provided they don\u2019t make a City of the second leg.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/pep-guardiola-tactics-real-madrid-manchester-city\">Guardiola dips into his bible to find tactical blueprint for win in Madrid | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Madrid weren\u2019t great, that much is true, but City were superior in all the relevant metrics of performance and even scored more goals than their opponent. Pep\u2019s uber-funky tactics \u2013 Gabriel Jesus wide left, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva up front, BASICALLY FOUR-FOUR-BLOODY-TWO FOR HEAVEN\u2019S SAKE \u2013 paid off, with City controlling most of the game and winning it late on. (There is an argument that Pep got lucky, and that City only won the game when he changed tactics and brought Raheem Sterling on, but The Fiver had a full tactical debrief with him on WhatsTok and he assures us that it was all part of the plan to use one of the best players in the world when the opposition defence was on its last legs.)</p> <p>The tactics were not completely new \u2013 City played the same way to destroy Manchester United in the Milk Cup semi-final first leg at Old Trafford \u2013 but they took a lot of people by surprise. De Bruyne, the most watchable player in the world and no we\u2019re not interested in discussing it but thanks for asking so politely, excelled in his unusual role. \u201cI think in the four years we are here with Pep we had some surprises and even the players, they don\u2019t really know until the game starts what we need to do,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/guardiolas-tactics-for-real-madrid-win-surprised-city-players-says-de-bruyne\">he said</a>, failing to convince anybody the formation hadn\u2019t been practised to within an inch of its life. \u201cThis is a really good start for us.\u201d</p> <p>City\u2019s rousing victory prompted their No 1 fan Liam Gallagher to issue a lyrical treatise of the match on Social Media Disgrace Twitter: \u201cKiss my blue ar$e UEFA c***s LGx.\u201d If that\u2019s not an invite to post-coital awkwardness, we don\u2019t know what is.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live\">Join Rob Smyth from 5.55pm GMT for hot Big Vase clockwatch coverage, while Tumaini Carayol will be on deck for Manchester United 3-0 Club Brugge (agg: 4-1) at 8pm</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cDo I think in the next 10 years it will challenge the European leagues?

Bolton were docked 12 points, so started the league on -12. Thus, at the start of the season, their \u2018something\u2019 of -12 was in fact much worse than the \u2018nothing\u2019 everyone else has. The fact Bolton are still bottom of the table helps illustrate that.

      "bodyText": "CITY SLICKERS The Fiver has always loved post-coital awkwardness. OK, OK, The Fiver has always loved the idea of post-coital awkwardness. We never did get to experience an abhorgasm, but the idea fascinates us on both a primal and philosophical level. As such, we\u2019ve taken great interest in Manchester City\u2019s Big Cup campaign, which could yet end with a public display of post-coital awkwardness, not to mention an excruciating lack of eye contact, between City and Uefa in Istanbul on 30 May. The relationship between the two has been strained since 2012, when Uefa decided that tardiness was a greater offence than racism. City fans regularly boo the Big Cup anthem, and their match against Real Madrid was punctuated by chants from the away fans of \u201cEff Uefa!\u201d And they yet might! City\u2019s impressive 2-1 victory was a statement of Big Cup-winning intent, not to mention an emphatic two fingers in the direction of anyone and everyone connected with Uefa. With all due respect to Lierse and Total Network Solutions, it was the first time City have ever won away to a European superpower in a knockout game. It was also the first time under Pep Guardiola that they have really looked like a team that might win Big Cup, and should do all sorts for their confidence, provided they don\u2019t make a City of the second leg. Madrid weren\u2019t great, that much is true, but City were superior in all the relevant metrics of performance and even scored more goals than their opponent. Pep\u2019s uber-funky tactics \u2013 Gabriel Jesus wide left, Kevin De Bruyne and Bernardo Silva up front, BASICALLY FOUR-FOUR-BLOODY-TWO FOR HEAVEN\u2019S SAKE \u2013 paid off, with City controlling most of the game and winning it late on. (There is an argument that Pep got lucky, and that City only won the game when he changed tactics and brought Raheem Sterling on, but The Fiver had a full tactical debrief with him on WhatsTok and he assures us that it was all part of the plan to use one of the best players in the world when the opposition defence was on its last legs.) The tactics were not completely new \u2013 City played the same way to destroy Manchester United in the Milk Cup semi-final first leg at Old Trafford \u2013 but they took a lot of people by surprise. De Bruyne, the most watchable player in the world and no we\u2019re not interested in discussing it but thanks for asking so politely, excelled in his unusual role. \u201cI think in the four years we are here with Pep we had some surprises and even the players, they don\u2019t really know until the game starts what we need to do,\u201d he said, failing to convince anybody the formation hadn\u2019t been practised to within an inch of its life. \u201cThis is a really good start for us.\u201d City\u2019s rousing victory prompted their No 1 fan Liam Gallagher to issue a lyrical treatise of the match on Social Media Disgrace Twitter: \u201cKiss my blue ar$e UEFA c***s LGx.\u201d If that\u2019s not an invite to post-coital awkwardness, we don\u2019t know what is. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth from 5.55pm GMT for hot Big Vase clockwatch coverage, while Tumaini Carayol will be on deck for Manchester United 3-0 Club Brugge (agg: 4-1) at 8pm. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cDo I think in the next 10 years it will challenge the European leagues? It\u2019s what we all hope for. It\u2019s what we will strive to commit to ... This should never be a league where players from Europe come to retire. That\u2019s not where you want to be\u201d \u2013 David Beckham, who moved to MLS from Europe to spend five of the final six years of his career, talks up Major League Soccerball on the eve of his Inter Miami FC\u2019s first game. RECOMMENDED LISTENING The latest Football Weekly Extra podcast is right here. Meanwhile, tickets are also on sale for the next live show in London. FIVER LETTERS \u201cIt\u2019s quite astonishing that the Middlesbrough managerial dream team of Jonathan Woodgate and Robbie Keane have a win ratio of only 21% after the defeat at home to Nasty Leeds. And yet, even if they lose every one of their 11 remaining games this season, they still won\u2019t have surpassed the high mark for managerial ineptitude that is John Carver\u2019s 15% win ratio at Newcastle United\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cI\u2019m sure that fans of Bolton \u2013 as well as myself \u2013 would disagree with Noble Francis\u2019 assertion that something, even late and poor quality, is better than nothing (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Bolton were docked 12 points, so started the league on -12. Thus, at the start of the season, their \u2018something\u2019 of -12 was in fact much worse than the \u2018nothing\u2019 everyone else has. The fact Bolton are still bottom of the table helps illustrate that. Had they got those 12 points back, they\u2019d rise to the heady heights of \u2026 erm \u2026 second bottom\u201d \u2013 Paul Dixon. \u201cNo article has made me laugh quite as much as Simon Burnton\u2019s recap of Manchester City flouting financial rules in 1906 (yesterday\u2019s Still Want More?). Not because of the wonderful synchronicity, but entirely down to the description from the sportswriter at the time of a certain Alex Leake, who was immortalised as \u2018without doubt, the merriest footballer of the day\u2019. I challenge The Fiver to confirm which modern footballer would genuinely earn that wonderful epithet without the merriest part being entirely reliant on Tin\u201d \u2013 Colin Reed. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Paul Dixon. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS The Asian Football Confederation will hold an emergency meeting next week to discuss contingency plans for holding World Cup and Olympic qualifiers amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The top division of women\u2019s football in Finland will change its name from Women\u2019s League to National League (Kansallinen Liiga) in the latest move to implement \u201cfull equality\u201d in running the country\u2019s football. Liverpool made a pre-tax profit of \u00a342m and increased turnover to \u00a3533m in 2018-19 as their rise to Big Cup champions was reflected on the balance sheet \u2026 and without any dubious claims about trending for mockery reasons on assorted Social Media Disgraces. Venezuelan coach Rafael Dudamel has been turfed out by Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro less than two months after he took charge, following their shock Brazilian Cup defeat by Afogados da Ingazeira. And Blackpool have now been rebuffed in their bid to prise Richie Wellens from his role as manager of Swindon Town. Coincidentally for Wellens, he\u2019s also now signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract. STILL WANT MORE? Floating brain in a jar Jonathan Wilson dons his tweed jacket, leather elbow pads and mortar board to theorise that Pep Guardiola reverted to the principles he devised in 2015 to beat a deeply ordinary Madrid. Gabriel Jesus: relentless, tenacious, and now ahead of Ag\u00fcero? Barney Ronay has a think. There is something shifting at Real Madrid, some sense of vulnerability, reckons Sid Lowe. Christian Pav\u00f3n, Pity Martinez, Carlos Vela, Nashville SC and, yes, Inter Miami: our writers look ahead to, and make their predictions for, the new MLS season. Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea have a lot of rebuilding work to do if they are to remain Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea for the long term, warns Jacob Steinberg.

      "bodyText": "The world still continues to grapple with the impact of coronavirus, and now with more new infections outside of China for the first time, questions are being raised as to whether the world can contain it, and whether it is safe for Australians to go on their Easter overseas holidays while there is still so much uncertainty. Here is the latest on the travel situation. Will I still be able to go on holidays over Easter? For Australians, the current travel advice from the department of foreign affairs and trade (Dfat) just states to not travel to China. Dfat has also warned there is a heightened risk of transmission of coronavirus for people travelling to parts of Northern Italy, South Korea, Iran and Japan. Big questions remain over top Australian travel destination Indonesia, which has not, at the time of reporting, declared any coronavirus cases. Are Australians cancelling their trips? It is too early to determine whether Australians by and large are cancelling their plans and staying home. A number of big travel companies have reported to market that coronavirus will hurt their profits, but cannot currently say what impact it will ultimately have. \u201cLeisure travel patterns have also been increasingly affected recently, with some customers reviewing or reconsidering short-term holiday plans and monitoring the virus\u2019s possible spread to locations outside China and Asia in the future,\u201d Flight Centre told the market this week. \u201cIt is impossible to predict the virus\u2019s impact at this time, but [Flight Centre] expects it will lead to subdued activity through to the end of FY20.\u201d Webjet said the main impact was in China, with flow-on effects to the rest of the Asia-Pacific region, and minor impact on Europe and the United States. Helloworld told the market last week it expected coronavirus to impact tickets to China, Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent Singapore. A spokeswoman told Guardian Australia the company had not seen any reduction in flights to Bali yet, but was closely monitoring the situation. What\u2019s happening with flights? Due to the cancellations major airlines including Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin are cutting flights across Asia as a result of a drop in demand due to coronavirus. Qantas is cutting around half of its Hong Kong flights to and from Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne, and reducing the number of flights to New Zealand by 6%. Jetstar is cutting the number of flights to Japan and Phuket by up to two a week. Virgin Australia reported the coronavirus had reduced international and domestic demand, and as a result the company was cutting several domestic routes for budget carrier Tiger: Sydney to Adelaide, Cairns to Coffs Harbour, Melbourne to Coffs Harbour, and Hobart to Gold Coast. The company is still forging ahead with plans for the Brisbane to Tokyo route launching next month. People with flights booked are encouraged to check their flight status, as they may be moved to a different flight due to the decreased demand. What about cruises? Helloworld also indicated it was seeing a downturn in cruise bookings, but according to Cruise Lines International Association in a statement earlier this month, most bookings are still currently going ahead. People who have travelled from or through China within 14 days of embarkation will not be allowed on board, as well as those who have been in close contact with someone suspected or diagnosed with coronavirus. There will also be extra screening measures and medical support. Will my travel insurance cover me? It depends on when it was purchased. Lisa Kable, communications manager for the Insurance Council of Australia, told Guardian Australia that after Dfat made its announcement on 23 January on the risk of travel regarding coronavirus, it became a \u201cknown event\u201d for insurers that is adjusted for coverage. \u201cIf people are travelling and bought their travel insurance before it became a known event \u2026 the majority of travel insurance policies should cover people if they contract coronavirus overseas, or if their trips have to be moved around countries or places. \u201cIf you bought it after, most travel insurers exclude pandemic, epidemic disease or infectious disease or a known event.\u201d The same rules apply if people are already travelling, or have yet to start travelling \u2013 it only matters when the insurance was purchased. What sort of travel insurance should I get? If you are planning to travel and haven\u2019t bought insurance yet, Kable says people should call a travel insurer and find out what the best product is. \u201cThere is a travel insurance product in the market called \u2018cancel for any reason\u2019. It\u2019s not a bad thing for people to be considering, it\u2019s an optional extra \u2013 it might give some people peace of mind if they\u2019re booking three or six months [ahead] and we\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going on.\u201d Kable said people can get 75% back on what they\u2019ve spent, but they need to buy it within 48 hours of booking flights and accomodation and other big purchases. \u201cBuy the right travel insurance, do a bit of research,\u201d Kable says.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO says we still need more information about the severity of the disease. In China, where the vast majority of cases and deaths have so far occurred, we know that 81% of people have had only mild illness. Of the rest, 14% have severe disease, which may become pneumonia, and 5% have critical disease involving breathing problems and organ failure.</p> \n<p>The death rate has been estimated at between 2 and 4% in Wuhan, where the epidemic began, but only 0.7% in the rest of China. But we still do not know how many people are not being counted in these statistics, because they suffer only a sore throat and do not go to hospital.</p> \n<p>It is clear that those people with damaged or failing immune systems are most at risk. \u201cOlder people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes) appear to be more vulnerable,\u201d says the WHO. But we do not know why children, who are very susceptible to some diseases, do not seem to be much affected by Covid-19.</p> \n<p>We do not know whether any of the antiviral drugs in existence will help people recover \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/07/china-trials-anti-hiv-drug-coronavirus-patients\">some, including anti-HIV/Aids drugs, are being given to patients as part of trials in China</a>.

We know that certain countries are already much more affected than us,\u201d Macron said while visiting staff at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris, where the first French victim of the virus, a 60-year old teacher, died on Tuesday night.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that we\u2019re only at the beginning. We\u2019re going to try to make the right decisions,\u201d Macron added.</p> <p>On Thursday evening French authorities said the number of confirmed cases in the country had more than doubled in 24 hours to 38. The health minister, Olivier Veran, said this was due to the identification of so-called \u201ccontact persons\u201d linked to previously known cases.</p> <p>Macron\u2019s comments came as the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the world was at \u201ca decisive point\u201d in a crisis that has now hit 47 countries, adding that epidemics in Iran, Italy and South Korea \u201cdemonstrate what this virus is capable of\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3392e76c5295ca7ffedb7cd8f95b239d29ffb68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3392e76c5295ca7ffedb7cd8f95b239d29ffb68/0_77_4698_2819/1000.jpg\" alt=\"French President Emmanuel Macron visits the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">French President Emmanuel Macron visits the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Bureau/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tedros said the number of new cases in China had been outstripped by new cases outside the country for a second day running. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world that\u2019s now our greatest concern,\u201d he cautioned.</p> <p>Almost 3,000 people worldwide have died of Covid-19 so far, and some 82,000 have been infected, mainly in China.</p> <p>Complicating the issue in several countries is the emergence of cases without any apparent link to China, Italy or other centres of the outbreak.</p> <p>With new confirmed cases being identified in the last 24 hours from Northern Ireland and Derbyshire in the UK, to Spain, Italy and Germany \u2013 many with links to the initial European outbreak in northern Italy \u2013 countries were scrambling to introduce measures to contain the spread of the disease.</p> <p>Among them was Greece, where the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said his country would tighten its border controls including around a key migrant route, amid fears the infection could enter overcrowded refugee camps, which have already been described as a \u201cticking health bomb\u201d.</p> <p>Russia also announced that it would suspend the train service from Moscow to the southern French city of Nice from 4 March as part of wider measures. The train runs through Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy and Monaco.</p> <p>Moscow also announced it would suspend some flights to and from Iran from Friday, except those operated by its national carrier Aeroflot and Iranian airline Mahan Air. It announced this week it would suspend some flights to and from South Korea and would also stop issuing visas to Iranian citizens for regular and transit travel from 28 February.</p> <p>As cases of the disease appeared in 10 new countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Norway, North Macedonia, Pakistan and Romania - other nations also introduced new measures to attempt to control the outbreak. They included:</p> <ul> <li><p>Japan, which has announced it will close schools nationwide for several weeks from Monday.</p></li> <li><p>Iran, a major outbreak centre with a death toll of 26 out of 245 cases, where authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected cases of the coronavirus and restrictions on Friday prayers.</p></li> <li><p>Saudi Arabia, which has temporarily suspended visas for visits to Islam\u2019s holiest sites for the umrah pilgrimage, an unprecedented move triggered by coronavirus fears.</p></li> <li><p>South Korea, the largest outbreak centre outside of China with 1,766 cases, where planned joint military exercises with the US have been postponed.</p></li> <li><p>Israel, which has denied entry to dozens of foreign nationals who landed on flights from Italy on Thursday.</p></li> </ul> <p>For its part Italy\u2019s government, desperate to stave off a likely recession over the devastating impact to tourism and its northern industrial heartland, on Thursday changed the way it counted its coronavirus cases to distinguish between people who had tested positive for the virus and patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, in an apparent effort to ameliorate the impact.</p> <p>But even as ministers took to the airwaves with reassuring messages, officials said the death toll had risen to 17, while the number of people confirmed to have contracted the illness rose to 650.</p> <p>The latest developments emerged as Spanish officials said that none of the 700-plus guests at a hotel in lockdown in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, including some 100 British tourists, have shown any symptoms of the virus and 130 of them have been cleared to leave the building.</p>",

With new evidence of unexplained cases of transmission emerging in Spain, Germany and France, the mounting public health crisis on the continent forced the cancellation of public events from Geneva to Greece, including sporting events, carnivals and trade conventions amid further sharp stock market falls and disruption to European travel. \u201cWe are facing a crisis, an epidemic that is coming. We know that certain countries are already much more affected than us,\u201d Macron said while visiting staff at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris, where the first French victim of the virus, a 60-year old teacher, died on Tuesday night. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re only at the beginning. We\u2019re going to try to make the right decisions,\u201d Macron added. On Thursday evening French authorities said the number of confirmed cases in the country had more than doubled in 24 hours to 38. The health minister, Olivier Veran, said this was due to the identification of so-called \u201ccontact persons\u201d linked to previously known cases. Macron\u2019s comments came as the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned that the world was at \u201ca decisive point\u201d in a crisis that has now hit 47 countries, adding that epidemics in Iran, Italy and South Korea \u201cdemonstrate what this virus is capable of\u201d. Tedros said the number of new cases in China had been outstripped by new cases outside the country for a second day running. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s happening in the rest of the world that\u2019s now our greatest concern,\u201d he cautioned. Almost 3,000 people worldwide have died of Covid-19 so far, and some 82,000 have been infected, mainly in China. Complicating the issue in several countries is the emergence of cases without any apparent link to China, Italy or other centres of the outbreak. With new confirmed cases being identified in the last 24 hours from Northern Ireland and Derbyshire in the UK, to Spain, Italy and Germany \u2013 many with links to the initial European outbreak in northern Italy \u2013 countries were scrambling to introduce measures to contain the spread of the disease. Among them was Greece, where the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, said his country would tighten its border controls including around a key migrant route, amid fears the infection could enter overcrowded refugee camps, which have already been described as a \u201cticking health bomb\u201d. Russia also announced that it would suspend the train service from Moscow to the southern French city of Nice from 4 March as part of wider measures. The train runs through Belarus, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy and Monaco. Moscow also announced it would suspend some flights to and from Iran from Friday, except those operated by its national carrier Aeroflot and Iranian airline Mahan Air. It announced this week it would suspend some flights to and from South Korea and would also stop issuing visas to Iranian citizens for regular and transit travel from 28 February. As cases of the disease appeared in 10 new countries \u2013 the Netherlands, Brazil, Denmark, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Norway, North Macedonia, Pakistan and Romania - other nations also introduced new measures to attempt to control the outbreak. They included: Japan, which has announced it will close schools nationwide for several weeks from Monday. Iran, a major outbreak centre with a death toll of 26 out of 245 cases, where authorities announced domestic travel restrictions for people with confirmed or suspected cases of the coronavirus and restrictions on Friday prayers. Saudi Arabia, which has temporarily suspended visas for visits to Islam\u2019s holiest sites for the umrah pilgrimage, an unprecedented move triggered by coronavirus fears. South Korea, the largest outbreak centre outside of China with 1,766 cases, where planned joint military exercises with the US have been postponed. Israel, which has denied entry to dozens of foreign nationals who landed on flights from Italy on Thursday. For its part Italy\u2019s government, desperate to stave off a likely recession over the devastating impact to tourism and its northern industrial heartland, on Thursday changed the way it counted its coronavirus cases to distinguish between people who had tested positive for the virus and patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, in an apparent effort to ameliorate the impact. But even as ministers took to the airwaves with reassuring messages, officials said the death toll had risen to 17, while the number of people confirmed to have contracted the illness rose to 650. The latest developments emerged as Spanish officials said that none of the 700-plus guests at a hotel in lockdown in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands, including some 100 British tourists, have shown any symptoms of the virus and 130 of them have been cleared to leave the building.",

The now vice-president, an ardent evangelical who regularly introduces himself in speeches as \u201ca Christian, a conservative and a Republican \u2013 in that order\u201d, has a troubling record on HIV that goes back even further. As a congressman, Pence supported a controversial plank of George W Bush\u2019s global Aids program, which stipulated 33% of funds must be spent on efforts to promote sexual abstinence and strict heterosexual monogamy. \u201cThe timeless values of abstinence and marital faithfulness before condom distribution are the cure for what ails the families of Africa,\u201d Pence told Congress in 2003. \u201cIt is important that we not just send them money, but we must send them values that work.\u201d Democrats scrambled to respond to Pence\u2019s new position in the US handling of coronavirus on Thursday. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said she had spoken with Pence about coronavirus, and made her concerns known. Leading Democrats have called for spending many times greater than the $2.5bn proposed by Trump earlier this week for dealing with US preparation to contain the outbreak. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the first-term progressive congresswoman with a huge following nationwide, summed up the feelings of many opponents of Trump. \u201cMike Pence literally does not believe in science,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt is utterly irresponsible to put him in charge of US coronavirus response as the world sits on the cusp of a pandemic. \u201cThis decision could cost people their lives. Pence\u2019s past decisions already have.\u201d The Trump administration had been criticized for its response even before Pence\u2019s appointment. Trump, during his trip to India this week, told journalists that the coronavirus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. That stood in stark contrast to the assessment of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which subsequently warned the virus could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to people\u2019s lives. \u201cUltimately, we expect we will see community spread [of coronavirus] in this country,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, the head of immunization at the CDC. With Pence in charge of the medical response, Americans are now anxiously awaiting answers. But his track record is giving pause. \u201cTime for a quick reality check,\u201d Pence wrote in a post on his website back in 2000, the year he was elected to the House. \u201cDespite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn\u2019t kill.\u201d Scientists had long concluded that exactly the opposite was true. When Pence became governor of Indiana, in 2013, he slashed funding for programs designed to prevent smoking and help people quit. As of 2018, Indiana had the eighth highest rate of cigarette smokers in the country.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>However, she said: \u201cOne thing becoming clear is we just can\u2019t predict the spread of this and how bad it can be. But it\u2019s not difficult to get to something similar to the 2008 crisis with a pandemic situation. Of course, we hope it won\u2019t get that bad.\u201d</p> \n<p>Central banks around the world would be all but powerless to mitigate the economic effect of so much business grinding to a halt, according to the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. \u201cIf it\u2019s a pure adverse supply shock, there is not much monetary policy can do,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>A supply shock is when there is disruption to production of goods and supply of services \u2013 such as shops and factories closing down. Monetary policy cannot keep them open.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday night Donald Trump hailed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-trump-says-risk-to-us-is-very-low-as-australia-enacts-emergency-plan\">\u201ctremendous success\u201d</a> in tackling the virus, but Janet Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, later said the American economy could be driven into recession.</p> \n<p>Goldman Sachs appeared to lend weight to her warning, predicting that US companies could record zero earnings growth this year if coronavirus spreads much further.</p> \n<p>The price of oil tumbled to a 13-month low on expectations of reduced economic activity, while City investors rushed to buy assets seen as safe havens in times of turmoil, such as government bonds.</p> \n<p>Supply shortages from manufacturers in China, where factories have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/scared-china-workers-halt-firms-return-to-business\">closed in an attempt to control the disease</a>, have already combined with sharp decline in consumer demand to trigger a string of corporate profit warnings.</p> \n<p>Demand for disinfectants such as Dettol and Lysol has soared, according to the household goods firm Reckitt Benckiser.

      "bodyText": "Fears over the spread of coronavirus have prompted a record plunge in the US stock market, as analysts warned the outbreak could wreak economic havoc on a scale not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst one-day fall \u2013 1,190 points \u2013 losing 4.4%, as fears of a global pandemic hit investor confidence. The FTSE 100 slumped by 3.5%, extending a losing streak that puts the blue-chip share index on course for its worst week since the eurozone debt crisis in 2011. Thursday\u2019s slump in financial markets came as countries stepped up efforts to contain the virus by banning travel, closing schools and postponing major sporting events and business conferences. British officials sought to prepare the public for all eventualities. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said that in the event of a global pandemic public events may have to be cancelled and schools closed for more than two months. As three new cases were identified in the UK on Thursday, including the first in Northern Ireland, and Public Health England sent a specialist to Tenerife to help manage an outbreak there, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said there was still \u201ca good chance\u201d of avoiding a pandemic but he acknowledged it was a \u201cpotential outcome\u201d. The value of London-listed companies has fallen by more than \u00a3150bn since markets opened on Monday, a prolonged selloff widely attributed to Covid-19. As well as being the Dow\u2019s worst points fall ever, the index\u2019s 4.4% drop was its worst percentage fall in two years. Meanwhile the tech-focused Nasdaq index tumbled by 4.6%, its worst daily loss since 2011. Scott Minerd of financial services firm Guggenheim Partners told Bloomberg TV that the coronavirus outbreak \u201cis possibly the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my career\u201d, a time-span which includes the 1987 crash and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. \u201cThis has the potential to reel into something extremely serious,\u201d Minerd warned. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine a scenario where you can actually contain this, and so that\u2019s the thing that to me is very frightening.\u201d A flurry of big names joined the lengthening list of companies reporting a serious impact on their finances and warning of further pain ahead if the outbreak\u2019s progress cannot be halted soon. Microsoft, PayPal and Standard Chartered all forecast disappointing profits. Facebook cancelled its annual developer conference in California where the company usually unveils new products to thousands of software engineers and entrepreneurs. Goldman Sachs warned coronavirus could wipe out profit growth at US companies in 2020. Aston Martin predicted falling sales and warned of disruption to its supply chain. Property firms pulled out of the industry\u2019s annual Mipim conference, due to take place in Cannes next month. Budweiser beer owner ABInBev reported a $170m hit to profits. Advertising firm WPP quarantined staff returning from Asian countries. Cosmetics firm L\u2019Or\u00e9al banned travel for its 86,000 staff. Shoemaker Crocs said Asian disruption would cut its revenues by up to $30m. Some of the world\u2019s best-known brands such as Apple, McDonalds and Starbucks have already counted the cost of the outbreak, while entire industries such as tourism, aviation and the automotive sector are struggling to cope with disruption. Analysts are now warning that the combined effect of the virus and measures put in place to prevent its spread could weigh heavily on the global economy. According to the consultancy Capital Economics, the outbreak turning into a full-blown international pandemic would trigger severe upheaval for world trade, markets and currencies on a par with the financial crisis, when global GDP fell by 0.5%. Jennifer McKeown, head of its global economics service, said there was still hope that the outbreak could be contained, with limited negative impact for businesses and countries. However, she said: \u201cOne thing becoming clear is we just can\u2019t predict the spread of this and how bad it can be. But it\u2019s not difficult to get to something similar to the 2008 crisis with a pandemic situation. Of course, we hope it won\u2019t get that bad.\u201d Central banks around the world would be all but powerless to mitigate the economic effect of so much business grinding to a halt, according to the Bank of England\u2019s deputy governor Jon Cunliffe. \u201cIf it\u2019s a pure adverse supply shock, there is not much monetary policy can do,\u201d he said. A supply shock is when there is disruption to production of goods and supply of services \u2013 such as shops and factories closing down. Monetary policy cannot keep them open. On Wednesday night Donald Trump hailed \u201ctremendous success\u201d in tackling the virus, but Janet Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, later said the American economy could be driven into recession. Goldman Sachs appeared to lend weight to her warning, predicting that US companies could record zero earnings growth this year if coronavirus spreads much further. The price of oil tumbled to a 13-month low on expectations of reduced economic activity, while City investors rushed to buy assets seen as safe havens in times of turmoil, such as government bonds. Supply shortages from manufacturers in China, where factories have been closed in an attempt to control the disease, have already combined with sharp decline in consumer demand to trigger a string of corporate profit warnings. Demand for disinfectants such as Dettol and Lysol has soared, according to the household goods firm Reckitt Benckiser. However, the UK firm, which also makes brands including Nurofen, Durex and Finish, said it was seeing disruption at retailers and in distribution and supply chains. Microsoft said supply chain disruption would affect its PC business, meaning it would miss sales forecasts, while PayPal predicted revenues at the bottom of its expected range. Aston Martin, which is already struggling to reverse deepening losses, warned of an impact on sales and supply chains, pointing out that China has been its fastest-growing market. The property industry is gearing up for its annual Mipim conference in the south of France next month, with organisers insisting it will go ahead as planned. But the pledge was cast into doubt after major real estate players including Land Securities, Cushman and Wakefield, Savills and Knight Frank pulled out amid concern about the possibility of contagion at large gatherings of people. ABInBev reported that it had already suffered a $170m dent in profits during the first two months of 2020, echoing a damage report issued by fellow drinks maker Diageo this week. Diageo, which makes Johnny Walker and Guinness, said it faced a profits hit of up to \u00a3200m in its Asian markets. L\u2019Or\u00e9al has banned travel for its 86,000 staff until at least the end of March. The tour operator TUI, British Airways owner IAG and easyJet were among the worst-performing UK shares due to concern about cross-border travel and tourism. The Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered, which is listed in London, said it would miss its financial targets this year but it was too early to predict the total cost of the coronavirus outbreak. Many major banks could come under severe pressure if companies struggle to repay loans at a time when debt levels have surged beyond the previous peak seen before the financial crisis, hitting a record level of $188tn. The International Monetary Fund has repeatedly sounded the alarm over surging global debt levels and the fragility of the financial system, particularly in China, where it warned that as much as 40% of corporate debt would be impossible to refinance in the event of a downturn just half as bad as the 2008 crash. Recent central bank stress tests in China indicated that as many as 17 out of 30 big banks in the country would fail if economic growth slowed to 4.15%. Growth in the world\u2019s second biggest economy dropped to 6.1% last year, the weakest pace since 1990, as the US-China trade war hit demand for goods and services. Capital Economics said growth in China could fall to 3% this year under the best-case scenario for the country. Should the impact for the world economy remain limited, it said global growth would slow to 2.5% this year, down from its previous estimate of 2.9%.",

      "bodyText": "The UCI has said the UAE Tour was cancelled as a precaution due to \u201csuspected\u201d cases of coronavirus as it emerged at least one of the two staff members involved may have tested negative for the disease. Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome and sprinter Mark Cavendish are among a star-studded field of riders in lockdown in Abu Dhabi, with all riders and staff at the race being tested. Statements on Thursday night from the Abu Dhabi Sports Council and organisers RCS Sport said the race had been cancelled due to two positives tests, but on Friday cycling\u2019s world governing body indicated the decision was made before the results were known. It is now understood at least one of those tests came back negative, but authorities in the United Arab Emirates took the decision to act early to prevent a possible outbreak. Journalists and riders tweeted throughout the day about the lockdown and lengthy waiting process for testing to take place. \u201cThe Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) confirms that the two final stages of the UAE Tour (23-29 February), which were to be raced Friday and Saturday, were cancelled late yesterday evening after two cases of coronavirus were suspected among two staff members of one of the participating teams,\u201d the UCI\u2019s statement said. \u201cWhile waiting for the results of tests and their communication, the United Arab Emirates authorities, the event\u2019s Organising Committee and the UCI, by mutual agreement, took the decision to interrupt this event, the third race on the 2020 UCI WorldTour calendar, in the interests of the health of riders and their staff, and to avoid the virus spreading.\u201d Questions were then raised over the UCI Track World Cycling Championships, taking place this week in Berlin, as Danish cyclist Michael Morkov had arrived in the German capital on Thursday, planning to compete in Sunday\u2019s Madison after contesting the first four stages of the UAE Tour. Morkov was seen at the velodrome on Thursday but is now being kept in solitary confinement at his team\u2019s hotel, where he is due to be tested for coronavirus. It is understood the 34-year-old feels fine and has shown no symptoms, with his only complaint being that he is unable to visit the velodrome. A spokesperson for the Danish team said the team still expected Morkov - who is training on a stationary bike in his room - to be able to race this weekend. One other rider, Spaniard Alberto Torres, had been due to travel from the UAE Tour to compete in Berlin, but did not leave before the lockdown was imposed. The 29-year-old\u2019s Movistar team said Torres would only travel if given the all-clear by authorities. British Cycling has remained in constant contact with the UCI\u2019s medical team regarding the situation but is continuing operations as normal. The World Championships are the last major competition before the Tokyo Olympics. The lockdown remains in place in Abu Dhabi, where Team Ineos\u2019 Froome and Bahrain-McLaren\u2019s Cavendish were among six Brits taking part in the WorldTour race. Mitchelton-Scott\u2019s Adam Yates has now been declared the overall winner, having been in the leader\u2019s red jersey after the fifth stage. Six-time British time trial champion Alex Dowsett (Israel Start-Up Nation), James Knox (Deceuninck-QuickStep) and Trek-Segafredo\u2019s Charlie Quarterman were also racing, as well as Irishmen Eddie Dunbar (Team Ineos) and Sam Bennett (Deceuninck-QuickStep). A tweet from Dowsett\u2019s Israel-Start Up Nation team on Friday morning said the results from the tests were expected within 24 hours. \u201cThe virus tests results of all teams will arrive in 24 Hours,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cImplication: leave? Stay for two weeks locked in? No chance for future decision before tomorrow\u201d. Riders and journalists in lockdown tweeted extensively as they waited to be tested, with Dowsett poking fun at the situation over the hotel exercise bike. Froome had been using the race to make his long-awaited comeback from the career-threatening injuries he suffered in a high-speed crash during a recon ride at the Criterium du Dauphine last June. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the \u00a3UAETour has been cancelled but public health must come first,\u201d Froome wrote on Twitter on Thursday night. \u201cWe are all awaiting testing and will remain at the hotel until further notice. I hope those affected make a speedy recovery and there aren\u2019t any further cases \u00a3coronavirus\u201d",

Several reports broke in the last 24 hours suggesting that the possible cases of the disease has spiked, and has become spread wide across the country.

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap Financial markets have suffered fresh, heavy losses, as the coronavirus crisis escalates - threatening to cause major economic disruption. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 slumped by 3.5%, taking it down more than 10% from its recent peak. The index has lost 8%, or \u00a3152bn, this week alone. There were similar heavy losses across Europe, where stocks were hit by fresh cases of Covid-19 - including in Italy - and a warning from France\u2019s president that an epidemic could be close. Investors ditched stocks and oil, in favour of safe-haven asset such as American government debt -- driving US borrowing costs to record lows. Wall Street had another turbulent day too, with the Dow suffering its worst points fall ever - down 1,20 points. Further losses are expected on Friday. Traders are very concerned about the impact of more cases in the US, with California revealing it is tracking 8,400 people. Goldman Sachs\u2019s warned that US corporate profit growth could be wiped out is also casting a shadow.... while Bank of America cutting its growth forecasts to an 11-year low. There are also fears that the virus could even push the eurozone into recession. Several companies, from Standard Chartered bank to foam shoe-maker Crocs, warned that they\u2019d miss financial targets due to the impact of Covid-19. But some analysts are advising clients to buy shares at current levels, wagering that policymakers will act to protect growth. Goodnight. GW The sell-off is heading back round to Asia-Pacific markets, where shares are expected to fall heavily on Friday. Investors are very worried about large coronavirus outbreak occurring in the US, now that California is monitoring 8,400 people (it emerged earlier). Kyle Rodda of IG explains: Panic in global markets has escalated, still on fears that the coronavirus is rapidly evolving into a global pandemic. Market volatility is particularly high, with the VIX hitting as high as 33. That\u2019s sent stocks plunging even further, with many of the world\u2019s major benchmark indices entering what\u2019s considered in technical analysis a \u201cmarket correction\u201d. Naturally, the demolition of risk-appetite has seen traders flee to safe-havens, many of which have traded at historically significant levels. The catalyst for the latest deterioration in market sentiment has been the burgeoning belief that the coronavirus has arrived on US shores. Several reports broke in the last 24 hours suggesting that the possible cases of the disease has spiked, and has become spread wide across the country. A press conference held by US President Trump failed to quell concerns. Instead, traders have latched onto this morning reports that the state of California is monitoring 8,400 for the virus. With stocks plunging, and government bond yields (interest rates) at record lows, the markets are sending a very worrying signal. \u201cStocks and bonds say we\u2019re doomed,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG Union Bank (via Bloomberg). \u201cAnyone who has a better idea for what lies ahead please let us know because right now the direction ahead for the economy is straight down.\u201d US tech stocks have had their worst day in eight years, Bloomberg reports: The Nasdaq Composite Index sank 4.6% to 8,566.48, the lowest in almost 12 weeks on the largest tumble in more than eight years. This is Wall Street\u2019s worst day in two years, reports CNBC: Thursday marked the Dow\u2019s biggest one-day points decline in history. The S&amp;P 500 also closed below 3,000 for the first time since last October. Those losses put the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq in correction territory, down more than 10% from their record closes. It took the Dow just 10 sessions to tumble from its all-time high into a correction. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq set record highs last week Both the Dow and the S&amp;P 500 had their worst day since February 2018 while the Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day loss since August 2011. Newsflash: the Dow has posted its biggest points drop ever, shedding another 1,200 points in a late burst of selling before the closing bell. More than 4% has been lost today, following big losses earlier this week. This puts the US stock market firmly into a correction (down over 10% from last week\u2019s record high). It also means this is the worst week for the US market since the 2008 financial crisis. Heavy losses on Wall Street: The sell-off is accelerating in late Wall Street trading. This is pushing the Dow down by another 3.5% today, or over 900 points.... Scott Minerd of financial services firm Guggenheim Partners is very concerned about coronavirus, and its impact on the markets and the global economy. He told Bloomberg TV that \u201cthis is possibly the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my career\u201d, a time-span which includes the 1987 crash and the 2008 financal crisis. Pointing to the jump in cases in Italy and South Korea overnight, Minerd warns: \u201cThis has the potential to reel into something extremely serious... \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine a scenario where you can actually contain this thing, and so that\u2019s the thing that to me is very frightening.\u201d Minerd also warned that the US economy is already being hit: Hotels in New York are empty. Airlines.. people are not travelling. It\u2019s a demand shock [as well as a supply shock] As things stand, the Dow Jones has shed 2,600 points so far this week -- or roughly 9% of its value. Here\u2019s the scene on the New York stock exchange floor this afternoon, amid another volatile session: Back in the UK, Northern Ireland has just reported its first confirmed case of coronavirus, taking the total number of UK cases to 16. Our main news liveblog has all the details. Earlier today, French president, Emmanuel Macron warned that France was on the brink of a coronavirus epidemic. My colleague Peter Beaumont explains: With new evidence of unexplained cases of transmission emerging in Spain, Germany and France, the mounting public health crisis on the continent forced the cancellation of public events from Geneva to Greece, including sporting events, carnivals and trade conventions amid further sharp stock market falls and disruption to European travel. \u201cWe are facing a crisis, an epidemic that is coming. We know that certain countries are already much more affected than us,\u201d Macron said while visiting staff at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re hospital in Paris, where the first French victim of the virus, a 60-year old teacher, died on Tuesday night. \u201cWe know that we\u2019re only at the beginning. We\u2019re going to try to make the right decisions,\u201d Macron added. Ut oh. Wall Street is on the slide again. The Dow Jones industrial average is down another 2% today, 570 points lighter at 26,387. The sell-off picked up, following a report that more than 8,000 people in California are being monitored for coronavirus symptoms. With the death toll in Italy now rising to 17, there is much concern about how the crisis will pan out. Back on Wall Street, stocks are attempting a bounce-back. The Dow Jones industrial average is now just 213 points down, or 0.8%, at 26,744. The move comes as Mike Pence recruits treasury secretary Stephen Mnuchin and economic advisor Larry Kudlow to his new coronavirus task force. Neither are noted experts in virology or immunisation, but they\u2019re both likely to push for interest rate cuts to protect the economy. Nearly every stock on the FTSE 100 fell today: The stock market slump is now an opportunity to buy shares. So argues JP Morgan\u2019s chief US equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, who thinks central bankers and politicians will take steps to support growth, boosting markets. Lakos-Bujas told clients: While it is easy to turn cautious on the market after a ~10% drop, we argue investors should not discount the benefit of announced and unannounced global policy responses that are likely to outlast the impact of COVID-19. It\u2019s a sensible theory. But... investors would still be taking a gamble. We still don\u2019t know how far the coronavirus will spread, how many people will be infected or die, what quarantine measures will be taken, or how long it will take China\u2019s factories to return to work. Streaming service Netflix is defying the selloff, and has jumped by 2.3% today. Indeed, it\u2019s up a fifth this year -- as investors conclude that it could profit from the coronavirus. If people are afraid to go to the cinema, or not allowed into work or school, they\u2019ll end up watching TV instead. The coronavirus poses a clear threat to Europe\u2019s fragile recovery, fears Ritu Vohora, equities Investment Director at M&amp;G Investments. She writes: \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has replaced trade wars as the dark storm bearing on markets, sending jitters across global financial markets amid fears of a hit to the global economy. The surge of new coronavirus cases outside China has shaken investor hopes that the outbreak had been contained, Vohora explains: This is no longer just an Asia issue (even though the number of reported cases in mainland China has declined), the virus has spread to Italy, South Korea and Iran and there are fears this could develop into a global pandemic. Markets are starting to consider what this means for global trade and travel, while bond markets are worried about recessionary risks. With the coronavirus now in Europe, the region is particularly exposed to trade and the virus poses a threat to its fragile recovery. Indeed, we saw the first signs of the economic fallout last week, with various Asian PMI surveys showing sharp losses.\u201d Today markets are pretty grim -- as the worst week since 2011 grinds on. European stock markets also had a grim day, with the Stoxx 600 closing 3.6% down at 389.89 points. That, I reckon, puts it JUST into a correction -- down just over 10% from its peak last month. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has closed at a new one-year low, deep in correction territory. After another torrid session, the blue-chip index has ended the day down 246 points, or 3.5%, at 6796 points. That\u2019s the lowest point since January 2019. It means the FTSE 100 has shed 8% of its value this week alone, and is more than 10% below its recent peak in January. The slump wipes around \u00a361bn off the blue-chip index, virtually equalling the losses suffered on Monday. It means the Footsie has lost more than \u00a3150bn of value this week -- as anxiety over the impact of a full-blown Covid-19 pandemic hits stocks worldwide. In a break from the gloom, Starbucks chief executive has said the situation in China is improving, with 85% of its coffee stores now open. ECB chief Christine Lagarde has downplayed the prospect of the central bank intervening over the coronavirus - telling the FT that \u201cwe are certainly not at that point yet.\u201d Global banks, and their supervisors, are being urged to show vigilance about the coronavirus crisis - and share details of any economic shocks it causes. The Basel Committee, which sets standards for the financial sector, issued this warning after discussing the coronavirus crisis today: The Committee discussed the financial stability implications of the coronavirus outbreak (Covid-19) for the banking system and exchanged information on the business continuity measures that banks and authorities have put in place. The Committee encourages banks and supervisors to remain vigilant in light of the evolving situation and notes the importance of effective cross-border information sharing and cooperation when dealing with such shocks. The New York Stock exchange says it is prepared for any disruption caused by the coronavirus, should it reach America\u2019s financial heartland. NYSE says: \u201cThe NYSE is carefully monitoring the spread of COVID-19 and has robust contingency plans, tested regularly, to enable continuous operation of the NYSE exchanges should any facilities be impacted.\u201d Newsflash: The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 900 points! That wipes another 3% of the benchmark index, sending it deeper into correction territory. It is threatening to push the Dow below 26,000 points, for the first time since last summer. The Dow already lost over 1000 points on Monday, almost 900 points on Tuesday, and 124 points on Wednesday. Stocks are continuing to tumble, alarmingly, in London, as traders watch Wall Street tumble again. The FTSE 100 index is now down 4.3% -- a very serious decline -- losing 308 points to 6735. That pushes it deeper into correction territory. This is an even deeper plunge than we saw on Monday, and wipes out another \u00a375bn or so of value. It takes the total losses this week to over \u00a3160bn! Consultancy Capital Economics has warned that a full-blown global Covid-19 pandemic could be as bad as during the financial crisis, when global GDP fell by 0.5%. My colleague Richard Partington explains: Jennifer McKeown, head of the global economics service at the consultancy, said that there was still hope the outbreak could be contained with limited negative impact for businesses and countries. However, she warned: \u201cOne thing becoming clear is we just can\u2019t predict the spread of this and how bad it can be. But it\u2019s not difficult to get to something similar to the 2008 crisis with a pandemic situation. Of course, we hope it won\u2019t get that bad.\u201d There are several reasons why Wall Street is an almighty funk again today. Partly, there is disappointment that Donald Trump didn\u2019t provide more reassurance when he discussed the Covid-19 crisis last night. The president put VP Mike Pence in charge of the response, and said he would spend \u201cwhatever\u2019s appropriate\u201d. But this was undermined by news of a new case in California. Jeffrey Halley, senior Asia Pacific market analyst at Oanda, wrote in a note. \u201cPresident Trump finally addressed the arrival of coronavirus on U.S. shores, and the government\u2019s response to controlling its potential spread\u2026Neither inspired an already shaky North American market,\u201d There has been a fresh flurry of cases outside China today, with 26 more deaths in Iran and two in Italy. The economic cost of the crisis is also mounting, with Microsoft, Standard Chartered and Paypal all warning they will miss financial targets. Goldman Sachs\u2019s warning that US corporate profit growth could be wiped out is also casting a shadow.... as is Bank of America cutting its growth forecasts to an 11-year low. In another blow to investors, Europe stock markets have also just plunged into correction territory, matching Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 and the three major Wall Street indices today. There are heavy losses of at least 3% in Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid and Paris today. That has dragged the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index down 10% from its recent peak. Travel stocks are under real pressure on Wall Street, with American Airlines tumbling by 9% and Delta Air down 5.5%. Royal Caribbean has shed 10%, as investors conclude that the cruise industry is going to be very badly hit by the coronavirus. Twenty six of the thirty blue-chip companies on the Dow Jones industrial average are sliding today. Chemicals maker Dow Inc is the top faller, down 3.8%, followed by Disney, then oil producers Chevron and Exxon (hit by the weak oil price). The scale and speed of this sell-off is quite stunning, as this screengrab from Bloomberg shows: Covid-19 has punctured the optimism that pushed the US stock market to a series of record highs, says Michael Hewson of CMC Markets: He writes: The sharp declines in equity markets in the last week have turned investor sentiment on its head in a fashion that is almost schizophrenic in nature. From the unshakeable optimism seen at the beginning of the year, investors have done a complete U-turn switching from excessive optimism to outright pessimism in less than a week. Recent warnings from Microsoft and Apple are likely to just be the start and given that tech has led this rally over the last few years it could well be tech that causes further declines. What a week! And it\u2019s only Thursday morning in New York: Goldman Sachs\u2019s warning that US profit growth could be wiped out by the coronavirus is not helping the mood on Wall Street today. This is Wall Street\u2019s first correction since autumn 2018, when fears of a global slowdown rocked markets. Bloomberg is reporting that the S&amp;P 500 is on track for its worst week since 2008. NEWSFLASH: The Dow Jones industrial average has plunged into correction territory at the start of trading on Wall Street. The benchmark index has tumbled by 520 points, or 1.9%, to 26,437, as a fresh wave of alarm over the coronavirus sweeps the New York stock exchange. That\u2019s more than 10% off its record high set just two weeks ago, of 29,551 points. This is the sixth day of losses in a row, and there are some ugly moves out there -- the S&amp;P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq are also in correction territory! US government bond prices are hitting fresh record highs today, as investors try to find a safe place for their money. This has driven the yield on 10-year Treasury bills down to just 1.27% today, an all-time low. Yields move inversely to prices. Such record levels shows that the markets are worried about US growth prospects. Hold onto your hats, because Wall Street is about to open.... Footwear-maker Crocs has also been hit. The company, famous for its foam clog shoes, has warned that economic disruption in Asia will wipe $20m to $30m off its revenues. It says many of its vendors in China remain closed, while others are only opening for limited times (and are seeing low customer numbers anyway). Newsflash: Paypal has just warned that the coronavirus will knock its revenues. The online payments company says revenues for the current quarter will only reach the low end of its previously issued forecast, of $4.78bn to $4.84bn. And that\u2019s due to Covid-19, it says: We currently estimate the negative impact from COVID-19 to be an approximate one percentage point reduction, on both a spot and foreign currency-neutral basis, to PayPal\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth for the first quarter, as compared to the revenue guidance provided on January 29, 2020. \u201cStronger performance quarter-to-date across our diversified business is partially offsetting this one percentage point negative impact.\u201d You might think that online payments firms would benefit from the quarantine measures - as more people are having to shop over the web. But clearly the overall economic impact is negative (as Mastercard also warned this week). The oil price is hitting new one-year lows too. US crude has shed $2 per barrel to $46.72, a 4% tumble today. Budget airline easyJet is being hurt very badly by the selloff. Shares in easyJet are down 10% this morning, at \u00a310.74. That\u2019s down from \u00a315 at the end of last week. Clearly, air travel is going to be hit by the quarantine measures already being implemented in countries such as Italy -- usually a popular destination for easyJet, which flies to Rome and Venice. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 has just tumbled to a new 13-month low. The ongoing sell-off has pushed the index down by another 2.8%, or 202 points, to just 6839. That wipes out another \u00a350bn of value off the biggest companies listed in London. Travel firms, airlines, retailers and banks are all being hit hard, on fears of a global coronavirus pandemic that would hurt the world economy, weaken supply chains, and damage global trade. WPP is still the biggest faller, now down 16% after reporting disappointing results. The ad giant has also introduced its own self-quarantine policy, with anyone returning from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran or \u201cspecific lockdown areas\u201d in northern Italy told they must work remotely for 14 days from the date of return. More here: The coronavirus is also having a serious impact on Venice\u2019s tourist business. The Venice local hoteliers association has reported that occupancy rates fell by 40% after authorities cancelled the final two days of this year\u2019s Carnival. That was a fresh blow - as hotels were already reeling from flooding earlier this year. Associated Press have more details: We understand the fear that is spreading but at the same time we are aware that our health care system is holding and we believe that the image of efficiency of our area will win out,\u2019\u2019 said Daniele Minotto, the hotel association\u2019s deputy director. Venice city councillor for economic development Simone Venturini said that the economic impact of the new virus outbreak should worry national authorities as much as the impact on public health. Do this week\u2019s losses mean it\u2019s time to buy the dip? Not according to BNY Mellon\u2019s chief strategist Alicia Levine. She warns investors that they should resist piling into the stock market until they know more about coronavirus, even though stocks are around 7% cheaper than a week ago. Levine told Marketwatch: \u201cIf you think it is essentially a short-term problem, a hit to growth, but then it is over by the summer, then you\u2019re fine going into the market. But if you think it is worse than that, then you have to play that out.\u201d Oof! Goldman Sachs has just warned that the coronavirus could wipe out all US earnings growth this year, if it \u201cbecomes widespread\u201d. The Wall Street investment bank has also lowered its baseline forecast for earnings growth, due to the \u201csevere decline in Chinese economic activity\u201d this quarter. Ouch! Bank of America has slashed its forecasts for the global economy, predicting the worst year since 2009, following the financial crisis. Its economics team predict the world economy will only grow by 2.8% this year, down from 3.1% (which was already below the IMF\u2019s 3.3%). BAML fears the eurozone will only grow by 0.6%, down from 1%, while China\u2019s GDP would only grow by 5.2% -- the weakest since 1990. It warns there is a lack of momentum in the global economy, due to China\u2019s aggressive response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of the virus on other economies. Standard Chartered\u2019s CEO, Bill Winters, says his company is struggling to assess the impact of coronavirus. Speaking after the bank admitted it would miss income growth targets, Winters explained that the outbreak was a blow to its chances: \u201cWe have had a good start to 2020, but we recognise there are some substantial headwinds that are mounting. And most obvious is the coronavirus, which is playing itself out in ways that none of us as yet fully understand [in terms of] how exactly this will progress.\u201d Wall Street is set to fall when trading begins in under three hours time, as New York traders catch up with the latest coronavirus news. The Dow is set to shed another 250 points, or almost 1%. That would confirm that Donald Trump\u2019s statement on the virus last night, putting vice-president Mike Pence in charge of America\u2019s response, hasn\u2019t reassured investors. Ed Moya of trading firm OANDA says the discovery of a US coronavirus case of \u2018unknown\u2019 origin in California will hit shares. US equities are poised to open lower after the CDC announced the first possible community spread of the virus in the US. The CDC cannot account for how a California resident contracted the virus. President Trump\u2019s press conference failed to calm markets as his overall optimistic tone was often balanced with warnings from the health experts. The S&amp;P 500 is having the worst week since the financial crisis and it is unlikely to get any better as the corporate response is delivering a wrath of profit warnings. This is turning into the worst week for the London stock market since the heights of the eurozone debt crisis. As things stand, the FTSE 100 has lost 505 points since the opening bell on Monday morning -- or 6.8% -- dragging it to a 13-month low. That\u2019s the biggest slump since the first week of August in 2011, when the index tumbled by 9.7%. That was the week when confidence in Greece\u2019s second bailout evaporated and Italy and Spain were dragged into the crisis. European markets have suffered even bigger losses this week, with the Stoxx 600 down 7.8% already. That\u2019s also the worst weekly performance since August 2011. Here\u2019s the state of play: FTSE 100: down 145 points at 6898, -2% today. Stoxx 600: down 9.9 points at 394.7, -2.45% today German DAX: down 296 points at 12,478, -2.3% French CAC: down 130 points at 5,553, -2.3% Italian FTSE MIB: down 414 points at 23,009, -1.7% Sir Jon Cunliffe, deputy governor of the Bank of England, has warned that central banks may not be able to help much. Speaking in London, Cunliffe warned that monetary policy can\u2019t do much about a \u201cpure supply shock\u201d - ie, if coronavirus prevented goods from getting into the UK. The pound has lost almost half a cent this morning, after the UK government threatened to walk away from trade negotiations with the EU. Sterling dropped to $1.2867, close to a three-month low, as Boris Johnson published the UK\u2019s negotiating mandate as he pushes for a Canada-style trade deal. A senior policymaker at the European Central Bank has revealed the ECB is \u201cvery worried\u201d about the coronavirus, and its impact on the eurozone economy. Isabel Schnabel, who joined the ECB\u2019s executive board in January, told an audience in London that the crisis threatens the global economy - and the euro area too. She said (via Reuters): \u201cAll of us are very worried about what is currently happening with respect to the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cWe know that this is really raising uncertainty to a large degree, for the global growth outlook but of course also for the outlook for the euro area.\u201d \u201cBut what we really need to understand when we are doing monetary policy is what are the potential medium-term implications, and at the moment this is unclear.\u201d Eurozone growth slowed to just 0.1% in the last quarter, with Germany stagnating and France and Italy both shrinking. ECB interest rates are already at record lows, but some investors are anticipating a cut by the end of the year. A rate cut might stimulate the economy....but it won\u2019t do anything to prevent Covid-19 spreading. Fears of a global slowdown have driven US crude oil prices down to a 13-month low. US crude has dropped by almost a dollar per barrel to $47.83, the weakest since January 2019. Chart of the morning: Closing all Macau\u2019s casinos, to curb the coronavirus\u2019s spread, has had a severe, if predictable, impact on revenues: After a very rocky start, the FTSE 100 appears to have stabilised. It\u2019s currently down 121 points, or 1.7%, at 6921. That would be a new 13-month closing low, leaving the index on the brink of an official correction. Most of the index is in the red, with travel firms, banks and consumer stocks falling badly (along with WPP). Just 12 shares are up, mainly defensive stocks such as British American Tobacco - which also posted strong results today - and National Grid. Artur Baluszynski, head of research at Henderson Rowe, says investors are pricing in a \u2018worst case scenario\u2019 for Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global economy. If one looks at the history of mini-pandemics, the longstanding advice from Warren Buffet is \u201cbuy when others are fearful\u201d which was seen by many as an almost guaranteed returns booster. However, what we know now is that the COVID-19 virus is highly contagious but not highly lethal. This is good news for patients but bad news for the global economy, as it means that the virus can survive longer and spread easier. Disruptions to the labour force combined with a major slowdown, and in some cases full scale halt to the global supply chain channels, could pose a serious threat to the Chinese economy and global stock markets. European economies such as Italy and Germany, already weakened by the ongoing US-China trade war, are unlikely to escape unscathed. The news of factory shutdowns coming out of Italy is pretty worrying. UK consumers could soon see shortages due to Covid-19, warns Dr Jonathan Owens, logistics expert from the University of Salford Business School: We are seeing no big breaks in the supply chains yet, but what is arriving at our ports now may have been ordered five to six weeks ago. So, if we do see shortages this will be in the coming weeks. Looking to alternative sourcing is not the immediate answer, as this is more a medium to long term solution. In addition, it is not clear how long it would take to get an alternative source in place and operating efficiently within the existing supply chain. Also, there\u2019s no guarantee that a new supplier would avoid being stricken by the coronavirus either, he adds. The coronavirus will force the IMF to tear up its growth forecasts at its Spring Meeting in April, predicts Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital: There is no respite for financial markets as the coronavirus spreads outside China. The reality is that the IMF is going to have to rewrite its projections when they are next due in April. While the Fund is not known for ever predicting a recession, and its projections tend to be near consensus thinking, it cannot be ruled out that global GDP growth returns to 2.0% \u2013 especially given the EM and Asian economies are at the forefront of supply chain disruptions and export declines. The IMF had predicted global growth of 3.3% this year, up from 2.9% in 2019 (corrected).. That now looks highly unlikely, given the disruption in China. Shares in WPP, the world\u2019s biggest advertising company, have plunged by 16% -- on track for its worst day since 1992! And for once, we can\u2019t blame Covid-19. Instead, the company has disappointed investors by reporting a 1.9% drop in revenues in the last quarter - and warned that sales will be stagnant this year. That\u2019s without factoring in the impact of the coronavirus. Chief executive Mark Read said. \u201cI am optimistic about the future of our industry and WPP\u2019s position within it, although there is still much more work to do,\u201d Investors seem less optimistic. The coronavirus has forced a major watch fair to be cancelled. The Watches &amp; Wonders watch fair will not take place in Geneva this year, due to concerns that it could spread the virus. Organisers of the show, which was popular with Chinese retailers, say: \u201cIn view of the latest developments concerning the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, it is [our duty]... to anticipate the potential risks that travel and important international gatherings could entail.\u201d Many other trade fairs have already been cancelled or postponed, which will presumably have a knock-on impact on orders this year. Troubled luxury carmaker Aston Martin has warned that the coronavirus could hurt its sales, and bog down its supply chain. Aston Marton hit investors with more bad news today -- a loss of \u00a3130m for last year, and a forecast of \u201cmaterially lower\u201d sales in 2020. It cautioned: Covid-19 has the potential to impact both the supply chain and customer demand in China and other markets. China was the company\u2019s fastest-growing market in 2019 and represented 9% of total wholesales. Analysts are worried that Aston Martin\u2019s new SUV, called the DBX, could suffer from the Covid-19 outbreak. That would be a serious blow for the company, which is already being bailed out by fashion mogul Lawrence Stroll. Shares in the company have slumped 15% to a record low of 334p this morning. Investors who paid \u00a319 per share in its flotation, in October 2018, must be absolutely furious. Covid-19 fears have driven European stock markets down to a fresh four-month low this morning. Paul Donovan of UBS says investors fear a slump in consumer spending: The importance of the consumer (globally) is why fear of the virus has the potential to do so much economic damage. If fear is contained at current levels, the consumer will support growth. If fear takes hold in the real world, the economic damage will be significant. US President Trump gave a press conference to reassure Americans last night. US Google searches for \u201ccoronavirus\u201d surged immediately afterwards. Market analyst Connor Campbell of SpreadEx blames president Trump for today\u2019s rout: With the coronavirus death toll approaching 3000, South Korea suffering another swell of cases, financial warnings from the likes of Microsoft, and the launch of an emergency response plan in Australia, it was hard to find even a modicum of comfort on Thursday morning. The fact Mike Pence \u2013 whose policies helped lead to Indiana\u2019s worst outbreak of HIV, not at the height of the crisis, but in 2014/15 \u2013 has been put in charge of the US response to the coronavirus was arguably the tipping point for investors. It\u2019s an unserious choice by a President who, on Wednesday night, seemed too blas\u00e9 about the issue for the market\u2019s liking \u2013 especially since former Fed chair Janet Yellen speculated that a surge of cases in America could force the country into a recession. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also expressed deep concerns last night: Standard Chartered, the bank focused on Asia-Pacific markets, has cut its income growth target due to coronavirus. It warned shareholders it probably won\u2019t hit its previous target of 5-7% income growth, because of the impact of Covid-19 (plus the wider economic slowdown, and the protests in Hong Kong). Shares in Standard Chartered have slid by 5% in early trading, helping to push the FTSE 100 down. The European markets are a sickly sea of red this morning. This fresh wave of selling has wiped another 2% off the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index. The consumer sector is leading the rout, followed by energy stocks, tech firms, financial companies, industrial stocks and miners (so most of the index, basically!). Nearly every company on the FTSE 100 is down today, with travel companies among the top fallers. In London, budget airline easyJet has slumped by 8% this morning to its lowest level since October. Holiday firm TUI has shed 4.3%. Cruise firm Carnival are down 3%, at their lowest level since 2014! They\u2019ve lost a sixth of their value since the coronavirus outbreak began. I reckon the FTSE 100 has plunged into a full-blown correction. Today\u2019s slump means the index is more than 10% below its recent peak, of 7674 points set on January 17th. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has fallen more than 2% at the start of trading. The blue-chip index has shed another 153 points to 6,887. That means it has plunged by 7% this week, as coronavirus fears have swept the City. Roughly \u00a338bn has been wiped off the index this morning, on top of the \u00a397bn lost on Monday and Tuesday. Other European markets are taking a tumble too, with Germany\u2019s DAX tumbling by another 1.8% and France\u2019s CAC down 1.9%. New Zealand is also bracing for an economic hit from Covid-19, having already seen exports to China cancelled: Consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser says this morning that demand for its Dettol antibacterial soaps, sprays and wipes and its Lysol cleaning and disinfecting products has risen due to the coronavirus outbreak. At the same time, it has suffered some disruption to its supply chain in China. The company told shareholders this morning: \u201cIt is too early to fully assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the operational and financial performance of the Group. We are committed to China, to the health of our consumers in China and to the health and safety of our employees in China. \u201cWe are seeing some increased demand for Dettol and Lysol products and are working to support the relevant healthcare authorities and agencies, including through donations, information and education. We do see increased activity online for our consumers in China. Conversely we are seeing some disruption to offline retailers, distribution channels and the supply chain connected to China.\u201d Investors are \u201cvigilant and broadly fearful\u201d of the growing coronavirus outbreak, despite Donald Trump\u2019s statement on the crisis last night, says Kyle Rodda of IG: The day turned pear-shaped after US President Donald Trump\u2019s press conference addressing the White House\u2019s response. Trump didn\u2019t say anything too controversial, and spent most of his breath reassuring his constituents that the crisis, within American borders, is under control, despite the significant rise in cases reported in the US yesterday. Despite this, and for whatever reason, traders reacted to the press-conference poorly, clearly assuming that the situation in the US will likely deteriorate from here. Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group agrees that the president \u201cfailed to alleviate market concerns\u201d during yesterday\u2019s press conference on the coronavirus. The main takeaway was that the virus will \u201cprobably spread in the US\u201d.... We think the next \u2018breaking point\u2019 will be when there is a big cluster of cases in the United States. Former Fed-Chair Yellen acknowledged yesterday that \u201cit\u2019s conceivable that coronavirus pushes US into a recession\u201d. This is turning into a grim week for the markets, even before Europe opens today..... Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Another day, another sell-off! World stock markets are sliding again today, as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world. Fears of a global pandemic, and a sharp slowdown in economic growth, are raging through the markets -- as investors fear that governments will fail to contain Covid-19. European stock markets are expected to tumble sharply today, as the wave of selling accelerates. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is being called down another 1.5%, which would send it to a fresh 13-month low. That would also drive the Footsie into correction territory (more than 10% off its recent peak). European markets are tipped to tumble by another 2%, with the futures market a sea of red again. Asia-Pacific stocks have already slumped today, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei shedding another 2% and South Korea down 1%. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index has lost another 0.75%, as Canberra launches its coronavirus emergency plan. Overnight, South Korea has reported a further 334 new cases of Covid-19, and China reported 433 new confirmed cases, and 29 deaths. The total death toll is nearly 3,000 people, with more than 82,000 infected. Last night, Microsoft joined the ranks of firms warning that they\u2019ll miss their financial targets - its personal computing supply chain has been disrupted. Investors have not been reassured by Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to get a grip on the situation. The US president put his deputy, Mike Pence, in charge of coronavirus response, and insisted America \u201cvery, very ready for this\u201d. In a rare trip to the White House briefing room, Trump declared: The risk to the American people remains very low. We are ready to adapt and we are ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads. There\u2019s no reason to panic . . . this will end.\u201d Investors, though, are in a panicky mood. They\u2019ve realised that company profits could be badly hit if firms can\u2019t source products from China, or sell to their usual outlets. Wall Street failed to rally last night, with the Dow closing lower -- and it could suffer further falls today too. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says traders are also concerned that there are now more cases outside China than inside: News spurred worries that the coronavirus is becoming a global threat and that containment measures elsewhere could further slowdown the global growth. Some European companies paused their business trips for the coming weeks and earnings forecasts are being pulled lower.... The slide we are seeing right now is not the correction of the recent stock rally, but the market\u2019s understanding that the coronavirus outbreak would translate into significantly lower earnings and an anaemic global growth. If we add the fact that the crisis has only started outside China into the mix, there is a meaningful shift in stock valuations. We\u2019ll be tracking all the market action through the day....

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for our Europa League clockwatch. Thanks for your company on a busy and dramatic night. I\u2019ll leave you with a report of Arsenal\u2019s shocking defeat at the Emirates. The draw for the last 16 will take place tomorrow. This is the line-up: Olympiacos Manchester United Wolves Basaksehir Rangers Getafe Leverkusen Copenhagen Basel Sevilla LASK Internazionale Eintracht Frankfurt or Red Bull Salzburg Shakhtar Donetsk Wolfsburg Roma The Olympiacos players are running wild, and quite right too. It\u2019s a desperate night for Arsenal, who looked to be comfortable after their 1-0 win in Greece last week. Football, eh. Arsenal are out of the Europa League! Aubameyang missed an absolute sitter with the last kick of the tie, somehow clipping a loose ball wide from eight yards. That\u2019s extraordinary. 120 min There will be two minutes of added time. Amazing stuff. The goal came from a needlessly conceded corner, for which the Olympiacos keeper Jose Sa came forward. It was half cleared and tossed back into the area, where El Arabi got the wrong side of Sokratis to poke the ball past Leno. It was a superb ball in from the right by Masouras and a good finish, though Sokratis was more than a little dopey in his defending and David Luiz had his hand up for a non-existent offside. Olympiacos have done it!!! \u201cI\u2019m sure Arsenal fans won\u2019t need reminding,\u201d says Simon McMahon, \u201cthat they last won a European trophy the year before The Bends was released.\u201d And when this little festival of yearning was No1. 115 min: Arsenal 1-1 Olympiacos (agg: 2-1) Now Olympiacos must score or they are out. If they do score, they will be ahead on away goals. But they look shattered. Pick that out! Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang puts Arsenal ahead on aggregate with a spectcular scissor-kick! Ozil\u2019s cross was headed up in the air, and Aubameyang got into a position for an elegant and emphatic scissor kick that flew past Jose Sa. Martinelli is on. I forgot to say that. Saka continues to deliver some beautiful crosses from the left, the latest of which leads to a bit of a scramble in the Olympiacos area. 108 min: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1): Masouras hits the top of the bar! It was a brilliant effort, curled towards the far corner from the edge of the box. Arsenal\u2019s last penalty shootout in this competition was that miserable night in Copenhagen 20 years ago. \u201cI am also in California,\u201d says Zach Neeley, \u201cbut this match is making me interested in something stronger than apple cider.\u201d Celtic 1-3 Copenhagen (agg: 2-4) It was a stinker of a night for Celtic. Ewan Murray was there. Half time in extra time: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Oh, Arsenal. \u201cHere in California, Martinelli is the name of a renowned brand of non-alcoholic sparkling apple cider,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cWhen your reader mentioned the name, I immediately felt the urge for a glass of bubbly, golden, crisp perfection. Neither shaken nor stirred.\u201d 104 min: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) A good chance for Olympiacos! The substitute Bruno Gaspar was through on goal, just inside the area, but splattered a half-volley high and wide. 103 min: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Mustafi limps off to be replaced by Sokratis. Manchester United 5-0 Club Brugge Here\u2019s more on a comfortable night for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s team. \u201cSevilla have been one of the most interesting stories of the season, for me,\u201d says Sebastian Wood. \u201cSold all of their big-name players over the summer, made 15 signings including the disgraced former Real Madrid and Spain manager, and this year are better than ever.\u201d And their history in this competition is a definite advantage, even with a whole new squad. 99 min Arsenal appeal for handball in the area when Aubameyang\u2019s shot hits a defender. It did hit his arm, but his body position was natural and he didn\u2019t move towards the ball. \u201cSomeone asked for Martinelli,\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cShaken or stirred?\u201d 96 min: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Lots of Arsenal pressure at the start of extra time, though no real chances. Olympiacos would take penalties; they look shattered. \u201cAs the ties currently stand - and if we assume that Conte will be prioritizing title challenge higher than the EL - are Manchester United now the front-runners to win the competition?\u201d asks Doremus Schafer. There are some good teams left in it, including Sevilla, Roma, Shakhtar, Leverkusen (who looked great tonight), Wolves and possibly Arsenal. If Marcus Rashford was fit I\u2019d make United favourites; without him, I\u2019m not so sure. I\u2019d go for Inter, Leverkusen or Sevilla. \u201cMartinelli please,\u201d says Zach Neeley. \u201cThat is all.\u201d Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Extra time is under way at the Emirates. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this, not when Arsenal won the first leg away from home. Arsenal\u2019s match is the only one going to extra-time. The rest have finished, and these are the final scores. Ajax 2-1 Getafe (agg: 2-3) Benfica 3-3 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 4-5) Celtic 1-3 Copenhagen (agg: 2-4) Internazionale 2-1 Ludogorets (agg: 4-1) Man Utd 5-0 Club Brugge (agg: 6-1) Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1, Sevilla through on away goals) That\u2019s a really sore one for Celtic, who are eliminated in the last 32 for the third consecutive season. GOAL! Man Utd 5-0 Club Brugge (agg: 6-1, Fred 90+3) It\u2019s a very, very good night when Fred scores twice. Full time: Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) It\u2019s going to extra time. Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Mustafi makes a vital interception in the last minute of injury time! Without his sliding tackle, El Arabi would have had a simple chance from six yards. NO GOAL! Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) Cluj\u2019s goal has been VARed, so as things stand Sevilla are going through on away goals. It\u2019s all over for Celtic. Dame N\u2019Doye stumbles straight through the defence and finishes calmly past Forster. GOAL! Sevilla 0-1 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-2; Paun-Alexandru 87) The shock is on in Seville as well. A savage blow at Celtic Park! The overlapping Pep Biel coolly nutmegs Fraser Forster to put Copenhagen ahead - and now Celtic need two more. Latest scores Ajax 2-1 Getafe (agg: 2-3) Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Benfica 3-3 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 4-5) Celtic 1-1 Copenhagen (agg: 2-2) Internazionale 2-1 Ludogorets (agg: 4-1) Man Utd 4-0 Club Brugge (agg: 5-1) Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) Odsonne Edouard brings the house down with the laziest of Panenkas! GOAL! Man Utd 4-0 Club Brugge (agg: 5-1, Fred 82) PENALTY TO CELTIC! It was given by VAR, after a slightly weird handball by Ragnar Sigurdsson. Celtic 0-1 Copenhagen Celtic, whose need for a goal is even more urgent than Arsenal\u2019s, are also having their best spell of the half. Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos Arsenal are starting to put Olympiacos under extreme pressure. Nicolas Pepe has just forced a good save from Jose Sa, with Alexandre Lacazette heading wide moments later. He should have scored. Celtic 0-1 Copenhagen (agg: 1-2) Griffiths almost scores straight away, but the Copenhagen keeper Karl-Johan Johnsson makes a terrific block from close range. GOAL! Benfica 3-3 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 4-5, Patrick 71) Alan Patrick has given Shakhtar a two-goal cushion in Portugal. Celtic 0-1 Copenhagen (agg: 1-2) Leigh Griffiths has come on for Celtic, replacing Mohamed Elyounoussi. Celtic have 20 minutes to save the tie. Arsenal 0-1 Olympiakos Arsenal are living dangerously. A brilliant cross from the impressive left-back Tsimikas just evades El Arabi, who was a couple of yards away from having a simple tap-in. It\u2019s now Ajax 2-1 Getafe (agg: 2-3), with Getafe\u2019s Mathis Olivera scoring an own goal. Ajax need two more to go through. Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) It\u2019s still pretty even at the Emirates, with Arsenal struggling to create anything of note. \u201cAbout the coronavirus situation in Lyon, national authorities have not decided to close the France-Italy border nor cancel any public event, which included the match,\u201d says Alexandre Chesneau. \u201cInstead, they prioritized informing the public in the stadium about the situation, and also banned people coming from Italian cities suffering from the outbreak from coming to the match. So I guess the discrepancy is due to the French authorities\u2019 handling of the situation (that being said, local authorities weren\u2019t thrilled with the perspective of hundreds of Italians from a region near the outbreak coming to town, but they can\u2019t cancel a public event like this on their own).\u201d It\u2019s quite an interesting debate. When does the risk of transmission become sufficient to cancel a sporting event, or even a Marilyn Manson concert? Celtic 0-1 Copenhagen (agg: 1-2) There\u2019s a febrile atmosphere at Celtic Park, where Copenhagen are having an excellent spell. This was supposed to be a comfortable night for Celtic; it has turned into anything but. \u201cI don\u2019t care about other sports,\u201d says Ben Aitkenhead. \u201cThey are not the same and comparisons are flawed. Technology works for objective decisions that can be made instantly (eg goal-line technology). But it is awful in all sports where decisions are subjective. And the process of review inevitably delays emotional responses - by definition - which destroys atmosphere. Bin it.\u201d Amen. It\u2019ll never happen, though. Latest scores Ajax 1-1 Getafe (agg: 1-3) Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Benfica 3-2 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 4-4) Celtic 0-1 Copenhagen (agg: 1-2) Internazionale 2-1 Ludogorets (agg: 4-1) Man Utd 3-0 Club Brugge (agg: 4-1) Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) Arsenal 0-1 Olympiacos (agg: 1-1) Leno makes an excellent save from Tsimikas, who went on a glory run and lifted a dangerous shot from the edge of the area. If Arsenal concede again they will be in serious schtuck. Uh-oh. A desperate mistake from Jozo Simunovic allows the substitute Michael Santos to give Copenhagen the lead at Celtic Park. \u201cThe reason for empty stadiums in Milan, while allowing the Juve game to go ahead,\u201d says Abdul Basit, \u201cis because Milan is in the Lombardy region which is where all the outbreaks are currently linked to, with Lombardy having half of all Italian cases. Turin is not in that region.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fairly clear that Arteta has made an impact, and Arsenal do look generally better than they did before his appointment,\u201d wrote Matt Dony. \u201cBut really, any team that can field Aubameyang, Lacazette, Pepe and Ozil in attack (and Luiz in defence!) should be a lot more entertaining to watch.\u201d Arsenal have a problem. The unmarked Papa Abou Cisse scores a simple header from a corner to bring Olympiacos level on aggregate at the Emirates. As things stand, the match is going to extra-time. GOAL! Benfica 3-2 Shakhtar Donetsk (Stepanenko 49) As I was saying. Taras Stepanenko has brought Shakhtar level on aggregate - and ahead of away goals - in a humdinger at the Estadio da Luz. \u201cGenuine question,\u201d begins Tim Smith. \u201cSo, Inter playing at home in empty stadium. IRFU six nations Ireland Vs Italy already cancelled. I get the abundance of caution, but last night Juventus played in Lyon. Presumably some away fans made the trip? Just wondering if there is any consistency here?\u201d I don\u2019t know enough about it to comment, really. But based on my vague understanding of human history, it wouldn\u2019t be entirely without precedent for some important people to be making it up as they go along. \u201cMemory,\u201d is the subject of Simon McMahon\u2019s email. \u201cThe Bends was released 25 years ago next month, Rob. 25 years, though!!!\u201d See, now that really does feel like it was 25 years ago, at least. GOAL! Benfica 3-1 Shakhtar Donetsk (Silva 47) Rafa Silva puts Benfica ahead in the tie, though Shakhtar only need a 3-2 defeat to go through on away goals. Peep peep! The second halves are underway. In case you missed the early games, these were the results: Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-3 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-5) LASK 2-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 3-1) Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0) Porto 1-3 Leverkusen (agg: 2-5) Extra time: Istanbul Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 4-4) Espanyol 3-2 Wolves (agg: 3-6) Basaksehir 4-1 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 5-4) \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Michael George. \u201cAs a fan of the NFL and baseball, which have had \u2018VAR\u2019 for years, football needs to make a choice. Either do away with Stockley Park (aka le Parc de la Stockley on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday), or the referee reviewing le Parc\u2019s decisions. To have both is ridiculous and time consuming!\u201d There is a third choice. Peep peep! It\u2019s half-time in the late games, and these are the scores. Ajax 1-1 Getafe (agg: 1-3) Arsenal 0-0 Olympiacos (agg: 1-0) Benfica 2-1 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 3-3) Celtic 0-0 Copenhagen (agg: 1-1) Internazionale 2-1 Ludogorets (agg: 3-1) Man Utd 3-0 Club Brugge (agg: 4-1) Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) GOAL! Internazionale 2-1 Ludogorets (Lukaku 45, agg: 4-1) A freak goal puts Internazionale 4-1 up on aggregate. Romelu Lukaku\u2019s stooping header is saved by the keeper, but the ball rebounds back off his noggin and loops gently in the net. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Patrick O\u2019Brien. \u201cThe commentator on BT mentioned earlier that Bruno Fernandes has five goals for Spirting in this seasons Uefa cup. When did they sack off the cup-tied rules?\u201d They changed it recently, last year I think. But knowing how the memory of a fortysomething works, that probably means it was changed in the early 2000s. This tie is done and done. Scott McTominay returns to the side with a goal, sidefooting confidently into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. Arsenal 0-0 Olympiacos Alexandre Lacazette has had a goal disallowed for offside against Saka in the build-up. Shame as it was another lovely, clean assist from Saka, a fast, low cross that gave Lacazette an open goal. Ajax 1-1 Getafe (agg: 1-3) Getafe have hit the post and bar in quick succession. Ajax are having a lot of the ball but they need another three goals, at least. \u201cMate im trying to find the arsenal score but youve got a fixation on manure,\u201d says Kevin Baker. \u201cI dont give a fuck about man utd where\u2019s the arsenal score please?\u201d 0-0 mate. GOAL! Benfica 2-1 Shakhtar (agg: 3-3, Ruben 37) The tie is level on aggregate after an excellent downward header from Ruben Dias. Odion Ighalo scores on his full debut! It was a simple finish after good play from Bruno Fernandes and Juan Mata, and Nigeria will be a very happy place right now. Latest scores Ajax 1-1 Getafe (agg: 1-3) Arsenal 0-0 Olympiacos (agg: 1-0) Benfica 1-1 Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 2-3) Celtic 0-0 Copenhagen (agg: 1-1) Internazionale 1-1 Ludogorets (agg: 3-1) Man Utd 1-0 Club Brugge (agg: 2-1) Sevilla 0-0 CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) Celtic 0-0 Copenhagen (agg: 1-1) Celtic have been excellent so far and should be ahead. A 0-0 draw is good enough for them to go through, mind. GOAL! Internazionale 1-1 Ludogorets (agg: 3-1, Biraghi 31) Christian Eriksen finds the overlapping Biraghi, whose deflected shot beats the keeper at the near post. GOAL! Inter 0-1 Ludogorets (agg: 2-1, Oliveira-Souza 27) That\u2019s silenced the home crowd, etc, etc. The new Old Trafford hero, Bruno Fernandes, gives United the lead with another impressively cocksure penalty. Brugge are also down to 10 men: Simon Deli was sent off for handling a goalbound shot from Daniel James. Full time: Basaksehir 4-1 Sporting (agg: 5-4) A famous victory for Basaksehir! There are some VAR fun and games at Old Trafford. Tumaini Carayol will tell you more. GOAL! Basaksehir 4-1 Sporting (agg: 5-4, Visca 119 pen) Edin Visca smashes a penalty into the roof of the net to put Basaksehir ahead! Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting (agg: 4-4) The tie is nine minutes from penalties. GOAL! Benfica 1-1 Shakhtar (Junior Moraes 12, agg: 2-3) A vital away goal for Shakhtar, with Junior Moraes scrambling the ball over the line. He knew very little about it, if that, as he slid towards a low cross with a couple of defenders. I doubt he\u2019ll care though. GOAL! Ajax 1-1 Getafe (Danilo 11, agg: 1-3) One down, three to go. The young Brazilian Danilo scores an open goal to give Ajax a snifter of hope against Getafe. GOAL! Benfica 1-0 Shakhtar (Pizzi 9, agg: 2-2) Benfica are level on aggregate. Pizzi has given them the lead with a nice goal, steering the ball sweetly into the far corner from just inside the box. Internazionale 0-0 Ludogorets (agg: 2-0) Romelu Lukaku has missed a one-on-one for Inter, who are playing behind closed doors because of the coronavirus outbreak. GOAL! Ajax 0-1 Getafe (agg: 0-3, Mata 6) An important early goal in Amsterdam. Jaime Mata has put Getafe three up on aggregate, and with an away goal as well. Ajax are in all sorts. Peep peep! The evening games are under way. Don\u2019t forget you can follow Man Utd v Club Brugge with Tumaini Carayol. Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting (agg: 4-4) Ten minutes gone in extra time. As things stand, it\u2019s going to penalties. \u201cI am going to print this MBM,\u201d says Mystic Peter Van, \u201cand next time I\u2019m talking football with my mates, I\u2019ll shove it in their faces and say, \u2018Yes, but have YOU ever been proven right on a Guardian MBM?\u2019 And so, at the request of no-one, here are my guesses for the late games: Arsenal to go through (easily) United to go through (not so easily) Benfica beat Shakhtar Getafe hold on vs. Ajax I will soon have no mates to talk football with.\u201d \u201cThink Neto showed his inexperience there,\u201d said Phil Russell. \u201cJota would have taken the contact, got the keeper sent off and had an outfield player in goal for the free kick.\u201d The later games will kick off in the next few minutes. And here they are: Ajax v Getafe (agg: 0-2) Arsenal v Olympiacos (agg: 1-0) Benfica v Shakhtar Donetsk (agg: 1-2) Celtic v Copenhagen (agg: 1-1) Internazionale v Ludogorets (agg: 2-0) Man Utd v Club Brugge (agg: 1-1) Sevilla v CFR Cluj (agg: 1-1) That\u2019s it for the early games, apart from Basaksehir v Sporting Lisbon. These are the latest/final scores: Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-3 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-5) LASK 2-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 3-1) Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0) Porto 1-3 Leverkusen (agg: 2-5) Extra time: Istanbul Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 4-4) Espanyol 3-2 Wolves (agg: 3-6) Peep peep! Wolves reach the last 16 in Europe for the first time since 1971-72. In the long-term, however, the match will probably be remembered for a very special miss by Pedro Neto. Full time: Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting (agg: 4-4) The match goes to extra-time, though Robinho - yep, him, yep he\u2019s 36 now - almost won it with the last kick of the game. His swirling long-range drive whistled just over the bar. Roma, Wolfsburg and LASK are all through to the last 16. Wolves, Basel and Leverkusen are about to join them. Jonathan Callari complets a consolation hat-trick with a good downward header. Wolves will be a bit annoyed to lose on the night, but the main thing is that they are through to the last 16. GOAL! Basaksehir 3-1 Sporting (agg: 4-4; Visca 90+2) Edin Visca has taken the match to extra-time! Espanyol 2-2 Wolves Pedro Neto has just missed an open goal from 20 yards. He went round the keeper and calmly sidefooted the ball wide. That registers very high on the Rosenthalometer, and I suspect the clip will be going viral this same night. Espanyol 2-2 Wolves Early days, but Daniel Podence could be yet another triumph for the Wolves scouting department. He\u2019s had a terrific game. Espanyol 2-2 Wolves Watching Wolves in the last 16 is going to be so much fun. Imagine the atmosphere at Molineux. Wolves equalise on the night, with Matt Doherty scoring an open goal after good work from the lively Daniel Podence. Gent 1-1 Roma It hasn\u2019t been an easy night for Roma - they scored from their only shot on target - but Gent are starting to run out of hope, ot to mention time. These are the latest scores. Most of the ties look settled, though Basaksehir v Sporting Lisbon is poised pretty nicely. And Gent are still pushing enthusiastically for the two goals they need to Roma. Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-3 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-5) LASK 2-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 3-1) Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0) Porto 0-3 Leverkusen (agg: 1-5) Istanbul Basaksehir 2-1 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 3-4) Espanyol 2-1 Wolves (agg: 2-5) Wolfsburg are now 3-0 ahead against Malmo, 5-1 on aggregate. GOAL! Porto 1-3 Leverkusen (agg: 2-5, Marega 67) Two in a minute for Peter Van! Porto get a consolation goal, just as he predicted, with a cracking header from Moussa Marega. GOAL! Istanbul Basaksehir 2-1 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 3-4, Vietto 68) Peter Van strikes again! Fulham alumnus Luciano Vietto has put Sporting Lisbon back in front on aggregate against the Turkish league leaders. Espanyol 2-1 Wolves (agg: 2-5) There\u2019s a bit of huff and puff from Espanyol. But they still need four goals to go through and, well, no. GOAL! Malmo 0-2 Wolfsburg (agg 1-4; Gerhardt 65) It\u2019s a stroll in Sweden for Wolfsburg. Yannick Gerhardt has put them 4-1 ahead on aggregate. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Peter Van. \u201cThanks for acknowledging my very modest and very temporary success in predicting Gent to do well tonight vs. Roma. I\u2019m not actually watching that game (Porto - Leverkusen is what\u2019s on TV here). Based on that, here are some second half predictions: Porto will score but they are dreadful in defence and Leverkusen will go through Sporting Lisbon to come back against Basaksehir LASK will hold their lead vs. Alkmaar Wolves will, hmmm, qualify.\u201d This is a rout. The brilliant Kai Havertz, who made the first two goals, scores the third on the break. Latest scores Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-1 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-3) LASK 2-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 3-1) Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0) Porto 0-2 Leverkusen (agg: 1-4) Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 3-3) Espanyol 2-1 Wolves (agg: 2-5) A bit more team news Thanks Niall. Meanwhile, Jonathan Calleri\u2019s relaxed penalty has put Espanyol ahead on the night against Wolves. They only need four more. It\u2019s game over in Porto, where Leverkusen now lead 2-0, and 4-1 on aggregate. Kerem Demirbay is the man on the scoresheet. Leverkusen can be formidable opponents when they\u2019re on their game \u2013 the British teams who progress will hope to avoid them. And speaking of formidable, it\u2019s time to hand you back to Rob Smyth, who will guide you through the rest of this continental buffet. Daniel Podence almost puts Wolves ahead on the night, cutting inside but firing just over the bar. In Austria, Margo Raguz has scored a second for LASK Linz, who lead AZ Alkmaar 3-1 on aggregate in the Capital Letters Derby. Here\u2019s how to follow Manchester United v Club Brugge: The players are heading back out for the second half in Barcelona, and everywhere else for that matter. Danijel Aleksic scored an absolutely belting free kick just before the break to give Istanbul Basaksehir a 2-0 lead over Sporting: With Frankfurt\u2019s game at Salzburg put back until Friday because of a storm, Eintracht fans have headed en masse to watch an ice hockey game instead. They\u2019re watching Red Bull\u2019s hockey team against Klagenfurt, and backing the away side: Remember when West Ham drew Romania\u2019s Astra Giurgiu twice in Europa League qualifying \u2013 and got knocked out both times? Well, it\u2019s been pretty much downhill ever since for the Hammers \u2013 and now they\u2019re battling the dreaded drop: Arsenal, Celtic and Manchester United are all in action at 8pm (GMT), with Odion Ighalo set for his first United start at home to Club Brugge. Rob will be keeping tabs on that one, but you can also join Tumaini Carayol in a separate MBM: Thanks, Rob. Some serious pre-season friendly vibes about Espanyol v Wolves, now the visitors have that away goal. It\u2019s also looking very good for Leverkusen, Basel and Wolfsburg. Tie of the night so far is in Istanbul, where Basaksehir lead Sporting on away goals. Peep peep! It\u2019s half time in the seven early games, and these are the scores. Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-1 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-3) LASK 1-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 2-1) Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0) Porto 0-1 Leverkusen (agg: 1-3) Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 3-3) Espanyol 1-1 Wolves (agg: 1-5) There\u2019s a long night ahead, oh yes, so I\u2019m going to take a short break. Niall McVeigh will be with you for the next 20 minutes or so. Bye! GOAL! Istanbul Basaksehir 2-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 3-3, Aleksic 45) Danijel Aleksic has brought Basaksehir level on aggregate - and they are ahead on away goals. GOAL! Malmo 0-1 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-3; Brekalo 42) GOAL! LASK 1-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 2-1; Raguz 44 pen) GOAL! Basel 1-0 APOEL (agg: 4-0; F Frei 38 pen) Basel will be in the last 16. Porto 0-1 Leverkusen (agg: 1-3) Leverkusen have been a class above Porto in the first 37 minutes 44 seconds. Latest scores Gent 1-1 Roma (agg: 1-2) Malmo 0-0 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-2) LASK 0-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 1-1) Basel 0-0 APOEL (agg: 3-0) Porto 0-1 Leverkusen (agg: 1-3) Istanbul Basaksehir 1-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 2-3) Espanyol 1-1 Wolves (agg: 1-5) \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Matt Burtz. \u201cThis email may only be applicable to approximately two people, but Americans with a cable subscription can watch some Europa League games through Univision\u2019s streaming service. Yes, it\u2019s in Spanish, but it\u2019s better than nothing, and you get to hear the classic \u2018GOOOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL\u2019 or some variation thereof.\u201d Will it explain Brexit though? Istanbul Basaksheir 1-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 2-3) Our old friend Martin Skrtel has put the Super Lig leaders Basaksehir in front against Sporting Lisbon. A hammer blow to Gent, and a vital away goal for Roma. Justin Kluivert makes a good run infield, onto Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s nice through pass, and finished confidently. Peter Van predicted it! Jonathan David has given Gent the lead with a goal of unobtrusive call. There must have been at least 20 passes in the build-up. Eventually Roman Bezus put in a brilliant cross from the right, and David pulled off his man to steer an accomplished half-volley past Pau Lopez. Delightful stuff. Adama Traore, back in his birthplace of Barcelona, scores at the second attempt to put Wolves 5-1 ahead on aggregate. They also have an away goal, which means Espanyol need at least five more to go through. Latest scores Gent 0-0 Roma (agg: 0-1) Malmo 0-0 Wolfsburg (agg: 1-2) LASK 0-0 AZ Alkmaar (agg: 1-1) Basel 0-0 APOEL (agg: 3-0) Porto 0-1 Leverkusen (agg: 1-3) Istanbul Basaksehir 0-0 Sporting Lisbon (agg: 1-3) Espanyol 1-0 Wolves (agg: 1-4) A-hem, as I was saying. Jonathan Calleri gives Espanyol the lead with a crisp finish at the near post from Pedrosa\u2019s low cross. Espanyol 0-0 Wolves No sign of an imminent nightmare for Wolves. Rui Patricio has just made a terrific save, though yer man was offside. \u201cI\u2019ll be relying solely on your MBMing skills today as they no longer show Europa League games on TV here and I\u2019m too cheap to pay to watch them,\u201d says J. R. in Illinois. \u201cAh well. I guess I\u2019ll just continue reading this book explaining why y\u2019all Brexited yourselves even though I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever fully understand. Maybe if these games are uneventful and you\u2019re looking for material you could try explaining it to me.\u201d No. Leverkusen go 3-1 ahead on aggregate. As in the first leg, Lucas Alario had a goal disallowed for offside on the field and then given by VAR. It was a calm, accomplished finish at the end of a neat move, and Leverkusen are well on course for the last 16. Espanyol 0-0 Wolves Nothing much to report after six minutes, though Espanyol have been lively enough. The RCDE Stadium looks a quarter full at best. Peep peep! The seven early games have started. These are the latest scores. \u201cDear Rob,\u201d says Peter Van. \u201cI fully agree that tonight\u2019s top matchup is Porto - Leverkusen. But I\u2019d keep an eye on Gent-Roma too. I saw Gent demolish Wolfsburg in the group stages and I was impressed, I think they might turn it around against a hot-and-cold Roma team. And they feature striker Jonathan David, sure to be a recurring feature in your Rumour Mill column. \u201cOn a different note - do you share the (very, very wrong) opinion as most of your colleagues in the English media, according to whom the Europa Vase is a waste of time, useful only as an alternative path to the Big Megabucks League?\u201d I\u2019m no Europa League disciple \u2013 I have a very snobbish subconscious, which I hate \u2013 but even so, that attitude has always irritated me. When you win a trophy you should be high on glory, not your win bonus. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve really enjoyed watching Wolves in Europe this season, because there has been no entitlement or elitism. \u201cEvening Rob,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cAfter Rangers and Man City STORMED it on the continent last night, it\u2019d be good to see more British teams making a STATEMENT tonight. It\u2019s all part of the Brexit dividend, innit? If we ignore what happened to Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea, of course.\u201d I love that Britain (well, England) is even being shown up by Europe when it comes to VAR. Some pre-match reading (and listening) Team news Wolves, who are 4-0 up from the first leg, have picked a weakened side to face Espanyol. They\u2019ll regret that if they lose 12-0. There\u2019s a decent chance that there will be five British clubs in the last 16. Wolves and Arsenal should progress comfortably - should - while Celtic and Manchester United are favourites after managing score draws away to Copenhagen and Club Brugge respectively. The match of the night is probably in Portugal, where FC Porto start 2-1 down to Bayer Leverkusen. And these are the 8pm games (9pm CET) Benfica v Shakhtar Donetsk (1-2) Internazionale v Ludogorets (2-0) Man Utd v Club Brugge (1-1) Arsenal v Olympiacos (1-0) Sevilla v CFR Cluj (1-1) Celtic v Copenhagen (1-1) Ajax v Getafe (0-2) These are the 5.55pm kick-offs (6.55pm CET; first leg scores in brackets) Gent v Roma (0-1) Malmo v Wolfsburg (1-2) LASK v AZ Alkmaar (1-1) Basel v APOEL (3-0) Porto v Leverkusen (1-2) Istanbul Basaksehir v Sporting Lisbon (1-3) Espanyol v Wolves (0-4) Hello and welcome to live coverage of the Europa League last 32, phase B, part deux, second leg ties. Rangers have already qualified for the next round, so there are 15 more places up for grabs. The kick-offs are staggered as usual, with seven at 5.55pm UK time and seven more at 8pm. A gold star for the first person who shouted at their screen: \u201cHang on, 7+7 does NOT equal 15! Do you get paid for this? \u2018The world\u2019s leading liberal voice\u2019? Liberal maths more like lol.\u201d Yes, the match between Salzburg v Frankfurt has been postponed (or, to put it in the parlance of our times, POSTPONED) because of a storm warning. It has been rescheduled (RESCHEDULED) for tomorrow afternoon. That\u2019ll be then, this is now: let\u2019s look at tonight\u2019s games.",

The global count of those sickened by the virus hovered around 82,000 on Thursday, with 433 new cases reported in China and an additional 505 in South Korea. The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that can cause colds or more serious illnesses such as Sars and Mers. The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads. Officials are advising people to take steps to avoid infection with coronavirus or other respiratory infections like colds or the flu, including washing hands with soap and water and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.",
