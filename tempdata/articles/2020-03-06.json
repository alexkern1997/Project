      "bodyText": "The federal government has set up a national Indigenous advisory group to fast-track an emergency response plan for Aboriginal communities that are among the most vulnerable to any potential spread of Covid-19. The taskforce met on Thursday as remote Aboriginal communities in South Australia began to strictly limit visitors for the next three months, worried that if Covid-19 arrives it will be \u201cdevastating\u201d for their elders and people with existing health problems. The Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY) have introduced strict rules for entry to their lands, which they can to do under the APY Land Rights Act. \u201cWe are protecting our people, especially those who hold our ancient cultural knowledge, and we know they are already vulnerable as they are quite old,\u201d APY general manager Richard King said. \u201cA lot of our people present with comorbidities like diabetes and renal failure. We have high smoking rates, overcrowding in housing, overall poor hygiene. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a perfect storm to support the transmission of these types of diseases. \u201cThe problem with this one is it has a 3.4% fatality rate, which is high, but with our cohort, if it gets here, it\u2019s going to be devastating.\u201d The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander advisory group on Covid-19 is made up of leaders from the Aboriginal community controlled health sector, state and territory health and medical officials, Aboriginal communicable disease experts, the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association and the National Indigenous Australians Agency. The new taskforce will consider the health, social and cultural needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, using principles of shared decision-making and co-design. The management plan will focus on current containment activities as well as preparations for mitigation and treatment phases. There are major issues to consider, \u201cdepending on how serious it gets, and events as they unfold\u201d, according to Olga Havnen, a member of the taskforce and CEO of the Darwin-based Aboriginal health organisation Danila Dilba. These include housing people, and the deployment of additional health workforce capacity, Havnen said. \u201cWe would need deployment based on where the need is greatest,\u201d Havnen said. \u201cAnd will people want to do it? This will need a dynamic response. \u201cBut the commonwealth has a clear sense of the need to provide good structures for the vulnerable in our communities. \u201cThe key thing is getting good information, clear and consistent, to our communities. And the big message is hand-washing.\u201d The APY board decided on Thursday to refuse entry for the next three months to anyone who has been in mainland China since early February, or been in contact with someone confirmed to have coronavirus, or who has travelled to Iran, South Korea, Japan, Italy or Mongolia. Anyone in those categories who wants to visit needs to have tested negative for the virus, and will have to submit a copy of the test results along with a statutory declaration to be considered for entry. State and federal agencies don\u2019t need to apply for a permit to enter but King said he hoped they would comply with the ban. Indigenous Australians minister Ken Wyatt has agreed to postpone a scheduled visit next month. There have been no known Covid-19 cases on APY lands to date, but the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has expressed concern about the vulnerability of those in remote Indigenous communities. During the 2009 swine flu outbreak, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 11% of all identified cases, 20% of hospitalisations and 13% of deaths. The Northern Territory is also developing a remote health pandemic plan, due to be released on Monday. NT Chief medical officer Dianne Stephens acknowledged the \u201csignificant\u201d logistical problems with using self-isolation as a response in remote communities, where overcrowding in housing is a major issue. \u201cSo we are working out ways in every community where we can institute social distancing, where we can have a safe place for people to be quarantined if they\u2019re unwell,\u201d she said. The NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, announced yesterday that a pandemic clinic had been set up at Royal Darwin hospital.",

Not because she was a woman and I am concerned about electability. Not because I am waiting for the perfect woman to run, or that the budding octogenarian that I support is a savior. But because I truly believe that social movements and political revolution transform people, communities, and the planet - not just one built around a singular candidate. I did not want Warren to leave the race before anyone else. Naively, perhaps, I assumed that the United States had shifted significantly towards an exciting future, and the candidates would wither down to Bernie or Elizabeth. I was wrong. After Super Tuesday, I realized that many voters desperately want this country to return to normal, even though \u201cnormal\u201d is oppressive for so many of us. The biggest threat to Warren and Sanders supporters was never each other.</p> \n  <p>With this in mind, Senator Warren has a choice to make. She was one of the most innovative Democratic candidates for president in this current race, and possibly in American history. Her plans for universal childcare, significant Social Security expansion, and building a green economy would have certainly improved the lives of millions of peoples across the country. Does she believe in her vision enough to support and rally her base around Senator Sanders - the only candidate whose policies dream big about what we must make possible in this country?

In a ruling that questioned attorney general William Barr\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d, the judge indicated that the court would review the report and consider what additional portions can be released to the public. Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race. She has declined to endorse either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Bernie Sanders refocused his efforts on Michigan, leaving the south to Joe Biden. Though he was the frontrunner before Super Tuesday, Sanders is scrambling to catch up after moderates consolidated behind Biden. The Senate approved an $8bn bill to address the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Mike Pence headed to Washington, where there have been more reported coronavirus cases than in any other state. Donald Trump answered questions in a Fox News town hall held in Biden\u2019s home town Scranton, Pennsylvania. The president said he expects to face off against Biden, not Sanders, in November. Washington state Governor Jay Inslee greeted Mike Pence with an elbow bump, welcoming the vice president and other coronavirus task force members to the state\u2019s emergency operations centers. Pence and Inslee spoke to state health officials amidst a serious outbreak in the state, where there have been reported 70 cases and 11 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s Derecka Purnell writes: Senator Warren was my second choice candidate. Not because she was a woman and I am concerned about electability. Not because I am waiting for the perfect woman to run, or that the budding octogenarian that I support is a savior. But because I truly believe that social movements and political revolution transform people, communities, and the planet - not just one built around a singular candidate. I did not want Warren to leave the race before anyone else. Naively, perhaps, I assumed that the United States had shifted significantly towards an exciting future, and the candidates would wither down to Bernie or Elizabeth. I was wrong. After Super Tuesday, I realized that many voters desperately want this country to return to normal, even though \u201cnormal\u201d is oppressive for so many of us. The biggest threat to Warren and Sanders supporters was never each other. With this in mind, Senator Warren has a choice to make. She was one of the most innovative Democratic candidates for president in this current race, and possibly in American history. Her plans for universal childcare, significant Social Security expansion, and building a green economy would have certainly improved the lives of millions of peoples across the country. Does she believe in her vision enough to support and rally her base around Senator Sanders - the only candidate whose policies dream big about what we must make possible in this country? She absolutely must. Her, and our collective future, requires it. Read the full piece here: Speaking at the Fox News town hall in Scranton, Trump said he expects to be running against Joe Biden. \u201cMentally, I\u2019m all set for Bernie,\u201d he said. But after Super Tuesday, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m running against Bernie,\u201d Trump added. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very hard for him to come back.\u201d He also said that Elizabeth Warren should have dropped out earlier, echoing what some Sanders supporters had said. \u201cLook if she\u2019s a true progressive, which probably she is, she should have dropped out three days ago,\u201d Trump said. Now that Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the presidential race, we may be seeing less of her most effective surrogate: her golden retriever Bailey. But it seems that Bailey is enjoying a break, and he\u2019s already starting to let loose now that the pressure\u2019s off. It\u2019s ruff always having to be a good boy! Following Warren\u2019s public address announcing the end of her campaign, it seems Bailey helped himself to a large burrito and gulped down a good portion of it before several people lunged into action to try to remove the remnants from his mouth. Burritos, of course, are generally considered human food not meant for doggos. Still, after a hard-fought campaign, who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t deserve it. At the Scranton town hall, in response to a supporter who asked him to tone down his rhetoric, Donald Trump said it was important to \u201chit back\u201d. \u201cWhen they hit us, we have to hit back. I really feel that,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn your cheek\u201d He also provided a positive spin on the coronavirus outbreak: \u201cI have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the US\u2014 and I like that,\u201d he said. Donald Trump, meanwhile, is in Joe Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for a town hall hosted by Fox News. This will be his first TV town hall the 2020 elections, and a rare instance where Trump will be taking questions from the public \u2014 albeit in a friendly venue set up by his favorite network. This is also Trump\u2019s first visit this year to Pennsylvania, a swing state that he won by just 44,000 votes in 2016. Bernie Sanders has canceled a trip to Mississippi, choosing to focus his efforts in Michigan and essentially leaving the south to Joe Biden. Sanders was supposed to campaign Jackson, Mississippi, along Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, on Friday. Instead, Sanders will head to Detroit for a rally tomorrow, and Grand Rapids for another event on Sunday. Speaking to reporters from his campaign headquarters in Vermont yesterday, Sanders said that Michigan would be \u201cwhere we will spend a bit of our time,\u201d and noted that it was critical in his path to the Democratic nomination. Though Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Michigan primary, he appears to be nearly 7 points behind Biden in a Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll of likely Michigan Democratic primary voters released Tuesday. Today, Michigan\u2019s governor Gretchen Whitmer endorsed Biden. \u201cAll roads to the White House lead through my state, and I want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a strong ability to help impact where we are headed as a nation,\u201d she said on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe. Sanders campaigned Whitmer\u2019s primary challenger in 2018. Another judge from the same court as Judge Walton recently sentenced Roger Stone \u2014 a friend of Trump \u2014 for interfering in a congressional investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Amy Berman Jackson of the Washington district court sentenced Stone to more than three years in prison following disagreements between Barr and career prosecutors over how harsh the sentence should be. The Department of Justice has been ordered to turn over an unredacted copy of the Mueller report by 30 March, so a judge can assess what can be further released publicly. The ruling accuses the attorney general, William Barr, of misrepresenting the findings of the report before handing it over to Congress. The court decision is the result of a BuzzFeed News lawsuit seeking to reveal the contents of the report, which details the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In his opinion explaining the ruling, the federal judge Reggie Walton wrote that Barr\u2019s public comments in April 2019 about the report didn\u2019t fit with the actual findings and were misleading to the public. \u201cThe inconsistencies between Attorney General Barr\u2019s statements made at a time when the public did not have access to the redacted version of the Mueller Report to assess the veracity of his statements, and portions of the redacted version of the Mueller Report that conflict with those statements cause the Court to seriously question whether Attorney General Barr made a calculated attempt to influence public discourse about the Mueller Report in favor of President Trump despite certain findings in the redacted version of the Mueller Report to the contrary,\u201d Walton said. Walton, who was appointed by George W Bush, also delivered a hard condemnation of Barr. \u201cThese circumstances generally, and Attorney General Barr\u2019s lack of candor specifically, call into question Attorney General Barr\u2019s credibility,\u201d he wrote in the legal opinion. Facebook says it will remove misleading Trump ads that present a survey on the president\u2019s reelection campaign website as an \u201cofficial\u201d 2020 census survey. Kevin Collier reports for The Guardian: The Trump Make America Great Committee posted 2,000 iterations of an ad this week, asking users to respond to the \u201cOfficial Congressional District Census\u201d. Instead of information at the Census Bureau, however, the posts linked to a push-poll survey on the GOP fundraising site action.donaldjtrump.com, which also requests personal information for the campaign. Advocates said this could interfere with the actual census, which begins for most Americans with mailers in mid-March. A census is a once-in-a-decade event that seeks to count every person in the country, with drastic consequences for resource allocation and government representation nationwide. Hi, there! It\u2019s Maanvi \u2014 writing from the West Coast. Now that Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the race, where do her supporters go? Second choice polling data from Moning Consult suggests that her supporters may split between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. Forty-three percent of Warren supporters said they\u2019d shift support to Sanders , and 36 percent said they\u2019d go with Biden. Of course, that could change if Warren ultimately choses to endorse Sanders. As Sanders pointed out, her politics and policies align much more closely with his than Biden\u2019s. For now, Warren has held off \u2014 perhaps strategically choosing to maintain leverage and push the remaining candidates\u2019 policies. In 2016, she declined to choose between Sanders and Hillary Clinton, frustrating supporters of both candidates. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race after a disappointing Super Tuesday performance. The Massachusetts senator declined to endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders today, and she said she had \u201cno regrets\u201d about her campaign. The $8 billion bill aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus passed the Senate. The proposal is now headed to Trump\u2019s desk for his signature. Markets slumped again amid growing fears about coronavirus. The Dow dropped 970 points, wiping out almost all of yesterday\u2019s gains after Biden\u2019s strong showing on Super Tuesday. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he misspoke in his comments directed at two Supreme Court justices. The New York Democrat said yesterday that Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two justices nominated by Trump, would \u201cpay the price\u201d for their decision in an abortion rights case. Mike Bloomberg is reportedly starting a new group aimed at defeating Trump in November. The former New York mayor suspended his presidential campaign yesterday and endorsed Biden, but Bloomberg made clear he would still work to elect the eventual Democratic nominee. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Freshman congresswoman Elissa Slotkin has endorsed Joe Biden days before her home state of Michigan holds its primary. \u201cToday, I filled out my absentee ballot for Joe Biden,\u201d Slotkin said in a statement. \u201cI did so for a host of reasons, but most importantly because I hear from my constituents every day that they want an end to the all-or-nothing politics that have so polarized our country.\u201d Slotkin is one of the freshman House Democrats who flipped Republican districts in 2018, and she faces a difficult reelection in November. Her endorsement of Biden is unsurprising, considering a number of moderate Democrats have sought to distance themselves from Bernie Sanders. But the timing of the Michigan congresswoman\u2019s endorsement could be crucial, considering the state will award 125 delegates on Tuesday. The US markets dropped again today amid growing fears about the spread of coronavirus. The Dow dropped 970 points, or over 3.5%, erasing much of yesterday\u2019s gains. The markets saw an uptick yesterday as investors appeared to breathe a sigh of relief about Bernie Sanders\u2019 sinking political fortunes after Joe Biden\u2019s strong Super Tuesday performance. For more updates and analysis, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog: A national poll shows Joe Biden leading Bernie Sanders by double digits after his strong performance on Super Tuesday. According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, Biden stands at 55% nationally, while Sanders is 10 points behind at 45%. Of course, the more important polls now are those taken in states that will hold primaries later this month. On that metric, Biden also appears to be enjoying an advantage over Sanders. A poll from Michigan, which will vote on Tuesday, showed Biden leading by more than 6 points, and a new Florida poll, which will award 219 delegates on March 17, found Biden holding an astounding 49-point advantage. House speaker Nancy Pelosi held a signing ceremony for the coronavirus bill, which is now headed to Trump\u2019s desk after its passage in the Senate today. Pelosi acknowledged the $8 billion package may only mark the beginning of the US response to the health threat. \u201cWe have no idea what the scope will be,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe do recognize this may be a first step.\u201d Asked by a reporter about whether there are coronavirus test kits at the Capitol, Pelosi said she did not believe the government had the capacity for such testing. Joe Biden has picked up another endorsement from a former Obama administration official: former health and human services secretary Kathleen Sebelius. \u201cAt this time of an emerging health crisis, it\u2019s more important than ever to have an experienced leader as president who listens to the scientists, believes in health care for all, and can bring the country together to deal with the challenges ahead,\u201d Sebelius said in a statement released by the Biden campaign. \u201cThat leader is Joe Biden, and I hope you\u2019ll join me in fighting for him.\u201d Sebelius served as the governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and her endorsement is seen as a huge boost in the state, which will hold its presidential primary on May 2. Some of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s supporters are continuing their fight for other progressive candidates after the Massachusetts senator suspended her campaign today. The New York Times reports: Ms. Warren\u2019s supporters never turned on their candidate, or the party that rejected her candidacy. In Illinois, where Ms. Warren\u2019s campaign was scheduled to hold a post-Super Tuesday phone banking session, staff and supporters refused to cancel. They decided to use their time to support Marie Newman, the Illinois congressional candidate running against an incumbent Democrat opposed to abortion rights. Newman is challenging incumbent Democratic congressman Dan Lipinski, who she narrowly lost to in 2018. After suspending his presidential campaign, Mike Bloomberg is reportedly starting a new group aimed at defeating Trump in November. The Washington Post reports: Bloomberg has decided to form a new independent expenditure campaign that will absorb hundreds of his presidential campaign staff in six swing states to work to elect the Democratic nominee this fall. The new group, with a name that is still undisclosed because its trademark application is in process, would also be a vehicle for Bloomberg to spend money on advertising to attack President Trump and support the Democratic nominee, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. ... The new group, operating with the same potentially limitless bankroll that funded Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, could play a mayor role in shaping the race this fall. Bloomberg, who is worth more than $50 billion, has also not ruled out using the group to spend money to support Vice President Joe Biden during his primary fight against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Bloomberg dropped out of the race yesterday after a disappointing performance on Super Tuesday and immediately endorsed Joe Biden. Even though he\u2019s out of the Democratic primary, Bloomberg has continued to taunt Trump, releasing a new video today that mocks the president as a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the country. Jordan Frias reports from outside Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home in Cambridge, Massachusetts: Elizabeth Warren supporters who came to see the former candidate\u2019s press conference today included college students and neighbors, many of whom said they were too sad to speak to the media, while others wouldn\u2019t be drawn on who they might support now. Pat David, 73, came with her 2-year-old granddaughter in her stroller. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want her to endorse [Bernie Sanders],\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know who can beat this idiot in the White House ... I don\u2019t think she should necessarily endorse anyone, I think she should stay out of that sort of thing until someone decides to try to draft her in.\u201d Sarah Taylor, a neighbor of Warren\u2019s, came with her dog and a sign reading, \u201cWe are proud of you, thank you\u201d. She too is not ready to see the liberal progressive back anyone. \u201cI will support whoever the Democratic Party nominates, and I think [Sanders] has many gifts\u201d Taylor said, \u201cBut I think that the temperament that I\u2019m looking for in the president is one like Elizabeth\u2019s, and one that\u2019s more in line with [Joe Biden].\u201d In case you missed it amid the flurry of news this morning: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he misspoke when he warned two conservative Supreme Court justices would \u201cpay the price\u201d for their decision in an abortion rights case. \u201cI should not have used the words I used yesterday. They didn\u2019t come out the way I intended them to,\u201d Schumer said in a Senate floor speech this morning. \u201cI\u2019m from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language. I shouldn\u2019t have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat. I never \u2014 never \u2014 would do such a thing.\u201d Speaking to abortion rights supporters yesterday as the Supreme Court hears a case about a Louisiana law restricting access to the procedure, Schumer directed a warning at Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, the two justices nominated by Trump. \u201cI want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell then accused Schumer of trying to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d But it should be noted Republicans have avoided similar criticism of Trump, who has repeatedly lashed out against judges who deliver decisions that are unfavorable to his policy agenda. Even though he has dropped out of the presidential race, Mike Bloomberg is not done bashing Trump. The former New York mayor just tweeted a new video that calls Trump a \u201cdisaster\u201d for the country and ends with the message, \u201cDump Trump. Go Joe.\u201d Trump and Bloomberg repeatedly exchanged insults about each other\u2019s height and intelligence once the billionaire candidate launched his Democratic presidential campaign in November. When Bloomberg dropped out of the race yesterday after a disappointing Super Tuesday perfromance, he endorsed Joe Biden and said he would work to help get him elected. Senator Rand Paul had proposed an amendment to offset the cost of the coronavirus bill with cuts to foreign aid. When that measure failed, the Kentucky Republican voted against the $8 billion bill, making him the only senator to oppose the proposal. The only two House members to vote against the bill yesterday -- Andy Biggs and Ken Buck -- similarly objected to the bill\u2019s cost. The Senate has passed the $8 billion coronavirus bill on a vote of 96 to 1, with only Republican senator Rand Paul opposing the measure. The bill similarly advanced through the House on a resounding vote of 415 to 2. The proposal now goes to Trump, who is expected to sign the bill into law after significantly increasing the amount of requested funding to combat the heath threat. An $8.3 billion bill to release emergency funding to combat the coronavirus outbreak has won enough support for passage in the Senate, as voting continues. The bill passed in the House yesterday and is receiving bipartisan support. It is a much larger sum than the White House floated late last month and will authorize special funding for government agencies in the front line of dealing with the novel illness, as well as to boost Medicare, the government health insurance for the older population. The legislation passed almost unanimously in the House and, Reuters reported, is on its way through the Senate also with strong support. Bernie Sanders celebrated Elizabeth Warren as a progressive champion who has \u201ctaken on the most powerful corporate interests\u201d after she suspended her presidential campaign. Some of Sanders\u2019 allies have called on Warren to endorse her fellow progressive senator, but she told reporters today that she was \u201cnot ready\u201d to make an endorsement. Joe Biden, the other leading candidate remaining in the presidential primary, similarly praised Warren as \u201cthe fiercest of fighters for middle class families.\u201d At her weekly press conference, House speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed disappointment that the presidential primary has narrowed to two men. \u201cEvery time I get introduced as the most powerful woman, I almost cry because I wish that were not true,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cI still wish that we had a woman president of the United States.\u201d Pelosi said she believed there was \u201can element of misogyny\u201d to the hurdles that women candidates face in politics. The speaker also dismissed the idea that Democratic voters were worried a woman candidate could not beat Trump \u201cI think anyone can beat President Trump,\u201d Pelosi said. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez mourned the end of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s presidential campaign. The progressive congresswoman has been a top surrogate for Bernie Sanders in recent days, but unlike some of Sanders\u2019 allies, Ocasio-Cortez did not call on Warren to drop out after her disappointing Super Tuesday performance. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Elizabeth Warren has dropped out of the presidential primary, following her disappointing performance on Super Tuesday. Warren told reporters she would wait on endorsing one of her opponents, as many of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters call on her to back her fellow progressive senator. Mitch McConnell criticized Chuck Schumer for comments he made about two conservative Supreme Court justices, accusing the Democratic leader of trying to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Elizabeth Warren said she had a theory about the presidential primary that was proven incorrect in recent weeks. The Massachusetts senator said she was told there were \u201ctwo lanes\u201d in the primary: \u201ca progressive lane that Bernie Sanders is the incumbent for and a moderate lane that Joe Biden is the incumbent for.\u201d She added, \u201cI thought that wasn\u2019t right but evidently I was wrong.\u201d Elizabeth Warren acknowledged that sexism in the presidential primary impacted her campaign. \u201cIf you say, yeah, there was sexism in this race, everyone says, whiner. And if you say no, there was no sexism, about a bazillion women think, what planet do you live on?\u201d Warren said. The Massachusetts senator pledged to speak more about sexism in politics moving forward. \u201cI promise you this: I\u2019ll have a lot more to say on that subject later on,\u201d Warren said. Elizabeth Warren expressed pride in being able to vote for herself in Massachusetts\u2019 primary on Tuesady. \u201cI stood in that voting booth, and I looked down at my name on the ballot and thought, \u2018Wow kiddo, you\u2019re not in Oklahoma anymore,\u2019\u201d Warren said. The senator added she was thinking about her late parents and missing them as she cast her ballot. Elizabeth Warren addressed reporters at her Cambridge home, explaining her decision to suspend her presidential campaign. \u201cI will not be running for president in 2020, but I guarantee I will stay in the fight,\u201d Warren said. The Massachusetts senator acknowledged she was disappointed the field has narrowed to two white male candidates (with the exception of Tulsi Gabbard, who has two delegates). \u201cOne of the hardest parts of this is ... all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years,\u201d Warren said. She added that she would not be endorsing another candidate at the moment. \u201cNot today,\u201d Warren said of her potential endorsement. \u201cI need some space around this.\u201d Echoing her campaign manager Roger Lau, Warren said, \u201cI have no regrets at all. This has been the honor of a lifetime.\u201d Joe Biden applauded Elizabeth Warren after she announced her withdrawal from the presidential primary, calling the Massachusetts senator \u201cthe fiercest of fighters for middle class families.\u201d After his strong performance on Super Tuesday, Biden is looking like the frontrunner in the race, and some have speculated about what role Warren could serve in his potential administration. However, the two candidates have a number of policy differences on a wide range of issues, including healthcare and student debt. Tulsi Gabbard, who is now the only woman in the presidential race, has won two delegates from Super Tuesday. For comparison, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders each won hundreds of delegates from California and Texas on Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s remarks to staff announcing her decision to suspend her campaign appear to end on an allusion to Ted Kennedy. \u201cOur work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die,\u201d Warren told her staffers. When Kennedy ended his own presidential campaign in 1980, he said, \u201cThe work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die.\u201d Both Warren and Kennedy, who died in 2009, have represented Massachusetts in the Senate. Bernie Sanders told MSNBC it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to discuss whether Elizabeth Warren could serve as his running mate. The Vermont senator added that he looked forward to talking to Warren about what role she may be able to serve in his potential administration. In her remarks to staffers, Elizabeth Warren celebrated the campaign\u2019s accomplishments and tenacity. \u201c[I]n this campaign, we have been willing to fight, and, when necessary, we left plenty of blood and teeth on the floor,\u201d Warren said. \u201cAnd I can think of one billionaire who has been denied the chance to buy this election.\u201d Warren landed some devastating punches against Mike Bloomberg during the Las Vegas debate, and the billionaire candidate dropped out yesterday, giving Warren bragging rights about outlasting his campaign by a day. Reporters are gathered outside Elizabeth Warren\u2019s home waiting for the Massachusetts senator\u2019s press conference. Warren\u2019s golden retriever Bailey, who has become a fixture on the campaign trail, could be spotted through a window. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign has shared her remarks to staff announcing she is dropping out of the presidential primary: I love you guys too. I want to start with the news. I want all of you to hear it first, and I want you to hear it straight from me: today, I\u2019m suspending our campaign for president. I know how hard all of you have worked. I know how you disrupted your lives to be part of this. I know you have families and loved ones you could have spent more time with. You missed them and they missed you. And I know you have sacrificed to be here. So from the bottom of my heart, thank you, for everything you have poured into this campaign. Warren also shared a story she heard from a supporter as she cast her vote in Massachusetts earlier this week: She said she has two small children, and they have a nightly ritual. After the kids have brushed teeth and read books and gotten that last sip of water and done all the other bedtime routines, they do one last thing before the two little ones go to sleep. Mama leans over them and whispers, \u2018Dream big.\u2019 And the children together reply, \u2018Fight hard.\u2019 Our work continues, the fight goes on, and big dreams never die. Elizabeth Warren is scheduled to hold a press conference in about an hour, when she is expected to announce her withdrawal from the presidential primary. The Massachusetts senator reportedly informed her staff of her decision on a conference call about 30 minutes ago. According to the New York Times, Warren is not expected to endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders at the press conference. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal means there are no major candidates left in the presidential race who are women. (Tulsi Gabbard remains a candidate, but she has so far only won one delegate from American Samoa.) One NBC News reporter noted that Warren\u2019s gender was often cited as a liability by voters who were nervous about nominating a woman after Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 loss: Trump has weighed in on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal, once again using his \u201cPocahontas\u201d insult against the Massachusetts senator and accusing her of costing Bernie Sanders the nomination. Here are some snap verdicts on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s reported withdrawal from the Democratic primary: From a Daily Beast reporter: From a political science professor at George Mason University: From a Washington Post reporter: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s departure from the race followed a series of lackluster finishes in the early contests, including a demoralizing third place finish in her home state of Massachusetts. After surging to the front of the field last summer with an urgent call for \u201cbig structural change\u201d, she began to slide, squeezed from the left by Bernie Sanders and from the center by more moderate alternatives. In the final weeks of her campaign, Warren, 70, attempted to reset her campaign this winter by recasting herself as the \u201cunity candidate\u201d best positioned to unify the Democratic party after a competitive primary, but that argument failed to win over many voters. Elizabeth Warren briefly led national polls this fall, but her numbers dropped as she was scrutinized over the specifics of her Medicare for all plan. As she failed to win states in the past month, a number of Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters called on Warren to drop out in the hope of consolidating the progressive vote. Next week\u2019s primaries will give us our first sense of whether that consolidation has occurred. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s expected withdrawal from the presidential primary leaves only three candidates in the race: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard. Considering Gabbard has only won one delegate so far, this is effectively a two-candidate race between Biden and Sanders. The next test for Biden and Sanders will come on Tuesday, when six states will hold primaries. Elizabeth Warren reportedly intends to drop out of the Democratic presidential primary. The Massachusetts senator was considered one of the frontrunners in the race but has failed to win a single state. The results of Super Tuesday indicated Warren\u2019s support lagged far behind that of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has taken to the Senate floor to criticize Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer for his comments about two conservative Supreme Court justices. McConnell accused Schumer of attempting to \u201cbully our nation\u2019s independent judiciary.\u201d \u201cI fully anticipate our colleague would quickly withdraw his comment and apologize,\u201d McConnell said. Schumer also received a rare rebuke from Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts yesterday over comments he directed at the two Trump-appointed justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, in response to a case focused on abortion access in Louisiana. \u201cI want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou won\u2019t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.\u201d CNN has announced the moderators for the next debate, which will take place in Arizona on March 15. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, along with Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos, will moderate the 11th Democratic debate. Only four candidates remain in the race -- Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard -- and Gabbard is unlikely to qualify. If Warren drops out of the race in the next week, which is possible but not certain at this point, the debate could be a two-candidate event featuring only Biden and Sanders. Trump is once again denying saying somthing he did indeed say, and this time it\u2019s something about coronavirus. Appearing on Sean Hannity\u2019s Fox News show last night, Trump said of coronavirus, \u201cBecause a lot of people will have this and it\u2019s very mild. ... So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. The Senate will vote later today on the $8bn bill aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus, which passed the House yesterday. The bill is expected to easily pass the Senate and advance to Trump\u2019s desk, considering it passed the House on a vote of 415 to 2. The Today show have just posted up the full six-and-a-half minute interview with Joe Biden this morning on their social channels. In the clip Biden talks about winning well on Super Tuesday without an Obama endorsement, and the kind of support he can expect from Mike Bloomberg. He also addresses the security concerns after the incident where his wife Jill Biden and senior adviser Symone Sanders protected him from two protesters who stormed the stage. Biden says it might be time for him to have Secret Service protection. \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s something that has to be considered, the more outrageous some of this becomes. I wasn\u2019t scared for me, I was worried about for Jill.\u201d \u201cThe idea of jumping on a stage is just not permissible,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe last thing we need is anybody hurt.\u201d The Secret Service, by statute, protects the president, the vice president and their families as well as some other senior government officials. It is also authorized to protect major party presidential candidates, an authority granted after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. We can expect the latest developments with the coronavirus outbreak in the US to be pretty high on the agenda today. The death toll from coronavirus climbed to 11 yesterday as California reported its first fatality, and the House of Representatives passed an $8.3bn bill to help fund containment efforts. Hallie Golden has been out and about in Seattle looking at what life is like in the Washington city at the centre of America\u2019s outbreak. The state has seen 39 cases of the virus, with a total of 10 deaths. In the city\u2019s downtown area on Wednesday, residents reported fewer people walking around, while some shops turned to cutting back on staffing in response to slow business. Local grocery stores have seen some of their shelves emptied, as residents look to stock up on essentials. In a QFC (Quality Food Centers) in downtown Kirkland, several shelves where disinfectants, bottled water and bread would normally be were almost bare. Read it here - Life in the Washington city at the center of America\u2019s coronavirus outbreak There\u2019s going to be a House Science, Space, and Technology Committee session on coronavirus this morning, starting at 9am ET. There will be some experts from the Smithsonian and Harvard among the witnesses in a session titled \u201cUnderstanding the spread of infectious diseases and mobilizing innovative solutions\u201d Watch it here - House Science, Space, and Technology Committee coronavirus hearing The AP is reporting another endorsement for Joe Biden - this time Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer, who had not been planning to endorse a 2020 candidate, says Biden \u201chas our backs.\u201d She cited his work with President Barack Obama to add health coverage for millions of people and to rescue two of the Detroit Three automakers, General Motors and Chrysler, from financial ruin. \u201cHe showed up for the people of Michigan when our health care and our auto industry were on the line,\u201d the first-term governor said in a statement released Thursday to the Associated Press. \u201cHe helped us pick ourselves up and get back to work. I know he\u2019ll do the same as president.\u201d Of the six states voting next Tuesday, Michigan is the biggest prize with 125 pledged delegates at stake. \u201cJoe Biden is the candidate we need to defeat Donald Trump in November,\u201d Whitmer said a day after hinting that she might deliver an endorsement because \u201ca lot of things have changed in the last 72 hours.\u201d She said she decided to publicly support a candidate now because \u201cwe need our party to be united\u201d to beat the Republican president. On Twitter, Whitmer confirmed she would be will be joining Biden\u2019s campaign as a co-chair. FiveThirtyEight have an endorsement tracker, which shows just how far out in front Biden is on that score. Most Democrats believe that one of the key things to defeating Donald Trump in November\u2019s election will be getting the black vote out and turning up for whoever is nominated. There is sometimes a tendency to treat that vote as a bit of a monolith, and perhaps take for granted that it will come out and swing behind whoever the Democrats pick. Kenya Evelyn in Washington has been looking at what Super Tuesday\u2019s results tell us about the black vote. Biden\u2019s strength among black communities also made the difference in narrowly winning Texas, where African Americans make up about one-fifth of the Democratic primary electorate and Biden won at least three times more of their votes than Sanders did. \u201cThose young progressives may be motivated for a movement but it\u2019s the older, moderate aunties and uncles who show up\u201d said Antjuan Seawright, a South Carolina-based Democratic strategist, ahead of Biden\u2019s victory there. Read it here - What Super Tuesday revealed about black voters\u2019 power and preferences Donald Trump Jr - who you feel is perhaps on somewhat thin ice when throwing out this kind of accusation - has just been tweeting out a Daily Caller \u2018exclusive\u2019 from yesterday about Hunter Biden. The son of the US president is suggesting that \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the whole Biden family is entity dependent on Joe holding public office?\u201d Slightly away from the election, Associated Press this morning have been running a story about visiting a shop selling unofficial President Donald Trump-themed merchandise in a suburban Philadelphia strip mall. The Trump Store in Bensalem sells t-shirts, hats, beanies, and mugs with the president\u2019s cartoon face - all designed to appeal to his biggest fans Mike Domanico, the shop\u2019s owner, got into the T-shirt business in 2017 and noticed that the 10 or so Trump shirts he offered for sale at car shows sold out fast. He opened a kiosk in a nearby mall before expanding to the store early this year. The shop does about 350 sales a day, with the average customer spending about $60. Among the top sellers is a t-shirt that has the president\u2019s signature in gold above a brick wall and says, Border Wall Construction Co. The phrases \u201cBuild the wall\u201d and \u201cDeport them all\u201d are printed underneath. Other t-shirts feature the Confederate flag and reference slavery, alongside one with a gun and a dig at former president Barack Obama. Mike Catalini reports that Bucks County, where the shop is located, is the kind of swing area that is going to be crucial in the 2020 race. It swung for the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election, but frequently votes Republican for the House. Speaking to people visiting the store, Catalini found Jim Smith, 56, a tractor-trailer driver making his second visit to the shop to stock up on T-shirts. For him, he said, they are a way to grab people\u2019s attention. Smith plans to give them out to people who are sitting on the fence politically. Its a conversation starter, he said. Other visitors to the store included Dave Russell, 75, and Ron Soto, 82, both of Levittown, Pennsylvania. Russell, an Air Force veteran who retired from construction, said he came out to buy a Veterans for Trump shirt to show his support. He said Trump was the only president he remembered keeping promises. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s 53 delegate tally might prove to be the most expensive of all time if you consider how much money the billionaire spent to obtain them. Here\u2019s a video wrap of four issues that hindered his presidential hopes. Sanders has set himself a high bar for wining the nomination, suggesting last night that if he went into a contested convention still in the race, he would concede to Biden if the former vice president was ahead on delegates, even if Biden had failed to amass a majority. Sanders told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow Show \u201cIf Biden walks into the convention, or at the end of the process, has more votes than me, he\u2019s the winner\u201d He sounded a note of caution about any process that involved superdelegates opting for somebody who hadn\u2019t won the popular vote though. \u201cIt would be a real, real disaster for the Democratic party\u201d Sanders said. \u201cPeople would say \u2018the person who won the most votes didn\u2019t get selected.\u2019\u201d Sanders also spoke at length how pleased he is that the rules around superdelegates have been modified since his unsuccessful 2016 campaign. Watch the clip - Sanders agrees: the person with the most delegates at the convention wins Talking about Sanders and 2016, there\u2019s an interesting bit of analysis over here from Zachary Wolf at CNN, which suggests that Sanders is doing better in the race in 2020, but off the back of less support than he had last time around. Read it here - CNN: 2020 Bernie Sanders is losing to 2016 Bernie Sanders Joe Biden has been on the Today show this morning, and there\u2019s a few interesting nuggets in among the questioning from Savannah Guthrie Asked about the missing endorsement from Barack Obama - who has said he won\u2019t endorse anybody at this stage - Biden says: \u201cImagine had he endorsed me and we won as big as we did, you\u2019d all be saying I won because of Barack. I\u2019m winning because of me. I\u2019m gonna earn this on my own.\u201d He was also questioned about what support he could expect from Mike Bloomberg now that the billionaire has pivtoed from running against him to backing Biden. Joe was circumspect about not mentioning the money, saying: \u201cHe talked about my character, he talked about why he supported me, and he talked about why he would be enthusiastic about it. That all by itself is a gigantic help.\u201d You can watch some of the segment here. Rep. Val Demings has been on CNN this morning to endorse Joe Biden. It\u2019s a big deal for Joe given the demographic make-up of the crucial swing state. The former police chief is a member of both the intelligence and judiciary committees and was one of the impeachment managers at Trump\u2019s trial. At the same time, Mayor of New York City Bill de Blasio appears to have come out in favour of Bernie Sanders. Biden easily has more endorsements from Capitol Hill than any other candidate. It is unclear how much effect that has in turning out the popular vote in primaries, but it could certainly come in handy if the race with Sanders stays close and we end up with a contested convention and superdelegates in play. We know that on Super Tuesday California and Texas voters faced hours-long lines, once again calling into question the way that the US organises its elections. Some voters waited several hours or longer to cast their ballots in the vital primaries. And there is still the question of foreign interference in the election process hanging in the air. NPR have an interesting piece this morning rounding-up the election security situation. Philip Ewing writes: Trump and Sanders both say they want no foreign help winning in 2020. What hostile governments wants is less a certain political outcome than \u201cto cause confusion and create doubt in our system\u201d\u2026Federal, state and local officials are coordinating in a way they never have before. Big Tech platforms say they\u2019re working within their own networks to clamp down on disinformation and agitation. And political campaigns are trying to make themselves harder targets for cyberattacks than before. Read it here - NPR: What To Know About The Election Security Situation After Super Tuesday As the US wakes up we can expect a lot of reaction to a decision that has come out of the international criminal court (ICC) in the Netherlands this morning. Senior judges have authorised an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan. It also approved that the scope of the investigation should include CIA black sites operated in Poland, Lithuania, and Romania, where detainees were taken. This is likely to infuriate Donald Trump and his administration. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has previously said that Washington would revoke or deny visas to ICC staff seeking to investigate alleged war crimes and other abuses committed by US forces. The decision today over-turns a previous ruling that there would not be an investigation because the expectation was that those targeted, including the US, Afghan authorities and the Taliban, would not cooperate. Read the full report - Senior ICC judges authorise Afghanistan war crimes inquiry Joe Biden might be enjoying a moment in the sunlight back as the front-runner in the race for the Democrat\u2019s nomination, but his other political problems haven\u2019t gone away. In fact, his dominant display on Super Tuesday might bring them back to the public eye. The Hill are reporting this morning on Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to ramp up their probe into Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian gas company Burisma. \u201cThese are questions that Joe Biden has never adequately answered. And if I were a Democrat primary voter, I would want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final vote\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson. Suggesting a purely political motivation to the move, Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, pushed back forcefully, saying \u201cWe already knew that Donald Trump is terrified of facing Joe Biden \u2014 because he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to spread lies about the vice president on behalf of his reelection campaign.\u201d Read it here - The Hill: As Biden surges, GOP Ukraine probe moves to the forefront Less than a week ago, the conventional wisdom among American pundits and pollsters was that the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders was cruising toward the Democratic presidential nomination. Then came Super Tuesday. Joe Biden won critical states such as Texas, Virginia and North Carolina, and finished first in Massachusetts and Minnesota, where a week ago he was projected to finish fifth. Now much of the talking-head consensus is shifting toward proclaiming Biden the favorite. Do the people who pronounce on politics really know any more about what\u2019s going on than the random loudmouth in the pub or coffee shop? Director of political studies at the Niskanen Center Geoffrey Kabaservice writes for us, asking if there are more shocks ahead in the primary race. You feel that Donald Trump will be slightly disappointed that Mike Bloomberg has dropped out of the race this early. He certainly seemed to enjoy needling the billionaire on Twitter. Here\u2019s a reminder of the speech Bloomberg gave to announce that he was now backing Joe Biden My colleague Ankita Rao wrote yesterday how ultimately it was Elizabeth Warren\u2019s debate performances that effectively ended Bloomberg\u2019s White House hopes It might still be a little too early for obituaries for the Warren campaign, but that isn\u2019t stopping people writing them. The Atlantic have just published five theories about \u201cWhat Happened to Elizabeth Warren?\u201d In the piece, Amy Walter says: For voters who were looking for a liberal, Bernie Sanders\u2013like candidate but wanted a new model\u2014somebody who was not as old, not as male, not as crotchety\u2014[Warren] looked like this new great option. And for other voters, especially for a lot of women who wouldn\u2019t put themselves in the \u201cvery liberal\u201d category, there was an appeal to her because she seemed more unifying than Bernie Sanders. But both of those sides ultimately felt very unsatisfied Read it here - The Atlantic: What Happened to Elizabeth Warren? Good morning. It feels like today there\u2019s finally a bit of a lull in the Democrat campaign after the hectic events of the last few days that have seen Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and now Mike Bloomberg drop out of the race, and Joe Biden re-assert his front-runner status ahead of Bernie Sanders. Six states - Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington - will vote on Tuesday. All eyes will be on Elizabeth Warren in the meantime to see if she will continue to hang on in there. Don\u2019t forget you can always check on the latest state of play with our delegate tracker. Donald Trump has got a couple of appointments coming up. He will meet with secretary of state Mike Pompeo at 11:45am ET. The latest developments in Afghanistan are sure to be on the agenda. Less than 24 hours after the president said he had a \u201cvery good talk\u201d with a top leader, a US military drone targeted the Taliban in retaliation for an uptick in their attacks on Afghan forces. Trump is also due to take part in a Fox News campaigning town hall at 6.30pm ET. The response to coronavirus has stepped up a gear with California declaring a state of emergency over the viral outbreak. Heading up federal efforts to combat the spread, vice president Mike Pence will be in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Education secretary Betsy DeVos will testify to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the annual budget at 10am ET. If her track record is anything to go by, it could be quite a lively session.",

      "bodyText": "Australian households should not expect Kevin Rudd-style cash payments to stimulate the economy in the wake of coronavirus, Mathias Cormann has warned. The finance minister told Sky News on Friday that the government would focus on encouraging businesses to invest in and employ workers, appearing to rule out cash payments to all individuals, although measures to help sections of the population such as pensioners are still on the table. The Morrison government is working on a stimulus package believed to include a new business investment allowance, a boost to pensioners\u2019 income via deeming rates, and measures targeted at affected industries such as tourism. Cormann said the package was expected in \u201cthe next few weeks\u201d, well ahead of the May budget, which is expected to show the budget is in deficit despite the government forecasting a surplus of $5bn as recently as December. The package comes as the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, revealed that the department was forecasting a 0.7% contraction in economic growth in the March quarter, equivalent to lost activity worth about $3.5bn. On Friday Cormann said the government wanted to \u201ckeep businesses in business and keep Australians in their jobs\u201d. \u201cObviously we are going to enter a pretty challenging period, both from a public health and from an economic point of view,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cBut we also know on the other side there will be a strong recovery and we want to be sure we put Australia in the strongest possible position to maximise the recovery.\u201d Cormann said the uncertainty and anxiety caused by the external shock of coronavirus was reducing business investment, although he also conceded investment \u201cneeded to be boosted in any event\u201d.

He said the stimulus would consist of \u201ctargeted, responsible and scaleable\u201d interventions but did not rule out relief for some individuals. But asked if voters should expect a cheque in the mail, Cormann replied: \u201cWe will not be pursuing a cash splash in the reckless Rudd-Gillard fashion, no.\u201d In the wake of the global financial crisis, the Rudd government supplied stimulus in several stages, including $8.7bn for cash payments to pensioners and family tax benefit recipients in October 2018, and $12.7bn for cash payments of up to $900 for most taxpayers in February 2009.

In a new report on Friday, the ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s said Australia was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to a recession and slashed its estimate of growth for the country in 2020 by a full percentage point, from 2.2% to a miserly 1.2%.

Across the Asia-Pacific region, S&amp;P expects the outbreak to carve $211bn from the incomes of households, companies and governments. Roache said a recovery would now be later in the year than S&amp;P previously forecast \u201cdue to a harder hit to China\u2019s economy in the first quarter, viral transmission outside China, and tighter financial conditions\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said it was \u201cgood to see that minister Cormann has finally acknowledged what Labor, industry groups, the Reserve Bank and economists having being saying for months now\u201d. \u201cBusiness investment was weak before the bushfires and coronavirus having gone backwards for three consecutive quarters and has been a significant drag on economic growth.\u201d",

Another meeting is being held about how to prepare vulnerable communities, such as aged care homes and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</p> <p>\u201cThe commonwealth, on executing those agreements will immediately put $100 million down as an advance through the normal distribution mechanism to the states, to ensure that they are in a position to immediately meet those costs,\u201d Morrison said.

Four residents of the home have tested positive, including a 95 year-old woman who died. </p> <p>Health authorities are also contacting the families of 17 school students who visited residents of the home. </p> <p>Earlier in the week a doctor at Ryde hospital tested positive, with authorities trying to contact attendees of a radiology conference he attended.</p> <p>It follows a baby girl in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory being diagnosed with the virus on Thursday. Health authorities have said the aim is now to curb the spread of the disease rather than contain it.</p> <p>Meanwhile 61 staff at Sydney\u2019s Ryde Hospital were placed in self-isolation and 56 patients have been identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister has offered states and territories a national partnership agreement on a joint COVID-19 public health response to split the costs of responding to the outbreak equally. On Friday morning, as doctors and medical representatives from around the country met with Australia\u2019s chief medical officer to learn about a plan, Scott Morrison said he estimated the virus would cost Australia\u2019s health system $1bn, of which the federal government would pay $500m. Another meeting is being held about how to prepare vulnerable communities, such as aged care homes and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. \u201cThe commonwealth, on executing those agreements will immediately put $100 million down as an advance through the normal distribution mechanism to the states, to ensure that they are in a position to immediately meet those costs,\u201d Morrison said. It would cover expenditure incurred from 21 January, he said. Under current hospital arrangements the federal government pays 45% of health costs. Morrison he said while he hoped the cost of preparing for and treating the virus would be less, \u201cit could be more\u201d. \u201cBut we at least have to enter into these arrangements having some sense of the scale of what we\u2019re dealing with here,\u201d he said. News South Wales remains the state most affected by Australia\u2019s 53 cases of coronavirus, with 26 cases in that state. Epping boys high school, with 1,200 pupils, was shut down on Friday after a year 11 student tested positive for coronavirus. The state\u2019s premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said a \u201cvery precautionary approach\u201d had been taken to give officials time to trace who the boy had been in close contact with. On Friday the state\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Kerry Chant said a second health worker at the Dorothy Henderson aged care facility in north Sydney has been diagnosed with the virus. Four residents of the home have tested positive, including a 95 year-old woman who died. Health authorities are also contacting the families of 17 school students who visited residents of the home. Earlier in the week a doctor at Ryde hospital tested positive, with authorities trying to contact attendees of a radiology conference he attended. It follows a baby girl in South Australia and a tourist in the Northern Territory being diagnosed with the virus on Thursday. Health authorities have said the aim is now to curb the spread of the disease rather than contain it. Meanwhile 61 staff at Sydney\u2019s Ryde Hospital were placed in self-isolation and 56 patients have been identified as close or casual contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case. At Liverpool Hospital, in the same city, 23 staff and five patients have been identified as potential close contacts of a confirmed case. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, has warned the worst-case scenario for Australia was \u201cmillions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d but that the country\u2019s public health systems were well prepared if widespread outbreaks occurred. As the federal government announced new travel control measures affecting South Korea, New South Wales authorities said they were also trying to contact 70 doctors who attended a radiology conference with a man diagnosed with the virus. Public health physician Dr Nicola Spurrier said the baby in Adelaide is the daughter of a 40-year-old woman hospitalised in the Flinders Medical Centre with the virus. The woman arrived in Adelaide from Iran via Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. \u201cThe little bub, the child of the mother that is currently in Flinders Medical Centre, has tested positive but I am very pleased to report that the child is well and both mother and baby are doing well in that facility,\u201d Spurrier said. She said a 58-year-old man, from Taiwan, arrived in Adelaide on Tuesday and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital to be isolated on Thursday after also being diagnosed. The Northern Territory\u2019s health department is contact testing all passengers on Qantas flight QF840 which arrived in Darwin at midday on Tuesday after a 52-year-old man tested positive to the virus there. Western Australia recorded its third case of coronavirus and its first case not associated with the Diamond Princess cruise ship \u2013 a woman in her 30s who returned to the state this week after travelling to Iceland and London, and flying home via Dubai. The woman remains in home isolation. Of the cases throughout Australia, 10 have been associated with the Diamond Princess cruise ship, 15 involved direct or indirect travel to Wuhan, China, and 12 involved direct or indirect travel to Iran. Six cases involved travel to other affected countries. The source of infection is unknown in four cases, all in NSW, including the elderly woman who died. Flight details for more confirmed cases have been released by health authorities: a 36-year-old woman from Sydney\u2019s northern beaches returned from Iran on 24 February on Emirates flight EK416 from Dubai and has been admitted to hospital. A 60-year-old woman arrived in Sydney on 3 March on Cebu Pacific flight 5J39 from the Philippines. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said \u201ccontainment is likely to be an unlikely outcome, so we need to work constructively with the community to continue our effort to emphasise to the community that [controlling the virus] is a partnership \u2026 Our community has to be doing everything they can do to support us in defeating what has really become a war in defeating this coronavirus\u201d. However, authorities have said slowing any spread so that the health system is not overwhelmed would be key to Australia\u2019s response. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced on Thursday increased travel restrictions for South Korea as cases in the country approached 6,000. Morrison said people should reconsider travel there. Entry bans remain in place for visitors coming from China and Iran, and citizens and permanent residents returning from those countries are required to self-isolate for 14 days. Murphy, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, said the federal government \u2013 which last week enacted its pandemic preparation plan \u2013 was \u201clooking at scenarios from the most benign through to some millions of people being infected over a period of several weeks\u201d. \u201cWe think our health system is well prepared to cope with that, but we are making sure. Clearly the community has had some concerns about the outbreak in Sydney, the small community outbreak, but this is a very small cluster of cases. There is no other evidence of community transmission anywhere else in Australia.\u201d He added that over the coming weeks there would be extra facilities dedicated to coronavirus testing. \u201cThe labs are coping brilliantly with a load that they have but we will need the private labs if we\u2019re to do more testing as further cases emerge, so that is being finalised and sorted out over the next few days,\u201d he said. The Northern Territory is developing a remote health pandemic plan, due to be released on Monday, to help manage any potential outbreaks of Covid-19 in remote Indigenous communities. One remote community in the APY lands has already contacted minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, wanting to restrict access for outsiders to help protect against the disease, he revealed on the ABC on Thursday evening. NT chief medical officer Dianne Stephens said earlier it was unclear if any Indigenous people from remote communities were on the same plane as the tourist diagnosed with the virus, and it was impossible to determine how many people may have come into contact with the man since his arrival in the NT. Stephens acknowledged the \u201csignificant\u201d logistical problems with posing self-isolation as a response in remote communities where overcrowding in housing is a major issue. \u2022 Lorena Allam and Jack Banister contributed to this report",

      "bodyText": "The demise of AAP has unexpectedly ignited a war of words between media companies over who is to blame. According to News Corp \u2013 one of the major shareholders who actually took the decision to close AAP \u2013 the shuttering of the vital news service is the fault of digital giants Google and Facebook \u2026 and the ABC and Guardian Australia. Wait. What? In the fallout over AAP in the last few days, News Corp has used its significant real estate to attack both media organisations, with articles appearing in the Australian, the Daily Telegraph and other Murdoch titles shifting blame to competitors. A page three story in the Australian on Friday accused Guardian Australia of \u201cgobsmacking hypocrisy\u201d for reporting that, along with the very compelling financial reasons for closing the service, News Corp and Nine told staff they no longer wanted to subsidise a breaking news service for their competitors. Neither News nor Nine have denied making the comments. The AAP chairman, Campbell Reid, fired off a statement after the Guardian report saying it was \u201cone of the very companies that slashed the amount it was prepared to pay for AAP\u201d. A senior executive for News Corp, Reid is also furious with the media union, the MEAA, for questioning News Corp\u2019s motives for suddenly closing the wire service and throwing 600 people into unemployment. \u201c[The Guardian] is one of the organisations whose decisions have contributed to the closure of AAP and it and the [Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance\u2019s] leadership should confront the bigger, tectonic forces our entire industry faces rather than trot out this arrant nonsense,\u201d Reid thundered. Guardian Australia\u2019s editor, Lenore Taylor, who was not given a right of reply by the Oz, says: \u201cWe were offered a discount by AAP when we renegotiated last year because we were using fewer services as we expanded our own reporting teams.\u201d \u201cMr Reid\u2019s statement is based on false premises,\u201d Taylor said on Twitter. \u201cNo one at Guardian Australia has ever suggested the decision to close AAP was made primarily to hurt small media organisations. We have written that it was a commercial decision. We did publish what Mr Reid TOLD staff at AAP \u2013 that as well as commercial considerations, News and Nine felt they were propping up a news wire that helped competitors.\u201d Then there was that other whipping boy, the public broadcaster. An editorial in the Daily Telegraph argued that Aunty\u2019s free content was cutting their lunch. \u201cAdditionally, AAP found itself competing with an ever-expanding ABC, which in defiance of the public good and media viability now dominates a great deal of the online realm through tax-funded content,\u201d editor Ben English editorialised. \u201cThe forthcoming loss of AAP will be a crushing blow to media diversity, brought about by behemoth organisations that care little for a plurality of sources.\u201d Climate of denial We know that News Corp is responsible for much of the climate denial published in the Australian media \u2013 no matter what Rupert Murdoch claimed \u2013 but now we have some hard data to put it in context. First the good news. Reporting on bushfires is now far more likely to mention climate change, a study by Monash University has found. The report from the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub, found that 49% of the media coverage of the recent bushfires mentioned climate change, compared with 5% of reports about Black Saturday in 2009. The researchers analysed 1% of articles between 1 September and 31 January and found only 5% of overall coverage featured climate denialism, down from 21% in 2009. But it was News Corp publications that represented 59% of all the denialist discussion of climate change. The former Fairfax papers, now owned by Nine Entertainment, made up 19% of denialism. The coverage of protests by school children and Extinction Rebellion showed that, of the 2% of articles that criticised the actions of the protesters, a whopping 84% appeared in News Corp. Return to sender The ABC wants the government to reverse its decision to impose an $84m indexation pause, an unlikely outcome with the details of cuts to staff and services due to be unveiled this month and no sign of the government softening. But before the ABC managing director, David Anderson, could make a final plea to parliamentarians on Tuesday, the delicate behind-the-scenes negotiations between the communications minister and the ABC were leaked to the papers \u2013 twice. A letter written by the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, to Anderson appeared in the pages of the Sydney Morning Herald. Fletcher had \u201cstrongly urged\u201d the ABC to consider selling its capital city offices to cope with the $84m budget cut. Anderson addressed the suggestion in Senate estimates later that day, saying the property portfolio had been examined many times and the idea was not new. He also told senators the summer bushfires added an extra $3m in emergency broadcasting costs to the ABC budget at a time when the corporation had to absorb an ongoing annual budget cut of $105.9m. That $105.9m figure represents all the cuts the Coalition has made to Aunty between 2014, when Tony Abbott promised no cuts to the ABC or SBS, and 2022, when the indexation pause ends. The next day the Australian had another leaked letter, this time from Anderson to Fletcher. Anderson said if the government reversed the cuts the corporation would find $10m to fund additional regional services. \u201cIf indexation was restored, combined with savings and efficiencies that the ABC has identified in recent months, the corporation would be in a position to commit an additional investment of up to $10m per annum to employ more journos in regional Australia and generate more content from regions for local and international stories,\u201d the MD wrote. With the defence minister, Linda Reynolds, angrily insisting it was an \u201cindexation pause\u201d and ABC executives saying it was a cut, we can\u2019t see the negotiations being successful. PM hater gets spiked The ABC\u2019s editorial director, Craig McMurtrie, was grilled at estimates about whether there had been any political interference in ABC News in relation to a report about sports rorts and another about a Rural Fire Service volunteer, Paul Parker, who told the prime minister to \u201cget fucked from Nelligen\u201d in a viral news clip. ABC\u2019s Media Watch revealed last month that a news story about Parker was filed for the ABC\u2019s 7pm bulletin but didn\u2019t run. Then the story was slated to run on News Breakfast, only that didn\u2019t run either.

Health authorities and district offices across the country are sending \u201csafety guidance texts\u201d from early morning to late at night, reminding people to wash their hands thoroughly and not to touch their faces with unwashed hands. But for many people, the texts \u2013 while intended as a public health service \u2013 are fuelling social stigma and in some cases, leading to speculation over extra-marital affairs. Much of the criticism centres on messages that trace the movements of people who have recently been diagnosed with the virus. \u201cA woman in her 60s has just tested positive,\u201d reads a typical text, \u201cClick on the link for the places she visited before she was hospitalised,\u201d it adds. Clicking on the link takes the user to the website of a district office that lists the places the patient had visited before testing positive. This avalanche of information has included some embarrassing revelations. One involved a man in his 50s who returned from Wuhan province in China \u2013 where the outbreak started \u2013 with his 30-year-old secretary. Both were infected in the early days of the epidemic. In another case, reported by the BBC, one alert said a man contracted the virus from an instructor during a sexual harassment class. As South Korean media pored over their movements, citizens looked on with a mixture of horror and fascination as their private lives were laid bare, leading to speculation that they were having an affair and that the secretary had undergone plastic surgery. In another text that captured people\u2019s imagination, a woman in her 60s reportedly went to work as normal, attended a wedding and had lunch at a hotel buffet restaurant with friends, despite having been recently hospitalised with injuries she said she had sustained in a car accident. The woman, who then tested positive for Covid-19, was accused by South Korean internet users of committing insurance fraud \u2013 allegations she denied publicly after TV reporters managed to track her down. A man in his 30s who tested positive became the target of online taunts about his sexual behaviour after authorities said in a text alert that they had been unable to track his movements after he arrived at Seoul\u2019s main railway station from the capital\u2019s airport. Since the area near the station is known for prostitution, the man, known only by his case number, was repeatedly accused on online forums of paying for sex.

      "bodyText": "Students and staff at a Sydney private school have been told that anyone who travels overseas will be required to self-isolate for two weeks \u201cregardless of what country they have travelled to\u201d. The principal of Rosebank College, a Catholic school in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, wrote to parents on Thursday saying the school was preparing \u201cfor the possible event of closure\u201d because of the virus, and imposing a blanket ban on anyone who travelled overseas attending classes. Calling the spread of the virus \u201ca significant moment in human history\u201d, principal Tom Galea said that \u201cuntil further notice\u201d any family who travelled overseas would be required to self-isolate for two weeks, regardless of where they had been. \u201cThis includes families who have had someone within the household travel overseas,\u201d Galea said. \u201cFor the sake of consistency, we will be implementing the same requirement for all staff of the College.\u201d Criticised as overkill by some parents, the move comes as the public and private school sectors grapple with the spread of the virus. \u201cThe recent breakouts of the virus around Australia indicate that it is making its way through the community, albeit slowly and randomly,\u201d Galea wrote. \u201cHowever, we do have to be prepared.\u201d On Friday almost 1,200 pupils at Epping boys high school were told to stay home after a 16-year-old student was diagnosed as having the virus on Thursday night. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, acknowledged the decision to close the school was \u201can escalation\u201d of the government\u2019s response to the virus but said the decision to temporarily close the school was \u201ca very precautionary approach\u201d. \u201cThere is no doubt that we are not anywhere near the worst of this,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even hit the winter months.\u201d The number of confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus in Australia has risen to 55. Almost almost half of those are in NSW, which has 25 confirmed cases, up from about nine last week. The state government has yet to say how long the school closure could run for, but staff and students have been told to isolate themselves at the weekend. People who have been in close contact with the student have been told to self-isolate for 14 days. In Victoria, an independent school in Shepparton has instructed 16 students and their families to self-isolate after a number of exchange students caught the same flight as a 40-year-old Tasmanian man who was later diagnosed with coronavirus. In a letter to parents sent on Thursday night, Goulburn Valley Grammar principal Mark Torriero said a number of exchange students and their host families had been asked to self-isolate while the school awaited the test results of two Indonesian students who developed coughs after the flight. Torriero told Melbourne\u2019s Age newspaper that the test results had not yet returned, but that the students and their host families had been asked to self-isolate in an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d. \u201cThey are very happy and willing to support that, because they know it\u2019s in the best interests of our school and the wider community,\u201d he said. At Rosebank, Galea told parents the school was preparing for the possibility of an eventual closure as the spread of the virus continues, saying the school had made a significant investment in online learning in recent years. \u201cIf this was to happen, as in Italy last night, it will happen with little notice and will be effective immediately,\u201d Galea told parents. \u201cFurther detailed information regarding this approach will be forwarded if and when needed. In the meantime, may I suggest that your family confirm that your internet provider and service is reliable enough in the event that it would need to be used for educational purposes during the day. \u201cWhile the level of anxiety in the community is no doubt growing, I believe that this is also a significant moment in human history where humility (a small bug can bring the world to its knees) and unity of purpose reigns, where we may move away from a concentration on differences to a concentration on our shared humanity. We pray for this outcome to occur.\u201d Rosebank College has been contacted for comment.",

      "body": "<p>Christian Santos* remembers staying awake at night, anxiously listening to the sound of his colleague coughing. They were sleeping below deck, in one of the small rooms shared by workers on board the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/17/coronavirus-japan-braces-for-hundreds-more-cases-as-another-china-city-locked-down\">stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship</a>.</p> \n<p>He had spent the previous two weeks serving guests who were confined to their rooms, and watching the miserable failure of disease-control measures on the vessel. Now he knew the coronavirus, which had already transmitted to hundreds of people onboard, had almost certainly entered his own cabin.</p> \n<p>He tried to move rooms, but was told this wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cEvery time he coughed I was afraid,\u201d recalls Santos, who, like many workers interviewed, asked to speak under a pseudonym. The next morning his colleague was taken to hospital for treatment.</p> \n<p>Santos has since tested negative, but as he and other crew remain in quarantine, a separate cruise ship is now being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/coronavirus-san-francisco-cruise-ship-grand-princess\">held off the coast of San Francisco</a> after it was linked to a coronavirus death in California. A further 21 people onboard are reporting possible symptoms. It is not known if guests will be allowed to disembark.</p> \n<p>It is clear, said Santos, that passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess<strong> </strong>should have been evacuated far earlier from the ship, which became a breeding ground for the virus after it was stopped from sailing by the Japanese government. Crew, he added, should not have continued serving, cooking and cleaning while a quarantine was supposed to be underway.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were abused,\u201d said Santos. \u201cCan you imagine? The situation was alarming but they kept us working.\u201d He fears he could still develop the virus, and worries about losing work because of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Concerns were first raised about the ship when a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus on 1 February. Three days later, Japanese authorities stopped the ship from sailing. On 5 February, tighter controls were introduced and the 2,600 guests on board were told not to leave their rooms.</p> \n<p>But these measures, which some have speculated were imposed days too late, only applied to passengers. Crew continued to eat in a large mess hall, share bathroom facilities and go to guests\u2019 rooms. Some departments received protective equipment later than others. Santos says he did not receive a mask until a week after the ship had been stopped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"851b8015226586f4717d0c0cc24cf7f63ed9aa8c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/851b8015226586f4717d0c0cc24cf7f63ed9aa8c/0_0_4836_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship on their balconies at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama, Japan, during the ship\u2019s quarantine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship are seen on their balconies at the Daikoku Pier cruise terminal in Yokohama, Japan, during the ship\u2019s quarantine.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jiji Press/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the time, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital, an infectious disease specialist who visited the ship during the quarantine, described the procedures onboard as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=xjSR_Pdy7PU\">\u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d</a>. In a scathing video posted online, he said he had worked during Ebola and Sars outbreaks and had never worried about getting infected but, after visiting the Diamond Princess, he was afraid of catching coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Crew members described scenes of confusion and chaos, in which there was little separation between the healthy and the sick. \u201cAs a crew you don\u2019t even know who is positive \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with them and you\u2019re going around the ship, eating in the mess together,\u201d said another staff member, James Reyes, who worked in housekeeping.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are the one giving [isolated crew members] everything they need and sorting out their dirty dishes. Then one day you will notice those isolated cabins going empty because they [have tested] positive. Imagine the cross contamination.\u201d</p> \n<p>Six passengers have died as a result of the virus.</p> \n<p>Princess Cruises said in a statement that Japan\u2019s ministry of health was the lead authority \u201cdefining and executing the testing and quarantine protocols for all guests and crew\u201d, and that the ship was legally obliged to follow the country\u2019s public health and medical instructions.</p> \n<p>Japan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that Japan \u201cpresented a criteria of behaviour\u201d to limit infection along with equipment, but that \u201cthe responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with the ship operator\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

He is now in quarantine with Santos, back in the Philippines, home to almost half of the Diamond Princess\u2019s crew. The country is a major source of ship workers globally and depends heavily on remittances. Though most Filipinos are employed through land-based jobs, 330,859 people were at sea as of <a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/177879/ph-seafarers-need-lifeline-or-sink-amid-global-rivals\">the end of 2018</a>. Cruise ship work, thanks to its higher pay and the job\u2019s glamorous reputation, is highly sought after.</p> \n<p>This can leave employees reluctant to speak out when they are being unfairly treated, said Professor Helen Sampson of the seafarers international research centre at Cardiff University. \u201cMost workers are employed on temporary contracts and are fearful of losing their jobs, making them extremely vulnerable to abuse of many kinds.\u201d</p> \n<p>The majority of crew members interviewed said they did not want to give their full name because they feared repercussions from Princess Cruises, or from their recruitment agency, the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (MMC). Some crew and their relatives said they had been discouraged from sharing information about the outbreak by posting online or talking to the media. Princess Cruises said it had not stopped staff from using social media. MMC did not respond to a request for comment.</p> \n<p>Joanna Concepcion, chairperson of Migrante International, a Manila-based group that supported affected crew members, said employees wanted to stop working but felt they had no choice. \u201cIt was almost as if they were forced to pick between their health and safety, and their economic livelihood,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bddb3890afd4034f78b9cfd01bf8585b2ed44b6f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bddb3890afd4034f78b9cfd01bf8585b2ed44b6f/0_0_5547_3698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A crew member at work onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A crew member at work onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Messages given to crew onboard varied. In one department, crew were told in a group meeting that if they did not wish to work they must come forward and write down their names, so that their details could then be provided to human resources \u2013 an announcement perceived by some staff present to be a threat. Elsewhere, staff said they were not informed of any option not to work, and instead found their hours increasing as they were tasked with delivering food and other treats to passengers who had been confined to their rooms. Crew were also given treats and vitamins.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we [had stood down] nobody would deliver food, and [passengers] would not be able to eat,\u201d said one worker, who asked to be referred to by their initials, RCDG. Many guests were old and had underlying health conditions, making them more vulnerable to the virus, RCDG added.</p> \n<p>Photographs shared online show a flood of thank-you letters written by the ship\u2019s guests. Some passengers were frustrated by the quarantine, but most were extremely grateful to the crew, workers said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe sacrificed our health for the benefit of others. Now that the crisis is over, we feel this feeling of pride in ourself, and in what we did,\u201d RCDG said, adding that the captain and department heads were supportive.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Others argue this isn\u2019t a sacrifice crew members should have been asked to make. Relatives fear that Filipinos, who pride themselves on being hardworking, felt obliged to go above and beyond what should have been expected. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer their job. It\u2019s not part of their contract,\u201d said the girlfriend of one man who worked onboard and later tested positive and remains in Japan.</p> \n<p>There is often a culture of soldiering on among crews, added Sampson. The ships provide a unique environment in which diseases can spread, and there has long been concern about the need to minimise the risk of outbreaks. \u201cOn all cruise vessels most crew, other than the very senior ranks, share cabins which are small and which are very unhelpful in regard to infection control,\u201d said Sampson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/28/world-banks-500m-coronavirus-push-too-late-for-poor-countries-experts-say\">World Bank's $500m pandemic scheme accused of 'waiting for people to die'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Across the cruise sector, staff can be more vulnerable to illnesses \u2013 shift patterns can prevent employees from visiting the onboard doctors, and some feel obliged to carry on, especially if they are worried about being sent home. This, in turn, also puts guests at greater risk.</p> \n<p>The lack of agreement over who had ultimate responsibility for staff members on Diamond Princess \u2013 the various companies or the Japan or Philippines government \u2013 shows how \u201ccompletely under-considered\u201d such matters are, added Sampson.</p> \n<p>\u201cPerhaps if anything positive eventually emerges from this global health crisis, it might be that cruise operators review crew working and living conditions, and upgrade these to provide for better physical and mental health, and welfare,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb970097de4a32254ff3abd2f96940c952001b3b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb970097de4a32254ff3abd2f96940c952001b3b/0_0_5554_3703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A port worker runs in front of the Diamond Princess cruise ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A port worker runs in front of the Diamond Princess cruise ship.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>More immediately, cruise operators have cancelled and rescheduled trips, and introduced tighter health screening and staff training in an attempt to reassure passengers. The virus has wreaked havoc across the global tourism sector, with the overall economic cost yet to be seen.</p> \n<p>Workers fear they will incur a loss of income. In 2018, seafarer remittances totalled $6.1bn (\u00a34.7bn). Princess Cruises said staff members have been offered two months\u2019 leave, and will be contracted to another ship.</p> \n<p>Elsie Lavado, whose husband is among those in quarantine in the Philippines, says she just wants her family back together. During the height of the outbreak, she locked herself in her son\u2019s bedroom, praying for the return of her husband and all other people onboard. \u201cThe life of my husband is more important than money,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p><em>* Names of workers have been changed.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Christian Santos* remembers staying awake at night, anxiously listening to the sound of his colleague coughing. They were sleeping below deck, in one of the small rooms shared by workers on board the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. He had spent the previous two weeks serving guests who were confined to their rooms, and watching the miserable failure of disease-control measures on the vessel. Now he knew the coronavirus, which had already transmitted to hundreds of people onboard, had almost certainly entered his own cabin. He tried to move rooms, but was told this wasn\u2019t possible. \u201cEvery time he coughed I was afraid,\u201d recalls Santos, who, like many workers interviewed, asked to speak under a pseudonym. The next morning his colleague was taken to hospital for treatment. Santos has since tested negative, but as he and other crew remain in quarantine, a separate cruise ship is now being held off the coast of San Francisco after it was linked to a coronavirus death in California. A further 21 people onboard are reporting possible symptoms. It is not known if guests will be allowed to disembark. It is clear, said Santos, that passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess should have been evacuated far earlier from the ship, which became a breeding ground for the virus after it was stopped from sailing by the Japanese government. Crew, he added, should not have continued serving, cooking and cleaning while a quarantine was supposed to be underway. \u201cWe were abused,\u201d said Santos. \u201cCan you imagine? The situation was alarming but they kept us working.\u201d He fears he could still develop the virus, and worries about losing work because of the crisis. Concerns were first raised about the ship when a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus on 1 February. Three days later, Japanese authorities stopped the ship from sailing. On 5 February, tighter controls were introduced and the 2,600 guests on board were told not to leave their rooms. But these measures, which some have speculated were imposed days too late, only applied to passengers. Crew continued to eat in a large mess hall, share bathroom facilities and go to guests\u2019 rooms. Some departments received protective equipment later than others. Santos says he did not receive a mask until a week after the ship had been stopped. At the time, Kentaro Iwata of Kobe University Hospital, an infectious disease specialist who visited the ship during the quarantine, described the procedures onboard as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d. In a scathing video posted online, he said he had worked during Ebola and Sars outbreaks and had never worried about getting infected but, after visiting the Diamond Princess, he was afraid of catching coronavirus. Crew members described scenes of confusion and chaos, in which there was little separation between the healthy and the sick. \u201cAs a crew you don\u2019t even know who is positive \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with them and you\u2019re going around the ship, eating in the mess together,\u201d said another staff member, James Reyes, who worked in housekeeping. \u201cWe are the one giving [isolated crew members] everything they need and sorting out their dirty dishes. Then one day you will notice those isolated cabins going empty because they [have tested] positive. Imagine the cross contamination.\u201d Six passengers have died as a result of the virus. Princess Cruises said in a statement that Japan\u2019s ministry of health was the lead authority \u201cdefining and executing the testing and quarantine protocols for all guests and crew\u201d, and that the ship was legally obliged to follow the country\u2019s public health and medical instructions. Japan\u2019s ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement that Japan \u201cpresented a criteria of behaviour\u201d to limit infection along with equipment, but that \u201cthe responsibility for ensuring that the ship can be operated in a manner that provides a safe environment for passengers and crew rests with the ship operator\u201d. Reyes isn\u2019t sure who is to blame. He is now in quarantine with Santos, back in the Philippines, home to almost half of the Diamond Princess\u2019s crew. The country is a major source of ship workers globally and depends heavily on remittances. Though most Filipinos are employed through land-based jobs, 330,859 people were at sea as of the end of 2018. Cruise ship work, thanks to its higher pay and the job\u2019s glamorous reputation, is highly sought after. This can leave employees reluctant to speak out when they are being unfairly treated, said Professor Helen Sampson of the seafarers international research centre at Cardiff University. \u201cMost workers are employed on temporary contracts and are fearful of losing their jobs, making them extremely vulnerable to abuse of many kinds.\u201d The majority of crew members interviewed said they did not want to give their full name because they feared repercussions from Princess Cruises, or from their recruitment agency, the Magsaysay Maritime Corporation (MMC). Some crew and their relatives said they had been discouraged from sharing information about the outbreak by posting online or talking to the media. Princess Cruises said it had not stopped staff from using social media. MMC did not respond to a request for comment. Joanna Concepcion, chairperson of Migrante International, a Manila-based group that supported affected crew members, said employees wanted to stop working but felt they had no choice. \u201cIt was almost as if they were forced to pick between their health and safety, and their economic livelihood,\u201d she said. Messages given to crew onboard varied. In one department, crew were told in a group meeting that if they did not wish to work they must come forward and write down their names, so that their details could then be provided to human resources \u2013 an announcement perceived by some staff present to be a threat. Elsewhere, staff said they were not informed of any option not to work, and instead found their hours increasing as they were tasked with delivering food and other treats to passengers who had been confined to their rooms. Crew were also given treats and vitamins. \u201cIf we [had stood down] nobody would deliver food, and [passengers] would not be able to eat,\u201d said one worker, who asked to be referred to by their initials, RCDG. Many guests were old and had underlying health conditions, making them more vulnerable to the virus, RCDG added. Photographs shared online show a flood of thank-you letters written by the ship\u2019s guests. Some passengers were frustrated by the quarantine, but most were extremely grateful to the crew, workers said. \u201cWe sacrificed our health for the benefit of others. Now that the crisis is over, we feel this feeling of pride in ourself, and in what we did,\u201d RCDG said, adding that the captain and department heads were supportive. Others argue this isn\u2019t a sacrifice crew members should have been asked to make. Relatives fear that Filipinos, who pride themselves on being hardworking, felt obliged to go above and beyond what should have been expected. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer their job. It\u2019s not part of their contract,\u201d said the girlfriend of one man who worked onboard and later tested positive and remains in Japan. There is often a culture of soldiering on among crews, added Sampson. The ships provide a unique environment in which diseases can spread, and there has long been concern about the need to minimise the risk of outbreaks. \u201cOn all cruise vessels most crew, other than the very senior ranks, share cabins which are small and which are very unhelpful in regard to infection control,\u201d said Sampson. Across the cruise sector, staff can be more vulnerable to illnesses \u2013 shift patterns can prevent employees from visiting the onboard doctors, and some feel obliged to carry on, especially if they are worried about being sent home. This, in turn, also puts guests at greater risk. The lack of agreement over who had ultimate responsibility for staff members on Diamond Princess \u2013 the various companies or the Japan or Philippines government \u2013 shows how \u201ccompletely under-considered\u201d such matters are, added Sampson. \u201cPerhaps if anything positive eventually emerges from this global health crisis, it might be that cruise operators review crew working and living conditions, and upgrade these to provide for better physical and mental health, and welfare,\u201d she said. More immediately, cruise operators have cancelled and rescheduled trips, and introduced tighter health screening and staff training in an attempt to reassure passengers. The virus has wreaked havoc across the global tourism sector, with the overall economic cost yet to be seen. Workers fear they will incur a loss of income. In 2018, seafarer remittances totalled $6.1bn (\u00a34.7bn). Princess Cruises said staff members have been offered two months\u2019 leave, and will be contracted to another ship. Elsie Lavado, whose husband is among those in quarantine in the Philippines, says she just wants her family back together. During the height of the outbreak, she locked herself in her son\u2019s bedroom, praying for the return of her husband and all other people onboard. \u201cThe life of my husband is more important than money,\u201d she said. * Names of workers have been changed.",

      "bodyText": "Washed your hands while singing our lord and saviour\u2019s Jolene until she has come and taken your man just because she can, and still been exposed to coronavirus? You\u2019re not alone. If what chief medical officer Brendan Murphy let slip this week is correct, in a worst-case scenario, millions of us could be in the same boat in just a few weeks. If you\u2019ve been coronalerted, but not coronalarmed, you should be prepared for your two-week self-quarantine. If not, don\u2019t worry boo, the Australian government has got you \u2013 producing some interesting advice for how to spend your time in self-isolation. Break out those exercise DVDs, because nothing says depression busting quite like Jane Fonda working out in full make-up, yelling at you to firm and burn. \u201cExercise regularly,\u201d the government advice suggests. \u201cOptions could include exercise DVDs, dancing, floor exercises, yoga, walking around the backyard or using home exercise equipment, such as a stationary bicycle, if you have it.\u201d If Fonda isn\u2019t your jam, or you haven\u2019t owned a DVD player since 2002, there are 4,500 episodes of Aerobics Oz Style to watch as you eat cream cheese out of a tub. Because productivity remains important to the health of the nation\u2019s economy, which is most likely already in negative growth, a true Pandemic Patriot would arrange to work from home, according to the government. But if you\u2019ve put in your nine hours, including working through your lunchbreak, that\u2019s all the time Morrison and Co want you to spend online. \u201cDon\u2019t rely too heavily on the television and technology,\u201d says the advice, obviously constructed sometime around the millennium bug panic. \u201cTreat quarantine as an opportunity to do some of those things you usually never have time for, such as boardgames, craft, drawing and reading.\u201d Because what better time to hone your Monopoly skills than when you can play against yourself and live the boomer dream of becoming your own landlord and banker? Have you considered Scrabble for one? Think of the allowable words! Or you could always take the Niccol\u00f2 di Bernardo dei Machiavelli route of constructing letters and plans to take down your many enemies, or finally work out why macrame is a thing. There\u2019s also eating. Because nothing says self-quarantine like calling up a stranger and asking them to deliver you food to your door, before they leave your potentially contagious self and visit numerous other people and restaurants to then spreadthe bug to their doors too.

I think the timing is appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>The new measures also applied to visitors from China where new cases rose by 143 on Friday. Another 30 deaths were recorded.</p> <p>Across the Pacific, as the outbreak continues to spread in the US, the Trump administration was also forced onto the defensive, amid criticism of its approach to the virus which has now seen the number of cases rise from 15 to 233 in the past week. Twelve people have died, 11 of them in Washington state.</p> <p>The president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/coronavirus-trump-says-risk-to-us-is-very-low-as-australia-enacts-emergency-plan\">who last week claimed that the risk in the US was \u201cvery low\u201d</a> and that the number of cases would be zero in \u201ca few days\u201d, faced questions at an election town hall event in Scranton, Pennsylvania on Thursday night. His vice-president, Mike Pence, who is charge of the US response, admitted that the country did not have enough testing kits to meet demand.</p> <p>Asked if the virus would hurt the economy, Trump admitted for the first time that \u201cit might have an impact\u201d before declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s going to all work out. Everybody has to be calm. We have plans for every single possibility and I think that\u2019s what we have to do. We hope it doesn\u2019t last too long.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s hopes for a quick recovery will be tested again on Friday with futures trading pointing to another day of losses on US stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/us-markets-close-sharply-lower-amid-rollercoaster-over-coronavirus\">lost nearly 1,000 points on Thursday </a>and that sparked another wretched day of trade in Asia on Friday with the Nikkei in Tokyo leading the way down with a drop of more than 3%.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus outbreak has ignited a diplomatic row between Japan and South Korea, after Tokyo said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from the country, which has the highest number of Covid-19 cases outside China. In response, the government in Seoul on Friday called the move \u201cunreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable\u201d, threatening retaliatory measures and accusing Japan of not dealing with its own outbreak properly. From Monday, anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea will be placed in two weeks\u2019 quarantine at government-designated sites, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe said on Thursday, amid criticism of his handling of the outbreak just months before the country is due to host the Olympics. \u201cIt is extremely regrettable Japan took this unreasonable and excessive step without sufficient prior consultation with us, and we strongly urge immediate reconsideration,\u201d the South Korean foreign ministry said in a statement. Seoul said it would summon Japan\u2019s ambassador to explain the measure, hinting that Tokyo had been motivated by politics rather than a desire to contain the spread of the respiratory illness. \u201cWe can\u2019t help but question whether Japan has other motives than containing the outbreak,\u201d the statement said, without elaborating. South Korea\u2019s criticisms found an echo from the World Health Organisation, which said on Thursday night that some countries were not showing \u201cthe level of political commitment\u201d needed to \u201cmatch the level of the threat we all face\u201d. Although he didn\u2019t name any culprits, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters: \u201cThis is not a drill. This epidemic is a threat for every country, rich and poor.\u201d Japan\u2019s chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, defended the decision saying it was \u201cthe result of a comprehensive review of the information available about the situation in other countries and the effects of other measures. I think the timing is appropriate.\u201d The new measures also applied to visitors from China where new cases rose by 143 on Friday. Another 30 deaths were recorded. Across the Pacific, as the outbreak continues to spread in the US, the Trump administration was also forced onto the defensive, amid criticism of its approach to the virus which has now seen the number of cases rise from 15 to 233 in the past week. Twelve people have died, 11 of them in Washington state. The president, who last week claimed that the risk in the US was \u201cvery low\u201d and that the number of cases would be zero in \u201ca few days\u201d, faced questions at an election town hall event in Scranton, Pennsylvania on Thursday night. His vice-president, Mike Pence, who is charge of the US response, admitted that the country did not have enough testing kits to meet demand. Asked if the virus would hurt the economy, Trump admitted for the first time that \u201cit might have an impact\u201d before declaring: \u201cIt\u2019s going to all work out. Everybody has to be calm. We have plans for every single possibility and I think that\u2019s what we have to do. We hope it doesn\u2019t last too long.\u201d Trump\u2019s hopes for a quick recovery will be tested again on Friday with futures trading pointing to another day of losses on US stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 1,000 points on Thursday and that sparked another wretched day of trade in Asia on Friday with the Nikkei in Tokyo leading the way down with a drop of more than 3%. The Vix volatility index, also known as the \u201cfear index\u201d, spiked 24% to 39.62 and investors continued to rush into the safe haven of US government bonds. Japan\u2019s stock market is now at a six-month low and the economy faces a significant hit from the new travel restrictions. Big-spending Chinese visitors are a major plank of Shinzo Abe\u2019s plan to revitalise the economy. But Japan will also have to deal with the diplomatic fallout from South Korea. Seoul\u2019s presidential office said the country was starting to see progress from its \u201ctransparent and active quarantine efforts\u201d to contain the illness, contrasting it with Japan\u2019s approach. \u201cWhile our country is sternly dealing with Covid-19 under its scientific and transparent quarantine system that is highly evaluated by the rest of the world, Japan is losing its faith from the international community because of its ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts,\u201d the office said in a statement, according to Yonhap news agency. South Korea\u2019s national security council said it would consider countermeasures against Tokyo. Those could include designating Japan as a risk area for infectious diseases and placing its own restrictions on travellers from Japan. South Korea has not, though, imposed corresponding measures on more than 90 other countries that have banned or restricted visitors from the country. Japan\u2019s new quarantine requirement would create havoc for thousands of Koreans who had planned to visit Japan, said Park Chul-hyun, a media columnist based in Tokyo who cancelled a three-day trip to Seoul for fear of having to go into quarantine on his return. \u201cThere are thousands of South Koreans arriving in Tokyo on a daily basis and I bet a majority of them have called off their trips,\u201d Park told Agence France-Presse, dismissing the measure as a \u201cpure performance\u201d ahead of the Tokyo Olympics. The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will open as planned on 24 July, but speculation is growing that they will have to be cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Japan\u2019s quarantine move has become the source of added friction between Japan and South Korea, whose relations have long been soured by the legacy of Japan\u2019s 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula, its use of Korean women as wartime sex slaves and rival claims to islands in the Sea of Japan, which Koreans call the East Sea. Last year, tensions stemming from Japan\u2019s use of forced labourers from the Korean peninsula before and during the war led to a trade dispute that also damaged tourism, cultural ties and security cooperation. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 March 2020 because an earlier version said the quarantine measures will come into effect on Saturday.

Albanese said the public deserved answers about who had changed the material after 4 April. \u201cWas it the prime minister? The prime minister\u2019s office? Someone else? \u201cWe know that the prime minister\u2019s office made a change early on the morning at 8:46am on the 11th of April,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Coolangatta. \u201cWho made the further nine additional funding grants, with one removed, later that afternoon during caretaker period? \u201cThe prime minister has to answer these questions and answer them very clearly. You can\u2019t have taxpayer funds being allocated, and changed, and swapped around without knowing who was making those decisions.\u201d Morrison has sought to distance both himself and his office from the controversy, insisting that McKenzie was the sole decision maker and characterising the role of his office as passing on information \u201cbased on\u201d representations from MPs. The Australian National Audit Office told Senate estimates this week the prime minister\u2019s office had requested a last-minute change before the documents were sent to Sports Australia at 8.46am on 11 April, which was the day parliament was prorogued for the 2019 election. But another set of changes were made later that day. Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey told Guardian Australia on Friday that McKenzie\u2019s revelation raised the prospect that somebody else made late changes to grants without legal authority. Twomey, who believes the sports grants are unconstitutional and that McKenzie lacked legal authority to make them, said the latest revelation was \u201cbizarre\u201d because it was not clear who made the changes, if not McKenzie. Twomey told Guardian Australia that even if McKenzie had legal authority, \u201c[if] the minister wasn\u2019t actually making the decision about which of those grants were approved because she made her decision on 4 April and somebody else \u2013 whether it be people in her office or whatever \u2013 made changes, that would be problematic from a legal point of view. \u201cIf you accept the commonwealth\u2019s view that the minister is the decision-maker, either the minister\u2019s staff as her agents made decisions to approve things after [4 April], which means she made that decision \u2026 [or] if they are asserting someone else made the decision, and that it wasn\u2019t legally her decision because they were not her agents, then these actions have been taken unlawfully.\u201d Twomey said McKenzie\u2019s claims she did not make the changes showed the \u201cenormous dysfunction\u201d of the way the government had handled sports and other grants. She renewed her calls for the government to explain the basis of its claim McKenzie had authority to approve the grants. Albanese noted that McKenzie and Phil Gaetjens, the head of Morrison\u2019s department who investigated a breach of ministerial standards in relation to the program, a process that ultimately lead to McKenzie\u2019s resignation, are due to appear before a Senate inquiry into the sports grants. \u201cWe actually just need some straight answers about this scandal,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cWhat we know is \u2026 hardworking volunteers would have spent hundreds of hours of time filling out application forms, thinking there was a level playing field, when in fact, the fix was in. \u201cIt\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 funds. And then there needs to be answers and transparency.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Explosive verdict on kidnapping of princesses Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray, telling you for the last time (this week, at least) that this is the news you could do with reading. Authorities are under pressure to bring to justice the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, after a UK judge found that he orchestrated the abduction of two of his daughters, including one from the streets of Cambridge. The Guardian can reveal the ruling after months of legal action, laying open a family saga spanning 20 years during which the sheikh, 70, organised international kidnappings, imprisoned both Princess Shamsa and another daughter, Princess Latifa, and \u201cdeprived [them] of their liberty\u201d. The sheikh\u2019s actions emerged after his sixth and youngest wife, Princess Haya, 45, fled to London in April 2019 with their two young children. His attempt to return the children to Dubai triggered a legal action in the family courts. The court judgment naming the sheikh, who is a friend of the Queen and one of the UK\u2019s most important horse-racing figures, risks destabilising diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates, a close Gulf ally. The sheikh has denied all allegations against him. * * * Coronavirus latest \u2013 After the UK recorded its first death from coronavirus, in the US Donald Trump has admitted there \u201cmight\u201d be an impact on the economy but said it would pass. The Dow Jones sank 3.6% on Thursday and Mike Pence admitted the country does not have enough testing kits. A diplomatic row has erupted after Japan said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from South Korea \u2013 measures that Seoul branded \u201cunreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable\u201d. China announced 143 new cases on Friday and 30 new deaths, while Italy\u2019s death toll has risen to 148 with 3,858 infections. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has said an epidemic is \u201cinevitable\u201d in France \u2013 there are 423 infections and seven people have died. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, declared a 30-day state of emergency after coronavirus cases were reported in Bethlehem. All the developments throughout the day at our live blog. * * * Catch this \u2013 Sorry \u2026 Our Science Weekly team have launched their first in a special series, Science Weekly Extra, exploring some burning questions with experts on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus. In the first, entitled Covid-19: where in the body does it infect us?, Ian Sample investigates how the virus takes hold and what difference this makes to disease severity and transmissibility. * * * Shaky ceasefire in Syria \u2013 The presidents of Russia and Turkey have declared a ceasefire, which came into force overnight. Escalating fighting in north-western Syria had threatened to put forces from the two countries into direct conflict. At the same time the Turkish military has said it killed 21 Syrian troops after two Turkish soldiers were killed in Idlib earlier. Turkey and Russia are on rival sides. Russia is fighting for the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, while Turkey backs anti-government fighters that Russia and Syria have called \u201cterrorists\u201d. Caught in the middle are Syrians who have taken refuge in Turkey. * * * Warren bows out \u2013 Elizabeth Warren has quit the race for the Democratic presidential nomination but, so far, declined to endorse either Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden, who are now effectively running in a two-horse race. Biden called Warren \u201cthe fiercest of fighters for middle-class families\u201d whose work made \u201ca real difference in people\u2019s lives\u201d. Sanders praised his Senate colleague for running an \u201cextraordinary campaign of ideas\u201d and said the progressive movement \u201cwould not be nearly as strong as it is today\u201d without her leadership. * * * Not space lettuce again! Astronauts on extended missions to the moon and beyond can expect to have greater variety in their diets, with Nasa researchers and the crew of the international space station developing ways to grow food up there. They have already cultivated lettuce, which was found to be as safe, nutritious and palatable as the Earth-grown variety. The menu is now set to be expanded to pak choi, dragoon lettuce, wasabi mustard and red Russian kale, as well as tomatoes and peppers. One hopes they won\u2019t have to resort to the raw materials used by Matt Damon in The Martian \u2026 Today in Focus podcast: A runway failure The appeal court has declared the proposed Heathrow expansion plans illegal and in breach of the UK\u2019s climate change commitments under the Paris agreement. Is this the end of the third runway? And: how our quest for a good night\u2019s sleep is leading to a landfill crisis. Lunchtime read: Expect the worst Threats to humanity, and how we address them, define our time. Why are we still so complacent about facing up to existential risk? \u201cIn science fiction, we sometimes encounter the idea of a pandemic so severe that it could cause the end of civilisation, or even of humanity itself,\u201d writes Toby Ord. \u201cSuch a risk to humanity\u2019s entire future is known as an existential risk. We can say with certainty that the novel coronavirus, named Covid-19, does not pose such a risk. But might the next pandemic?\u201d Sport The decision to postpone England\u2019s Six Nations trip to Italy could end up costing the Rugby Football Union a \u00a35m jackpot, with the tournament organisers on Thursday scrambling to save the championship. Wayne Rooney\u2019s Manchester United reunion was ruined by Odion Ighalo, who scored twice in a 3-0 FA Cup win over Derby, although the former United player still served up flashes of his glorious past. Any ambition Phil Neville\u2019s Lionesses had of asserting their claim to be the biggest rivals to four-time world champions the US took a heavy bruising as they slumped to a 2-0 defeat in their SheBelieves Cup opener. The FA has opened an investigation and contacted Eric Dier for his observations after the Tottenham player went into the stands and confronted a supporter. Rory McIlroy shot a 66, with his caddy calling a bunker shot his \u201cbest of the season\u201d, and finished the first day of the Arnold Palmer Invitational one behind America\u2019s Matt Every. England captain Heather Knight has called for the rules to be changed after England\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup campaign ended without a ball being bowled. Andy Murray remains hopeful of making his comeback at the Miami Open later this month. The FIA has said it could not conclusively prove Ferrari\u2019s engine had been operating outside the rules in 2019. And Hend Zaza, an 11-year-old Syrian table tennis player, is set to become the youngest athlete at this year\u2019s Olympics. Business The Bank of England has drawn up a plan to tackle the coronavirus amid a warning from Goldman Sachs that it could tip Britain into recession. Another rough day is expected on the stock markets after heavy losses on Thursday were followed up with more of the same in Asia overnight. The Nikkei in Tokyo has fallen 3% to a six-month low and the FTSE100 is seen losing 2% at the opening bell. The pound is buying $1.295 and \u20ac1.152. The papers Few of the papers depart from the first UK death of a coronavirus patient as their lead story, and splash headlines are constructed accordingly, including on our own front page. The Times, Express, Metro, Sun, Mirror and the i follow suit. There is a great deal of commonality, too, in the use of pictures of the Sussexes resurfacing at the Endeavour Fund Awards in London. The Times calls it a \u201clast lap\u201d in their royal duties, the Express manages \u201cMeghan an entrance\u201d, the Metro has \u201cI only have eyes for blue\u201d, picking up on the colour of the Duchess\u2019s dress, and the Sun calls it \u201cMarkle sparkle\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The federal government has promised to improve communication to the public and health workers around Covid-19, following doctors expressing their frustration with the level of information they were receiving from officials. A meeting between GPs, primary health workers and state and federal officials on Friday also heard concerns about medication hoarding and shortages of protective gear. Similar issues, including how to replace quarantined medical staff, were raised at an aged care coronavirus forum, as two hospitals and an aged care home in New South Wales grapple with cases of the virus. Addressing the media after the meetings, chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the public should expect to see more coronavirus information \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. \u201cI think that is really an important part of what we can do,\u201d he said. Australian Medical Association president Dr Tony Bartone was in both briefings and said the virus would not be contained, but that holding it off for as long as possible would be critical to how the health system coped. \u201cToday we were given insight into the next steps in primary care and aged care, and while there was a lot of detail there, the plans are still not yet signed off on,\u201d Bartone said. \u201cThe government has some fairly detailed processes in place but they wanted stakeholders to give some strong feedback about what\u2019s missing from those plans. \u201cCommunication, timeliness and consistency of messaging about the virus to doctors and the public was brought up by doctors loud and clear. As was personal protective equipment. There was a deep, deep understanding and acknowledgement by the commonwealth that more needs to be done in both of those spaces.\u201d Murphy led the meetings and holds responsibility for briefing the government and protecting the health workforce and public. Bartone said people should feel confident Murphy was part of managing the coronavirus response. \u201cI know hard he\u2019s been working and he hasn\u2019t had a day off since this virus emerged in January,\u201d Bartone said. \u201cHe has a proven track record.

The Victorian government told the federal government that if there were distribution issues in supplying protective equipment through the primary health networks, then gear should be given directly to the state department of health. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has echoed messages not to panic, with 13 confirmed cases in the state. Fifteen staff from Brisbane\u2019s Mater hospital are in home quarantine after potentially being exposed to the virus. \u201cI think the public can be reassured that we have done this type of planning when it comes to natural disasters, and we are doing exactly that type and kind of planning for a possible outbreak of coronavirus,\u201d Palaszczuk said on Friday.

Trump said he had been \u201call set\u201d to face Biden\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders, whom he called a \u201ccommunist\u201d, until the recent vote. \u201cThen we have this crazy thing that happened on Tuesday, which [Biden] thought was Thursday, but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns and that he was running for the United States Senate. There\u2019s something going on there,\u201d Trump said. Biden \u2013 who did say those things \u2013 has a track record of gaffes, and has turned in bumbling debate performances, but Trump\u2019s line of attack raised the unedifying spectacle of an election focused on two men in their 70s attacking each other\u2019s perceived cognitive decline. Biden did not immediately respond to Trump, who was speaking at the Scranton Cultural Center, on the street where Biden grew up, a mile and a half north-east. The town hall was hosted by the Trump-friendly Fox News but had a more sedate vibe than Trump\u2019s rallies, with many of the crowd wearing button-up shirts and not a single Make American Great Again hat to be seen. Trump, who brushed off questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 suggesting the economy could benefit because Americans may choose not to travel abroad \u2013 has had his own faculties questioned during his presidency. In December, 350 psychiatrists and other mental-health professionals sent a letter to Congress warning that Trump\u2019s mental health was deteriorating. The anonymous government official who penned an op-ed in the New York Times warning about Trump \u2013 and subsequently wrote the book A Warning \u2013 claimed people in Trump\u2019s administration were concerned about him. \u201cNormal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity,\u201d the anonymous author wrote. As Trump spoke, Maryland announced three residents had contracted the coronavirus, the first cases in the state. In the US 12 people have now died, and the government has been criticized for its slow response to the coronavirus, but on Thursday Trump instead suggested he had been given \u201ctremendous marks\u201d for his response. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a great job. We\u2019ve got the highest poll numbers of anybody for this kind of thing,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMike Pence is working 20 hours a day or more on this and really doing a fantastic job.\u201d In fact a Public Policy Polling survey found that 51% of Americans disapprove of the Trump administration\u2019s handing of the epidemic, and 53% of people disagree with Trump\u2019s claim that he has done \u201ca great job\u201d in handling the coronavirus. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.6% on Thursday as the US stock market continued to decline amid fears over the epidemic, but Trump claimed the economic damage could be offset by Americans not traveling abroad. \u201cI have to say, people are now staying in the United States, spending their money in the US \u2013 and I like that,\u201d Trump said. Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016, by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and the state is a key part of his potential path to victory in November. He has held seven rallies in the state since he was elected, including two in the past year, although the nomination of Biden could provide a fillip to Democrats\u2019 chances in Pennsylvania. The exit from the Democratic race over the last week of Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 all of whom subsequently endorsed Biden \u2013 has left the Scranton native in a formidable position in the race to take on Trump. If Biden succeeds, then Thursday provided a rather unsavory glimpse into how that battle could unfold.",

The government provided a regional breakdown of where all the cases are located, after reversing a controversial decision to withhold information about the geographical spread of the disease. That step came after Wednesday\u2019s decision prompted accusations of secrecy and concerns that it would lead to the spread of fake news. Whitty announced the reinstatement of daily location updates and admitted a \u201ccommunication fumble\u201d on the issue. The newly-published details of the geographic spread of cases showed 25 were in London. Two more cases were confirmed in Liverpool. The first West Midlands case was also confirmed by health officials. New figures showed an increase of 30 cases from Wednesday, 25 of whom were in England. A total of 18,083 people in the UK have now been tested. As the move to home treatment took place, Prof Steve Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, said: \u201cIf the symptoms are mild then it\u2019s appropriate for people to be in a home setting rather than a hospital setting.\u201d Asked how the authorities are ensuring that infected patients are staying indoors, Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England\u2019s national infection service said that all were displaying very responsible behaviour. \u201cMany are isolating in their bedroom and only coming out of their room to get food and go back in,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are being very responsible. These people are making very active decision to isolate themselves.\u201d Three new cases were confirmed in Scotland. The country\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said the new Scottish patients are from the Forth valley, Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde, and Grampian areas. All of them tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with others who already had the virus.",

The state\u2019s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said residents were complying with the voluntary self-isolation orders, and there was no cause for broader alarm. \u201cNo one should be panicking, this is another disease that is spreading through our community, as we have with lots of other diseases \u2026 we want to minimise its spread where we can, because we know everyone\u2019s susceptible,\u201d Young said. She said 80% of people infected by Sars-Cov-2 \u2013 the virus that causes Covid-19 \u2013 would be only mildly unwell, to the extent of barely knowing they were sick. Older people, particularly those over 80, and those with chronic conditions, were most vulnerable to the illness. Brisbane\u2019s Prince Charles Hospital opened a fever clinic on Friday afternoon to deal with a spike in the number of people presenting to the hospital with fears they were infected. Schools around the country have been affected by the outbreak. Almost 1,200 students at Epping Boys High School in Sydney\u2019s north were told to stay home after a 16-year-old pupil was diagnosed as having the virus on Thursday night. The infected student\u2019s mother works at Ryde Hospital and was in contact with a doctor who has contracted the virus. And students and staff at Rosebank College, a Catholic school in Sydney\u2019s inner-west, have been told that anyone who travels overseas will be required to self-isolate for two weeks \u201cregardless of what country they have travelled to\u201d. The school\u2019s principal wrote to parents on Thursday saying the school was preparing \u201cfor the possible event of closure\u201d because of the virus, and imposing a blanket ban on anyone who travelled overseas attending classes. Calling the spread of the virus \u201ca significant moment in human history\u201d, principal Tom Galea said that \u201cuntil further notice\u201d any family who travelled overseas would be required to self-isolate for two weeks, regardless of where they had been. \u201cThis includes families who have had someone within the household travel overseas.\u201d With 28 confirmed cases, New South Wales has had more than half of Australia\u2019s 58 Covid-19 infections. The number of infections around the country is expected to increase further and the speed of the virus\u2019s spread is expected to intensify. Two Australians have died. \u201cThere is no doubt that we are not anywhere near the worst of this,\u201d NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even hit the winter months.\u201d Four Australians are onboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, currently off the coast of San Francisco, with more than 2,000 passengers aboard and 45 people have tested for the virus. The Diamond Princess cruise ship, docked off Yokohama, became an incubator for the disease, with hundreds of cases reported among passengers and crew. Australia has prohibited the entry of visitors to Australia coming from the Republic of Korea, China, and Iran. People flying in from Italy will have to undergo advanced screening for the virus before being allowed into the country. Eighty-five countries have been affected worldwide. There have been more than 95,000 confirmed cases, the majority in China, and more than 3350 deaths. with Michael McGowan",

Bristol University is teaching students science-based strategies for living happier lives. And Kazakh female chess players are outperforming men \u2013 and inspiring a chess boom. What we heard Readers were complimentary about our new Europe d\u00e9marche. It certainly resonated with Prof Isabella Lazzarini, who lives in Edinburgh, but works in Italy. Thanks to the Guardian, for your renovated stance towards Europe, as for your engagement for a journalism without fear and without borders. I\u2019m Italian, I live in Edinburgh and work in Italy: since November 2017, I\u2019m also British. In such a multiple \u2013 and sadly divided \u2013 identity, I\u2019m proud of being a Guardian reader. Brian Milne, meanwhile, wrote in from France to explain the effect that our new commitment had on him. I saw something, clicked and followed, read the editorial, joined. There was no question about thinking about it. This decision by the Guardian to have this new site was an inspired moment for me; the choice between yes and yes. While up in Schleswig-Holstein, in northernmost Germany, Andrew Craston was also pleased. Today I am simply writing to you to say a heartfelt thank you for your commitment to Europe and the launch of the dedicated Europe section. The Guardian is my first port of call every morning and I am glad that I can support the Guardian\u2019s free and impartial journalism through my modest partner/membership fee. And finally, Jacques Roos wrote in from France. I am French and a daily reader of the Guardian which I consider the very best news organisation I know of, not only on UK issues but also on worldwide issues. I was and I am terribly upset by Brexit. I am afraid it will loosen relations with many British people despite the fact they were \u201cremainers\u201d. Your decision to be a European news organisation will greatly help to keep these relations alive despite the populist soundbites emanating from British gutter press and some political leaders. It also will allow many European readers of the Guardian but also British readers to keep on benefiting of your analyses and investigations regarding achievements and difficulties of EU. And maybe, it could help so that one day, in the future, the UK would decide to join back this fantastic endeavour of building European Union, far away from its old history of conflicts and wars. Next week: what readers did with their bonus Leap Day. Where was the Upside? In the trees \u2013 in particular the ones our readers singled out as the specimens that changed their lives. Homework time: what do you make of This is Europe? Reply here. Would you like to receive its weekly email? You can do so here. What do you think of the way news media is covering coronavirus?

Hermes, whose 15,000 couriers are normally paid only if they complete a parcel delivery or collection for retailers including John Lewis and Asos, said on Friday it had set aside a \u00a31m support fund. The move follows warnings from trade unions that a lack of sick pay for the more than 1 million gig economy workers could accelerate the spread of the virus, as workers would face financial difficulties if they did not carry on regardless of their or others\u2019 health. Many gig workers are in public, highly mobile roles visiting hundreds of addresses every week delivering parcels and takeaways and carrying passengers in minicabs. DPD UK, another large courier firm that relies on self-employed drivers, said on Tuesday it was not offering sick pay. Deliveroo, which uses self-employed couriers to deliver takeaways, said it was considering offering financial support to affected riders in the UK, as it has done in Hong Kong. Uber, which works with more than 40,000 self-employed minicab drivers in London alone, is in talks with Axa insurance about extending drivers\u2019 sickness cover to include self-isolation that does not involve sickness. The GMB trade union welcomed the move by Hermes. \u201cBy setting up this fund to assist those couriers they are not just protecting people who deliver for them; they are helping to keep the British public safe,\u201d said the national officer Mick Rix. \u201cThis is a very welcome step in the right direction, and all employers across the UK should follow their example.\u201d Self-employed workers are not eligible for statutory sick pay so Wednesday\u2019s announcement from Boris Johnson that workers will be eligible for payments from the first day off work, rather than the fourth, does not help them. The Department for Work and Pensions said welfare benefits including universal credit and employment and support allowance would be available, but these are considered by many to be too slow and cumbersome to apply for to be a viable short-term solution. Hermes couriers are expected to be offered a lump sum for the two-week period of self-isolation being requested by health authorities of people who believe they may have come into contact with the virus. \u201cThis is an extraordinary situation,\u201d said Martijn De Lange, the chief executive of Hermes UK. \u201cWe have taken the decision to help support our couriers financially if they need help and also ensure we are doing everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus.

Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display.

Warhol was a very serious artist with a darkly moral view of the modern world. And he is still teaching us to see ourselves in his mirror. \u2022 Tate Modern, London, 12 March to 6 September.

Piranesi Drawings: Visions of Antiquity For this 18th-century visionary the ruins of ancient Rome were surreal and sublime. The classic and gothic meet in his drawings. \u2022 British Museum, London, until 9 August. Image of the week A rarely seen Canaletto painting of Westminster Abbey has gone on public display for probably the first time in more than two centuries. Since 1792, it has hung in the private living quarters of the dean. It\u2019s the earliest work of art to depict the abbey\u2019s famous west towers, completed in 1745. Planned refurbishment of the deanery and the opening of gallery spaces in 2018 has now allowed the abbey to put one of its jewels on public display. Mainly known for his pictures of Venice, Canaletto lived in England in 1746-55 and painted many London views, the majority of which were bought by George III and remain in the Royal Collection.

Cheparinov was originally defaulted, but the game was replayed on the rest day.

A routine exchange of pieces implies that you place your hand on a surface just vacated by your opponent\u2019s hand. The distance between two opponents seated at the board is likely to be much less than the one metre recommended by Fide, particularly when the players are short of time and reaching across the board to move quickly. Perhaps wearing gloves when playing is an answer, but this makes for clumsiness in writing down your move or moving fast in time pressure.</p> \n<p>Prague already has its first virus cases, and the number may grow before the nine-round team event ends on 14 March. England are medal contenders in the over-50s, and several other British teams are taking part, although some over-65s have withdrawn.

As you know, there is currently an increase in the epidemic of the coronavirus worldwide. The World Health Organization has announced the highest epidemic - red. Many competitions and significant events in the world are canceled or postponed to a later date, based on the development of the situation.</p>\n    <p>\"The International Chess Federation has implemented a number of preventative measures but not all. It was stated that the Chinese players, their coaches and accompanying persons will be quarantined for 14 days in Russia. One of the Chinese chess players [Ding Liren], coaches and the delegation are indeed quarantined. However, the second participant from China [Wang Hao] will not be quarantined and will arrive at the beginning of the tournament from a country where the epidemic of coronavirus is growing every day [Japan].</p>\n    <p>\"In addition, there is no explanation from Fide how the tournament will proceed in the event that any participant or coaches or accompanying persons, journalists, interviewers, arbiters have signs of a cold or influenza, or, God forbid, a coronavirus is determined. Will participants will be quarantined, how much time and steps are needed to analyse and determine the exact presence or absence of the virus?</p>\n    <p>\"The Candidates Tournament is a chess marathon, consisting of 14 rounds over 22 days. How the tournament will develop in the conditions of the global epidemic, what measures will be taken in case of detection of the virus and what measures will be taken in relation to a sick participant, no one explains. Due to the complexity of all these points, I turned to Fide with a proposal to postpone the tournament to a later date. I was refused this offer of mine. In connection with the above, I considered that such conditions can greatly affect the necessary level of concentration and mood required for the maximum level of play in such an important competition as the Candidates Tournament, and a possible health hazard. As a result, I was replaced with another participant.\"</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Britain\u2019s 4NCL (Four Nations Chess League) played its latest matches last weekend at Daventry, where Guildford stretched their unbeaten sequence to 85 matches and eight years.

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus is starting to affect major chess events. Five international Opens have already been cancelled or postponed while Fide, the global chess body, has issued detailed medical advice for the over-50 and over-65 World Senior Teams which have just begun in Prague. Recommendations include avoiding the traditional handshake at the start and end of a game, which acquired the status of an essential courtesy following Wijk aan Zee 2008, where Bulgaria\u2019s Ivan Cheparinov twice refused Nigel Short\u2019s hand. Cheparinov was originally defaulted, but the game was replayed on the rest day. Short won, and commented: \u201cThere is a God, and he is not a Bulgarian.\u201d As many have already pointed out, a handshake is far from the only way you can catch the virus from your opponent. A routine exchange of pieces implies that you place your hand on a surface just vacated by your opponent\u2019s hand. The distance between two opponents seated at the board is likely to be much less than the one metre recommended by Fide, particularly when the players are short of time and reaching across the board to move quickly. Perhaps wearing gloves when playing is an answer, but this makes for clumsiness in writing down your move or moving fast in time pressure. Prague already has its first virus cases, and the number may grow before the nine-round team event ends on 14 March. England are medal contenders in the over-50s, and several other British teams are taking part, although some over-65s have withdrawn. Fide will be hoping that the many participants in their 70s and 80s will emerge safely. Further ahead, the 185-nation team Olympiad due to start in Moscow in August \u2013 with China as defending champions in both the open and women\u2019s events \u2013 must be in doubt, although the event has a resilient history. The second world war broke out in the middle of the 1939 Olympiad, the English team withdrew and went on to become codebreakers at Bletchley Park, while other teams continued although matches between warring nations were declared 2-2 draws without play. Germany won, half a point ahead of Poland. The Bangkok, Vietnam, Sharjah, Reykjavik and \u2013 most significantly \u2013 Dubai Opens, were all scheduled for the next few weeks, The Dubai cancellation could be a portent of possible problems ahead for Magnus Carlsen\u2019s \u20ac2m, 14-game world title defence which has been announced for a 20 December opening as part of the giant six-month Expo 2020 event in the city for which, pre-coronavirus, its organisers were hoping for at least 25 million visitors. In a worst case virus scenario it should still be possible to stage the championship match without on-site spectators. The Carlsen v Fabiano Caruana match in 2018 showed that there was a huge worldwide audience following the games move by move even without a live stream of the players in action. Teimour Radjabov, the World Cup winner from Azerbaijan, withdrew on Friday morning from the eight-man candidates tournament which starts in a week\u2019s time and will decide Carlsen\u2019s next challenger. Radjabov will be replaced by France\u2019s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, who was widely considered to have been unlucky not to qualify earlier.

Guildford\u2019s world team silver medallist Gawain Jones brought off a quick finish as he exploited White\u2019s army crammed in a corner. Guildford\u2019s rivals Manx Liberty have also won all six matches, but the most impressive performance so far has been by Grantham, whose team has no grandmasters and just a few IMs. They have lost only to Manx and are sure to qualify among the eight teams in the championship pool, while it was a Grantham player who brought off the most visual finish of the weekend in the puzzle diagram. 3661 1...Bh2+! wins.

Under Mike Ashley\u2019s ownership Newcastle have been inclined towards offloading older players while they retain some resale value but Steve Bruce has succeeded in emphasising the importance of Ritchie, 30, and Shelvey, 28, in the dressing room as well as on the pitch. \u201cThe nucleus of the team that got Newcastle out of the Championship and is still playing well today is still here, the core group of them, and these two have been instrumental in it,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cWe all know what Ritchie is like, the way he is \u2013 there\u2019s never a dull day \u2013 and Jonjo, on his day, we all know is a very, very talented footballer, so I\u2019m delighted that they\u2019ve committed their future to us. Let\u2019s hope now we can get another two or three others done as well.\u201d Newcastle have also offered another midfielder, 19-year-old Matty Longstaff, a new deal. Talks are ongoing but Bruce\u2019s tone is becoming a little less optimistic when he discusses a player recently watched by Internazionale and Milan and whose contract at his hometown club runs out in June. \u201cWe all know what I think about Matty \u2013 we\u2019re hoping something can get sorted,\u201d said Newcastle\u2019s manager before Saturday\u2019s trip to Southampton. \u201cLet\u2019s hope he wants to stay with us.\u201d Bruce faces arguably the first stern examination of his recently remodelled back four from Danny Ings and his Southampton team-mates, and travelling Newcastle fans have been confronted by a significant logistical challenge following the collapse of Flybe. Hundreds of supporters had booked to fly to Southampton on the airline but must now contemplate rail and road journeys, often involving two overnight stays. Bruce, who trusts his switch from five to four in defence can help banish Newcastle\u2019s lingering relegation fears, has a selection dilemma in attack but is highly unlikely to shift Miguel Almir\u00f3n from his preferred position \u201cin the hole\u201d. The manager suspects that coronavirus makes it \u201cpretty inevitable\u201d that Premier League games will be played behind closed doors this season.",

Turkish military kills 21 Syrian troops despite new ceasefire The Turkish military has killed 21 Syrian troops in retaliation for the deaths of two of its soldiers in Syria\u2019s Idlib province, hours after a ceasefire deal for the region was agreed between the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin. The two major powers have been engaged in hostilities in Idlib, the last remaining opposition stronghold in Syria, where Turkey supports anti-government fighters and Russia is backing the Assad regime. Hostile mood. Turkey is home to some 3.5 million Syrian refugees. When fighting breaks out across the border, they often face the wrath of angry locals, as Bethan McKernan and Hussein Akoush report. UK investigates Dubai ruler for abducting his own daughters A British judge has ruled that the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, orchestrated the abduction of two of his daughters from the streets of the UK \u2013 opening the door to a police investigation of the sheikh, who is a friend of the Queen and an important regional ally to the British government. Princess Shamsa was snatched from Cambridge in 2000 when she was 19. Princess Latifa, then 32, was seized by Indian army commandos in the Indian Ocean and returned to Dubai after fleeing in 2018. Family courts. The sheikh\u2019s sixth wife, Princess Haya, 45, fled to London last April with their two young children. His attempts to return the children to Dubai triggered the legal action in the family courts that has shed fresh light on the past incidents. Cheat sheet Alabama has executed Nathaniel Woods, a man convicted of murder for the 2004 killings of three police officers, despite an outcry from activists and public figures \u2013 and his co-defendant, who admitted guilt and insisted Woods was innocent. Five senior members of the US neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division have been arrested across several states in recent weeks, dealing a major blow to a far-right organisation associated with at least five murders. More than a million women are set to join a protest march in Chile on Sunday, marking International Women\u2019s Day and potentially reigniting the social unrest that has rocked the country since October. Nasa has cultivated space-grown lettuce found to be as safe and healthy as the variety on Earth, expanding astronauts\u2019 hitherto limited diets for a decade when they are expected to travel back to the oon \u2013 and possibly even to Mars. Must-reads Greg Kinnear on Bob Hope: \u2018Times were changing around him\u2019 Greg Kinnear plays Bob Hope in his new film, Misbehaviour, set in 1970 when the entertainer faced women\u2019s liberation movement protests while hosting Miss World. Kinnear was once a TV presenter, too \u2013 but, he tells Ryan Gilbey, Hope was at work in an era which \u201cheld up in today\u2019s light\u2026 does look, uh, slightly off\u201d. Why are we so complacent about existential risks? We can now say with certainty that the coronavirus does not pose an existential threat to humanity. But the next pandemic might. As Toby Ord writes, the more technological progress humanity makes, the greater the danger that we could wipe ourselves out. A Zodiac Killer theory that\u2019s very close to home The Zodiac Killer terrorised the Bay Area in the 1960s and 70s, killing seven and taunting the police and public. Decades later, Gary Stewart believes he has identified the killer: his own birth father. Stewart\u2019s bestselling book has been made into a documentary series, as Adrian Horton explains. The race to save Europe\u2019s secret Amazon Polesia is Europe\u2019s largest wilderness, spread across four countries and home to an extraordinary array of flora and fauna. Once affected by fallout from Chernobyl, Polesia now faces another potential catastrophe: the construction of a new inland shipping route, as Phoebe Weston reports. Opinion The abortion rights case heard by the supreme court this week threatens the end of Roe v Wade, against the will of most Americans. Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, says the stakes for reproductive rights have never been higher. Legal abortion means nothing if only the privileged have access. Together, alongside our reproductive justice partners on the ground, we must fight state by state to protect access where it still exists, and to expand access where we can. Sport Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his long-awaited return to the Golden State Warriors\u2019 line-up, after four months out with a broken hand. The Warriors nonetheless lost to the Toronto Raptors 113-121, sending the latter into the NBA playoffs for a seventh straight season. Hend Zaza, an 11-year-old Syrian table tennis player, is set to become the youngest athlete in competition at this year\u2019s Tokyo Olympics, after winning last week\u2019s West Asia Olympic qualification tournament in Jordan.

We have to see this as our chance, do our best and not worry about what has gone before.\u201d</p> <p>It is fitting to glance back through Clarke\u2019s fascinating journey, a rugged defender for whom missing out on Scotland\u2019s trip to the 1990 World Cup hurt. \u201cI went in the pre-squad in February, to Italy. I was in the 26 or 28 but dropped out of contention between then and the tournament. It was disappointing to be so close.\u201d</p> <p>By 1994, after six caps, Clarke\u2019s Scotland career was over.</p> <p>Clarke was a Chelsea fixture 10 years before the financial revolution at Stamford Bridge, his last appearance a winning one at right-back in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final. Vialli floated the idea of a player-coach role. \u201cThat suggested he was going to bring someone else in to play in my position,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t too happy.\u201d</p> <p>Chelsea would have demanded a fee if Clarke moved to Newcastle with Gullit as a player so he hung up his boots and took a coaching role at St James\u2019 Park. A switch back to Chelsea involved youth-team duties before Jos\u00e9 Mourinho took a shine to Clarke and hired him as his first assistant in England in 2004. \u201cI think he just wanted someone who knew the club, the league,\u201d Clarke says, somewhat bashfully. \u201cRight place, right time.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cJos\u00e9 was a breath of fresh air for the Premier League.

In football you tend to drift away and on to the next job; you bump into someone after two or three years and it\u2019s the same as seeing them yesterday. It\u2019s a little bit like that with Jos\u00e9. We had text messages, eventually that dried up, then he has been away working all around the world. He isn\u2019t going to be that bothered about whether or not I\u2019m keeping in touch. We were really tight knit when we worked together.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke had the chance to remain at Chelsea after Mourinho departed. The appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008 was instead the precursor to Clarke\u2019s second Chelsea exit. \u201cI could have stayed. That would have been the easy option. I wasn\u2019t comfortable at being the perennial No 2. That didn\u2019t fulfil my ambition. I wanted to put myself under pressure.\u201d</p> <p>Still, it took until 2012 for Clarke to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/08/steve-clarke-west-brom-manager\" title=\"\">step into management at West Brom</a> after coaching roles at West Ham and Liverpool. Typically, there was method to that approach. \u201cYou know when you take a manager\u2019s job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge. That\u2019s not to say if the chance had come up earlier I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I knew I was ready.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke took West Brom to their highest Premier League finish and points total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/15/west-bromwich-manager-steve-clarke\" title=\"\">before a \u201cstrange ending\u201d that included </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/dec/15/west-bromwich-manager-steve-clarke\" title=\"\">being placed on gardening leave</a>. \u201cFor the first time in 18 months we lost four in a row and the chairman was obviously nervous. His club, his choice. I can be pleased with my work there.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke took Reading to the FA Cup semi-finals and coached alongside Roberto Di Matteo at Aston Villa. Management might have passed him by before the umpteenth call from Kilmarnock in October 2017. Clarke\u2019s brother Paul played more than 400 times for the club.

I was happy working on my golf and doing a bit of fishing. My wife started nagging that I needed to go and work again. Everything just clicked.\u201d</p> <p>Everything within his control. Clarke made headlines across Britain last February after <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/football/2019/feb/20/kilmarnock-steve-clarke-rangers-scottish-cup-sectarian-abuse\" title=\"\">vehemently criticising sectarian abuse</a> from Rangers supporters during a defeat at Ibrox. A year on he is candid when asked whether the landscape has improved. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has,\u201d he says. \u201cI had been so far out of it and came back \u2013 for me it was very clear.</p> <p>\u201cI always put it on the line as the racism one: if you call someone a black bastard, that\u2019s not good; if you call them a fenian bastard or an orange bastard, that\u2019s all right. What\u2019s the difference? It exists in society but it manifests itself in football grounds. I don\u2019t understand it.</p> <p>\u201cThere was obviously an amount of frustration on the night \u2026 It\u2019s pretty normal that you get an outburst then everything just quietens down, people sweep it under the carpet and it goes away again. That is how they deal with sectarianism here in Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>The Scotland manager\u2019s job should carry a health warning. Alex McLeish used it as a platform to move to Birmingham 13 years ago, but he is the clear exception to an inauspicious rule. Manager after manager has seen prospects reduced as Scotland struggled.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Caption: The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>Caption: The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou could have said that same about Kilmarnock because if I\u2019d gone there and it hadn\u2019t gone particularly well, I probably wouldn\u2019t have got another job,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cSo it\u2019s not really any different here. I\u2019ve gone in with my eyes wide open. I didn\u2019t think this was a job I could turn down.</p> <p>\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, you are looking at a contract until 2022 and hopefully, everything being as it should be, no matter what happens with these games I\u2019ll get the time to build and shape the squad over a number of camps that can get us a qualification.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke has sampled changing attitudes towards international football. \u201cI didn\u2019t earn fortunes but the pinnacle was always to be capped by your country,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think the pinnacle is securing the next contract.\u201d</p> <p>Pending coronavirus developments, Israel\u2019s visit on 25 March should see Hampden Park at, or close to, capacity. \u201cWhen I bump into Scotland supporters they are pretty positive. They just want a little bit of success. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much for them to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Woe betide any fan who believes Israel will offer a free pass to Oslo or Belgrade. \u201cIf I was the Israel manager I\u2019d be looking at how competitive they were against Scotland in their last two games,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cIsrael are dangerous, their front players are top-level. I\u2019ll be delighted if we get through that one.\u201d</p> <p>He might even show it.</p>",

He isn\u2019t going to be that bothered about whether or not I\u2019m keeping in touch. We were really tight knit when we worked together.\u201d Clarke had the chance to remain at Chelsea after Mourinho departed. The appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari in 2008 was instead the precursor to Clarke\u2019s second Chelsea exit. \u201cI could have stayed. That would have been the easy option. I wasn\u2019t comfortable at being the perennial No 2. That didn\u2019t fulfil my ambition. I wanted to put myself under pressure.\u201d Still, it took until 2012 for Clarke to step into management at West Brom after coaching roles at West Ham and Liverpool. Typically, there was method to that approach. \u201cYou know when you take a manager\u2019s job it could be terminal. I was making sure there was enough in the bank to cover that, making sure myself and my family would be all right when I took the plunge. That\u2019s not to say if the chance had come up earlier I wouldn\u2019t have done it. I knew I was ready.\u201d Clarke took West Brom to their highest Premier League finish and points total before a \u201cstrange ending\u201d that included being placed on gardening leave. \u201cFor the first time in 18 months we lost four in a row and the chairman was obviously nervous. His club, his choice. I can be pleased with my work there.\u201d Clarke took Reading to the FA Cup semi-finals and coached alongside Roberto Di Matteo at Aston Villa. Management might have passed him by before the umpteenth call from Kilmarnock in October 2017. Clarke\u2019s brother Paul played more than 400 times for the club. Steve left Scotland \u2013 and St Mirren \u2013 at 23. Clarke was branded a miracle worker at Kilmarnock, dragging them from the perennial threat of relegation to a third-place Scottish Premiership finish in the 2018-19 season. \u201cKilmarnock had been on the phone a few times over the years,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d decided I was finished. I was happy working on my golf and doing a bit of fishing. My wife started nagging that I needed to go and work again. Everything just clicked.\u201d Everything within his control. Clarke made headlines across Britain last February after vehemently criticising sectarian abuse from Rangers supporters during a defeat at Ibrox. A year on he is candid when asked whether the landscape has improved. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has,\u201d he says. \u201cI had been so far out of it and came back \u2013 for me it was very clear. \u201cI always put it on the line as the racism one: if you call someone a black bastard, that\u2019s not good; if you call them a fenian bastard or an orange bastard, that\u2019s all right. What\u2019s the difference? It exists in society but it manifests itself in football grounds. I don\u2019t understand it. \u201cThere was obviously an amount of frustration on the night \u2026 It\u2019s pretty normal that you get an outburst then everything just quietens down, people sweep it under the carpet and it goes away again. That is how they deal with sectarianism here in Scotland.\u201d The Scotland manager\u2019s job should carry a health warning. Alex McLeish used it as a platform to move to Birmingham 13 years ago, but he is the clear exception to an inauspicious rule. Manager after manager has seen prospects reduced as Scotland struggled. \u201cYou could have said that same about Kilmarnock because if I\u2019d gone there and it hadn\u2019t gone particularly well, I probably wouldn\u2019t have got another job,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cSo it\u2019s not really any different here. I\u2019ve gone in with my eyes wide open. I didn\u2019t think this was a job I could turn down. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out, you are looking at a contract until 2022 and hopefully, everything being as it should be, no matter what happens with these games I\u2019ll get the time to build and shape the squad over a number of camps that can get us a qualification.\u201d Clarke has sampled changing attitudes towards international football. \u201cI didn\u2019t earn fortunes but the pinnacle was always to be capped by your country,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I think the pinnacle is securing the next contract.\u201d Pending coronavirus developments, Israel\u2019s visit on 25 March should see Hampden Park at, or close to, capacity. \u201cWhen I bump into Scotland supporters they are pretty positive. They just want a little bit of success. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s too much for them to ask.\u201d Woe betide any fan who believes Israel will offer a free pass to Oslo or Belgrade. \u201cIf I was the Israel manager I\u2019d be looking at how competitive they were against Scotland in their last two games,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cIsrael are dangerous, their front players are top-level. I\u2019ll be delighted if we get through that one.\u201d He might even show it.",

In January the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/17/government-accused-of-covering-up-true-terms-of-flybe-rescue-deal-ryanair-michael-oleary\" title=\"\">extended a lifeline</a> to the beleaguered carrier, but against the backdrop of Covid-19 that package became untenable.</p> <p>Airlines in general have endured severe turbulence in recent years. Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, collapsed in September, triggering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/20/thomas-cook-in-talks-stave-off-collapse-biggest-peacetime-repatriation\" title=\"\">largest peacetime repatriation effort</a> in British history. Now the International Air Transport Association estimates the potential financial cost of coronavirus for airlines to amount to between <a href=\"https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/pr/2020-03-05-01/\" title=\"\">$63bn and $113bn</a> this year. Last month it had pinned that figure at just <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/20/coronavirus-air-travel-demand-set-to-decline-for-first-time-since-2009.html\" title=\"\">$29bn</a>. British Airways, easyJet, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Norwegian Air are just some of those that have already warned about the financial impact of coronavirus. </p> <p>Hotel chains, cafes and restaurants are the next obvious corporate victims. Huge events and conferences, such as the Geneva Motor Show and Basel watch fair, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-28/geneva-car-show-canceled-in-swiss-bid-to-contain-virus-outbreak\" title=\"\">have already been shelved</a>. Facebook\u2019s massive developers\u2019 conference due to take place in May in San Jose, California, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156308/facebook-f8-developer-conference-cancelled-coronavirus-concern-covid-19\" title=\"\">is off, too</a>.

The broadcaster ITV, which gets a big chunk of ad revenue from travel companies, cautioned this week that this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/itv-forecasts-10-drop-in-advertising-revenues-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">could fall by about 10%</a> next month.The editor of a travel publication told me this week that prospects were grim: \u201cThe last thing people want to think about now is getting on a plane,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd advertisers know that trying to convince them otherwise is useless.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s the businesses not grabbing the headlines that might end up proving the most tragic of victims: smaller hotels and hospitality firms, family-run groups with a handful of staff and little slack in the system.<a href=\"https://www.fsb.org.uk/uk-small-business-statistics.html\" title=\"\">Small and medium-sized businesses</a> account for about three fifths of employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector \u2013 and make up 99.9% of the whole business population by number of businesses. They are the backbone of Britain. Flybe\u2019s demise is the tip of the iceberg, but what\u2019s happening below the surface and away from the limelight of the mainstream media could well be devastating.</p> <p>Global stock market indices have suffered their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-knocks-5tn-off-worlds-stock-markets-this-week\" title=\"\">worst drops since the 2008 financial crisis</a> over the last fortnight. What\u2019s also important to remember, though, is that as far as markets are concerned, the higher you\u2019ve climbed, the further you can fall. Late last year, global stock indices were <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets/global-stocks-rally-to-record-highs-gold-gains-idUSKBN1YU0YZ\" title=\"\">hitting record highs</a>. So while the equity tumble looks extremely dramatic, it\u2019s also likely to be symptomatic of an overvalued market. When overvaluation occurs, many investors will use any excuse to sell.</p> <p>So what happens next? Will the Bank of England cut interest rates? The outgoing governor, Mark Carney, this week implied that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/mark-carney-tells-g7-bank-of-england-will-give-necessary-coronavirus-support\" title=\"\">certainly an option</a>. And \u2013 after years of speculating about the extent of the financial impact of Brexit \u2013 will it actually be coronavirus that tips us over the precipice and into a recession? The next few weeks will tell.</p> <p>Ever since the beginning of trade, economies have moved in cycles, pushed and pulled by a rotating array of geopolitical, commercial, social and cultural forces. Occasionally we get what statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb termed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/may/12/society\" title=\"\">black swans</a>\u201d: rare and unpredictable events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations. Even though some sort of pandemic was always going to happen eventually, to my mind the precise circumstances surrounding coronavirus make it such a beast, but in history we\u2019ve overcome worse. This won\u2019t spell the end of humanity and it won\u2019t knock the UK economy out cold.

      "bodyText": "As the infection and death toll from coronavirus continues to creep higher, sending ripples of panic through communities and financial markets, the first high-profile corporate casualties are starting to emerge. Flybe, Europe\u2019s largest independent regional airline, collapsed into administration this week, putting more than 2,000 jobs at risk immediately and imperilling the future of a host of regional airports and local economies. It will take months \u2013 even years \u2013 to gauge the full extent of the fallout. In truth, it wasn\u2019t just coronavirus that brought Flybe down \u2013 but a plunge in travel demand in reaction to the outbreak was the final gust of wind that flattened a precariously balanced house of cards. Intense competition, debilitating taxes and a fares war with regional rival Loganair bruised Flybe even before a massive Brexit-induced slump in the pound dealt a body blow. In January the government extended a lifeline to the beleaguered carrier, but against the backdrop of Covid-19 that package became untenable. Airlines in general have endured severe turbulence in recent years. Thomas Cook, the world\u2019s oldest travel firm, collapsed in September, triggering the largest peacetime repatriation effort in British history. Now the International Air Transport Association estimates the potential financial cost of coronavirus for airlines to amount to between $63bn and $113bn this year. Last month it had pinned that figure at just $29bn. British Airways, easyJet, Virgin Atlantic, Lufthansa and Norwegian Air are just some of those that have already warned about the financial impact of coronavirus. Hotel chains, cafes and restaurants are the next obvious corporate victims. Huge events and conferences, such as the Geneva Motor Show and Basel watch fair, have already been shelved. Facebook\u2019s massive developers\u2019 conference due to take place in May in San Jose, California, is off, too. InterContinental Hotels, which owns Holiday Inn, has been forced to close 170 of its 470 hotels in the critical Chinese market. As of Friday morning, shares in the company had lost a fifth of their value over the last month. A business rule of thumb dictates that when times get tough, advertising budgets are often first on the chopping block. The broadcaster ITV, which gets a big chunk of ad revenue from travel companies, cautioned this week that this could fall by about 10% next month.The editor of a travel publication told me this week that prospects were grim: \u201cThe last thing people want to think about now is getting on a plane,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd advertisers know that trying to convince them otherwise is useless.\u201d But it\u2019s the businesses not grabbing the headlines that might end up proving the most tragic of victims: smaller hotels and hospitality firms, family-run groups with a handful of staff and little slack in the system.Small and medium-sized businesses account for about three fifths of employment and around half of turnover in the UK private sector \u2013 and make up 99.9% of the whole business population by number of businesses. They are the backbone of Britain. Flybe\u2019s demise is the tip of the iceberg, but what\u2019s happening below the surface and away from the limelight of the mainstream media could well be devastating. Global stock market indices have suffered their worst drops since the 2008 financial crisis over the last fortnight. What\u2019s also important to remember, though, is that as far as markets are concerned, the higher you\u2019ve climbed, the further you can fall. Late last year, global stock indices were hitting record highs. So while the equity tumble looks extremely dramatic, it\u2019s also likely to be symptomatic of an overvalued market. When overvaluation occurs, many investors will use any excuse to sell. So what happens next? Will the Bank of England cut interest rates? The outgoing governor, Mark Carney, this week implied that it\u2019s certainly an option. And \u2013 after years of speculating about the extent of the financial impact of Brexit \u2013 will it actually be coronavirus that tips us over the precipice and into a recession? The next few weeks will tell. Ever since the beginning of trade, economies have moved in cycles, pushed and pulled by a rotating array of geopolitical, commercial, social and cultural forces. Occasionally we get what statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb termed \u201cblack swans\u201d: rare and unpredictable events that are beyond the realm of normal expectations. Even though some sort of pandemic was always going to happen eventually, to my mind the precise circumstances surrounding coronavirus make it such a beast, but in history we\u2019ve overcome worse. This won\u2019t spell the end of humanity and it won\u2019t knock the UK economy out cold. Companies may be battered, bruised or \u2013 in Flybe\u2019s case \u2013 broken, but for the majority this, too, will pass. What perhaps won\u2019t pass as easily, is if, in an effort to keep the shop running, a business develops a bad reputation. In an era of leaders parading governance strategies that put profit and purpose on par, this is their opportunity to prove what they\u2019re really made of: honour employees, safeguard their rights, consider their needs and respect their expectations.

Much has been written about the impact of Brexit on education and the arts, but few have been concerned about another industry affected by new immigration rules: the world of canine performance competitions. Crufts, the world\u2019s biggest dog show, held at Birmingham\u2019s NEC Arena, experienced a significant drop in overseas dog entries this year, with organisers blaming the fall on Britain\u2019s recent departure from the EU. There are 19,696 dogs taking part this year, down from 20,395 in 2019. Of those 700 absentees, 63% (440) would have been overseas dogs, which make up 3,171 of those competing over the weekend. As the first agility contests got under way, several rows of seats in the arena stood empty, and stallholders noted the venue\u2019s halls were less busy than usual. The Kennel Club, which organises Crufts, said notification from Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that travel regulations for pets would remain the same during the Brexit transition period was only received after entries had closed on 20 January. A spokesperson said: \u201cCrufts is a British institution with an international feel and is a great celebration of dogs, regardless of where they live. \u201cAs with many areas of British life, the future movement of dogs across the Channel in a post-Brexit world is a concern, and many dog owners \u2013 who needed to enter the Crufts by 20 January \u2013 could have been put off by the uncertainty around pet travel.\u201d This year, 42 overseas countries will take part in the gundog, working and pastoral, terrier and hound, and toy and utility categories, down from a peak of 55 in 2017.

After that, new arrangements for pets to travel around the EU will be made by the government. Annick Provost, 57, a bus driver from Belgium, said if regulations were to be toughened, she could be priced out of the competition. On Saturday, she is heading to Crufts for the 30th time to compete in a breeds competition with her Irish wolfhound Erin. \u201c[After December] we hope they will only ask for a blood test in a recognised lab, then the dog will be fine to come over, but we are not sure.

Although more than 160,000 people are expected to attend the event over the weekend, a Kennel Club spokesperson confirmed ticket sales had been down on usual numbers, and that some ticket holders may not have attended on Thursday because of coronavirus fears. Earlier in the week, the major sponsors, Royal Canin and James Wellbeloved, pulled their staff from Crufts in line with a temporary policy that they should only attend large events if it is \u201cbusiness critical\u201d. Inga Finsell, a spectator from Eastbourne, who has been attending Crufts for more than 40 years, seemed unfazed. \u201cIt\u2019s nice because it\u2019s a lot quieter because people haven\u2019t come.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s largest cinema chain says fears over the spread of coronavirus have not yet significantly impacted ticket sales, despite a 20% fall in its shares over the past two days. Following news on Wednesday that the release of new James Bond film No Time to Die would be pushed back from April to November, Cineworld\u2019s shares fell 13%. A further 7% decline was registered on Thursday as concerns continued to grow, leading to some analysts suggesting that globally there would be a minimum loss of $5bn on the film industry. Meanwhile AMC, the world\u2019s largest cinema chain, has seen a 30% drop in shares over the past fortnight. A spokesperson for Cineworld, which owns multiplexes throughout Europe as well as UK arthouse chain Picturehouse Cinemas, pointed to the fact that most releases remain on track, with studios apparently reluctant to change schedules unless it becomes absolutely necessary. \u201cAdmissions remain high,\u201d Phil Clapp, chief executive of the UK cinema association told the Guardian. \u201cIn line with the advice given by the deputy chief medical officer this week, all sites will remain open,\u201d he said. A similar defiance was demonstrated by the Cannes film festival, which said it remained committed to proceeding as planned in mid-May. On Thursday, the French government extended a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until the end of May. \u201c[These] instructions don\u2019t concern the festival,\u201d a spokesperson said, \u201cas we are never more than 5,000 in one enclosed space. As of today, nothing indicates the festival will not take place.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a confidence thing,\u201d one industry source added. \u201cYou can\u2019t start saying you\u2019re worried. It has to be very on until it\u2019s suddenly very off. In part, that\u2019s just a legal and insurance thing.\u201d More than 12,000 delegates attended Cannes last year, but the largest cinema at the Palais des Festivals seats only 2,300. Invitations to the Cannes lineup press conference in Paris on 16 April were sent out on Friday morning. No mention was made of any uncertainty; instead the invite noted that \u201caccreditations continue at an intensive pace\u201d as requests are up 9% from last year. Cannes regained credibility as a launchpad when three of its 2019 premieres \u2013 Parasite, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire \u2013 performed well during awards season. This followed a couple of underpowered editions for the festival in which its programme was overshadowed by Cannes film festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux\u2019s row with Netflix, whose films he barred from awards eligibility. Pressure on festival directors not to skip a year would therefore be considerable, despite both unsettling government advice and increasing industry precedent. On 4 March, organisers of the Cannes MIPTV content market \u2013 which also takes place in the Palais \u2013 announced they were cancelling this year. Forty of France\u2019s cinemas have been closed and the number of confirmed cases in the Cannes area has reached double figures. More than half of Italy\u2019s cinemas are closed and regulations prohibit people from sitting less than a metre away from each other in public. Mario Lorini, president of ANEC, the national association of exhibitors, has unveiled a system he hopes would comply and enable cinemas to remain open: allowing the booking of every third seat in a row, with empty seats directly in front and behind. Lorini said his team had been \u201cworking round the clock\u201d to try to make the plan viable. On Friday the International Indian Film Academy Awards were postponed because of \u201csensitivity\u201d over the mounting health crisis. Originally due to take place on 27 March, the annual gala is Bollywood\u2019s version of the Oscars. The inaugural Red Sea international film festival in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was cancelled earlier in the week, and increasing numbers of attendants \u2013 including Amazon and Apple \u2013 have withdrawn from the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. SXSW has a significant film sidebar, and is still scheduled to take place for 10 days from 13 March. But it is the mainstream end of the film industry which is likely to be hit hardest by the spread of coronavirus, while smaller films and streaming sites such as Netflix could be set for an unexpected boost. MGM\u2019s decision to delay the release of the Bond film was applauded by many, despite a potential $50m bill to cover logistics \u2013 as well as costs and share falls for the many sponsors whose tie-in campaigns have already begun. Momentum was built by the release of Billie Eilish\u2019s theme song last month, as well as a $4.5m Super Bowl advert, that will be chalked up to long-lead brand awareness. Had MGM stuck to its original date, estimates suggest that there would be a minimum 30% reduction to a global box-office take that was anticipated to top $1bn. In earmarking an alternative window quickly, the studio has bought dominance over a key date in the cinema-going calendar \u2013 No Time to Die opens in the US over Thanksgiving weekend \u2013 while the seven-month hiatus allows time to redraw plans. \u201cThat feels like a safe amount of breathing room,\u201d said a source close to the production. \u201cTentpole movies live or die on large audiences going out of their houses and watching them in cinemas with hundreds of other people. Right now, nobody wants to do that.\u201d \u201cIn China infections seem to have peaked but you can\u2019t see them opening cinemas before June,\u201d said another industry insider, \u201cnor people being keen to go for a while after that. Add three months for the rest of the world and November starts looking very attractive.\u201d Widespread cinema closures across China, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan and South Korea have already done drastic damage to the global box office, with one consulting firm suggesting that the loss during China\u2019s new year holiday alone amounts to around $1bn. Among projected big-hitters yet to be released in China\u2019s 70,000 screens are Dolittle, Sonic the Hedgehog and Oscar contenders such as 1917, Marriage Story, Jojo Rabbit and Little Women. When cinemas do reopen, the backlog will cause further delays and local titles will be prioritised. Bond\u2019s distributors did not directly mention coronavirus in their Wednesday statement, instead saying that the decision had been taken after \u201ccareful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace\u201d. Two-thirds of the money made by Bond movies comes from outside the US, with east Asia increasingly courted by Hollywood producers. Forthcoming blockbusters such as Mulan \u2013 whose $200m budget makes it Disney\u2019s most expensive live-action remake yet \u2013 and the ninth Fast and Furious film are highly reliant on Asian markets for their profits. The Chinese premiere of Mulan was cancelled some weeks ago and updates are anticipated from Disney on any changes to the worldwide launch, which is currently still scheduled for 27 March. Early estimates suggest that Mulan\u2019s US opening weekend may still manage a $90m take, with some crediting coronavirus\u2019s reportedly less dramatic impact on children as one reason that family films may not suffer as much as their adult counterparts. How Mulan fares will have substantial implications for the strategy surrounding Disney\u2019s first blockbuster of the year: Avengers spin-off Black Widow, which is meant to open worldwide at the start of May. Should these films flop, many forecast a domino effect as studios scramble to reschedule tentpole releases. F9, Scooby-Doo movie Scoob!, Wonder Woman 1984 and Netflix\u2019s Eurovision movie are all early summer releases whose release dates look vulnerable. Production disruption is already considerable, with Paramount halting a planned shoot in Venice on Mission: Impossible VII last week citing \u201cconcerns of the crew\u201d. \u201cWho is going to underwrite a movie which goes into production next week?\u201d queried one source. \u201cIf an actor is due on set in say, late March, their agent might well forbid them from working, saying it\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d Nervousness was demonstrated by talent agency CAA on Wednesday when it clamped down on anything other than virtual meetings. The same day, Sony Pictures\u2019 offices in London, Paris and Poland were shut for the remainder of the week after a UK employee was feared to have been exposed to the virus while travelling abroad. Paramount is, however, pressing ahead with the release of the sequel A Quiet Place Part II on 20 March. Just a 10th of the original film\u2019s $340m take came from China; the curious parallels between the plot \u2013 a family self-isolates to try to survive \u2013 perhaps boosting its box office appeal among populations relatively unaffected by illness. Contingency plans for mid-range releases may involve fast-tracking them to streaming services, where there is likely to be a substantial appetite from a captive at-home audience. Water-cooler titles such as Promising Young Woman \u2013 in which Carey Mulligan feigns drunkenness on nights out before taking bloody revenge on men who attempt to take advantage of her \u2013 are thought to be prime candidates for films that could do well online, if a cinema release appears optimistic. However, legacy inertia could make such innovation challenging. \u201cThe ecosystem of release strategies would be really damaged by that kind of thing,\u201d said one source. \u201cEverything is booked and lined up already. I don\u2019t know if that tactic has real financial merit.\u201d The industry\u2019s structural makeup may also prove problematic, with studios and exhibitors prizing competition over collaboration, meaning strategy communication is limited. \u201cIt\u2019s uncharted territory,\u201d said one source, \u201cbut that also means there are lots of opportunities out there if streamers can move quickly.\u201d Representatives for Netflix and Amazon did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment, but a boom in users and dwell time over the coming weeks appears likely. Even long-established studios are seeing silver linings online. Contagion, Steven Soderbergh\u2019s unfortunately prescient 2011 thriller about the global outbreak of a deadly virus, has proved such a viral hit over recent weeks that it\u2019s already Warner Bros\u2019 second-best-performing film of 2020.",

Manchester United can beat City in the derby if they don\u2019t lose it like they did in the Rumbelows Cup, according to Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cFor 15 minutes definitely, our heads went for a spell there \u2026 we\u2019ve learned from that,\u201d he soothed.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>Fiona Bruce has told the Radio Times she has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/fiona-bruce-surprised-at-question-times-level-of-toxicity\">surprised by the toxicity</a> of the Question Time debates. So I can only assume she had never watched the programme when she agreed to take over the presenter\u2019s role from David Dimbleby. For some years now \u2013 not helped by Brexit which still continues to divide the country no matter how much we are told that now is the time for everyone to come together \u2013 Question Time has been a bit of a bear-pit with panels, composed of politicians and professional gobshites, and audiences selected for their capacity to kick lumps out of one another. All of which I am sure is entirely deliberate as it\u2019s the rows that pull in the ratings. QT\u2019s prime aim is to attract viewers and get people mouthing off on Twitter, not stimulate intelligent debate. If anyone ends the hour any better informed, then it\u2019s just an added bonus. A politician not abjectly defending a party line, or a business person or pundit making a nuanced argument are the exception. I\u2019ve never been invited to take part in the programme, but even if I were to be I would turn it down. Partly because I wouldn\u2019t want the stress of being in such a pressured situation \u2013 my anxiety levels are bad enough on the occasions I punish myself by watching it on TV \u2013 but mainly because there are many topics on which I either don\u2019t have a particularly strong opinion or don\u2019t feel sufficiently well-informed to start sounding off. Somehow, I suspect, the producers would be tearing their hair out at a guest whose main contribution was to say, \u201cIt\u2019s complicated\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>On my way in to No 10 for the coronavirus press conference, I was rather surprised to find I was the only journalist keen to take advantage of the hand sanitiser on offer by the door. No one else seemed that bothered, even when I pointed it out to them. I\u2019m guessing this could be a function of age. Most of my colleagues are much younger than me while I, approaching my mid 60s, am in what the Daily Mail rather unkindly called \u201cthe Death Zone\u201d. Last week, I rather prematurely wrote about how \u2013 as a professional hypochondriac \u2013 I wasn\u2019t that bothered about the coronavirus as there many more deadly conditions to worry about. Well, all that\u2019s now changed and I am regularly waking up in the middle of the night after the most disturbing anxiety dreams. Not least because I didn\u2019t find the Downing Street press conference altogether reassuring. While it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/as-chris-whitty-provides-a-dose-of-reality-boris-is-just-an-annoying-distraction\">refreshing to have the experts back in charge</a>, with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t rather he was prime minister instead of Boris? \u2013 and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, in command of their subject, able to communicate clearly and treating the country as adults, the information they had to share of a possible 80% infection rate and a 1% mortality rate over a six-month period wasn\u2019t what many of us of a certain age were hoping to hear. That\u2019s a possible 600,000 deaths. It\u2019s all rather taken the gloss off this coming weekend\u2019s visit from my son and his girlfriend who are on their way back from holiday. Because I\u2019m now worried he will give me a hug and kill me.</p> <h2><strong>Wednesday</strong></h2> <p>We need to talk about Spurs. The season is currently going from bad to worse, with four defeats \u2013 three of them at home \u2013 on the bounce. Nor is it obvious if the team is capable of improvement. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/tottenham-hotspur-norwich-city-fa-cup-fifth-cup-match-report\">FA Cup loss to Norwich</a> marked a new low as no one would easily have identified any of the Spurs\u2019 players as professional footballers. The match ended in a penalty shoot out in which Tottenham contrived to take three of the worst spot kicks ever seen anywhere. The last one was a collector\u2019s item. A gentle pass to the opposition keeper that would have struggled to get over the line. Bizarrely, at the end of the game, the manager, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, spoke of how brilliant the team had been. In which case, I\u2019d hate to seem them when they were a bit rubbish. I\u2019ve had many low points with Spurs over the years \u2013 part of their attraction is their commitment to letting you down \u2013 but I haven\u2019t felt this way about them since the late 90s. I am beyond despair and into indifference. I was surprised to find that I genuinely was neither that surprised at nor that bothered by losing to Norwich. And I\u2019m far from alone. Sometimes boos can be heard after a bad defeat: the only reaction among fans near me when the last penalty was missed was laughter. Spurs have somehow contrived to build one of the best new stadiums in the country, yet simultaneously destroy both the atmosphere in the ground and one of the best teams I\u2019ve watched in years. As so often at Tottenham, money is the thing that talks loudest and the club knows there are suckers like me who can be relied on to renew our season tickets \u2013 prices inevitably going up, as the football gets worse \u2013 just because we always have. The only way my friend Matthew can cope is by losing himself in the virtual world of Championship Manager. Under his guidance, Spurs have just beaten Barcelona, Christian Eriksen is still with the club and is actually trying, and Tanguy Ndombele has played every minute of every game. It may be fantasy, but I \u2013 and 60,000 others \u2013 would much rather be watching Matthew\u2019s Spurs than Mourinho\u2019s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"834512f614b7ed7c0ae1a1cb460dd9b798235523\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/834512f614b7ed7c0ae1a1cb460dd9b798235523/0_0_5091_3394/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat: \u2018Jesus.

After I had spent much of the week enviously eyeing up the hand sanitiser lying around on his desk, my friend Rajeev reached into his bag and brought out another bottle and gave it to me. I was totally overwhelmed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19\">you can\u2019t buy the stuff for love nor money anymore</a>. \u201cI want you to live after all,\u201d he said. The nicest words I\u2019d heard in ages. Everyone I know can talk of little but the coronavirus anymore. From those who repeat at length how they \u201creally, really aren\u2019t that worried about it at all\u201d to people like me who fear they might be living on borrowed time. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve yet heard anyone dolefully singing happy birthday to themselves, but I can report that I\u2019ve never seen such frantic hand washing in the gents toilets in Westminster. The message is clearly getting through now that Boris has been sidelined and the scientific grown-ups are effectively running the country. Whitty was out again before the health select committee to update us on the spread of the virus and plans to contain it. Though he didn\u2019t have much good news to report, he was able to tell committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, there was no point in everyone dressing up in hazmat suits; principally because they are fiendishly difficult to get off and you\u2019re very likely to infect yourself while doing so. Another friend, Kevin, did wonder if Whitty might not have missed a trick. Given that a key part of the advice is for people not to touch their faces \u2013 something most of us do the whole time \u2013 Kevin wondered if we shouldn\u2019t all be wearing the \u201ccone of shame\u201d that dogs are given to stop them scratching themselves. As the outside of the plastic could also ward off aerial droplets, this could stop the virus in its tracks. It would also have a secondary benefit of protecting dogs. One pooch has already been infected by his owner kissing him.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2> <p>I have enough problems trying to deal with my own mental health, but now it seems I should be paying as much attention to Herbert Hound\u2019s. A Finnish study of more than 13,740 mutts published in the journal Scientific Reports has found that nearly three-quarters of pets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/05/dog-breeders-urged-to-act-over-high-levels-of-anxiety-in-pets\">display problematic anxiety-related behaviour</a>. Having checked through the symptoms, Herbie appears to be less disturbed than some. I don\u2019t know if he howls when we\u2019re not there \u2013 though I dare say if I had an Alexa I could find out \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t appear too bothered, as he doesn\u2019t chase his tail or trash the place. Neither is he at all aggressive: quite the reverse in fact. He is completely terrorised by the cats who treat him with contempt. My one area of concern with Herbie is his OCD behaviour, though I rather suspect that could be something he has learned from me. We are both at our happiest when we are doing the same things that we always do. On walks we play the same games with sticks and neither of us ever gets bored of them: precisely because we know how they are going to end. Herbie is also still bewildered that the squirrels he chases can disappear by running up trees. Though that could be because he isn\u2019t that bright. He also likes to sleep in the same place each night: on our bed. Still, I will be doing my best to protect him this weekend by preventing him from watching Crufts on TV. He is a very woke dog and he still hasn\u2019t quite come to terms with me telling him some years ago that cockapoos are no platformed for the elite pedigree competition and only allowed in as a novelty act. So best no one tells him it\u2019s that time of year again.</p> <p><strong>Digested week</strong>: \u201cThe Return of the Experts\u201d</p>",

From those who repeat at length how they \u201creally, really aren\u2019t that worried about it at all\u201d to people like me who fear they might be living on borrowed time. I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve yet heard anyone dolefully singing happy birthday to themselves, but I can report that I\u2019ve never seen such frantic hand washing in the gents toilets in Westminster. The message is clearly getting through now that Boris has been sidelined and the scientific grown-ups are effectively running the country. Whitty was out again before the health select committee to update us on the spread of the virus and plans to contain it. Though he didn\u2019t have much good news to report, he was able to tell committee chair, Jeremy Hunt, there was no point in everyone dressing up in hazmat suits; principally because they are fiendishly difficult to get off and you\u2019re very likely to infect yourself while doing so. Another friend, Kevin, did wonder if Whitty might not have missed a trick. Given that a key part of the advice is for people not to touch their faces \u2013 something most of us do the whole time \u2013 Kevin wondered if we shouldn\u2019t all be wearing the \u201ccone of shame\u201d that dogs are given to stop them scratching themselves. As the outside of the plastic could also ward off aerial droplets, this could stop the virus in its tracks. It would also have a secondary benefit of protecting dogs. One pooch has already been infected by his owner kissing him. Friday I have enough problems trying to deal with my own mental health, but now it seems I should be paying as much attention to Herbert Hound\u2019s. A Finnish study of more than 13,740 mutts published in the journal Scientific Reports has found that nearly three-quarters of pets display problematic anxiety-related behaviour. Having checked through the symptoms, Herbie appears to be less disturbed than some. I don\u2019t know if he howls when we\u2019re not there \u2013 though I dare say if I had an Alexa I could find out \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t appear too bothered, as he doesn\u2019t chase his tail or trash the place. Neither is he at all aggressive: quite the reverse in fact. He is completely terrorised by the cats who treat him with contempt. My one area of concern with Herbie is his OCD behaviour, though I rather suspect that could be something he has learned from me. We are both at our happiest when we are doing the same things that we always do. On walks we play the same games with sticks and neither of us ever gets bored of them: precisely because we know how they are going to end. Herbie is also still bewildered that the squirrels he chases can disappear by running up trees. Though that could be because he isn\u2019t that bright. He also likes to sleep in the same place each night: on our bed. Still, I will be doing my best to protect him this weekend by preventing him from watching Crufts on TV. He is a very woke dog and he still hasn\u2019t quite come to terms with me telling him some years ago that cockapoos are no platformed for the elite pedigree competition and only allowed in as a novelty act. So best no one tells him it\u2019s that time of year again. Digested week: \u201cThe Return of the Experts\u201d",

As Hancock told Thursday\u2019s BBC Question Time audience, he is \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that there won\u2019t be food shortages, and people should not indulge in herd behaviour. I know what you\u2019re thinking: tell me I\u2019m not expected to take a lecture in herd behaviour from this guy? Matt, you might recall, enlivened his brief Tory leadership bid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/aug/29/then-and-now-what-senior-tories-say-about-proroguing-parliament\" title=\"\">by declaring</a>: \u201cA policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.\u201d More than that, he said after the D-day commemorations it would go against \u201ceverything that those men who waded on to those beaches fought and died for. And I will not have it.\u201d But you will, won\u2019t you, Matt. Two months later, he was with all the others, running round the supermarket and sweeping bottles and bottles of prorogation into his trolley. Don\u2019t tell me about the herd, Matt. You are the herd.</p> <p>But what of the man we might class as Matt\u2019s line manager? Imagine if five years ago someone had pitched you this scenario: \u201cIt\u2019s March 2020. A global contagion is under way, and we open as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is outlining his strategy to stave it off: singing Happy Birthday twice while washing your hands.\u201d Oh, come on, you\u2019d have said. Even I can\u2019t suspend my disbelief for this. Stick on the one where Denise Richards is the nuclear physicist. No \u2013 wait. The one where Steven Seagal\u2019s an award-winning Yale professor of archaeology.</p> <p>And yet, We Are Where We Are, as this era\u2019s take on the Keep Calm And Carry On poster might run. As for where Johnson is, the prime minister continues to make only occasional departures from the self-isolation that has characterised his premiership thus far.</p> <p>Johnson mostly hides out in his out-of-town mansion, gives embarrassing performances when he does show his face, and presents as the least serious, most indulged gilded playboy. We\u2019re basically being governed by Batman\u2019s cover story. But in a horrifying twist, the cover story isn\u2019t covering anything. Instead of Boris Wayne having a double life as an extremely skilled and effective force for good \u2026 that\u2019s all there is. What you see is what you get. There is no batcave. There is no state-of-the-art equipment, no matchless martial arts skill, no scientific arsenal. Sorry, guys. I\u2019m trying to locate Boris Johnson\u2019s character attributes, and there\u2019s nothing here. Actually, hang on \u2013 he can make you pregnant. Is that what you\u2019re after?</p> <p>At some level, conscious or subconscious, Johnson seems to believe that is what people are after from him. If you listen regularly to his speeches, it\u2019s striking how many of them seek to entwine our national destiny with his own sense of sexual potency. Johnson is forever offering to do things like \u201cput some lead in the collective pencil\u201d, or fretting that Trident going to sea without missiles would mean \u201cthe whole country\u2019s firing blanks\u201d. He seems convinced there is no problem he couldn\u2019t spaff our way out of, given the opportunity.</p> <p>And so to his radically dwindling opportunities. This week, following the announcement that he has a baby due in June, Johnson let it be known he\u2019d be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/03/boris-johnson-paternity-leave-prime-minister-carrie-symonds\" title=\"\">taking paternity leave</a>. He knows that doesn\u2019t mean leaving after the paternity test, right? </p> <p>Indeed, probably my favourite reaction to the news came from William Cash, son of the paleosceptic MP Bill Cash, who wrote about the happy event in the Mail on Sunday under the headline: \u201cWelcome to the Old Dads Club (and the Third Wives Club!), says proud father William Cash to his contemporary Boris Johnson.\u201d</p> <p>Mm. Got to say that \u201ccontemporary\u201d is obscuring a multitude of sins. After all, the last time Cash wrote in the Mail on Sunday on Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7439103/Society-writer-William-Cash-reveals-Prime-Minister-agreed-let-raise-love-child.html\" title=\"\">he was telling the story </a>of how he tried and failed to bring up one of the prime minister\u2019s secret children for him. We\u2019ll take up the tale as Cash bumps into Johnson at Davos (natch), and hilariously apologises for managing to pull off this paternal switcheroo. \u201cI wanted to marry Helen and bring up your daughter as my own,\u201d Cash tells Johnson. \u201cIt was that simple.\u201d According to this account, Johnson replies: \u201cRight \u2026 er \u2026 got it. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d concludes Cash, \u201cwe walked off in different directions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/mar/05/stand-down-experts-celebrities-coronavirus-crisis\">Stand down, experts: celebrities have got coronavirus covered</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lovely people. Anyway, on to Cash\u2019s latest article, which begins at a recent fundraiser. \u201cI was sitting at a table close to Boris Johnson at last week\u2019s Conservative Winter Ball,\u201d writes Cash. Do get your head round the fact that we live in a country where in the midst of our various shitshows, the prime minister was performing for coins mere feet from some guy who once offered to bring up one of his spare kids. Even if The Jeremy Kyle Show hadn\u2019t been axed, this would be a scenario simply too trashy to air. But on we go. \u201cI have a sense that Boris will enjoy his new life,\u201d judges Cash, a man demonstrably not famed for his judgment.</p> <p>At any rate, it\u2019s all part of the great change of pace for Johnson. Think about it: this was a man who once enjoyed the freedom of one of the great capital cities, with a girl in every postcode, and a life of light work and positively buccaneering irresponsibility. But now? Now 55-year-old Johnson has to go to sleep in the same place every night, with two coppers standing outside his bedroom door and a crying baby in the post. (Don\u2019t write in about the newborn magic; I\u2019ve had three of them.) It\u2019s rather perfect.</p> <p>Workwise, instead of a short column and a long lunch, his intray contains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/boris-johnson-voters-wednesday-budget-prime-minister\" title=\"\">reaping his own Brexit whirlwind</a>, and a likely global pandemic. So, given we have to take our wry smiles where we can these days, this does resemble a form of poetic justice. Half close your eyes, and you could almost swing from not wanting Boris Johnson to be prime minister to wanting him to be prime minister, just like this, for ever and ever and ever.</p> <p>Never mind \u201clevelling up\u201d; he could end up begging to be levelled down to his old life. If not, and in only mildly metaphorical terms, this could yet turn out to be a story about a Midas character who is \u2013 quite agonisingly \u2013 prime ministered to death.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Matt, you might recall, enlivened his brief Tory leadership bid by declaring: \u201cA policy on Brexit to prorogue parliament would mean the end of the Conservative party as a serious party of government.\u201d More than that, he said after the D-day commemorations it would go against \u201ceverything that those men who waded on to those beaches fought and died for. And I will not have it.\u201d But you will, won\u2019t you, Matt. Two months later, he was with all the others, running round the supermarket and sweeping bottles and bottles of prorogation into his trolley. Don\u2019t tell me about the herd, Matt. You are the herd. But what of the man we might class as Matt\u2019s line manager? Imagine if five years ago someone had pitched you this scenario: \u201cIt\u2019s March 2020. A global contagion is under way, and we open as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is outlining his strategy to stave it off: singing Happy Birthday twice while washing your hands.\u201d Oh, come on, you\u2019d have said. Even I can\u2019t suspend my disbelief for this. Stick on the one where Denise Richards is the nuclear physicist. No \u2013 wait. The one where Steven Seagal\u2019s an award-winning Yale professor of archaeology. And yet, We Are Where We Are, as this era\u2019s take on the Keep Calm And Carry On poster might run. As for where Johnson is, the prime minister continues to make only occasional departures from the self-isolation that has characterised his premiership thus far. Johnson mostly hides out in his out-of-town mansion, gives embarrassing performances when he does show his face, and presents as the least serious, most indulged gilded playboy. We\u2019re basically being governed by Batman\u2019s cover story. But in a horrifying twist, the cover story isn\u2019t covering anything. Instead of Boris Wayne having a double life as an extremely skilled and effective force for good \u2026 that\u2019s all there is. What you see is what you get. There is no batcave. There is no state-of-the-art equipment, no matchless martial arts skill, no scientific arsenal. Sorry, guys. I\u2019m trying to locate Boris Johnson\u2019s character attributes, and there\u2019s nothing here. Actually, hang on \u2013 he can make you pregnant. Is that what you\u2019re after? At some level, conscious or subconscious, Johnson seems to believe that is what people are after from him. If you listen regularly to his speeches, it\u2019s striking how many of them seek to entwine our national destiny with his own sense of sexual potency. Johnson is forever offering to do things like \u201cput some lead in the collective pencil\u201d, or fretting that Trident going to sea without missiles would mean \u201cthe whole country\u2019s firing blanks\u201d. He seems convinced there is no problem he couldn\u2019t spaff our way out of, given the opportunity. And so to his radically dwindling opportunities. This week, following the announcement that he has a baby due in June, Johnson let it be known he\u2019d be taking paternity leave. He knows that doesn\u2019t mean leaving after the paternity test, right? Indeed, probably my favourite reaction to the news came from William Cash, son of the paleosceptic MP Bill Cash, who wrote about the happy event in the Mail on Sunday under the headline: \u201cWelcome to the Old Dads Club (and the Third Wives Club!), says proud father William Cash to his contemporary Boris Johnson.\u201d Mm. Got to say that \u201ccontemporary\u201d is obscuring a multitude of sins. After all, the last time Cash wrote in the Mail on Sunday on Johnson, he was telling the story of how he tried and failed to bring up one of the prime minister\u2019s secret children for him. We\u2019ll take up the tale as Cash bumps into Johnson at Davos (natch), and hilariously apologises for managing to pull off this paternal switcheroo. \u201cI wanted to marry Helen and bring up your daughter as my own,\u201d Cash tells Johnson. \u201cIt was that simple.\u201d According to this account, Johnson replies: \u201cRight \u2026 er \u2026 got it. Thanks for letting me know.\u201d \u201cAnd then,\u201d concludes Cash, \u201cwe walked off in different directions.\u201d Lovely people. Anyway, on to Cash\u2019s latest article, which begins at a recent fundraiser. \u201cI was sitting at a table close to Boris Johnson at last week\u2019s Conservative Winter Ball,\u201d writes Cash. Do get your head round the fact that we live in a country where in the midst of our various shitshows, the prime minister was performing for coins mere feet from some guy who once offered to bring up one of his spare kids. Even if The Jeremy Kyle Show hadn\u2019t been axed, this would be a scenario simply too trashy to air. But on we go. \u201cI have a sense that Boris will enjoy his new life,\u201d judges Cash, a man demonstrably not famed for his judgment. At any rate, it\u2019s all part of the great change of pace for Johnson. Think about it: this was a man who once enjoyed the freedom of one of the great capital cities, with a girl in every postcode, and a life of light work and positively buccaneering irresponsibility. But now? Now 55-year-old Johnson has to go to sleep in the same place every night, with two coppers standing outside his bedroom door and a crying baby in the post. (Don\u2019t write in about the newborn magic; I\u2019ve had three of them.) It\u2019s rather perfect. Workwise, instead of a short column and a long lunch, his intray contains reaping his own Brexit whirlwind, and a likely global pandemic. So, given we have to take our wry smiles where we can these days, this does resemble a form of poetic justice. Half close your eyes, and you could almost swing from not wanting Boris Johnson to be prime minister to wanting him to be prime minister, just like this, for ever and ever and ever. Never mind \u201clevelling up\u201d; he could end up begging to be levelled down to his old life. If not, and in only mildly metaphorical terms, this could yet turn out to be a story about a Midas character who is \u2013 quite agonisingly \u2013 prime ministered to death. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

On Thursday, she paid a low-key visit to a hologram exhibit at the National Theatre, as well as a comprehensive school in Dagenham, east London on Friday. On Sunday she will mark International Women\u2019s Day. Meanwhile, Harry joined the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton to open a museum at the Silverstone circuit, and met staff at his Invictus charity, to which he remains committed. On Saturday the couple will attend the Mountbatten Festival of Music at the Royal Albert Hall. It will be Harry\u2019s final engagement as Captain General of the Royal Marines, the highest rank of his honorary military titles, which he must now relinquish under terms agreed with the Queen. Agreeing to sever his official military ties will have been painful for Harry, who spent 10 years in the army, and who on Thursday, told veterans he was \u201cdeeply proud to have served alongside you as Capt Wales\u201d. No replacements will appointed to these roles in the 12 months before the couple\u2019s new status is reviewed. \u201cNothing is final,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt was intentionally not binary \u2026 Because this is the great unknown. And, the family wants the best for them.\u201d This was the message the Queen conveyed to her grandson over a private lunch at Windsor Castle last Sunday. The lunch, at Harry\u2019s request, was their first meeting since the Sandringham summit in January, where senior royals thrashed out details of the couple\u2019s new financially independent role. But they have spoken regularly on the phone. \u201cThe Queen has left the door wide open. It\u2019s almost as if she has seen that there is a good chance that their schemes won\u2019t work,\u201d said the royal historian and author Hugo Vickers. The couple are expected to return to Canada, where they left their 10-month-old baby son Archie, shortly after Monday\u2019s service. They will soon announce details of new non-profit organisations. Though they will no longer be official working royals, this is not the last time they will be seen in the UK. They are said to be \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to serving their patronages, which would involve travel to the UK and the Commonwealth, though immediate plans may be affected by restrictions due to coronavirus, it is said. Pictures of Harry, sixth in line to the throne, and Meghan seated behind William and Kate will dominate British media on Monday. \u201cBy virtue of being in the second row, it points out [Harry] is no longer third in line, as he was for quite some time,\u201d said Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine. \u201cHe will go further down the pecking order, as [William and Kate\u2019s children] George, Charlotte and Louis grow up and have children of their own. And, rather than let time and Mother Nature play their parts, they have speeded up the process, by stepping back, as they are perfectly entitled to do so. \u201cAs far as the Prince of Wales is concerned, he must be pretty devastated by all this,\u201d Little added. Aside from his feelings as a father, Harry and Meghan were a key part of Charles\u2019s plans for a slimmed-down monarchy. \u201cI do think he must be very upset.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The number of people buying travel insurance rose sharply last month, despite the fact that most policies won\u2019t pay out if people cancel due to concerns around coronavirus. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.abi.org.uk/products-and-issues/topics-and-issues/coronavirus-qa/\">According to the Association of British Insurers</a>, cancellations will only be covered if the Foreign Office (FCO) advice changes to all but essential travel to a destination after booking. However, with growing concerns about coronavirus and uncertainty over whether the FCO may widen its advice to include additional countries or regions, insurance providers saw a surge in the sales of policies in February. Many of these policies are for trips much later in the year, as people rush to secure cover instead of leaving it to the last minute, which insurers say is often the case.</p> <p>In February the Post Office saw a year on year rise in sales of policies of 168%, and CoverForYou saw a 150% increase, while comparison site TravelSupermarket said traffic to its insurance pages increased by 85% for the week of 24 February compared to the previous week.</p> <p>Enquiries from existing customers relating to coronavirus have also increased.

      "bodyText": "The number of people buying travel insurance rose sharply last month, despite the fact that most policies won\u2019t pay out if people cancel due to concerns around coronavirus. According to the Association of British Insurers, cancellations will only be covered if the Foreign Office (FCO) advice changes to all but essential travel to a destination after booking. However, with growing concerns about coronavirus and uncertainty over whether the FCO may widen its advice to include additional countries or regions, insurance providers saw a surge in the sales of policies in February. Many of these policies are for trips much later in the year, as people rush to secure cover instead of leaving it to the last minute, which insurers say is often the case. In February the Post Office saw a year on year rise in sales of policies of 168%, and CoverForYou saw a 150% increase, while comparison site TravelSupermarket said traffic to its insurance pages increased by 85% for the week of 24 February compared to the previous week. Enquiries from existing customers relating to coronavirus have also increased. CoverForYou said that it has been receiving twice the number of daily enquiries, which has increased fourfold in the last week, since the coronavirus outbreak began. Alpha has also seen a surge in both policy bookings and enquiries: \u201cThe main concerns are around changes to the FCO\u2019s advice, whether they can still travel abroad and what holidaymakers should do if they are unable to return home from their trip,\u201d says Rachel Conaghan, Alpha\u2019s brand manager. Alpha, which only provides travel insurance, has also noticed a shift in buying habits, with significantly more people booking through comparison sites, and booking much further in advance. \u201cOn average, consumers on comparison sites tend to buy their travel insurance around two weeks before they are due to go on holiday. However, we have noticed that holidaymakers are purchasing cover for trips as much as three to six months in advance in preparation for summer. We always recommend that travellers take out a travel insurance policy as soon as their trip is booked to protect both themselves and their holiday from any unforeseen circumstances.\u201d In terms of the coronavirus, the FCO is currently only warning against all but essential travel to China, some parts of South Korea and the eleven villages in northern Italy that are on lockdown.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll wrap things up, then. Thanks for joining us today, here\u2019s Barney Ronay\u2019s column: Jonny remains out for Wolves ahead of Brighton game. Jonny is unavailable for Wolves ahead of the visit of Brighton. The wing-back remains sidelined after suffering an ankle injury against Norwich last month. Midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White will also miss out after suffering his own ankle injury playing for the under-23s but it is not thought to be serious. Brighton boss Graham Potter reported no fresh selection concerns following last weekend\u2019s home defeat by rivals Crystal Palace. Midfielder Alexis Mac Allister is now training with the first-team squad again following his recall from a loan spell at Boca Juniors in Argentina. Colombian Jose Izquierdo remains unavailable as he continues to recovery from a knee problem. David Moyes and Eddie Howe defend Eric Dier\u2019s fit of midweek pique. As Eric Dier waits to hear what punishment will be handed down to him by the FA following his unsuccessful bid to confront an abusive fan after climbing into the lower tier of White Hart Lane\u2019s West Stand following Tottenham\u2019s FA Cup exit to Norwich, David Moyes has spoken out in his defence. \u201cFor Eric to do what he has done, it must have been required and needed,\u201d said West Ham\u2019s manager. \u201cIn many ways I admire him and like it. I like how he stands up for his family, for himself, and you know we all get criticism and we have to take it in different ways. \u201cThere have been many events recently where they haven\u2019t taken it well but footballers and football managers have to get it regularly. I know Eric well as he was with me at Everton, he is a great boy. Really good professional from a really good sporting family and background who understands all the issues in sport.\u201d Eddie Howe said that, while Dier\u2019s post-match reaction was unfortunate and regrettable, the behaviour of some football fans needs to be subjected to more scrutiny. \u201cIt is very easy to focus on the reaction of the player, and I don\u2019t think anybody wants to see players, coaches or anybody confronting supporters in that way,\u201d the Bournemouth boss said. \u201cBut the world of football needs to look at what is said and what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. It is almost anything that is said from the terraces: \u2018Oh, that is just football banter, that is the world of football\u2019, but I don\u2019t think it should be like that. \u201cI think it is an opportunity to look at this and maybe review what is acceptable and what is not, highlighting it for everybody who goes to games.\u201d Tottenham\u2019s investigation of the incident is on hold until Metropolitan Police finish their own enquiries, while the Football Association will also wait to see the outcome before acting. Blackburn Rovers taking no risks regarding coronavirus. Blackburn Rovers have issued a statement saying they will be obeying the EFL diktat banning pre-match \u201cFair Play\u201d handshakes, but are going further in their efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In addition to the Government advice, Rovers have opted to implement additional precautions at Ewood Park, as well as the club\u2019s Senior Training Centre and Academy \u2013 and we have advised our players and coaching staff not to shake hands, sign autographs or pose for photos with supporters before or after games \u2013 in order to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further,\u201d they say. \u201cWe apologise for any inconvenience caused, but hope that supporters understand the reasons behind these measures being taken. Additionally, any supporter who has recently returned from an affected country should seek professional medical advice before travelling to any upcoming Rovers fixtures.\u201d Harry Maguire is \u201ctouch and go\u201d to feature in Sunday\u2019s Manchester derby. Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer says centre-back Harry Maguire may not be ready to face Manchester City on Sunday. The United captain missed Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win at Derby after rolling his ankle in training on the eve of the game and will be assessed ahead of the match. Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James have not trained this week with knocks so will also need checking over. Marcus Rashford (back) and Paul Pogba (ankle) remain out. Kevin De Bruyne is doubtful for City after falling awkwardly on his shoulder in the latter stages of the Carabao Cup final last weekend and will be assessed. Winger Leroy Sane continues to make progress in his recovery from the knee injury that has sidelined him since August but the trip to Old Trafford comes too soon for the German. Defender Aymeric Laporte is still missing with a hamstring problem. Ederson will return in goal after sitting out the past two domestic cup games. Neil Lennon fields inevitable questions about the coronavirus. The Celtic boss has described the prospect of playing games behind closed doors as \u201cnot ideal\u201d but accepts the broader picture of fixtures being fulfilled. Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster has warned an outbreak of the virus at even one club could make finishing the season \u201cvery difficult\u201d. As of Friday morning, 11 people had tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland, with the UK figure standing at 163. The possibility of matches taking place at empty stadiums was flagged up as the football authorities consider what options might be available. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal but they have had to do it in Italy,\u201d said Lennon. \u201cI don\u2019t know what measures are taken elsewhere but we\u2019ll have to take a view on that if and when that situation arises. It\u2019s not ideal. I don\u2019t know the financial situations of other clubs but I would say it would be very detrimental to the financial well-being. \u201cI think we are maybe getting a little bit too far ahead of ourselves at the minute and we will have to take it week by week. Yes, we want to play the games and obviously we want to play them in front of full houses, that\u2019s what football is all about. Behind closed doors isn\u2019t ideal and, like I say, the club will guide me on how to guide the players and staff on that.\u201d Bar\u00e7a coach Quique Seti\u00e9n echoed Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp widely-shared response to a request for his opinion on how football will deal with coronavirus. Klopp won plaudits after carpeting the journalist who asked the question, asking how the words of those with no specialist medical knowledge were of any value during a health crisis. Seti\u00e9n said: \u201cI think he gave an extraordinary answer. The reality is that I have dedicated my life to football and so has he. I don\u2019t know what value my opinion has when I know nothing about this situation. \u201cThere are much more competent people out there who can talk about this issue, it\u2019s as if people want to know everything but I don\u2019t understand these questions. I guess people feel they have to ask something.\u201d Well that\u2019s this liveblog of football manager responses to questions about coronavirus told. Eesh. Probably as well that Barry\u2019s returned to take the reins back here. Daniel Farke this week enjoyed back-to-back wins for the first time this season, at home to high-flying Leicester and away in the Cup for the spot-kick success at Spurs. Speaking as he prepares his side to face fellow promoted side Sheffield United, he said: \u201cSuccess is no coincidence. Even when the odds are against you there is no reason to give up. We will keep going and try to make something extraordinary.\u201d \u201cWe are realistic and know we are bottom of the league. We have to earn the right to play here next season, so we are not carried away. I don\u2019t want to stop the feelgood factor we have, but I don\u2019t see any danger of us being over confident or losing the ground beneath our feet.\u201d Speaking of the derby, this from Jamie Jackson has just landed \u2026 Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City will on Sunday face an \u201cincredibly aggressive\u201d Manchester United enjoying their best moment of the season. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s team are unbeaten in nine matches, a best run for a year. The trip to Old Trafford will be City\u2019s fourth meeting with their crosstown rivals this term, having lost two of the previous three. \u201cWhen I saw the last games they were incredibly aggressive and in Old Trafford that will happen,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIn some games they defend against us, but what I saw in the last games \u2013 not just against us but against every team in the league \u2013 is they were aggressive. At Goodison Park [in Sunday\u2019s 1-1 draw against Everton] they played a good game \u2013 and in others.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r has been harrumphing at the fixture list. He\u2019s unhappy that his side had to play in the Cup last night and then strap up their aching bones for the derby on Sunday, while rivals City got an extra days\u2019 rest. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s that help we get from the FA again, the extra 24 hours that they\u2019ve had \u2026 I cannot believe there\u2019s a derby on Sunday and we\u2019ve got to play on Thursday night. What\u2019s the point in that? That doesn\u2019t level the playing field. \u201cIt was the same when we beat them last time to be fair [on 7 December], we played [the previous] Wednesday, they played Tuesday. Them 24 hours, they\u2019re important so we\u2019ve got to be good at recovering now.\u201d Jamie Vardy is closing on a return for Leicester in Monday night\u2019s match against Aston Villa. Having missed the defeat to Norwich and Wednesday FA Cup win over Birmingham, the forward \u201clooked very good in training and he\u2019s still on track for Monday\u201d, according to Brendan Rodgers. Rodgers added: \u201cHe\u2019s a very important player for the club and has been for a number of years, particularly since I arrived here. It\u2019s very important he\u2019s available for us for this final part of the season.\u201d Full-back Ben Chilwell is more of a doubt, however, with the club monitoring \u201ca hamstring twinge\u201d. Roy Hodgson has been talking about his one-year contract extension (see 11.09), and said securing his backroom colleagues\u2019 future at Crystal Palace was the \u201ccrucial factor\u201d in re-signing. He said: \u201cI\u2019m very pleased. We talked about it for quite a long time \u2026 It was more a case of making sure everyone around me is going to be looked after as well, and receive new contracts, because you don\u2019t work in isolation at a football club. You\u2019re very dependent upon the people you\u2019re working with, and I happen to think we have a very, very good team who work with the players and prepare the games. \u201cThat was a crucial factor for me. People can\u2019t give you assurances and guarantees, but everyone at the club \u2013 Steve Parish and the American owners \u2013 we\u2019re all pretty much aware of the fact it would be nice to have some investment in the team and to strengthen in certain areas. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll be trying to do.\u201d John McGinn is closing on a return for Aston Villa after suffering a fractured ankle late last year. The midfielder\u2019s fine early-season performances caught the eye but in his absence Villa have won only two of nine games in the league and now find themselves second from bottom. His manager Dean Smith said: \u201cHe\u2019s getting to where we want him to be and had a CT Scan today to make sure there\u2019s a full union of the fracture. He trained with us, we\u2019ve not had him training in contact sessions yet, he\u2019s been involved in possession and shape work. He feels really good which is the important thing. He\u2019ll be pushing me for Chelsea [on 14 March], that\u2019s for sure. \u201cOnce he gets on that training ground he\u2019ll move quickly and he\u2019s certainly progressing quickly now. Obviously, there will be a lot of pressure put on him because of the pressure on him before his injury, but we have to make sure he\u2019s right when he actually comes back.\u201d West Ham\u2019s manager has responded to Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin\u2019s suggestion that the League Cup be scrapped with an alternative. David Moyes said: \u201cI\u2019ve always thought we should have included Scotland. I think it could do with a revamp, maybe there\u2019s a way that then a certain amount of Premier League teams wouldn\u2019t enter. \u201cI understand the fixture pile-up and there are an awful lot of games for the top players \u2026 a lot who will be playing in the Euros and just off the back of playing long seasons, Saturday-Wednesday, and are then expected to start again in the Premier League with only two or three weeks\u2019 break, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. The players are going to have no time off at all. \u201cIt\u2019s in need of some way of being revamped. Call it the British Cup. A couple of teams from Northern Ireland, maybe two of the Welsh League clubs.\u201d Here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s full story on Liverpool\u2019s goalkeeping gah \u2026 \u201cUnfortunately Ali is out,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway; the plan was he was on the bench. \u201cThere, we thought: \u2018Come on, we don\u2019t have to take any risks\u2019 so left him out of the squad. [There was a] scan the next day and they found something so now he is out. It is a muscle, slight, in the hip region. A small muscle.\u201d Asked to confirm the length of the goalkeeper\u2019s absence, the Liverpool manager said: \u201cNext week no, that means Atl\u00e9tico. I don\u2019t want to say no [to the Everton game] but I don\u2019t know if he will be available. He is not available for tomorrow and then the next week. We have to judge the situation anew. I would say after the international break 100%. Whatever we can get before that we will see.\u201d More on Chelsea\u2019s injuries. Willian feels Mateo Kovacic\u2019s achilles pain and requires a late fitness test. Jorginho starts a two-match league suspension after racking up 10 yellows this season, while N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 still has adductor ouch and Tammy Abraham\u2019s ankle knack continues. Lampard said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been spoken about that much, but we\u2019ve had probably the worst injury list of certainly the top group of the table I think, lots of numbers injured, important players injured, Kant\u00e9, Loftus-Cheek etc.\u201d However Lampard added that Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Pulisic played in an \u201cin-house game\u201d at Chelsea\u2019s training ground earlier today: \u201cIt was great to see Christian get some minutes, he\u2019s still short of match fitness, but it\u2019s the first time the injury\u2019s gone up to a level to get him on a big pitch in a relatively competitive match, so it\u2019s a big step forward hopefully. Ruben played half of that game himself, and is trying to find match fitness.\u201d Dominic Calvert-Lewin is just a pen, paper and photographer away from committing more of his life to Everton, says Carlo Ancelotti. The club this week nailed down defender Mason Holgate on a five-year deal, and the Italian said: \u201cHolgate is going to be the future of this club. It\u2019s important for him and for us to renew the contract, to have stability here with this player. \u201cWe are close to Dominic Calvert-Lewin also and I hope he\u2019s going to sign soon. The idea for the future is really clear for us.\u201d Pep Guardiola says derby rivals Manchester United are \u201cgetting better\u201d under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r \u2026 \u201cThe players follow him \u2013 the commitment they have \u2013 and it\u2019s getting better,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now maybe is the best moment in the season there \u2026 I always have a great opinion and a good respect for Man United.\u201d For Covid-19 corner, he offered: \u201cWe try to do our normal life and when the authorities, the club, the politicians or the doctors go to say what you\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to do [it].\u201d Our first few match previews are in for tomorrow\u2019s matches \u2026 Frank Lampard has been asked about coronavirus things, and how it could affect how Chelsea approach the rest of the season, starting with Everton on Sunday \u2026 \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t affect anything in terms of preparation \u2013 you would take on the opposition in front of you. Obviously it would affect the atmosphere, clearly. It obviously takes a lot away from the game when you don\u2019t have fans in the stadium. There are some things that are more important, and if that\u2019s the path that\u2019s chosen by the authorities then you would go with that.\u201d Lampard is injury-hit, with up to nine players out, after Callum Hudson-Odoi suffered a recurrence of his hamstring twang on his return to full training. Mateo Kovacic is also sidelined with an achilles problem. Afternoon all. Just emptied a tin of Vim over Mr Glendenning\u2019s workstation, but straight off the bat there\u2019s this just in from Spurs, in follow-up to this from earlier \u2026 Dier will play against Burnley tomorrow. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, when asked if the versatile midfielder would feature, said: \u201cOf course, the only thing that matters is nothing really big happened and secondly he played so, so well. Of course he is going to play. The only thing I can say is that if I see something happen to my son I would do the same. I would think two seconds about doing the same.\u201d In further keeper news, Hugo Lloris is a mild doubt for tomorrow\u2019s game but is expected to play. Important handover news: Stuart Goodwin will be taking over for an hour or so. Please be gentle with him. Liverpool news: Andy Hunter is at Jurgen Klopp\u2019s press conference and brings reasonably good tidings from the Liverpool manager. Fitba: Interested in seeing what happened when a famously dour, occasionally belligerent, crotchety and temperamental Scotsman sat down to interview the manager of his national football team? Ewan Murray sat down with Steve Clarke so you could find out ... Fitba: Steven Gerrard admits he is facing one of his most difficult periods in football - but says that challenging himself was exactly why he opted to begin his managerial career with Rangers. After advancing to the last 16 of the Europa League by beating Braga over two legs, his side has lost twice in five days - their Scottish Cup exit against Hearts followed by a home defeat by Hamilton. \u201cThe whole 20 months has been challenging but of course when results are not good enough in a short space of time there\u2019s more heat and more pressure on myself, which I accept,\u201d he said, when asked if this was the most challenging week of his professional career. \u201cIn many ways, yeah, it probably has been challenging but even when we were winning, this job is challenging because you have got to do everything you can to continue that. This is one of the most challenging jobs out there. I knew that and it hasn\u2019t disappointed.\u201d Meanwhile in Barcelona: Over in La Liga, Barcelona have the chance to regain top spot on Saturday night when they host Real Sociedad at Camp Nou. But in the buildup to the match their manager, Quique Setien, has been bogged down by chatter about the behaviour of his assistant Eder Sarabia, who has made headlines with his language during Barca\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Real Madrid. Setien has since apologised to his Barcelona squad. He told El Periodico: \u201cWe apologised to everyone [in our squad], we cannot behave like that. We don\u2019t like to see things like this, we have committed an error and we should try to avoid something like this happening again. This situation has affected me a lot, because I am concerned about the image of the club. We need to take care of that image, because we can be criticised for substitutions, tactics, etc, but not for our behaviour.\u201d For a sample of effing and jeffing in question, click here. Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: James Tarkowski has rejected the suggestion Burnley\u2019s chances of recording yet another clean sheet when Tottenham visit Turf Moor this weekend will be easier in the absence of Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. The frontline pair are both injured and will miss Spurs\u2019 trip to the north-west at teatime on Saturday as they look to arrest a slump that has seen them lose ground on the Premier League top-four. Burnley could leapfrog them with a win following a six-match unbeaten run that has carried them into the top half of the table, in part thanks to the effectiveness of their back-line. On 11 occasions this season, Burnley\u2019s opponents have drawn a blank in front of goal, but Tarkowski is not taking another clean sheet for granted. \u201cYes and no!\u201d said Tarkowski, upon being asked if now was a good time to be playing Tottenham. \u201cMaybe there\u2019s more expectation on us because they are missing two of their big hitters. \u201cWhen they are missing Harry and Son then obviously there may be a chance there for us to put a good performance in. I don\u2019t think it makes easier. Maybe from your perspective it does but not for me, no. \u201cThere is still a player in front of me I have got to stop from scoring goals and there is a team of 11 players we have got to go and beat.\u201d Tarkowski, fellow centre-half Ben Mee and goalkeeper Nick Pope have started every match in the top-flight this term, bolstering the impression that familiarity has bred success. \u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a consistent back four this season which is nice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe full-backs have chopped and changed a little bit but me, Ben and Popey have been there all season and that sort of consistency helps. It sort of comes more natural with each other, we know each other\u2019s game, I expect where Ben is going to be and he expects where I am going to be at times and we cover round each other.\u201d More on that Jesse Lingard abuse: As we mentioned earlier, Manchester United have launched an investigation into the shocking abuse aimed at Jesse Lingard following Thursday\u2019s FA Cup fifth-round victory at Derby. The 27-year-old was among six changes made for the 3-0 win against his former club at Pride Park, where video emerged on social media showing the midfielder being abused as he made his way onto the team coach. Lingard is heard being sworn at repeatedly as he signs autographs, before boarding the coach as another fan shouts \u201czero goals and zero assists\u201d. United team-mate Luke Shaw confronts supporters from the doorway of the bus and what appears to be a racist remark is allegedly uttered by someone waiting outside the coach. You can see and hear the footage below, but please be advised that it is not safe for work and contains lots of loud \u201ceffing\u201d and \u201cjeffing\u201d, as well as other depressingly unsavoury and unimaginative, possibly racist abuse. Sheffield United v Norwich City: Two of the three promoted teams meet on Saturday and a difference in transfer spending is not the whole story behind their divergent paths, writes Paul Wilson. Brighton news: Brighton boss Graham Potter intends to take it one match at a time as his team prepare for a daunting run of fixtures which could decide their Premier League fate. This weekend\u2019s trip to sixth-placed Wolves being followed by successive matches against Arsenal, Manchester United, Norwich, Liverpool and Manchester City. It is a formidable challenge awaiting the south-coast side, but Potter prefers not to look too far ahead or worry about what could happen elsewhere. \u201cWe have to focus on ourselves and not think about external things too much. You can\u2019t look any further than the next game, otherwise you overthink,\u201d Potter said. \u201cRather than worrying about what might or might not happen we will make sure our attention is on our game.\u201d Potter knows just what a tough ask it will be to leave Molineux with a good result. \u201cThey have done amazingly well and full credit has to go to the manager for getting them promoted and then stable in the Premier League,\u201d he said. \u201cWolves have been on a good European run and maintained their level. They are well organised and are competing for a top-four spot. They have a really dangerous front three and have a good mix of attacking qualities.\u201d EFL statement: \u201cAs a result of the ongoing concerns posed the by Coronavirus outbreak and following specific medical advice, the Fair Play handshake between players and match officials will not take place at this weekend\u2019s EFL matches and until further notice. \u201cWhilst the Government guidance does remain unchanged, a decision has been taken on medical advice and as a precautionary measure. Matchday operations at EFL grounds are set to continue this weekend with Clubs being advised to take appropriate prevention measures as per the Government guidance. \u201cIt is understood, however, that individual Clubs may take decisions at a local level to help mitigate the risk of the virus spreading further ahead of this weekend\u2019s matches. \u201cThe EFL continues to remain in regular dialogue with the Government regarding the ongoing developments and is being appraised on a regular basis of developments that could potentially impact our Clubs and Competitions \u201cWe will continue to provide EFL Clubs with updates and advice as it is issued to ensure that they have all the relevant up-to date information so that they can continue to advise their players, staff and supporters. \u201cThese matters are subject to constant change and we will update as appropriate.\u201d Coronavirus update: The Football League is to follow the Premier League in banning pre-match handshakes between sets of players in a bid to halt the spread of the virus. As gestures go, it could scarcely be more pointless, but it does at least allow both governing bodies to be seen to be doing something. Neither the Premier League nor the EFL have mentioned if they will also be forbidding players from spitting, blowing their noses, screaming in each other\u2019s faces. For the time being at least, they will also allow tens of thousands of spectators to sit together in close proximity to each other and the pitch, coughing, sneezing and shouting. Coronavirus is spread via droplets from the nose and mouth and can be transmitted on to the hands and passed on via a handshake. Coronavirus update: Denmark has become the latest country to announce that all football matches will be played behind closed doors for the rest of March. The country has also banned events that involve gatherings of over 1,000 people. All sport in Italy, including Serie A games, will be played behind closed doors until 3 April in an effort to contain the disease, the government has said. Manchester United news: The club have condemned what appears to be racist abuse suffered by Jesse Lingard after Thursday\u2019s FA Cup win at Pride Park, and will contact Derby for help in investigating the matter, writes Jamie Jackson. Women\u2019s football: England\u2019s Lionesses continue to be nowhere near as good as their delusional manager Phil Neville seems to think they are and were beaten by the USA in their SheBelieves Cup opener in Orlando yesterday. Suzanne Wrack was there to see England get swatted aside by a half-fit team of Americans interrupting their off season to play in the tournament. Crystal Palace news: Crystal Palace manager Roy Hodgson has signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him at the club until the end of the 2020-21 campaign, the Premier League club have announced. More as we get it ... although I\u2019m not sure how much more there is to add. The news does put an end to uncertainty surrounding Hodgson\u2019s future at the club, following speculation that he was very displeased indeed by their lack of activity in the January transfer window. Newcastle news: Steve Bruce fears it is \u201cpretty inevitable\u201d that Premier League games will be played behind closed doors as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. The authorities in Italy have introduced a ban on mass gatherings which has hit sports events, and Bruce believes it is only a matter of time before the same happens in the UK. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday morning, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine, isn\u2019t it? But obviously, they\u2019re doing it now in Italy and it\u2019s something we\u2019re probably going to face. We all know football is a way out for everybody, but people\u2019s lives are at stake and we\u2019ve got to go by the authorities. But it looks pretty inevitable that could be on the cards.\u201d The potential for some respite then, for disillusioned Newcastle fans who remain unhappy with their team\u2019s style of play under Bruce. Newcastle duo ink new deals: Jonjo Shelvey, 28, and Matt Ritchie, 30, have both signed new three-year contracts which will keep them at the Premier League club until 2023. Our chief football correspondent writes: David Hytner has penned an interesting comment piece on the furore surrounding Eric Dier\u2019s spirited, fraternal foray into the White Hart Lane stands in the wake of Tottenham\u2019s FA Cup defeat at the hands of Norwich City on Wednesday night. While no supporters were harmed in the making of this controversy, Dier almost certainly regrets his actions and is apparently resigned to whatever ban he inevitably receives from the Football Association for angrily making his way over 15 rows of seats with intent. His manager, however, has stood by him and urged Tottenham to do the same. Meanwhile, Dier\u2019s rush of blood to the head has intensified the focus on fan behaviour, specifically the behaviour of those entitled dunderheads who think buying a ticket for a football match entitles them to scream toxic abuse at the players putting on the show. Read on and feel free to add your two cents in the comments section below ... This weekend\u2019s Premier League fixtures The Manchester derby is probably the pick of the bunch, although the eye is also draw to wobbling Liverpool\u2019s game against Bournemouth at Anfield and Tottenham\u2019s trip to Turf Moor as they attempt to halt a run of four consecutive defeats. The only manager in football history ever to lose players through injury, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho has been getting his excuses in early, having told the BBC the club hierarchy must choose between prioritising the weekend\u2019s clash with Burnley or the upcoming Champions League visit to Leipzig. \u201cIn this moment I have to think about what\u2019s next and I have to speak to my club because I think some of these boys to have a chance to fight Tuesday for a Champions League position they just can\u2019t play on Saturday,\u201d he said, somewhat bafflingly. Coronavirus latest ... The spread of coronavirus means it is likely matches will be played behind closed doors this month, writes Paul MacInnes. Sasha Ryazantsev, the Everton chief financial officer, said banning fans from games in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus would be a decision imposed on clubs. However, with Italian authorities having taken the decision to play Serie A games behind closed doors until April, the possibility of something similar here is increasing. \u201cIt would be a forced decision rather than one we would proactively engage in,\u201d said Ryazantsev at the FT Business of Football Summit in London. \u201cBut the whole situation goes far beyond the world of sport. Nobody wants to play behind closed doors and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable that it will happen. But we feel it is quite likely it may happen in the coming weeks.\u201d Welcome to your one-stop shop for all the news and build-up ahead of another weekend\u2019s piping hot football action. With assorted managers scheduled to host press conferences ahead of the latest round of fixtures, we\u2019ll bring you all the news that\u2019s fit to print and almost certainly a whole lot more that isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t touch that dial. Or mouse. Or ... em, touchscreen. Or your face. And for the love of humanity, wash your hands!",

The chancellor should set out a clear timeline for this infrastructure programme and support at least 5% of government spending on climate and nature in the budget. This would show that ministers mean business in tackling the climate emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Dave Timms, the head of politics at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe government reconsidering support for expensive climate-wrecking infrastructure projects such as the \u00a330bn road-building programme would be a welcome sign that international climate commitments are being taken more seriously. However, they need to urgently press ahead with funding a national programme of investment in the UK\u2019s cold and leaky homes where there are clear benefits for the economy, households, and the planet.\u201d</p> <p>Next Wednesday\u2019s budget will be the first since Britain left the EU and the first since the UK adopted the net zero carbon target, enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer in one of her final acts as prime minister. It will also be scrutinised carefully by other nations for signals that the government is taking Cop26 seriously, after a troubled start to the UK\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>The EU is setting out its European Green Deal, a massive overarching strategy encompassing all aspects of the European economy, hoped to lead to net zero emissions by mid-century. The EU will use its green deal in a bid to draw China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, into a pact to cut greenhouse gases drastically.</p> <p>Without a similar strategy, the UK may lack credibility in trying to form the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of countries that experts say is necessary to make Cop26 \u2013 the conference of the parties, to be held in Glasgow this November \u2013 a success.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been promised a green budget, and with only eight months to go till the UN climate talks, it\u2019s essential we get one,\u201d said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance. \u201cThe government is badly off target to deliver its legally binding climate commitments. This is the moment to get on track.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners want to see the government commit to a range of measures that would reduce carbon, beyond the piecemeal announcements made so far. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/pm-urges-major-economies-to-go-carbon-neutral-by-2050\">Boris Johnson said last month</a> at the launch of Cop26 that the moratorium on sales of new diesel and petroleum cars would be brought forward five years to 2035, and this week ministers agreed to make onshore wind farms eligible for public support, and to increase the content of biofuels in petrol.</p> <p>Green groups and experts say much more is needed, including strategies on fixing Britain\u2019s heat-leaking homes, boosting renewables, halting the rapid rise in emissions from transport, restoring the natural environment and tackling waste.</p> <p>\u201cAs the first major opportunity for the Johnson government to show it is serious on delivering net zero, the budget is a huge moment ahead of Cop26,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cThe minimum expected is to lead by example and convince other nations to submit ambitious pledges, amplifying domestic action on to the global stage. The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.\u201d</p> <p>Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are \u201cuniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets\u201d.</p> <p>Some groups are calling for the government to devote at least 5% of spending to the low carbon effort.</p> <p>\u201cMassive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution \u2013 and show genuine leadership ahead of this year\u2019s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,\u201d said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth.</p> <p>In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected.</p> <p>Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda.</p> <p>\u201cThe need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,\u201d said Spiers. \u201cInvesting in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.\u201d</p>",

This would show that ministers mean business in tackling the climate emergency.\u201d Dave Timms, the head of politics at Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cThe government reconsidering support for expensive climate-wrecking infrastructure projects such as the \u00a330bn road-building programme would be a welcome sign that international climate commitments are being taken more seriously. However, they need to urgently press ahead with funding a national programme of investment in the UK\u2019s cold and leaky homes where there are clear benefits for the economy, households, and the planet.\u201d Next Wednesday\u2019s budget will be the first since Britain left the EU and the first since the UK adopted the net zero carbon target, enshrined in law by Theresa May last summer in one of her final acts as prime minister. It will also be scrutinised carefully by other nations for signals that the government is taking Cop26 seriously, after a troubled start to the UK\u2019s presidency. The EU is setting out its European Green Deal, a massive overarching strategy encompassing all aspects of the European economy, hoped to lead to net zero emissions by mid-century. The EU will use its green deal in a bid to draw China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, into a pact to cut greenhouse gases drastically. Without a similar strategy, the UK may lack credibility in trying to form the \u201cgrand coalition\u201d of countries that experts say is necessary to make Cop26 \u2013 the conference of the parties, to be held in Glasgow this November \u2013 a success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been promised a green budget, and with only eight months to go till the UN climate talks, it\u2019s essential we get one,\u201d said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of Green Alliance. \u201cThe government is badly off target to deliver its legally binding climate commitments. This is the moment to get on track.\u201d Campaigners want to see the government commit to a range of measures that would reduce carbon, beyond the piecemeal announcements made so far. Boris Johnson said last month at the launch of Cop26 that the moratorium on sales of new diesel and petroleum cars would be brought forward five years to 2035, and this week ministers agreed to make onshore wind farms eligible for public support, and to increase the content of biofuels in petrol. Green groups and experts say much more is needed, including strategies on fixing Britain\u2019s heat-leaking homes, boosting renewables, halting the rapid rise in emissions from transport, restoring the natural environment and tackling waste. \u201cAs the first major opportunity for the Johnson government to show it is serious on delivering net zero, the budget is a huge moment ahead of Cop26,\u201d said Jonathan Marshall, the head of analysis at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. \u201cThe minimum expected is to lead by example and convince other nations to submit ambitious pledges, amplifying domestic action on to the global stage. The UK can show the world that hitting net zero is eminently possible, and is more than just a slogan.\u201d Local government is also urging the chancellor to deliver a green budget for Cop26. A group of councils and local government organisations wrote to the chancellor on Friday to say that councils are \u201cuniquely well placed to help the government meet its carbon emissions reduction targets\u201d. Some groups are calling for the government to devote at least 5% of spending to the low carbon effort. \u201cMassive investment in our abundant renewable power potential, public transport and a nationwide energy efficiency programme would put the UK at the forefront of the green industrial revolution \u2013 and show genuine leadership ahead of this year\u2019s crucial climate summit in Glasgow,\u201d said Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth. In a sign of the growing impact of the coronavirus on Cop26, the UN announced planned meetings in Bonn in March and April would be cancelled. However the main preparatory Cop26 meeting scheduled for Bonn in June is so far unaffected. Some also fear that the need for urgent measures on the coronavirus will distract attention from the green agenda. \u201cThe need to avoid recession as a result of coronavirus cannot be made an excuse for dodging vital decisions on de-carbonising the economy,\u201d said Spiers. \u201cInvesting in warmer homes, infrastructure for electric vehicles, the renewable energy industry and natural flood defences will boost the economy, not least in poorer regions, as well as tackling the climate and wider environmental emergency.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, Tehran has pointed to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government figures.

      "bodyText": "The total number of coronavirus cases confirmed around the world passed 100,000 on Friday as Iran reported a sharp rise in cases and threatened to use force to stop people travelling between cities. Tehran\u2019s announcement came as the World Health Organization called on countries to make \u201ccontainment their highest priority\u201d and Donald Trump signed a $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus, despite insisting that it \u201cwill go away\u201d. In Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-affected country, the death toll rose by 46 to 197, and the number of confirmed cases increased by 778 to 4,636. Speaking at a televised press conference on Friday, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s health ministry said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before. While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces. The threat may be aimed at stopping people from using closed schools and universities as an excuse to go to the Caspian Sea and other holiday spots in the run-up to the Persian new year, which falls on 21 March. Semi-official news agencies in Iran posted images of long lines of traffic of people trying to reach the coast from Tehran on Friday despite authorities earlier telling people to remain in their cities. Checkpoints on roads in Mazandaran and Gilan provinces were being operated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in perhaps the most visible intervention by the state yet. There also appeared to be checks for those entering or leaving the holy city of Qom. Friday prayers and football matches have already been cancelled but public trust in the authorities\u2019 capacity to deal with the virus had been undermined by the government\u2019s sluggish and complacent initial response to the outbreak, and by the state\u2019s secrecy over the killing of hundreds of street protesters in November. Stung by criticism of its handling of the outbreak, Tehran has pointed to WHO assessments that have not challenged the government figures. Health officials said the new figures may reflect the availability of more accurate testing kits. In two further signs of rising concern about the situation in Iran, Christoph Hamelmann, the WHO country director, told senior overseas diplomats in Tehran that funding was urgently needed for a \u201crapid upscaling\u201d of laboratory and clinical components, and Saudi Arabia called on citizens to declare visits to Iran in the past 14 days.

But at a briefing on Friday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO\u2019s director general, praised Iran for \u201cswitching on\u201d to the outbreak and for taking an \u201call-of-government approach\u201d. Tedros said the epidemic was continuing to spread, adding: \u201cWe are continuing to recommend that all countries make containment their highest priority.\u201d Elsewhere in the Middle East, 12 new cases were reported among workers on a cruise ship in Egypt. A tourist who travelled on the same ship sailing between Luxor and Aswan tested positive for the virus on her return to Taiwan a week ago. Across Europe there were significant rises in death tolls and infections. In France, where cases rose by 190 to 613, and deaths by two to nine, President Emmanuel Macron urged people to limit visits to elderly people, even though this could prove \u201cheartbreaking\u201d at times. The UK, meanwhile, reported what is believed to be its second death, and the Netherlands its first. Elsewhere, the first confirmed cases were reported in Costa Rica, Colombia, Cameroon, Togo, Serbia, Bhutan and Vatican City. As the outbreak continued to spread in the US, the Trump administration was forced on to the defensive following criticism of its approach to the virus. Fifteen people have died from the coronavirus there and more than 200 infections have been confirmed across at least 18 states. Trump called for calm as he signed an $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus. \u201cIt will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very low numbers [of confirmed cases] compared to many countries throughout the world, our numbers are lower than almost anyone \u2026 In terms of cases, it\u2019s very, very few because we have been very strong at the borders.\u201d The president also said he believed the financial markets would \u201creally bounce back\u201d despite concerns that the virus was spreading beyond the control of governments around the world. Passengers on a large cruise ship off the California coast were instructed to stay in their cabins on Friday as they awaited test results that could determine whether the virus was circulating among the more than 3,500 people aboard. A military helicopter crew lowered test kits onto the Grand Princess by rope and later retrieved them for analysis at a lab as the vessel lay at sea off San Francisco, under orders to keep its distance from shore. Authorities undertook the testing after a passenger on a previous voyage of the ship died of the coronavirus and at least four others became infected. \u201cThe ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,\u201d the Califorinia governor, Gavin Newsom, said. In Asia, a diplomatic row erupted between Japan and South Korea after Tokyo said it would quarantine all passengers arriving from the country, which has the highest number of cases outside China. From Saturday, anyone arriving in Japan from South Korea will be placed in a two-week quarantine at government-designated sites, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Thursday. Seoul described the move as \u201cunreasonable, excessive and extremely regrettable\u201d, accusing Japan of failing to address its own outbreak properly, and threatening retaliatory measures. The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will open as planned on 24 July, but speculation is growing that they will have to be cancelled. Meanwhile, schools in parts of China were set to reopen as the central province of Hubei \u2013 excluding the provincial capital Wuhan \u2013 reported no new cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours for the first time since the outbreak began last year. While Hubei reported no new cases for a full day, Wuhan, the centre of the epidemic, said it had confirmed 126 new cases of the virus on Thursday.

She had just advised the public: \u201cStart working on not touching your face, because one main way viruses spread is when you touch your own mouth, nose or eyes.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is a simple strategy of prevention: the virus can live for at least nine hours, and possibly days, on hard surfaces. But it is easier said than done.</p> \n<p>As many of us have become uncomfortably aware, not touching your face is like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game)\">The Game</a>, wherein as soon as you think of it, you lose.</p> \n<p>Told not to touch your face, I guarantee: you will be able to do little else \u2013 even with the risk of becoming a coronavirus casualty.</p> \n<p>I tried for a day on Thursday, sightseeing on holiday with a friend. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to touch my face,\u201d I told her. \u201cIf you see me doing so, please stop me.\u201d</p> \n<p>This did not work, for reasons that are obvious in hindsight: if your friends notice where you are putting your hands, your hands are either somewhere entirely inappropriate, or your friends\u2019 attention is too close.</p> \n<p>I myself became excruciatingly conscious of where my grubby mitts were going \u2013 but only with something like a two-second delay.</p> \n<p>I applied too much lip balm. My fringe settled unflatteringly. I felt an overpowering and, I am quite certain, psychosomatic urge to itch my ear, my eyebrow, my nose. Every time, I instinctively touched my face \u2013 and every time, I checked myself too late.</p> \n<p>My friend watched in bemusement. While I spasmed whenever my hand drifted north of my collarbone like a woman possessed, she had landed on an elegant solution: keeping her hands as clean as possible, draping them in a scarf before she touched the grab bar on the tram or exchanged money.</p> \n<p>Simply adjusting my own scarf seemed impossible to do without coming into contact with my face \u2013 if indeed my scarf, going between covering the backs of restaurant chairs to the lower third of my face, was not a potential Covid-19 carrier.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>My new awareness of my extremities served as a reminder: even for those of us fortunate enough to have not been directly affected by coronavirus, every gesture has become loaded.</p> \n<p>Out in public \u2013 on the train, or on a bank note \u2013 you might imagine you can see the infectious fingerprints. It is a distressing way to view the world, but it may be the necessary prompt to take the threat seriously.</p> \n<p>With willpower alone proving inadequate, I have now resorted to machine learning to help me practice vigilant hygiene. The website <a href=\"https://www.donottouchyourface.com/\">donottouchyourface.com</a> uses your computer\u2019s webcam to train an algorithm to recognise when you are touching your face.</p> \n<p>When you do so, the screen flashes red and a disembodied voice sternly tells you \u201cNO\u201d, like you are a disobedient dog. When the tool is open in a background tab, a pop-up notifies you: \u201cYou touched your face.\u201d</p> \n<p>The idea is that, over time, \u201cyou learn to stop touching your face\u201d, say the tool\u2019s developers. Their answer to the frequently asked question: \u201cWill this stop me from getting Covid-19?\u201d is a tentative: \u201cNot for sure, but it might help.\u201d</p>",

She had just advised the public: \u201cStart working on not touching your face, because one main way viruses spread is when you touch your own mouth, nose or eyes.\u201d It is a simple strategy of prevention: the virus can live for at least nine hours, and possibly days, on hard surfaces. But it is easier said than done. As many of us have become uncomfortably aware, not touching your face is like The Game, wherein as soon as you think of it, you lose. Told not to touch your face, I guarantee: you will be able to do little else \u2013 even with the risk of becoming a coronavirus casualty. I tried for a day on Thursday, sightseeing on holiday with a friend. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to touch my face,\u201d I told her. \u201cIf you see me doing so, please stop me.\u201d This did not work, for reasons that are obvious in hindsight: if your friends notice where you are putting your hands, your hands are either somewhere entirely inappropriate, or your friends\u2019 attention is too close. I myself became excruciatingly conscious of where my grubby mitts were going \u2013 but only with something like a two-second delay. I applied too much lip balm. My fringe settled unflatteringly. I felt an overpowering and, I am quite certain, psychosomatic urge to itch my ear, my eyebrow, my nose. Every time, I instinctively touched my face \u2013 and every time, I checked myself too late. My friend watched in bemusement. While I spasmed whenever my hand drifted north of my collarbone like a woman possessed, she had landed on an elegant solution: keeping her hands as clean as possible, draping them in a scarf before she touched the grab bar on the tram or exchanged money. Simply adjusting my own scarf seemed impossible to do without coming into contact with my face \u2013 if indeed my scarf, going between covering the backs of restaurant chairs to the lower third of my face, was not a potential Covid-19 carrier. My new awareness of my extremities served as a reminder: even for those of us fortunate enough to have not been directly affected by coronavirus, every gesture has become loaded. Out in public \u2013 on the train, or on a bank note \u2013 you might imagine you can see the infectious fingerprints. It is a distressing way to view the world, but it may be the necessary prompt to take the threat seriously. With willpower alone proving inadequate, I have now resorted to machine learning to help me practice vigilant hygiene. The website donottouchyourface.com uses your computer\u2019s webcam to train an algorithm to recognise when you are touching your face. When you do so, the screen flashes red and a disembodied voice sternly tells you \u201cNO\u201d, like you are a disobedient dog. When the tool is open in a background tab, a pop-up notifies you: \u201cYou touched your face.\u201d The idea is that, over time, \u201cyou learn to stop touching your face\u201d, say the tool\u2019s developers. Their answer to the frequently asked question: \u201cWill this stop me from getting Covid-19?\u201d is a tentative: \u201cNot for sure, but it might help.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The leading index of UK company shares dropped by 234 points to 6,471, the lowest point since late June 2016 immediately after the EU referendum, with airlines and travel firms among the hardest hit as heavy selling pressure returned to markets around the world.</p> \n<p>Lufthansa said it planned to cut as many as half of its flights in the coming weeks because of the fallout from coronavirus, just days after announcing a 20% reduction.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A small number of schools have been closed when cases have been detected, while a nervous public have been panic-buying hand sanitiser, soap and dry food staples such as pasta and rice in supermarkets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-charities-rally-to-help-older-people-in-self-isolation\">Coronavirus: charities rally to help older people in self-isolation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Critics also say the government is struggling with communications, having just reversed a post-election boycott of the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.

      "bodyText": "The government has asked supermarkets to increase availability of home delivery services to help people in self-isolation with coronavirus get access to food and other essentials. Top supermarket executives held a call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Friday afternoon. The teleconference came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed he had been in touch with supermarkets and he was \u201cconfident\u201d food supplies would not run out. However, several supermarket executives told the Guardian that until Friday there had been no communication from the government about managing potential shortages during the outbreak. During the call Eustice is understood to have asked if the industry had the capacity to deal with increased home deliveries to cope with self-isolation cases, with the government advising people who have returned from badly affected coronavirus areas to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. The supermarkets said they had already seen a surge in online orders as some shoppers avoid public spaces. One executive said their existing delivery slots were full and the industry have be able to expand capacity by up to 20% but was unlikely to be able to do more. Prior to the call, industry chiefs held a summit between themselves earlier this week at which they discussed working together if food supplies did become limited because of factory shutdowns, for example. On Friday, Eustice is also understood to have asked supermarket bosses for details on how they were coping with a surge in demand for essentials such as toilet roll, hand sanitiser and pasta. One industry insider said: \u201cThe government has been a bit slow off the mark but they are getting into gear. There is a string of meetings starting today.\u201d More than one executive said their main fear was that panic-driven stockpiling would lead to shortages. One executive said that, while there were likely to be short-term gaps on shelves where some products were in high demand, there was plenty of capacity to cope. \u201cIt has been a much bigger week than normal for early March but it\u2019s not as big as Easter or Christmas,\u201d he said.

It\u2019s an opportunity for everyone to put aside their struggles and challenges for two to three hours and enjoy an outing.\u201d The 2020 Six Nations championship has not always been awash with feelgood vibes but England may be saving their best until last.",

      "bodyText": "One last thing: despite a late mini-recovery, Wall Street has closed in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down about 253 points or 1%, while the S&amp;P 500 lost about 52 points, or 1.7%, to close near 2,972. So, a poor day. But thanks to strong gains on Monday and Wednesday, the Dow finished the week up 1.8%, while the S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%. Goodnight! (Again) Time for a recap, after another turbulent week. Fears of a global recession triggered by Covid-19 have sent stock markets slumping again today. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has tumbled by 3.6% in another wave of selling; it shed 242 points to close at 6462, the weakest since July 2016. Wall Street is being pummelled too, as the number of coronavirus cases in America continues to rise. The main indices are at their lowest levels since last summer; Dow: down 566 points or 2.3% at 25,521 S&amp;P 500: down 92 points or 3% at 2,903 Nasdaq: down 293 points or 3.3% at 8,445 The scramble into safe-haven bonds has driven US and UK government bond yields to record lows. Oil has plunged after Opec and Russia failed to agree production cuts, to address falling demand due to the virus outbreak. German airline Lufthansa has halved capacity, as analysts warned that Norwegian airlines is suffering too. The US economy has created 273,000 jobs last month - more than forecast. Panicky investors took little notice. Goodnight, and have a lovely weekend! GW and JJ The UK government has asked supermarkets to increase availability of home delivery services to help people in self-isolation with coronavirus get access to food and other essentials. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: Top supermarket executives held a call with George Eustice, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs on Friday afternoon. The teleconference came after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, claimed he had been in touch with supermarkets and he was \u201cconfident\u201d food supplies would not run out. However, several supermarket executives told the Guardian that until Friday there had been no communication from the government about managing potential shortages during the outbreak. Ben Chu of the Independent has written about how rising anxiety about the economic impact of the global Covid-19 outbreak has driven the yield (or interest rate) on government debt to record lows: The recent dip is certainly driven by fears about the threat of a pandemic. Traders expect the Bank of England to be forced to cut interest rates relatively soon to try to help support the UK economy in the face of this shock. Reductions in the official short-term Bank interest rate tend to reduce traded UK government bond yields. Also, with stock markets tanking, there\u2019s generalised fear about holding riskier assets. Tom di Galoma, managing director of Treasurys trading at Seaport Global Securities, says stocks are falling because: \u201cThe COVID-19 infection rate is multiplying and more states in the U.S. are imposing emergency orders\u201d. Stocks are sliding as the number of coronavirus cases in the US keeps rising, with 33 now reported in New York state. Today\u2019s sell-off is threatening to push the S&amp;P 500 to a fresh five-month closing low. The broad index of US stocks is currently down 2.6%, or 78 points, at 2,947. It was briefly lower last week, but closed lower since mid-October 2019. Oil producers, banks and tech stocks are the worst-performing sectors, with miners trudging lose behind. Nearly half of companies have mentioned Coronavirus in their recent financial reports, spots Michael McDonough of Bloomberg (and very few, if any, were positive mentions, I bet) The firm behind toilet roll brand Andrex says it is taking steps to ensure supplies are available, after stock-piling and panic buying this week: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has shed over 12.5% of its value in the last fortnight, after today\u2019s selloff sent the index below last week\u2019s lows: A little context: This week had started with some optimism that the coronavirus outbreak might be contained, and that government and central banks might steer their economics through the weeds. Those hopes have fizzled in the last couple of days, though, as cases of Covid-19 have jumped in the US, the UK and Europe. Most stocks have suffered, but there are some serious casualties in London, as Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell explains:. Investor fears that appetite would wane for spring and summer holidays resulted in TUI\u2019s shares falling by 37% in value over the past two weeks. The sharp decline in its valuation cost the travel company its place in the FTSE 100 with the result of quarterly reshuffle demoting the business to the FTSE 250 index. \u201cOutsourcing group Capita lost 47% of its value over the past week after its restructuring was costing more and taking longer than expected. \u201cCineworld failed to convince the market that it was in good health. The postponement of the latest James Bond film, together with growing concerns about its very large amount of debt linked to two major acquisitions, led investors to worry about the state of the business. Its shares fell nearly 30% over the week.\u201d After tumbling again today, European stock markets have closed at their lowest point since August 2019. The Stoxx 600 has closed 3.7%, as the nervous recovery earlier this week was wiped out in heavy selling yesterday and today. Energy stock were the worst hit, after today\u2019s oil output cut deal collapsed. How bad is it today? Well, well-known Wall Street trader Peter Tuchman has captured the mood on another grizzly day: Every sector of the Dow is falling today, as investors ignore Donald Trump\u2019s claim that Covid-19 will \u201cgo away\u201d. My colleague Joanna Walters explains: \u201cYou have to be calm,\u201d Trump said at the White House this morning before departing to tour the tornado damage in Tennessee and shortly after signing an $8.3bn emergency spending bill to deal with the virus. \u201cIt will go away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very low numbers [of confirmed cases] compared to many countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than almost anyone \u2026 deaths, is it 11?\u201d It is. Investors, though, fear that total could rise sharply - triggering today\u2019s selloff: Newsflash: Britain\u2019s blue-chip stock index has ended the day at its lowest closing level since the summer of 2016. The FTSE 100 index has closed down 242 points, or 3.6%, at 6462. That\u2019s its lowest close since the end of June 2016 (when the Brexit vote knocked the pound, making UK stocks more attractive) Fears are growing that the coronavirus crisis will force some European companies to default on their bonds. The FT explains: A measure of strain in European credit markets leapt to its highest level in four years on Friday, suggesting that investors are bracing for a wave of defaults despite a vertiginous plunge in government bond yields. The iTraxx Crossover index, which measures the perceived risk of defaults by European companies with low credit ratings, surged above 380 basis points on Friday \u2014 a 100bp rise in just three days \u2014 to its highest since the summer of 2016. Sky News are reporting that Facebook is closing its London offices and telling staff to work from home after an employee was diagnosed with COVID-19. The employee who was diagnosed with the virus was normally based in Singapore, butvisited the London offices between 24-26 February. The slump in demand caused by Covid-19 has forced Icelandair to cancel around 80 flights in March and April, it says. That\u2019s roughly 2% of its flight schedule for the two months. Eek! The oil price is sliding even lower, amid confirmation that the Opec+ group have failed to agree production cuts (as feared). Brent crude is now down 8.8%, a really sharp plunge, at just $45.61, down from over $50 last night. Nearly every stock on the Dow is falling again today. JP Morgan is leading the selloff, after announcing that chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is recovering from emergency heart surgery. Exxon Mobile are down 3.6% as hopes of an Opec-Russia oil supply cut deal fade. Shares in Lufthansa\u2019s rivals have jumped. British Airways owner International Airlines Group is now leading the (seven) FTSE 100 risers, up by 1.8%. Air France-KLM has now gained 5.5%, while Ryanair has pared some of its losses. Germany\u2019s flag-carrier airline, Lufthansa, is planning to cut as many as half of its flights in the coming weeks. In a message to the Frankfurt stock exchange Lufthansa said that it had seen a \u201cdrastic falls in bookings\u201d. It had already cut about 25% of its capacity, before the latest measures. It is quite something. Oil prices are really under pressure as it appears that an Opec deal with Russia is not going to be forthcoming. Brent crude futures are now down by 5.6% today, hitting lows of $46.70 \u2013 having hit $71 on 8 July. That\u2019s down by a third in under two months! West Texas Intermediate crude futures have lost 5.9%, breaking below $43 per barrel. It was above $60 per barrel at the start of the year. It has been quite a day on the bond markets: every time you check it appears that yields on widely traded debt are plumbing new lows, as surging demand for safe havens pushes up prices. The UK 10-year gilt yield fell as low as 0.206% in afternoon trading, having started the day at 0.33%. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury fell to 0.66%, only three days after it first broke the 1% mark for the first time. And in Germany 10-year and 30-year Bunds fell further into record negative-yielding territory, at 0.746% and 0.335% respectively. That means that investors are effectively paying to lend to the German government (although at least holders will still get back their principal when the bonds expire \u2013 something that is clearly valued at times like these). Larry Kudlow, the director of Donald Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, is trying to reassure markets on US television. Kudlow may not have an absolutely stellar record on predictions, but there is some evidence that the US economy was not doing too badly before the outbreak \u2013 not least the strong US jobs data from today. It was \u201canother month of impressive jobs growth\u201d, said the Guardian\u2019s US business editor Dominic Rushe, in his report: The underlying pace could help once the outbreak has bottomed out, according to the respected Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz: By my reckoning the FTSE 100 is on course for the worst daily performance since 24 August 2015. London\u2019s blue-chip stocks fell by 4.67% on that day, when fears abounded over the Chinese economy. Before that we have to look back to 2011 for a comparable fall. As expected the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 2.9% at the opening bell. The Nasdaq lost 3%, as did the Dow Jones industrial average \u2013 776 points in old money. The FTSE 100 has now lost 3.7% for the day. The new intra-day low of 6,444 points is the lowest level since July 2016, when the fall in sterling made UK-listed companies relatively cheaper. The new low came after new figures showing an accelerating spread of coronavirus in the UK. *This post has been edited. It is the lowest level since July 2016, not 2017 as previously stated. The number of global coronavirus cases has reached 100,052, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It came as two British Airways employees tested positive for the disease. More updates here: Some coronavirus reactions (even if the markets aren\u2019t really moving in response to it). Robert Alster, head of investment services at Close Brothers Asset Management, said: Coronavirus poses a threat to the nascent recovery in manufacturing, and the vital service sector. Before Covid-19 spread, the US economy was already showing symptoms of slowing, with weakening employment data likely to offer waning support to consumption growth. Disruption the virus has caused elsewhere in the world may cancel out the better momentum facilitated by progress on trade, but what matters more is the domestic impact on US consumption. James Ingram, an investment manager at MB Capital, said: In the midst of all of the reporting on Coronavirus this was potentially going to be the most easily missed non-farm payroll announcement in recent history. We had a strong healthy start to the year with January\u2019s number being revised upwards from 225,000 to 273,000 and today\u2019s number for February coming in much stronger than expected also at 273,000. Couple this with the panicked rate cut of 0.5% by the US Fed and it places the economy and the stock market in a great position. My only fear is a weaker [reading] may have had a larger impact and created the urgency for the US to consider further stimulus, which would have buoyed the market and helped calm fears about the risk Coronavirus could have on ebbing away business revenues over the near future. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Avatrade, said: There is so much panic in the markets \u2013 in fact, the only time we have seen something similar to this was during the financial crisis. However, it is important to keep in mind that we have a serious discount available on the equity markets and it is about time to start preparing your shopping list. The US employment data show an economy running pretty hot. It would have been looking very promising for President Donald Trump going into a November election \u2013 before the coronavirus put paid to that. In other circumstances the US Federal Reserve\u2019s 0.5 percentage point emergency interest rate on Tuesday could well have been a rise. Wall Street futures have barely moved after the release, despite a massive beat. S&amp;P 500 futures are still down by 3.1%. The US economy created 273,000 jobs in February, blowing away economists\u2019 estimates, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis \u2013 even if the data were overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak. Remember, economists had expected 175,000 new jobs, compared to the earlier January reading of 225,000. S&amp;P 500 futures prices are down by 3.2% so far today. It would take an almighty surprise for the non-farm payrolls to make even a small dent in that ahead of the Wall Street opening bell. US airlines are due to get battered, with United Airlines down by 7% in pre-market trading (having lost 13% yesterday). Delta Air Lines is expected to lose 4%. And bank shares also look like they\u2019re due to fall steeply. The coronavirus outbreak is dominating market sentiment at the moment to the extent that traders are apparently barely watching the US non-farm payrolls data for February. The snapshot of how the US economy is faring \u2013 most notably in terms of how many jobs were created during the month \u2013 is usually seen as one of the key economic data points for the world\u2019s largest economy. Economists don\u2019t appear to believe there will be any major effect from the coronavirus outbreak visible yet. On average they estimate that 175,000 jobs were added, down from 225,000 in January but still a strong number. But this was all before the coronavirus outbreak really threatened the US. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, went as far as to say: This afternoon\u2019s US payrolls report looks set to be one of the most meaningless report in the last 12 years. Here are the numbers from the past year, in any case. Nissan has revealed that it has spent \u00a3400m in its Sunderland plant as it prepares to build its new Qashqai SUV. It came as the Japanese carmaker today launched a new \u00a352m metal press line to make body panels for the cars. The Sunderland plant \u2013 Britain\u2019s largest \u2013 became emblematic of the possible effects of the 2016 Brexit vote on the car industry. However, it has faced difficulties, most notably the withdrawal of a previous decision to build the X-Trail SUV there \u2013 a major loss of investment. It also stopped making premium Infiniti cars there. Nissan said that the \u00a3400m invested for Qashqai came on top of the \u00a3100m invested for the launch of new Juke. It said that was part of an overall \u00a31bn planned investment into the plant by Nissan over five years. Here\u2019s some lunchtime reading (at least for those joining us from the UK and western Europe): Huawei row: A group of eight Conservative rebel MPs, including four former cabinet ministers, have put down an amendment calling on the government to eliminate all Huawei technology from the UK\u2019s mobile phone networks by the end of 2022. Caffeine fix: UK consumers will spend more than \u00a34bn getting their caffeine fix from high street coffee shops this year, to hit an all-time high. Not building bridges: The national infrastructure strategy to invest \u00a3100bn in boosting the economy and tackling the climate crisis is expected to be delayed until after the budget. And some longer reports from earlier: Fraud alert: Coronavirus scams have tricked the UK public out of \u00a3800,000, according to the police. Jagged performance: Jaguar Land Rover suffered an 85% slump in sales in China last month as the coronavirus kept buyers indoors and most dealerships shut. The FTSE 100 has lost 3.1%, after hitting lows of 6,466 points \u2013 a whisker away from levels not seen since 2016 (when sterling\u2019s EU referendum plunge boosted UK shares). S&amp;P 500 futures are down by 2.2%, suggesting more pain is in store for Wall Street. Anglo American shares have dropped by 8.4% after a majority-owned subsidiary of the FTSE 100 miner said it would be unable to honour its contracts. Anglo American Platinum declared force majeure as it will be unable to process any materials for 80 days after a smelting plant was hit by an explosion. It cut its 2020 production outlook. It looks like it could be a white-knuckle ride for oil markets today as Russia and Opec bargain over who will shoulder the biggest burden in cutting crude production. Some interesting context: the increasing heft of the US oil industry has made Opec\u2019s plans much trickier. The US does not take part in the Opec negotiations. Shares in budget airline Norwegian have slumped by 25% on Friday as the coronavirus outbreak causes a big drop in demand. An analyst note from Pareto Securities raised concerns over whether Norwegian had enough cash to survive the disruption, which has caused the sector the world over to struggle. The airline may have to issue new shares to shore up its finances, Pareto said. Norwegian scrapped its earnings guidance yesterday and has cancelled flights. The global airline sector\u2019s market capitalisation has dropped by $40.6bn \u2013 a quarter of its value \u2013 in the last month alone, said Russ Mould, investment director at stocks platform AJ Bell. He said: Even before Covid-19 the industry had started to struggle, weighed down by its own optimistic capacity expansion and increased price competition. Flybe\u2019s collapse in the UK is just the latest in a long list of recent failures that also includes Thomas Cook and Monarch, as well as Denmark\u2019s Primera, Cyprus\u2019 Cobalt, France\u2019s XL Airways and Aigle, Iceland\u2019s Wow Air and Slovenia\u2019s Adria. Alitalia and Air India remain in terrible trouble. Ouch \u2013 Brent crude futures prices have now dropped by 4.6% to hit the lowest level since July 2017, at $47.02 per barrel. The oil-producing cartel, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), has decided to cut production to push up prices, but Reuters reports that Russia is not playing ball, citing a \u201chigh-level Russian source\u201d. Russia is not part of the group, and it isn\u2019t intending to back a cut. That could derail the whole agreement, keeping up the oversupply. S&amp;P 500 futures indicate that US stock markets are going to drop by about 2.6% when they open. On foreign exchange markets, the US dollar is on its way to its worst week since 2016 thanks to expectations of more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The euro gained 0.7% on Friday against the US dollar, breaking through the $1.13 mark. Sterling gained 0.3% against the greenback to hover around $1.30 for the first time in almost a fortnight. The Japanese yen also benefited from the search for safe havens, gaining 1% against the dollar. Collapsing US bond yields and the promise of lowest interest rates from the Fed make the dollar much less attractive. Kit Juckes, chief global foreign exchange strategist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, is looking ahead to the US non-farm payrolls later, which could add another element to the pot for investors trying to work out what\u2019s going on. The last non-farms reading showed that the US economy created 225,000 jobs during January. The February reading is expected to be relatively strong. Juckes said: Today\u2019s headline act is supposed to be the US jobs report. Consensus expects a 175k gain. Our economists forecast a 178k gain. The market is only going to care if we get a shocking number and even then, it\u2019s only prematurely weak data that the capacity to shock. Fraudsters have immediately latched on to coronavirus, with fake \u2018Center for Disease Control\u2019 emails and other scams already tricking the UK public out of \u00a3800,000, according to the police. The National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) this morning issued an urgent scam warning after identifying 21 cases of fraud involving coronavirus in February. Ten of the frauds involved desperate buyers of face masks, with one person paying \u00a315,000 for masks that were never delivered. Other frauds involve emails and texts purporting to be from research organisation\u2019s affiliated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). The NFIB said: They claim to be able to provide the recipient with a list of coronavirus infected people in their area. In order to access this information, the victim needs to click on a link, which leads to a malicious website, or is asked to make a payment in bitcoin. Individuals can report fraud or cybercrime to Action Fraud any time of the day or night using its online reporting tool at actionfraud.police.uk European banking shares have fallen by 4% to hit their lowest point since 2009 \u2013 when the sector was still feeling the effects of the global financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the Stoxx Europe 600 banks index. Oil prices are also taking a hammering this morning, with investors doubting whether Opec production cuts will be enough to sustain prices \u2013 given the big fall in demand caused by coronavirus disruption. The price of Brent crude futures (the North Sea oil benchmark) has fallen by 2.7% today to lows of $48.54 per barrel. If it falls below $48.40 it will be the lowest since summer 2017. West Texas Intermediate futures prices \u2013 North America\u2019s benchmark \u2013 have also lost 2.4%. The Guardian\u2019s Jillian Ambrose reported on the production cuts last night: The world\u2019s largest oil-producing nations plan to avert an oil market crash by cutting millions of barrels from their daily production, but traders fear the economic impact of Covid-19 could still drive global market prices to multi-year lows. Read more here: Back on markets\u2019 coronavirus reaction, the pivot out of riskier equities appears to be gaining pace. Losses on the Euro Stoxx 600 index are now 3.4%. The FTSE 100 has lost 3.1% \u2013 take a look at all of the fallers who have lost more than 5%. The City regulator has just published proposals to make big companies on the London Stock Exchange report their climate-related risks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will require all commercial companies with a premium listing to either make climate-related disclosures in line with standards from the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) or explain why not. While the \u201ccomply or explain\u201d approach means some companies could refuse to outline their exposures to climate-related risks, it could increase scrutiny on companies such as fossil fuel producers. The FCA will consider consulting on extending this rule to a wider scope of companies, it said, in one of the last actions by outgoing chief executive Andrew Bailey. Bailey, who will take up the reins at the Bank of England in 10 days\u2019 time, said: Climate change presents a serious and wide-ranging threat to global economic prospects, society more broadly and our natural environment. The changes we propose will help to provide the transparency the market needs to be able to assess how well companies are adjusting to the risks of climate change. Improved disclosures will support better asset pricing and enable investors to make more informed choices about where to allocate their capital \u2013 which will ultimately support the transition to a low-carbon economy. Demand for gold \u2013 traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset alongside government debt \u2013 has also increased. The spot price for the yellow metal has risen by 0.9% today to hit a high of $1,687 per troy ounce. That\u2019s only a dollar below the $1,688 level hit on 24 February, which was the highest since the start of 2013. Here\u2019s the latest on efforts to stop the coronavirus spread around the world. Globally the number of confirmed cases is approaching 100,000, with more than 3,000 deaths. The Vatican City has reported its first case. An adviser to Iran\u2019s foreign minister has died of the disease. Iran has been the worst affected country outside of China. The Chinese province of Hubei has reported no new cases outside of its capital, Wuhan, for the first time since the outbreak began. You can follow all the updates on the global spread of the virus on the main coronavirus live blog: Yields are dropping as I type: the US 10-year just hit 0.695% and the UK 10-year 0.246%. And more record lows for the 10-year bond yields in the UK and the US. The US 10-year Treasury just hit 0.742% and the 10-year gilt hit 0.249%. Investors appear to be going all in on further interest rate cuts \u2013 which would make the returns offered by staid-but-stable bonds look more attractive. Whether they should be quite this attractive is, however, another matter. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: The bond market is scaring the raccoons out of the air ducts like crazy right now. Investors seeking shelter and betting on aggressive policy cuts have driven the hottest bond rally in years, if not ever. There could be further to run lower for yields, but the more investors rush to bonds to greater the risk of a snap back causing even more damage. The FTSE 100 has slipped a little more in the first 90 minutes on the London Stock Exchange: it\u2019s now down by 2.2%, with publishing and events company Informa the worst performer. At 6,560 points it\u2019s only 100 points above the lows hit at the end of last week. The mid-cap FTSE 250 (with a bigger domestic focus) has lost 2.7%. It\u2019s much the same across Europe. Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 2.3% and France\u2019s Cac 40 has lost 2.5%. JP Morgan\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, is recovering from emergency heart surgery, with his two deputies taking over his duties as he recuperates, the US bank has announced. The lender publicly released an internal memo confirming that the 63-year-old executive, who has led the US\u2019s biggest bank by assets for more than a decade, experienced a tear in his heart\u2019s main artery, which was caught early and treated successfully. The Guardian\u2019s Joanna Partridge has the full report here: British house prices rose by 2.8% in the year to February, slower than January but still stronger than before the general election in December, according to Halifax. The bank said that demand has remained steady, with house prices increasing by 0.3% in February \u2013 althoug it warned that the coronavirus outbreak could weigh on sentiment. Russell Galley, Halifax managing director, said: Much like we saw in January, the increases seen in February reflect the continued improvement of key market indicators. The sustained level of buyer and seller activity is strong compared to recent years, with positive employment conditions and a competitive mortgage market continuing to support demand. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, a forecaster, said: A stream of recent firmer data and surveys suggest that the housing market has changed up a gear after a lacklustre 2019 (with particular softness around the third quarter). Certainly there is compelling evidence that the housing market got a leg-up from increased optimism and reduced uncertainties following December\u2019s decisive election as well as greater near-term clarity on Brexit with the UK having left the EU on 31 January with a deal. Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s profits will be hit by the coronavirus outbreak, after an 85% fall in sales in China, its Indian owner Tata Motors has said. Britain\u2019s largest carmaker has already cut back production this month \u2013 although it insisted (in very strong terms) that factory shutdowns were not related to coronavirus. But those shutdowns will give it some leeway to respond to slower demand. China provides JLR with about a third of its profits, and overall earnings margins will be down by 1% at least, Tata said. Its statement said: The coronavirus has significantly impacted China sales with February retails down around 85% vs the prior year. The spread of the virus to other markets such as South Korea, Japan, and Italy will also impact sales in those markets. JLR said it has ensured the supply of most parts for the next two weeks, after flying in parts such as key fobs in suitcases to get around shortages. But it warned that things could change \u2013 particularly given the spread of the disease in other key countries for automotive suppliers. In the event of specific parts shortages, Jaguar Land Rover would ordinarily be able to still build cars and retrofit missing parts when available, however, we cannot rule out the risk that a shortage of a critical component could impact production at some point. From Bond to bonds: UK government debt has not been left out of the global rush for safe havens. The yield on the 10-year gilt fell to 0.28% \u2013 down from about 0.8% at the start of the year, before the coronavirus\u2019s outbreak became clear. Yields, which move inversely to prices, have plummeted as demand for safer bonds has soared. Perhaps the spread of the disease will see investors effectively paying to lend money to the government, with a negative yield? The release of the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, may have been delayed by the coronavirus outbreak, but Cineworld insists that it is not being squeezed too hard. The chain has not seen \u201cany material impact on our movie theatre admissions due to COVID-19\u201d, it said today in an unscheduled statement to the market. Following an increase in admissions in the first two months of the year against the same period in the previous year, we continue to see good levels of admissions in all our territories, despite the reported spread of COVID-19. Although the release of the new Bond movie has been postponed to November 2020 largely due to closure of cinemas in the Asian markets, the studios have advised us that in the countries in which we operate, they currently remain committed to their release schedule for the coming months and remainder of the year. However, the company did leave the door open to cost cuts and lower investment spending if the outbreak worsens. Looking across the FTSE 100 risers... there are none. But it\u2019s also striking that there are not any huge moves down either \u2013 the worst faller is Tui, leading the travel companies on their way down, but only by 4.6%. It\u2019s a proper broad selloff. Carnival, the cruise operator, has lost 3.8% (Carnival is the only company listed on both the S&amp;P 500 and the FTSE 100 \u2013 today\u2019s markets trivia). European stocks have followed their Asian counterparts back down \u2013 adding another big move to a dramatic fortnight on equity markets. The FTSE 100 has fallen by 1.8% in opening trades, France\u2019s Cac 40 has slumped by 2%, and shares in Italy have fallen by 2.5%. The Euro Stoxx index has lost 1.6% \u2013 with only two gainers across 600 companies. (With US non-farm payrolls data due later we could be set for yet another bumpy day.) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Asian shares have fallen further with the coronavirus outbreak showing no sign of abating in the Europe or the US. Japan\u2019s Topix index slumped by 2.9% and the Nikkei 225 lost 2.7%. The Shanghai Stock Exchange index fell by 1.2% and the CSI 300, which also tracks shares in Shenzhen, lost 1.6%. Australian shares on the ASX 200 lost 2.8%, and the Hang Seng index lost 2.4%. \u201cNo sign of risk appetite stabilising, as the reports of new coronavirus cases spread across Europe and North America, resulting in further event cancellations and profit warnings,\u201d said Ian Williams, economics and strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt. It came after US stocks last night took a tumble \u2013 on what will surely be remembered as one of the most tumultuous weeks on stock markets. Where is all that money going? The bond market. Investors are betting that the US Federal Reserve will step in with more stimulus \u2013 after their previous emergency cut. The yield on US 10-year Treasury bonds, the benchmark for global demand for bonds, has plumbed new depths during the outbreak \u2013 far beyond even the financial crisis or the market turmoil that followed the election of Donald Trump as US president. Yields move inversely to prices, so the steep fall indicates a global flight to safety by investors. Here\u2019s a chart, the yield on the US 10-year over two decades that illustrates that amazing run: A few days ago the idea of Treasury yields falling below 1% was astonishing to many investors. Today it hit 0.808%. Deutsche Bank macro strategist Jim Reid said: For bonds [...] it\u2019s just a straight line down in yields at the moment. Asset allocation specialists at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 people who make exactly these kinds of decision on what to buy on a daily basis \u2013 suggest that Treasuries do indeed provide the best protection. But they also add that further losses could be limited, and they are raising exposure to Chinese equities: Policy makers have clearly entered the race, which should prevent \u2013 for now \u2013 an extended bear market on risk assets. Containment of the number of new cases has been impressive in mainland China, and we now expect a V-shaped recovery from the second quarter onwards there. The agenda 8:30am GMT: UK Halifax house prices (February) 1:30pm: GMT: US non-farm payrolls (February)",

      "body": "<p>Medical staff and patients at a hospital in Milton Keynes have been placed in isolation after a man in his 80s became the second person in Britain to have died from coronavirus, amid family fears he was not isolated quickly enough.</p> \n<p>Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation trust said the man, who had recently returned from a Caribbean cruise, tested positive for coronavirus shortly before his death on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: \u201cI am very sorry to report a second patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their request for privacy is respected.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe patient, who was being treated at the Milton Keynes University Hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions. Contact tracing is already underway.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fact that staff were forced into isolation will raise concerns about the effect of Covid-19 on hospitals\u2019 ability to cope with the outbreak.</p> \n<p>A family member, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian: \u201cOur concern is that the hospital were too slow to detect that our relative had symptoms similar to those of coronavirus and too slow to move him from a ward into isolation, and that that may have put a lot of people \u2013 fellow patients on the ward, staff who were looking after him and visitors who came to see him \u2013 at risk of contracting the virus from him.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think they should have put him into isolation right away, as soon as he arrived, given his symptoms. That was a failure by the hospital. He was coughing a lot and had quite severe symptoms.</p> \n<p>\u201cDespite that, he was put on a ward with lots of other sick patients for six or seven hours before he was moved into isolation. During that time a lot of relatives came to see him, both adults and children. Who knows if any of them have now got coronavirus and are maybe spreading it to older people who might get sick?\u201d</p> \n<p>They said that the family were told at around 7pm on Thursday that their relative had coronavirus \u2013 and about an hour later were told he had died. They said the family were also concerned about the reason they were given for his death, which was presumed to be that he took off his oxygen mask and asphyxiated. NHS England was approached for comment about the death of the patient.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Wednesday, King\u2019s College London confirmed that an immunobiology student working in an asthma and allergy research department at Guy\u2019s hospital in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> had tested positive and several other staff had been advised by NHS England to self-isolate.</p> \n<p> In other developments on Friday:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The Department of Health announced the biggest increase in the number of people infected, which jumped by 4 to 164. Two British Airways baggage handlers were among those who tested positive.</p></li> \n <li><p>A \u00a346m fund was announced by the government in an effort to find a vaccine and speed up testing.</p></li> \n <li><p>Public Health England said \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures such as avoiding cinemas, pubs or sporting events might be needed in the future.</p></li> \n <li><p>At least 142 Britons are among more than 2,000 passengers and crew quarantined on a cruise ship off the coast of California because of fears they may have been exposed to the coronavirus.</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>The prime minister, Boris Johnson said on Friday: \u201cIt looks to me as though there will be a substantial period of disruption when we have to deal with this outbreak.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow big that will be, how long that will be, I think, is still an open question.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut, clearly, it is something we are going to have to deal with for quite a while in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>More deaths would occur in Britain, experts said. Prof George Lomonossoff, of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s very sad, but I think it is inevitable that we will see further deaths in the next few days and weeks. Likewise the number of cases is probably going to rise fairly quickly in that same period.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are now entering the phase where transmission between people who have not travelled to infected areas will become dominant.\u201d</p> \n<p>The role of the British Airways workers will raise concerns about the possibility they may have inadvertently spread the disease through surface contact.</p> \n<p> It is possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection has touched, although it is more likely to be transmitted by other means. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, which is why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/02/uk-coronavirus-public-advice-adverts-tissues-hands\">emphasis is placed on handwashing</a>.</p> \n<p>The travel industry has already been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The contagion proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-two-months-after-government-announces-rescue\">Flybe, which collapsed into administration on Thursday</a>. On Wednesday, the German airline Lufthansa grounded 150 planes amid low demand.</p> \n<p>Officials from the Department for International Development hope the \u00a346m pledged will help in the development of the eight possible coronavirus vaccines being worked on by scientists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A rapid diagnostic test could also be used by low-income countries around the world that are not currently able to diagnose the virus at all.</p> \n<p>No one was has been allowed to leave the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was stuck off the coast of San Francisco, with guests being confined to their rooms pending test results. Meals were delivered to passengers\u2019 cabins and they were given free internet access and extra films to watch on the onboard televisions, Princess Cruises said.</p> \n<p>Last week, a passenger on its sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined in Japan, became the first UK citizen to die from the virus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Medical staff and patients at a hospital in Milton Keynes have been placed in isolation after a man in his 80s became the second person in Britain to have died from coronavirus, amid family fears he was not isolated quickly enough. Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation trust said the man, who had recently returned from a Caribbean cruise, tested positive for coronavirus shortly before his death on Thursday. The chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: \u201cI am very sorry to report a second patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their request for privacy is respected. \u201cThe patient, who was being treated at the Milton Keynes University Hospital, was an older patient who had underlying health conditions. Contact tracing is already underway.\u201d The fact that staff were forced into isolation will raise concerns about the effect of Covid-19 on hospitals\u2019 ability to cope with the outbreak. A family member, who did not wish to be named, told the Guardian: \u201cOur concern is that the hospital were too slow to detect that our relative had symptoms similar to those of coronavirus and too slow to move him from a ward into isolation, and that that may have put a lot of people \u2013 fellow patients on the ward, staff who were looking after him and visitors who came to see him \u2013 at risk of contracting the virus from him. \u201cWe think they should have put him into isolation right away, as soon as he arrived, given his symptoms. That was a failure by the hospital. He was coughing a lot and had quite severe symptoms. \u201cDespite that, he was put on a ward with lots of other sick patients for six or seven hours before he was moved into isolation. During that time a lot of relatives came to see him, both adults and children. Who knows if any of them have now got coronavirus and are maybe spreading it to older people who might get sick?\u201d They said that the family were told at around 7pm on Thursday that their relative had coronavirus \u2013 and about an hour later were told he had died. They said the family were also concerned about the reason they were given for his death, which was presumed to be that he took off his oxygen mask and asphyxiated. NHS England was approached for comment about the death of the patient. On Wednesday, King\u2019s College London confirmed that an immunobiology student working in an asthma and allergy research department at Guy\u2019s hospital in London had tested positive and several other staff had been advised by NHS England to self-isolate. In other developments on Friday: The Department of Health announced the biggest increase in the number of people infected, which jumped by 4 to 164. Two British Airways baggage handlers were among those who tested positive. A \u00a346m fund was announced by the government in an effort to find a vaccine and speed up testing. Public Health England said \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures such as avoiding cinemas, pubs or sporting events might be needed in the future. At least 142 Britons are among more than 2,000 passengers and crew quarantined on a cruise ship off the coast of California because of fears they may have been exposed to the coronavirus. The prime minister, Boris Johnson said on Friday: \u201cIt looks to me as though there will be a substantial period of disruption when we have to deal with this outbreak. \u201cHow big that will be, how long that will be, I think, is still an open question. \u201cBut, clearly, it is something we are going to have to deal with for quite a while in the UK.\u201d More deaths would occur in Britain, experts said. Prof George Lomonossoff, of the John Innes Centre in Norwich, said: \u201cIt\u2019s very sad, but I think it is inevitable that we will see further deaths in the next few days and weeks. Likewise the number of cases is probably going to rise fairly quickly in that same period. \u201cWe are now entering the phase where transmission between people who have not travelled to infected areas will become dominant.\u201d The role of the British Airways workers will raise concerns about the possibility they may have inadvertently spread the disease through surface contact. It is possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection has touched, although it is more likely to be transmitted by other means. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, which is why emphasis is placed on handwashing. The travel industry has already been hit hard by the coronavirus outbreak. The contagion proved the last straw for the Exeter-based airline Flybe, which collapsed into administration on Thursday. On Wednesday, the German airline Lufthansa grounded 150 planes amid low demand. Officials from the Department for International Development hope the \u00a346m pledged will help in the development of the eight possible coronavirus vaccines being worked on by scientists. A rapid diagnostic test could also be used by low-income countries around the world that are not currently able to diagnose the virus at all. No one was has been allowed to leave the Grand Princess cruise ship, which was stuck off the coast of San Francisco, with guests being confined to their rooms pending test results. Meals were delivered to passengers\u2019 cabins and they were given free internet access and extra films to watch on the onboard televisions, Princess Cruises said. Last week, a passenger on its sister ship, the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined in Japan, became the first UK citizen to die from the virus.",

The change could last for several months as experts believe the virus may not peak until April or May, and could last until June or July.</p> \n<p>The move is likely to prove controversial because it will mean that many patients are unable to have a physical examination as part of their consultation, risking some symptoms going undetected.</p> \n<p>The Royal College of GPs made clear that patients who still want to see a GP should be able to do so.</p> \n<p>NHS England has started asking health technology firms such as PushDoctor, Babylon, Docly and Visiba to help surgeries put in place the equipment needed for a massive expansion in remote consultations.</p> \n<p>Many NHS hospital trusts have also started exploring how they could hold outpatient appointments by telephone or digitally as a way of coping with extra pressure they will come under if Britain\u2019s outbreak becomes a pandemic, as senior doctors fear.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2020/03/Preparedness-letter_primary-care_NK_5-March2020.pdf\">letter to GPs</a> on Thursday to update them on its plans to counter Covid-19, NHS England told them to use phone or video consultations to assess people who may have contracted the virus as a way of protecting themselves.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo mitigate any risk that potentially infected patients book appointments online and attend the practice when they should be receiving advice to self-isolate or go through testing, all practices are now being advised to change face-to-face appointments booked online to triage appointments via telephone or video,\u201d wrote Dr Nikita Kanani, a GP and the NHS\u2019s medical director for primary care.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/corona-carousel\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Steve Mowle, the RCGP\u2019s honorary treasurer, said: \u201cAs a profession we will need to think about how best to consult with our patients during this period. We know some practices are ramping up the number of remote consultations they are offering, either online or by phone or video.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat seems like a sensible measure, particularly for initial contact and for appointments that have been booked online. However, these types of consultations have limits, and won\u2019t be suitable for all patients, so there will need to be some degree of flexibility.\u201d</p> \n<p>An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cAnyone who is worried they have coronavirus should check with NHS 111 online, and for any other health concerns, it remains the case that people can see a GP in your local practice.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs a precaution to protect patients, staff and the public, appointments booked online may be followed up with a call by the surgery, to make sure they see the right person in the right place for their illness.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graham Kendall, director of the Digital Healthcare Council, which represents health tech firms, said: \u201cOnline consultations cancel the risk of patients transmitting coronavirus to their GPs, and vice versa.

      "bodyText": "Millions of patients will have face-to-face appointments with their GP replaced by telephone or video consultations under NHS plans to respond to the threat posed by the coronavirus. In a significant policy change, NHS bosses want England\u2019s 7,000 GP surgeries to start conducting as many remote consultations as soon as possible, replacing patient visits with phone, video, online or text contact. They want to reduce the risk of someone infected with Covid-19 turning up at a surgery and free GPs to deal with the extra workload created by the virus. In a pre-emptive move some surgeries, especially in London, have already begun texting patients to tell them not to come in for pre-booked appointments from Monday and that appointments will be conducted by phone instead. The approach could affect many of the 340m appointments a year with GPs and other practice staff, only 1% of which are currently carried out by video, such as Skype. The change could last for several months as experts believe the virus may not peak until April or May, and could last until June or July. The move is likely to prove controversial because it will mean that many patients are unable to have a physical examination as part of their consultation, risking some symptoms going undetected. The Royal College of GPs made clear that patients who still want to see a GP should be able to do so. NHS England has started asking health technology firms such as PushDoctor, Babylon, Docly and Visiba to help surgeries put in place the equipment needed for a massive expansion in remote consultations. Many NHS hospital trusts have also started exploring how they could hold outpatient appointments by telephone or digitally as a way of coping with extra pressure they will come under if Britain\u2019s outbreak becomes a pandemic, as senior doctors fear. In a letter to GPs on Thursday to update them on its plans to counter Covid-19, NHS England told them to use phone or video consultations to assess people who may have contracted the virus as a way of protecting themselves. \u201cTo mitigate any risk that potentially infected patients book appointments online and attend the practice when they should be receiving advice to self-isolate or go through testing, all practices are now being advised to change face-to-face appointments booked online to triage appointments via telephone or video,\u201d wrote Dr Nikita Kanani, a GP and the NHS\u2019s medical director for primary care. Dr Steve Mowle, the RCGP\u2019s honorary treasurer, said: \u201cAs a profession we will need to think about how best to consult with our patients during this period. We know some practices are ramping up the number of remote consultations they are offering, either online or by phone or video. \u201cThat seems like a sensible measure, particularly for initial contact and for appointments that have been booked online. However, these types of consultations have limits, and won\u2019t be suitable for all patients, so there will need to be some degree of flexibility.\u201d An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cAnyone who is worried they have coronavirus should check with NHS 111 online, and for any other health concerns, it remains the case that people can see a GP in your local practice. \u201cAs a precaution to protect patients, staff and the public, appointments booked online may be followed up with a call by the surgery, to make sure they see the right person in the right place for their illness.\u201d Graham Kendall, director of the Digital Healthcare Council, which represents health tech firms, said: \u201cOnline consultations cancel the risk of patients transmitting coronavirus to their GPs, and vice versa. They are also much more convenient for patients and doctors in many cases. If just 5% of GP consultations went digital, there would be 300,000 fewer face-to-face visits to a GP a week \u2013 each of these could be a potential coronavirus transmission. \u201cHowever, NHS Digital figures show that in 2019 less than one in every 100 of all GP appointments was carried out by online video consultation and nearly four in 10 people had no access to online consultations at all. This isn\u2019t because of a lack of technology, but in many, many cases the decision has been taken not to offer this type of consultation to patients.\u201d Push Doctor\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Dan Bunstone, a Cheshire GP, said: \u201cWe are ready and fully prepared to help the NHS \u2013 both GP practices and hospitals \u2013 to cope with the rising tide of demand for online NHS advice and can provide online video consultations at scale across the country immediately. \u201cWe can also quickly and easily mobilise more GPs to hold remote consultations, and rapidly increase the number of daily appointments on offer to ensure that patients are still able to access GP services remotely.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "British universities face a black hole of hundreds of millions of pounds in tuition fees from the impact of coronavirus as international students from China and other severely affected countries are forced to cancel or postpone enrolments. Sources told the Guardian that most universities are planning for new students from China to delay entry until January next year, with online teaching offered. Exams, including English language tests required for visas and university admissions, have been cancelled in China, where 80,000 people have caught coronavirus. In addition, university leaders report that Chinese and other international students are unhappy at the British government\u2019s response to the outbreak, with some asking to suspend their studies, seek a refund and return home. Revelations about the funding deficit faced by universities came as: The number of UK cases rose by 48 to 164 \u2013 the biggest single-day increase \u2013 with two British Airways baggage handlers testing positive. A man in his 80s was confirmed as the second person to have died from the virus in Britain. It emerged that emergency planners have drawn up proposals to deal with \u201cexcess deaths\u201d of between 210,000 and 315,000 nationally over a 15-week period. Face-to-face GP appointments are being replaced by phone or Skype consultations under new NHS plans, with some practices cancelling all in-person appointments. The government asked supermarkets to step up home deliveries to help those self-isolating and said there was no need to stockpile food. Measures under consideration for next week\u2019s budget include short-term tax and VAT holidays for businesses affected by coronavirus and taxpayer support for small businesses whose employees self-isolate. British universities increasingly rely on revenue from international tuition fees, with students from China providing the vast majority of growth. There are more than 120,000 students from China studying in the UK, as well as 17,000 from Hong Kong and Macau, and 8,000 from South Korea and Japan. A 10% fall in enrolments from those regions could cost higher education \u00a3200m or more in lost tuition fees alone. International student fees at British universities can range from \u00a360,000 for MBAs at prestigious institutions such as Oxford\u2019s Said Business School, to about \u00a321,000 a year for a bachelor\u2019s degree at University College London. Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International (UUK), the umbrella group representing British universities, said: \u201cCoronavirus is likely to have a significant impact on this year\u2019s recruitment and admissions cycle for international students, including but not only from China.\u201d Stern said UUK was working with organisations such as the British Council, which administers English language tuition and testing in China and other affected countries such as Vietnam, and the government. \u201cMeasures universities are considering will include greater use of online delivery and delayed start dates. Meanwhile we are engaging with government on a wide range of issues affecting the student recruitment, admissions and visa application cycle,\u201d she said. More than 90,000 new students from China, Hong Kong, South Korea and other affected countries had been expected to arrive on British campuses in September, but universities are braced for substantial numbers of current applicants being unable to travel or to pull out completely. In that scenario, the UK economy would also stand to lose hundreds of millions pounds in lost revenue from spending by international students on accommodation, travel, entertainment and living expenses. Helen Higson, provost and deputy vice-chancellor of Aston University, said the experience of Australia, where the academic year coincided with the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, suggested the impact would have \u201cbig implications\u201d for the cash flow of some British universities. \u201cIn order to address this, institutions are already trying to find ways round this, including more online delivery \u2013 if we can get over the issues of the Chinese firewalls \u2013 [and] moving start dates from September to January,\u201d Higson said. She added that universities were looking at lengthening their pre-sessional English programmes and putting in extra language support to help compensate for the difficulties students faced in taking the English language qualifications, called IELTS. Since the outbreak began, the British Council has closed down IELTS testing in China and several other countries. Other test providers have also shut, while governments have closed schools and colleges. \u201cThe health of our students, customers and colleagues is our priority throughout this rapidly evolving situation. We are responding in line with local government and health authority guidance, continuing to run exams as planned where it is possible to do so. In line with health authority guidance, all exams in China are cancelled until the end of March,\u201d the British Council said. The University of Oxford has advised applicants that it is monitoring the situation. British universities already face uncertainty over links with the EU after Brexit, including continued membership of the mammoth Horizon Europe science funding programme and the Erasmus+ student exchange programme. Higson said the differing approaches to dealing with coronavirus had to be addressed by universities to make international students more comfortable. \u201cAs the official advice from China is to use face masks, the official British advice to focus on hygiene and frequent washing of hands is interpreted by some of our Chinese students as not being strong enough and creates concern with our Chinese students about the official UK response to Covid-19. In turn, this is resulting in some of our Chinese students now believing that it might be safer to return to China rather than staying in the UK,\u201d she said. Students from China, Hong Kong and South Korea are particularly concentrated in a range of taught postgraduate courses, meaning some universities may be forced to cancel masters\u2019 courses because of lack of student numbers.",

      "bodyText": "Concerns have been raised that the government has no clear strategy in place to protect homeless people from catching coronavirus. The homeless charity Crisis, together with the Liberal Democrats, are asking for immediate guidance on how to help rough sleepers who are likely to have pre-existing health conditions that make them vulnerable to the illness. Advice is also needed on how the self-isolation protocol could work for people who live on the streets and how they can regularly wash their hands, they suggest. Matthew Downie, director of policy and external affairs for Crisis, said: \u201cPeople sleeping rough are particularly vulnerable because they are more likely to have a range of existing health conditions and face specific challenges in that they may be unable to regularly wash their hands, nor can they self-isolate if they feel unwell. \u201cThis guidance must set out what measures government is taking to ensure rough sleepers get appropriate health checks, what accommodation will be provided so that people can self-isolate and advice for the public on how best they can support people who are homeless during the coronavirus outbreak.\u201d The Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran has written jointly to the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to seek clarity and urge the government to act. Moran suggests that emergency accommodation should be provided so that people can self-isolate. She said: \u201cThis government does not appear to have thought about the homeless at all in its management of this emergency. Stakeholders and charities are still waiting for information on what the government is going to do. \u201cMeanwhile, members of the public do not know what to do if they find a homeless person who they suspect has Covid-19 \u2013 they want to help, but don\u2019t know how.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019re well prepared to deal with the impacts for Covid-19. We are already working closely with local authorities to support vulnerable groups including homeless people. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the sector and will publish further guidance shortly.\u201d Just weeks ago the government was accused of dramatically under-reporting the scale of rough sleeping following council data showing numbers almost five times higher than Whitehall estimates. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government reported that last year 4,677 people slept outside across the country but council data from freedom of information requests showed almost 25,000 people slept rough in 2019. In the US, health care officials and charity workers who support homeless people on the west coast are already raising similar concerns that coronavirus could seriously affect communities of rough sleepers. They have highlighted that they typically have poor access to doctors and a high prevalence of underlying respiratory problems. Previously there has been a rapid spread of diseases such as typhus and tuberculosis among the homeless in LA because of the likelihood of large numbers of people sleeping close together. So far there have been no outbreaks of the virus in homeless shelters or encampments in the US.",

      "bodyText": "Customers exhibiting cold and flu symptoms have been asked to stay at home in a new statement from The Broadway League. The trade group, which represents major theatres and producers, has requested that anyone feeling sick should opt for a ticket exchange instead. The statement also specifies various measures being taken as coronavirus cases jump to 33 in New York state. \u201cWe have significantly increased the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting in all public and backstage areas beyond the standard daily schedule, and we have added alcohol-based sanitizer dispensers for public use in the lobby of every theatre,\u201d the statement reads. The situation is being closely monitored by the League who are following strategies laid forward by the CDC. They\u2019re also prepared to make decisions \u201cin response to changing conditions\u201d. The onset of the coronavirus lands amid a big box office season for Broadway. Existing productions of Aaron Sorkin\u2019s To Kill A Mockingbird adaptation starring Ed Harris and a Ivo Van Hove\u2019s reinvention of West Side Story have been been breaking records while the next few weeks see premieres of big new shows aiming for Tonys success. Bets include Conor McPherson\u2019s Bob Dylan musical Girl from the North Country, Martin McDonagh\u2019s Hangmen and a musical based on the life and death of Diana, Princess of Wales. \u201cOf course Broadway will be affected, but as with any tragedy or adversity, Broadway will always bounce back,\u201d an anonymous producer said to the Daily Beast this week. \u201cI remember those shows that closed after 9/11, but Broadway didn\u2019t die. It\u2019s a landmark, part of New York City\u2019s landscape.\u201d This week has seen MGM, Eon and Universal deciding to move the new James Bond thriller No Time to Die away from its April release date to November in fears of a box office dent.",
