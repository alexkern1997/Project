These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n

China has 81,782 and Italy is not far behind, with 80,589. </p> \n  <p>There are more than half a million cases worldwide, and one third of the planet\u2019s population is living under lockdown. </p> \n  <p>I will be with you for the next few hours, bringing you the most important developments from around the world. If you see news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment, let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n  <p>A lot has happened in the last few hours. Here are the main developments: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.</strong> Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China with 82,404 reported in the US and 81,782 in China. Italy is third with 80,589.</li> \n   <li><strong>The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed the half a million mark,</strong> according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed cases worldwide is 529,093.</li> \n   <li><strong>Leaders of the G20 industrialised nations committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the world-wide pandemic.</strong> But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF.</li> \n   <li><strong>China has announced it will close its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend</strong>. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, </strong>joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brita</strong><strong>in\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine</strong> as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it.</li> \n   <li><strong>The International Monetary Fund on Thursday asked G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity</strong> to strengthen its response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic that is set to cause a global recession in 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>France </strong><strong>began evacuating coronavirus patients from Alsace using a special high-speed train.</strong> About 20 patients were taken from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions. The move is aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals overwhelmed in Alsace.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO said it sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe. </strong>The World Health Organiszation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. </li> \n   <li><strong>A slower rise in deaths was reported in Spain. </strong>Spain has announced anothera further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise is deaths in Spain is stabilising.</li> \n   <li><strong>India announced a stimulus package. </strong>India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee (\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to millions of people, affected by a nationwide lockdown. </li> \n   <li><strong>Iran posted a record rise in cases. </strong>The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m handing over to the team in Australia now. Thanks so much for joining me. Here are the developments in the global coronavirus outbreak this evening: The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that people should stay at home for two weeks. After many delays, and then a series of tweets earlier today, US president Donald Trump announced he was invoking the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to build ventilators for hospitals. Following the news that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had tested positive for Covid-19, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed that he too has coronavirus. Both are experiencing mild symptoms and are in self-isolation. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, says he is also experiencing symptoms and has gone into isolation. Tests for healthcare workers in the UK will be rolled out next week, allowing them to confirm whether they have been infected or are safe to work, the British government has announced. Social distancing appears to be keeping the coronavirus at bay in British Columbia \u2014 a rare moment of positive news as cases around the world continue to surge. The daily rate of growth of coronavirus cases in the Canadian province has been cut from 24% to 12%, far lower than that of China and Italy during their severe outbreaks. Brazil\u2019s polemicist president Jair Bolsonaro has sparked further outrage by insinuating that the number of coronavirus cases is being inflated for political purposes and declaring: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Thousands of Australians caught by India\u2019s dramatic nationwide shutdown say they face running out of food and water or being evicted from accommodation, as 1.3 billion people across the world\u2019s second-most populous nation are ordered to stay indoors. In the UK, the Principality stadium in Wales is to be converted into a temporary hospital providing around 2,000 additional beds to support the NHS. Virgin Atlantic is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid to keep afloat during the coronavirus crisis, after the chancellor told the stricken aviation sector this week he would consider assisting firms on a case-by-case basis. After many delays, and then a series of tweets earlier today, US President Donald Trump is invoking the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals, he announced at the White House\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing. The Defense Production Act gives the president powers to direct domestic industrial production to provide essential materials and goods needed in a national security crisis. It allows the president to require businesses and corporations to prioritize and accept contracts for required materials and services. While Trump likes to work cooperatively with the private sector, he said, \u201cWhere an emergency exists and it\u2019s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly, we will do what we have to do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a brutal pandemic,\u201d Trump said at the beginning of the briefing. Read more from the White House briefing in our US liveblog: The Irish government has announced sweeping restrictions that will put Ireland in a de facto lockdown to try to slow the spread of coronavirus. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. People will be allowed to leave home to shop for food and exercise briefly within 2km of their homes, he said in a televised address. All public or private gatherings are banned, as are visits to hospitals and prisons, with some exceptions on compassionate grounds. People aged over 70 and vulnerable groups must \u201ccocoon\u201d and travel to offshore islands will be limited to residents. There are exceptions for farming, travel to and from work for essential work that cannot be done from home, caring for elderly or vulnerable people, and collecting medicine and attending medical appointments. Jordan reported the first death from coronavirus, a woman in her 80s, according to Reuters, quoting the state news agency. Jordan registered 23 new cases on Friday, bringing the total in the country to 235, the health minister said. Today\u2019s Australian live blog has launched covering developments there, including possible strict new measures for Victoria and New South Wales. Brazil\u2019s polemicist president Jair Bolsonaro has sparked further outrage by insinuating that the number of coronavirus cases here is being inflated for political purposes and declaring: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d Bolsonaro is facing furious criticism for his slaphappy handling of the coronavirus crisis, which he continues to dismiss as overblown and has called a media \u201ctrick\u201d. But on Friday afternoon \u2014 as the death toll here rose to 92, with 3,417 cases \u2014 he doubled down on his position telling Brazilian television he suspected those figures were being inflated by a political rival and denounced coronavirus \u201calarmism\u201d. Bolsonaro subsequently admitted lives would be lost but added: \u201cThat\u2019s life.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t shut down a car factory because people die in traffic accidents,\u201d Bolsonaro said. Brazil\u2019s far-right leader \u2014 who is pushing for tough lockdown measures to be lifted in states across the country \u2014 is facing growing fury from across the political spectrum and the country\u2019s media. In an article titled \u201cTrial of the future\u201d, the Brazilian writer Ruy Castro captured the revolt: \u201cThere\u2019s a sense that, if Jair Bolsonaro isn\u2019t tied to a tree and gagged, before making any more disastrous moves, the cost in lives will be incalculable. But one day these lives will be counted.\u201d Castro added: \u201cEvery single member of the government who, with their deeds or words, opposed the policy of social distancing and helped coronavirus spread will have to pay the price ... It isn\u2019t right to call Jair Bolsonaro irresponsible. He is the person most responsible for whatever happens in Brazil \u2014 and he will have to answer for it.\u201d Social distancing appears to be keeping the coronavirus at bay in a Canadian province \u2014 a rare moment of positive news as cases around the world continue to surge. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to over-call it, but I do believe we\u2019ve seen a flattening, a falling-off of that curve,\u201d said Bonnie Henry, British Columbia\u2019s top medical officer. Speaking to reporters Friday, Henry said the extreme measures taken by the province in recent weeks\u2014shutting down schools, non-essential businesses\u2014 have shown promising results. \u201cWhat we need, though, is for everybody to continue to pay attention to these measures so we can continue to prevent transmissions in our communities ... for the coming weeks.\u201d The daily rate of growth of coronavirus cases in the province has been cut from 24% to 12%, far lower than that of China and Italy during their severe outbreaks. The updated figures comes amid a report from the province that suggests it is well-equipped to handle a Hubei-like breakout of infections. A level of spread similar to that of Italy\u2019s Lombardy region, however, would stress the system\u2014 but the province nonetheless believes it has sufficient ventilators. More than 4,600 cases have been reported in Canada, with 725 in British Columbia as of Thursday. Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus, state-run Ikhbariya TV reported, citing the interior minister. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system, Reuters reports. The travel restriction, effective from Sunday, comes on top of a curfew announced this week from 6pm to 6am and after the country has halted flights and ordered the closure of most businesses. Humanitarian agencies have expressed deep concern over the prospect of coronavirus spreading in Syria\u2019s northwest, where hundreds of thousands of people displaced by war live in tightly packed camps and have severely limited access to healthcare. In the UK, the Principality Stadium in Wales is to be converted into a temporary hospital providing around 2,000 additional beds to support the NHS, PA media reports. The Welsh Rugby Union, which owns and operates the venue, has been working with the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board as part of contingency planning around the ongoing coronavirus crisis. The facility is now being assessed by specialists and contractors to complete the transformation. This follows the news that Birmingham\u2019s NEC arena and Manchester\u2019s G-Mex will also be converted into field hospitals. US President Donald Trump has publicly ranted at car-manufacturing giant General Motors over a delay in its production of ventilators. There has been some suggestions he could invoke the Defense Production Act, which allows the federal government to direct industries. His tweet comes a day after he dismissed demands from governors for more ventilators and said New York, which is the epicentre of the crisis in the US, was exaggerating the need. The state of New York pleaded to be sent 30,000 ventilators to help with its growing numbers of coronavirus patients. A further three people with coronavirus have died in Ireland, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 22, the National Public Health Emergency Team has announced. The latest victims were described as a person in the north-west of the country and two females in the east. There were 302 new confirmed cases of coronavirus announced on Friday evening, taking the total in Ireland to 2,121. This is Nicola Slawson, taking over from my colleague Simon Murphy. I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date this evening on the situation around the world. You can get in touch with me via Twitter or by email nicola.slawson@theguardian.com. I might not have time to reply but I will certainly give emails and messages a read. Biggest daily rise in UK coronavirus deaths The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths. In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases. Matt Hancock, the UK\u2019s health secretary, tests positive Following the news that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, had tested positive for Covid-19, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, confirmed that he too has coronavirus. Both are experiencing mild symptoms and are in self-isolation. Italy records highest daily rise in deaths and has not yet reached peak, experts say Italy also recorded its highest daily rise in Covid-19 deaths, with 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended. France extends lockdown by a fortnight France \u2013 which has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours \u2013 has extended its lockdown until 15 April, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. Four dead on cruise ship after outbreak Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed. US approves $2.2tn economic stimulus package Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage. In Greece, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 966, according to the government. The figure marks an increase of 74 new cases that emerged last night. But experts also point out that in the absence of widespread testing (only 13,477 people have been tested for the virus so far), the real number is almost certainly higher. Giving his daily update, Prof Sotiris Tsiodras, the health ministry spokesman on coronavirus, said the death toll had also gone up, with 28 fatalities recorded as of Friday. Of that number 23 were men, said the professor, an infectious diseases expert who is advising the centre-right government on how best to contain the spread of transmissions. The average age of those who had died was 73, he said, adding that while 66 of the total number of patients confirmed as having Covid-19 were in intensive care, 52 people had also made a full recovery. \u201cThe fast implementation of measures [to contain the disease] has saved our country from many deaths,\u201d he said, emphasising that although the trajectory was currently under control it was vital that the general population remained vigilant. \u201cEvery day we win small victories but the battle continues.\u201d Greece was among the very first countries in Europe to apply stringent restrictions, with officials recognising that after years of steep staff and budget cuts, the price of the country\u2019s near decade-long debt crisis, the state health system was in no position to deal with a significant public health crisis. There have been 299 coronavirus deaths in France in the last 24 hours, it has been announced. Releasing the latest set of figures, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, head of the French health authority, revealed there were now 32,964 confirmed Covid-19 cases, 3,809 more than the previous day. There have been 1,995 deaths in hospital, an increase of 299 in 24 hours. This is lower than the big jump of 365 deaths in 24 hours that Salomon announced on Thursday evening. There are 15,732 people in hospital, with 3,787 in intensive care. One third are under 60 years old and 42 of those in intensive care are under 30 years old. Salomon said the \u201cgood news\u201d was that about 5,700 people who had the Covid-19 virus had recovered. In the UK, Virgin Atlantic is applying for hundreds of millions of pounds in state aid to keep afloat during the coronavirus crisis, after the chancellor told the stricken aviation sector this week he would consider assisting firms on a case-by-case basis. As a purely long-haul, passenger airline, Sir Richard Branson\u2019s carrier has been hard hit by the travel bans and does not have the cash reserves of larger rivals such as British Airways or even EasyJet. Virgin led calls for state aid for airlines two weeks ago, as bookings dropped to near zero. Virtually all staff have accepted unpaid leave and Branson has said he will inject $250m (\u00a3201m) across the group, including the unfortunately timed launch of his Virgin Voyage cruise line. The airline declined to comment but is understood to have approached the government via bankers Rothschild for a package worth hundreds of millions of pounds in commercial loans and guarantees. The \u2018special relationship\u2019 appears to be alive and well as US president Donald Trump has wished the UK prime minister Boris Johnson a speedy recovery from coronavirus during a phone call on Friday. \u201cThey agreed to work together closely, along with the G7, the G20, and other international partners, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Downing Street said in a statement. Johnson and health secretary Matt Hancock have both contracted Covid-19, it emerged earlier. More on the situation in the US, as my colleague Jonathan Freedland skewers Donald Trump in a newly posted comment piece in which he accuses the US president of putting his ego first in his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He writes: The US president always was capricious and vengeful, but now that character flaw is a matter of life and death. State governors are crying out for federal help, not for themselves but for the people they represent: the nurses and doctors who need protective equipment and testing kits, the patients who need ventilators. But instead of leaping to their aid, Trump tells the governors it\u2019s their responsibility, even though they have a fraction of the procurement power of the US government \u2013 adding that if they want help, they\u2019d better grovel. \u2018It\u2019s a two-way street,\u2019 Trump said this week. \u2018They have to treat us well.\u2019 Even when lives are on the line, his ego with its paper-thin skin comes first. Another country, another lockdown. Zimbabwe, which has five confirmed coronavirus cases including one death, will impose a nationwide lockdown for 21 days from Monday to help curb the spread of Covid-19, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said. Only state and health workers will be exempted from the lockdown, he added. In other news, it emerges a global shortage in condoms is looming because of the coronavirus pandemic, the world\u2019s biggest producer has said. Karex Berhad, which makes one in every five condoms globally, has not produced a single condom in its three Malaysian factories for more than a week because of a lockdown imposed by the government to halt the spread of the virus, Reuters reports. That is already a shortfall of 100m condoms \u2013 normally marketed internationally by brands such as Durex \u2013 supplied to state healthcare systems such as the NHS in the UK or distributed by aid programmes such as the UN Population Fund. A striking image of Pope Francis praying in the middle of an empty St Peter\u2019s Square in the Vatican City has emerged. Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama amid a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed. A boat-to-boat rescue operation is under way near the entrance to the Panama canal to help healthy passengers off the Zaandam cruise liner, where two people have tested positive for the disease and another 138 have influenza-like symptoms. Holland America Line, which owns the cruise ship, confirmed that four elderly passengers had died onboard. It is not clear whether they died after catching Covid-19. All 1,243 guests have been asked to self isolate while a boat-to-boat operation to move healthy passengers to another ship, the Rotterdam, takes place off the coast of Panama. Guests over the age of 70 are being given priority, the company confirmed. On Friday, Ricaurte V\u00e1squez, the administrator for the Panama canal, told local media that the Zaandam would be put into quarantine if testing confirmed a Covid-19 outbreak and said the cruise ship would not be allowed through the canal while positive cases were on board, following an order from the ministry of health. The Panamanian Maritime Authority said it was supervising the rescue operation, adding that nobody on board would be allowed to disembark in the Central American country. In a statement, Holland America Line said: \u201cYesterday a number of patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for Covid-19 and two individuals tested positive. Out of an abundance of caution, on March 22 when Zaandam first saw a number of guests reporting to the medical center with influenza-like illness symptoms, we took immediate protective measures, including asking all guests to self-isolate in their staterooms and implementing all other appropriate precautions that have been developed in coordination with the CDC. All guests and crew received face masks yesterday and were provided with instructions on when and how to wear them. \u201cCurrently, 53 guests (4%) and 85 crew (14%) have reported to Zaandam\u2019s medical center with influenza-like illness symptoms. There are 1,243 guests and 586 crew on board ... \u201cHolland America Line can confirm that four older guests have passed away on Zaandam. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families and we are doing everything we can to support them during this difficult time.\u201d Holland America Line said those with family members on board should contact for information: +1 (877) 425-2231 or +1 (206) 626-7398. In a move that will puzzle many, Sweden has refused to shut bars and restaurants amid the coronavirus pandemic. Reuters reports on the situation on the ground in the country\u2019s capital, Stockholm: The words \u201cDO NOT STAND HERE! TABLE SERVICE ONLY!\u201d are scrawled in white marker across the bar\u2019s wooden counter, which only weeks ago was littered with beer mats and crowded with elbows. While the global spread of coronavirus has closed pubs right across Europe, Sweden has hung back, with authorities on Tuesday saying bars and restaurants could stay open \u2013 but only if customers are seated and served at a table. \u201cThis is completely new for both us and our customers... We have 26 taps of beer, which often change, so it\u2019s a little bit confusing when people can\u2019t approach the bar,\u201d Wirstroms owner Martin Hession, 49, told Reuters. Hession said that despite remaining open his sales are down 75% compared with March last year, forcing him to sack most of his staff. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be closed ... I can\u2019t understand why the government wants us to stay open while pubs and restaurants are going bankrupt,\u201d he added, as he rushed between the tables and bars of his labyrinthine pub in Stockholm\u2019s old town. Sweden has like most other countries asked people to maintain so-called \u201csocial distancing\u201d, particularly in pubs. \u201cKeeping two metres apart is absolutely easy for us, even natural,\u201d said Asa Jacobsson, 47, as she sipped white wine by a window seat in Hjartats bar, on Stockholm\u2019s trendy Sodermalm Island. The German government has reacted to criticism, particularly from southern Europe, that it has been acting only in its own self-interest since the start of the coronavirus crisis, by increasing its help to the EU\u2019s worst-hit countries. A total of 123 intensive care patients suffering from the virus from France and Spain are to be admitted to German hospitals, a spokesman for the foreign ministry has said. Seventy-three beds have already been made available for Italians with the illness. In addition protective clothing including masks and overalls are on their way to France, Italy, Austria and Switzerland. According to the government\u2019s Europe minister, Michael Roth, 100,000 face masks are being sent to Romania, and 60,000 to Sweden. German foreign minister Heiko Maas said in an interview with the Italian daily Corriere della Sera: \u201cEU solidarity is the order of the day\u201d. He added that last week deliveries of seven tonnes of relief supplies, including ventilation and anaesthetic equipment had already been sent. \u201cAnd more is to follow,\u201d he said A new Brazilian hip hop video attacks Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro for inertia over the coronavirus pandemic, warns of the risks crowded favelas place from coronavirus and calls on people to stay in isolation to protect themselves. \u201cThe WHO [World Health Organization] gave the warning,\u201d raps MV Bill in \u2018Quarantena\u2019 (\u2018Quarantine\u2019), released on youtube on Friday. \u201cThe head of state played it down. Delayed. They lost time on things that don\u2019t matter. Anyone with a clue about the virus is scared, I know. Incompetence comes first, yes.\u201d Other tracks by Bill \u2013 real name Alex Barbosa, 46 - have addressed the harsh realities of favela life. He told The Guardian that Bolsonaro is \u201cout of step with the rest of the world\u201d for playing down the risks of the virus \u2013 which he has called \u201ca little flu\u201d. \u201cAt a time like this we need someone balanced,\u201d he said. \u201cToday in my opinion a doctor or infectious diseases specialist is more of an authority than any head of state.\u201d The song was recorded alone in his apartment near Rio\u2019s City of God favela. In its video Barbosa, who also presents cable TV show Hip Hop Brazil, washes his hands with alcohol gel and dons mask and gloves as he warns of the importance of quarantine. \u201cIn the favela, for us Covid is different. The houses aren\u2019t big and generally there\u2019s a lot of people. Inevitable crowding. Some places still don\u2019t have drinking water. Take care there. There won\u2019t be room in intensive care,\u201d he raps. Italy has recorded its highest daily rise in COVID-19 deaths, with 919 new fatalities. It brings the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll to 9,134. More than 500 of those deaths are in Lombardy alone, according to Sky. It comes after the head of the country\u2019s national health institute earlier said Covid-19 infections have not yet reached their peak in Italy, warning that lockdown measures would have to be extended. The failure of EU leaders to agree on an economic rescue plan to address the devastating fall-out of coronavirus has been met with anger and trepidation among the bloc\u2019s poorer members, not least Greece which had only just begun to recover from its long-running debt drama when the public health crisis hit. The leftist former finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos, who navigated the country through some of its toughest years after replacing Yanis Varoufakis, had some especially choice words today for the Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte after he appeared point blank to reject the idea of issuing joint debt to assist the Union\u2019s financial recovery. The Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has been quoted to have said yesterday .... that he \u2018cannot foresee any circumstances in which the Netherlands will accept eurobonds\u2019. He is worthy of the Chamberlain-Daladier award, given to the politician who has made a significant contribution to the destruction of the European idea and European values,\u201d said the British-educated Tskalotos, a leading member of the main opposition Syriza party who is also shadow finance minister. I recall that Chamberlain and Daladier, prime ministers of Britain and France respectively in the 1930s, refused to recognize the existential threat of Nazism and persisted with the strategy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler, with, as we know, catastrophic consequences. The Dutch Prime Minister\u2019s stance in denying solidarity in this crisis is an existential threat to Europe and its ability to get out of this situation with a sense of common future.If he succeeds, along with the leaders of Germany, he will rightly be included in the Pantheon of European leaders who have done their utmost not only to undermine European values but also their own countries.\u201d The Greek economy, like that of all EU member states, is expected to shrink dramatically this year as a result of the novel virus. There have been more than half a million confirmed Covid-19 cases worldwide and in excess of 20,000 deaths, says the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, who is giving a press conference live. More than 100,000 have recovered from the disease, Dr Tedros Adhanom adds. More from Canada, as it emerges people who can\u2019t afford April\u2019s or May\u2019s rent thanks to COVID-19 crisis unemployment are being asked to hang a white sheet outside their homes to demand a rent strike. The protest movement - which started in Montreal last week and has already spread across Canada and the US, demands governments pause housing payments while the pandemic ravages people\u2019s ability to earn income. \u201cWe want landlords and tenants to come together in asking the government for cancellation of rent payments and cancellation of mortgage payments, including interest, for the duration of the health emergency,\u201d said Sunny Doyle, one of the organisers of White Sheets For the Rent Strike. \u201cWe can\u2019t be putting people in individualised fights with their landlords, where the power relations aren\u2019t equal.\u201d Doyle said her landlady agreed to hang a huge white sheet off the side of the triplex they share. She said even those who can afford their rent are invited to hang a sheet in support. With many provinces now under lockdown, Canada anticipates it will see four million jobless claims by the time the COVID-19 crisis is over. This week, the Canadian government announced a $2,000 monthly benefit for citizens put out of work by the virus. France has extended its coronavirus lockdown by two weeks until 15 April, Edouard Philippe said in a speech. The prime minister said: After these first 10 days of confinement, it is clear that we are just at the beginning of this epidemic wave. It has submerged eastern France and now it is arriving in the Paris region and northern France. For this reason, he said, the confinement period would be extended by two weeks from Tuesday next week, and added that the same rules would apply. He added that this period would only be extended again if the health situation required it. Canada will dramatically scale up support for small businesses amid criticism its policies are falling short as the coronavirus continues to jolt the country\u2019s economy. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister, unveiled plans to cover 75% of employee wages for small business \u2013 up from an initial 10% \u2013 in order to discourage companies from laying off staff. \u201cIt is becoming clear that we need to do more \u2013much more,\u201d he said, announcing the multibillion-dollar plan. The move brings Canada in line with a number of European nations that have also pledged to backstop the payrolls. In the last week, nearly 1 million Canadians applied for unemployment benefits. Trudeau\u2019s attempts to reassure small business owners follows a move by British Columbia to assume control of the province\u2019s supply chains as Covid-19 cases across the country continue to surge. In recent days, fears have grown \u2013 both within government and the general public \u2013 of looming shortages of essential goods in grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals. \u201cThe steps we\u2019re taking today are unprecedented. But I find myself saying that almost every day,\u201d premier John Horgan told reporters. The province, like all others in the country, is under a state of emergency as it battles coronavirus \u2013 including an outbreak at a retirement centre. Until recently, British Columbia also had suffered the most fatalities in the country. Trudeau has so far declined to invoke the rarely used Emergencies Act, which would unify country\u2019s approach to tackling the virus. Instead, he has allowed provinces to enact their own measures \u2013 and relief programmes \u2013 to combat Covid-19. Canada has recorded more than 4,000 cases of Covid-19 and 39 deaths. In these dark times, stories have been popping up across the globe of individuals trying to lift each other out of the gloom. In Spain, one man whose video of himself serenading neighbours on the piano from his balcony, which has been viewed nearly 1m times, says he is just happy he could help people forget the crisis engulfing the world \u2026 even if only for a few minutes. The clip, taken while 37-year-old computer programmer Alberto Gestosowas was confined at home in Barcelona under Spain\u2019s state of emergency, has been featured on national media in a country hard hit by the pandemic. \u201cOne neighbour asked me if he could join on the saxophone. I\u2019d never even seen him before,\u201d he said of the video, which features Barcelona\u2019s Sagrada Familia basilica in the background. \u201cIn the end I played [the theme from] Titanic and he joined me mid-song. If such a lovely, viral video can make people forget \u2013 if only for a little while, for five minutes \u2013 about the coronavirus and always talking about the same thing, then that\u2019s great. He is among dozens of musicians and singers across Spain who have regaled neighbours with music, since the government imposed strict lockdown measures on 14 March in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus, reports Reuters. A particularly troubling story has emerged in the US where a man who is believed to have been the first teenager in the country to die from complications from coronavirus was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance. It appears icy relations between Washington and Beijing are thawing as Chinese president Xi Jinping told Donald Trump on Friday that he would have China\u2019s support in fighting the coronavirus. There has been a long-running war of words as Trump and some US officials have accused China of a lack of transparency on the virus, and the US president has at times called Covid-19 the \u201cChina virus\u201d as it originated there, angering Beijing. In the call, Xi reiterated to Trump that China had been open and transparent about the epidemic, according to an account of the conversation published by the Chinese foreign ministry, Reuters reports. The US has now overtaken other nations with the most coronavirus cases in the world, with nearly 85,000 infections. Meanwhile, Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak emerged, which had been on lockdown for more than two months, was open to incoming traffic late on Friday, although cars were not allowed to leave. Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, removed border restrictions on Wednesday for all but Wuhan, which will allow people to leave the city from 8 April. Reuters reports that at a checkpoint entering the city on Friday night, three lanes were open to traffic but there were few cars, with a lone figure in military fatigues standing at each lane checking the mobile phone health codes of arriving passengers. In Italy, the frontline of Europe\u2019s battle against Covid-19, disease infections have not yet reached their peak, according to the head of the country\u2019s national health institute, who warned that lockdown measures would have to be extended. The country has reported 8,215 deaths of people who contracted the coronavirus, with the total confirmed cases topping 80,000. \u201cWe haven\u2019t reached the peak and we haven\u2019t passed it,\u201d the chief of the Superior Health Institute, Silvio Brusaferro, said, adding that there were however \u201csigns of a slowdown\u201d in the numbers of people becoming infected. \u201cWhen the descent begins, how steep it is will depend on our behaviour,\u201d Brusaferro said, referring to how strictly Italians will continue to respect a government-imposed lockdown. Italy was the first western country to introduce swingeing restrictions on movement after uncovering the outbreak five weeks ago. It has progressively tightened the curbs, banning all non-essential activities until at least next Friday, according to Reuters. Here\u2019s some context to Brusaferro\u2019s comments, as FT\u2019s John-Burn-Murdoch charts the death toll rise globally and across individual nations, including Italy. As Brazil\u2019s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro calls on people to return to work despite the advice of medical experts, his government is rolling out a propaganda video with the hashtag Brazil Can\u2019t Stop (#OBrasilN\u00e3oPodePara). The clip, which shows beaming Brazilian workers and professionals, has been shared on Bolsonarista WhatsApp and the president\u2019s son, senator Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, posted it on his Facebook. Bolsonaro has been widely condemned for his response to the crisis, which he has dismissed as a fantasy and a \u201cmedia trick\u201d. In a Facebook Live broadcast on Thursday night, Bolsonaro pointed to rising unemployment in the United States \u2013 which has overtaken China as the country with most cases of coronavirus \u2013 as the reason Brazil needed to get back to work. \u201cThis problem has already started here,\u201d he said, comparing lockdown measures to \u201cthat chemotherapy equipment\u201d treatment for cancer. \u201cThey are killing the patient to combat the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout money I am dying of hunger, man, dying of hunger. Suicide. Violence comes next.\u201d Bolsonaro also shared a video on Facebook of a parade of cars demonstrating for a return to work in Balne\u00e1rio Cambori\u00fa in Santa Catarina state, southern Brazil. Santa Catarina state will allow restaurants, bars, gyms, shopping centres and shops to open from 1 April, the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper said. Mato Grosso and Rond\u00f4nia states \u2013 also run by rightwing governors \u2013 have announced similar measures. But Brazilian coronavirus cases continued to rise \u2013 to 2,991 cases and 77 deaths. And a researcher for the government research institute Fiocruz said hospitalisations for respiratory problems had exploded since the first coronavirus case was confirmed, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported. There were 2,250 cases from March 15-21, nearly 10 times the norm. Here\u2019s a separate report from colleagues Tom Phillips and Caio Barretto Briso in Rio de Janeiro. In the Middle East, 269 coronavirus cases have been reported today in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt. The Saudi Arabian health ministry announced 92 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, pushing the total number of positive cases to 1,104 in the kingdom, its health ministry said in a statement. Iraqi officials reported 76 new coronavirus cases, in last 24 hours, taking the total number of infections to 485. Four patients have also been died after contracting coronavirus in the same period, increasing the total number deaths to 40, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. A further 122 patients have recovered. In Lebanon, health officials said 23 more patients have tested positive for Covid-19 in last 24 hours, meaning the total number of confirmed cases stands at 391. One patient died, taking the total number deaths to seven. Oman reported 22 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, pushing the total number to 131. Of the 22 cases, 10 patients had direct contact with previously infected cases, eight are related to travel, and four are under investigation, the Omani health ministry said in a statement. Some 23 patients have been recovered so far. Kuwait announced 17 new coronavirus cases in last 24 hours, meaning the total number of infections is now 225. Five cases are Kuwaiti nationals related to travel to USA, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France and Jordan. Nine cases were in contact with confirmed cases and three are under investigation, the health ministry of the country said in a statement. Eleven patients are in critical condition. Egypt\u2019s health ministry has reported 39 new coronavirus cases and three deaths, pushing the total number of infections to 495. The UK has recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths for the second day running. In the last 24 hours, 181 have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The death toll in the UK stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases. Of the 181 new UK deaths, a further 168 people in England who tested positive for Covid-19 have died. According to NHS England, the patients were aged between 29 and 98 years old and all but four \u2013 aged between 82 and 91 \u2013 had underlying health conditions. In Indonesia \u2013 the world\u2019s fourth most populous country \u2013 the government has performed a policy U-turn and pledged to impose lockdowns to control the coronavirus after the biggest one-day surge in confirmed cases. After previously restricting tougher restrictions, Indonesia\u2019s chief security minister Mahfud MD said on Friday the national government would allow regional authorities to impose lockdowns to stem the spread of Covid-19. According to Reuters, the security chief also said the government was mulling a plan to ban \u201cmudik\u201d \u2013 the practice that sees millions of Indonesians leave towns and cities for their native villages at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in May. It comes after the country announced on Friday its biggest one-day surge in coronavirus cases, up 153 to 1,046. The country, which has a population of 260 million, has conducted just 4,336 tests. One model by infectious disease experts suggests there are as many as 50,000 cases. Indonesia\u2019s government has previously been reluctant to embrace the stricter containment strategies of other nations, and President Joko Widodo\u2019s policy has been to encourage social distancing while not imposing tighter restrictions on movement. But on Thursday, its eastern province of Papua defied Jakarta by closing its airports, sea ports and land borders for 14 days in an attempt to prevent the disease spreading. After the central government initially sought to over-rule Papua\u2019s moves, Mahfud said on Friday that Jakarta would now issue a regulation allowing regional governments to impose a strict quarantine on their territory. In a later statement obtained by Reuters, Mahfud said the government was approving a \u201cregional quarantine\u201d, not a lockdown. Social care is an area of huge concern at the best of times but, all over the world, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought it into sharp focus. In northern Portugal, the plight of elderly residents in a care home \u2013 where most have tested positive for the coronavirus and others are awaiting results \u2013 has prompted the government to send in the army to avert what desperate staff fear could be a disaster in the making. \u201cWe want help. We want to test people,\u201d one worker at the Nossa Senhora das Dores care home in Vila Real shouted from the window on Tuesday, according to Reuters. City mayor Rui Santos said he had appealed for urgent government support in evacuating the home. As soon as everyone is out, soldiers will disinfect the facility, Santos added. Portugal has reported 4,268 confirmed cases of the virus so far, with 76 deaths. At least eight care homes across the country have already had many residents and workers affected and several deaths, mainly in the north. Meanwhile, in neighbouring Spain, workers fear a similar situation. \u201cOur homes were underresourced and understaffed before all this happened,\u201d Rui Fontes, president of an association training care home workers, told Reuters. \u201cI bet you we\u2019ll find bodies in homes soon ourselves as well.\u201d In Jersey, estimated to have a population of nearly 107,000, so far 46 people have tested positive for Covid-19, with one death. It represents an increase of 14 positive cases in the last 24 hours. Social distancing measures are in place across the island, with the government committing an additional \u00a3100m in funding during the next three months to keep its people in work. Flags will be flown at half-mast in cities across Italy to commemorate the victims of coronavirus as the disease continues to devastate the country. \u201cOn Tuesday 31 March, at 12pm, flags at half-staff and a minute of silence to be observed by Italian mayors with the tricolor sash in front of their city hall,\u201d the president of municipalities association ANCI Antonio Decaro announced on Twitter. The overall death toll in Italy grew by 662 to 8,165, the civil protection agency said on Thursday, down from 683 on Wednesday and 743 on Tuesday. The number of new infections had fallen nationally in recent days but rose on Thursday to 4,492, from 3,491 the day before. Meanwhile, another doctor has died from coronavirus in Bergamo, bringing the number of health workers who have died from Covid-19 to 44 since the outbreak began. The virus has infected more than 5,000 doctors, nurses, technicians, ambulance staff and other health employees. The majority were on the frontline in the badly affected northern regions and contracted the illness at the start of the outbreak when protective equipment was lacking. The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said on Friday that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy is approaching. \u201cWe have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since March 20 but we are not yet in a downward phase,\u201d said Silvio Brusaferro, the ISS president. In India, the second biggest nation on the planet with a population of 1.3 billion people, testing rates have been abysmally low compared with western nations. As of today, Indian authorities have confirmed 691 positive cases among 26,798 people tested, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. Now health authorities are setting up coronavirus call centres across the country in a bid to stop people overwhelming hospitals demanding immediate tests for Covid-19. According to Reuters, doctors and medical students have been recruited to run virtual diagnostic facilities and prescribe preventive care in more than 30 languages to ensure hospitals are seeing just the most severe cases rather than everyone worrying about possible infection. It follows Narendra Modi telling the population to self-isolate indoors for three weeks as part of a massive lockdown. In the Netherlands, the coronavirus death toll has risen to 546, with 112 new deaths. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has also increased by 1,172 to 8,603 \u2013 a 16% rise. But the increase in the rate of the spread of the virus appears to be slowing, according to the Netherlands National Institute for Health (RIVM) in its daily update. It said it hoped to be able to say \u201cwithin several days\u201d whether social distancing and other measures taken mid-month were working to slow the outbreak\u2019s spread, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, in Switzerland, the death toll from coronavirus hit 197 on Friday, the health ministry said, up from 161 on Thursday. It comes as the country makes drugs including painkillers from strategic reserves available to cover growing demand. The number of Covid-19 cases increased to 12,161 from 10,714 on Thursday. There are reports of dramatic conditions at hospitals in the Alsace region, the epicentre of the Covid-19 epidemic in France. According to a report by the German Institute for Disaster Medicine, compiled following a visit to the University Clinic in Strasbourg and seen by German news agency dpa, medics in the hard-hit region were no longer ventilating patients aged over 80 but were merely offering \u201cterminal care\u201d with opiates and barbiturates. The report said the hospital in Strasbourg was facing a mass influx of new patients at an hourly rate and that medics were continuing to offer care even after they themselves had been infected with the virus. The Strasbourg clinic on Friday rejected some of the details in the report, saying the overall condition of patients was crucial for prioritising access to ventilators, not age, and that the hospital had acquired new ventilators. Brigitte Klinkert, the president of the French departement Haut-Rhin, confirmed that Alsace hospitals were forced to triage care, meaning some patients were prioritised because of a limited number of ventilators. \u201cWe have already been practising triage for two weeks,\u201d Klinkert told German newspaper Die Welt. \u201cYou can\u2019t say it often enough, because it isn\u2019t just the German neighbours but also the French outside Alsace who still aren\u2019t taking the situation seriously.\u201d Researchers in Germany, where the number of confirmed infections is at over 47,400 and 286 deaths by lunchtime, have proposed a mass study into how many people are immune to the Covid-19 virus, in an effort to allow those for whom it is safe to do so, to return to leading a normal life. According to Spiegel magazine, which has seen the preparations for the study, which is awaiting the approval of authorities, researchers hope to be able to test the blood of more than 100,000 volunteers for Covid-19 antibodies from mid-April. The test would be repeated on the same volunteers and expanded to use different groups, at regular intervals, in order to oversee how the pandemic is progressing. The scientists \u2013 a team compiled from various bodies, including the government\u2019s leading public health body, the Robert Koch Institute, the German Centre for Infection Research, blood donation services, and the Institute for Virology at the Charite hospital in Berlin - hope to discover the extent to which Covid-19, or Sarvs-CoV-2 has already spread, and how many infected people it really kills. The results of the study would make it easier to decide for instance, when schools should reopen, and large-scale events be allowed to take place, the authors say. If everything goes to plan, the first results would be available by the end of April. \u201cThose who are immune could be issued with a sort of \u2018immune pass\u2019 that would allow people to be excluded from the restrictive measures currently in place\u201d G\u00e9rard Krause, an epidemologist from the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig, told Der Spiegel. A short while ago, Associated Press filed this troubling report from Tehran, the Iranian capital where people are drinking toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it will combat the coronavirus. Standing over the still body of an intubated 5-year-old boy wearing nothing but a plastic diaper, an Iranian health care worker in a hazmat suit and mask begged the public for just one thing: Stop drinking industrial alcohol over fears about the new coronavirus. The boy, now blind after his parents gave him toxic methanol in the mistaken belief it protects against the virus, is just one of hundreds of victims of an epidemic inside the pandemic now gripping Iran. Iranian media reports nearly 300 people have been killed and more than 1,000 sickened so far by ingesting methanol across the Islamic Republic, where drinking alcohol is banned and where those who do rely on bootleggers. It comes as fake remedies spread across social media in Iran, where people remain deeply suspicious of the government after it downplayed the crisis for days before it overwhelmed the country. \u201cThe virus is spreading and people are just dying off, and I think they are even less aware of the fact that there are other dangers around,\u201d said Dr. Knut Erik Hovda, a clinical toxicologist in Oslo who studies methanol poisoning and fears Iran\u2019s outbreak could be even worse than reported. \u201cWhen they keep drinking this, there\u2019s going to be more people poisoned.\u201d In the UK, after prime minister Boris Johnson tested positive for coronavirus, it now emerges that health secretary Matt Hancock has COVID-19 too. You can read more in our dedicated UK live blog here: Hello readers, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here taking over the global liveblog to steer you through this afternoon\u2019s world coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Another eight coronavirus patients in Scotland have died, bringing the total there to 33, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. She added that the number of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland had risen by 165 from Thursday\u2019s total, from 894 to 1,059, and that 72 patients with coronavirus symptoms were in intensive care units. The Armani Group said it has turned its production lines to produce single-use smocks for healthcare workers in Italy. Armani said on Thursday it has already shifted its focus and converted all its Italian productions sites to meet needs arising from the Covid-19 crisis, reports Lorenzo Tondo. Italian health workers are running out of medical equipment and hospitals are dealing with a severe shortage of protective medical gear, including face masks and hazmat suits. Armani has already donated \u20ac1.25m to Italy\u2019s Civil Protection and several Italian hospitals. The Armani Group is just the latest big-name fashion brand to turn its production lines to meet needs arising from the outbreak. As previously reported by my colleague Ellie Violet Bramley, on Tuesday, Prada said it would produce 110,000 masks by 6 April, while Gucci has said it will make more than 1m. Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga will also begin manufacturing them. During the weekend, H&amp;M Group said it would be rearranging its supply chain to produce protective equipment for hospitals and healthcare workers. The Belgian government has advised people to wash their hands before touching their pets after a cat was diagnosed as having contracting the coronavirus from its owner, in an apparent world first, writes Daniel Boffey in Brussels. During a daily press conference by scientists working with the federal government, virologist Steven Van Gucht, said the infection appeared to be an isolated case and that the animal\u2019s health is now improving. He said: \u201cA week after the owner developed symptoms, the animal also developed symptoms,\u201d said virologist Steven Van Gucht. \u201cIt was diarrhoea, vomiting and breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat\u2019s faees. Two dogs were previously reported to have been infected in Hong Kong but neither of those animals had symptoms. Van Gucht said: \u201cThere are no indications that this is common. It is also important to note that it was a transfer from human to animal and not from animal to human. The virus does not normally pass from animal to human. We therefore consider the risk to people to be small. \u201d The Federal Food Agency in Belgium has made a number of recommendations to protect pets. If an owner becomes infected with the coronavirus, they are are requested to keep the animal inside and to keep contact between owner and animal to a minimum. The National Council for Animal Protection (CNPA) said the development should not be a cause of alarm. \u201cAnimals are not vectors of the epidemic, so there is no reason to abandon your animal,\u201d the organisation said in a statement. Israel\u2019s military has said it will send about 500 soldiers to join police officers in enforcing a nationwide lockdown, writes the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Holmes in Jerusalem. The armed troops will patrol the streets from Sunday, the military said in a statement, to assist police in \u201cisolating and securing certain areas, blocking routes and additional similar assignments\u201d. On Wednesday, the Israel government instructed people to stay within 100 metres of their homes for a week or face a fine or even jail. It further reduced public transport and required employers to check workers for fever. Shopping for essential items and food delivery remained permitted. A group of doctors have set up a crowdfunder to get vital protective equipment to medics who are dealing with coronavirus cases, amid concerns that trusts are struggling to protect frontline workers because of a lack of supplies, writes my colleague Sarah Marsh. Dr Mona Barzin and Dr Salaj Masand among others published a page online that reads: \u201cWe are a group of colleagues (doctors in hospitals and GP), who have set up this initiative to source PPE [personal protective equipment] for those who need it most in our fight against coronavirus. \u201cUnfortunately current hospital supplies are not sufficient and while we are reassured the government is doing everything it can, healthcare workers on the frontline are risking themselves daily without adequate protection to care for sick patients. Healthcare workers on the frontline without PPE is the equivalent of going to war without armour and protection.\u201d The page explains that PPE involves face masks, visors, surgical gowns and gloves. The group said it has procured details of a number of internationally reputable suppliers of PPE, including those cross referenced by the UK embassy. They are trying to raise money to buy the equipment directly from global supply chains and donate supplies directly to the NHS Hospitals in need. NHS England and the government have made a significant effort since the weekend to address concerns about protective gear. The army has been called in to help deliver millions of pieces of PPE and 200 hospitals were due to receive extra kit overnight on Tuesday. However, doctors say deliveries are not arriving soon enough, and groups representing frontline staff say doctors could quit over the issue. So far, the page has raised \u00a388,000 since being launched yesterday evening. You can support it here. The British prime minister has tested positive for coronavirus The British prime minister Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. In a video posted on Twitter, Johnson confirmed he had developed mild symptoms \u2013 \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d \u2013 over the last 24 hours. Johnson, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.

For all live UK coronavirus news, please do read our UK facing live blog The BBC is reporting that Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d. More on this here: Spain\u2019s health ministry has just given out the latest figures, which show a new record single-day death toll, reports Sam Jones in Madrid. There have been 769 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,858. This is a new high - the previous record was 738, between Tuesday and Wednesday this week. The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday. Spain extended its coronavirus lockdown on Thursday and said it was fighting a \u201creal war\u201d over medical supplies to contain the world\u2019s second-highest virus death toll, turning to China for many critical products, where officials reported fraud and massive price increases. Armenia has reported its first death as a result of coronavirus. A 72-year-old woman diagnosed with coronavirus died in Armenia on Thursday, the health ministry\u2019s spokeswoman said, reporting the country\u2019s first death related to the virus. Armenia, a country of about 3 million people, had reported 290 coronavirus cases as of Thursday, the highest number among countries in the south Caucasus region. A rescue flight arranged by the German government on Friday picked up hundreds of tourists who had been stranded in Nepal since the Himalayan nation went on lockdown earlier this week, the Press Association reports: The Qatar Airways charter flight took off with 305 people on board, said Deo Chandra Lal Karna, an official at Kathmandu\u2019s Tribhuvan international airport. Immigration official Sagar Acharya said most of the passengers were German nationals or had some connection to the country. The airport reopened only for the flight, which did not bring any passengers to Nepal. Nepal, home to the highest mountains and hiking trails, is popular with tourists during the spring season when the weather is favorable for climbing. Up to 10,000 tourists are believed to be stranded in Nepal since the government ordered a complete lockdown that halted all flights and road travel to prevent the spread of the virus. Businesses and government offices were also shut. Nepal has only three confirmed cases of coronavirus, including one individual who has recovered. The UK\u2019s largest retailer Tesco is limiting online shoppers to 80 items per order in a drive to free up more delivery slots to households in self-isolation, writes my colleague Rebecca Smithers. A typical online order before the coronavirus outbreak would contain fewer than 60 items, but the average has leaped recently to more than 100 items. Customers are stocking up with essentials but may also buy more than they need. The move will allow the supermarket to release significantly more delivery slots over the coming weeks, as part of its efforts to ensure all customers can buy what they need. The UK\u2019s largest retailer is also launching a new \u2018Keeping You Safe\u2019 advertising campaign to help explain to customers the wide range of social distancing measures now in place in its stores across the UK. These include clear markings in car parks and in store to keep shoppers two metres apart \u2013 in line with government \u2018physical distancing\u2019 guidelines \u2013 as well as restrictions on the number who can enter at any one time. The advert was shot overnight on Wednesday in the retailer\u2019s Stevenage Extra store and is fronted by its staff. It will begin on social and TV ads over the weekend \u2013 including within Channel 4\u2019s Googlebox and ITV\u2019s screening of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Chief executive Dave Lewis said: \u201cWe felt it was important to help customers understand the changes we\u2019ve made in our stores to keep them safe as they shop. We hope they\u2019ll find it helpful. Our aim is to do everything we can to protect our colleagues and customers at this difficult time and ensure everyone has safe access to the food and essentials they need.\u201d The retailer is also giving NHS workers priority to shop between 9am and 10am on Tuesdays and Thursdays in its large stores, as well as its previously announced browsing time one hour before checkouts open on Sundays. In these bigger stores it will continue to prioritise an hour for elderly and vulnerable customers every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning between 9am and 10am. The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%, reports Sam Jones in Madrid. Like other countries struggling to diagnose and treat the virus, Spain has looked to China for rapid testing kits equipment and much-needed supplies, and announced this week that it would spend \u20ac432m (\u00a3387m) on tests, masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment. However, a batch of Chinese-made kits bought by Spanish health authorities a few weeks ago has been pulled after they were discovered to be unreliable and the Chinese government said that they had been made by a company that did not appear on its list of authorised manufacturers. In a statement on Thursday, Spain\u2019s health ministry said it would be returning the kits, but stressed that they had not be bought directly from the Chinese manufacturer but from a supply company in Spain that had purchased them in China and had provided the necessary accompanying paperwork. \u201cThe first tests on the rapid testing kits were carried out simultaneously by a hospital in Madrid and by the Carlos III Health Institute, and as soon as their low sensitivity was discovered, they were withdrawn,\u201d said the ministry. \u201cThe supplier has been contacted and replacement tests will be provided.\u201d Certificates shared by the ministry included an EC declaration of conformity for the products, which, according to the documentation, were made by the Shenzen Bioeasy Biotechnology Company Limited in Guandong province. \u201cSpain follows EU regulation, which means that if a product is certified to conform to European standards, it can be bought and sold throughout the union area,\u201d said the statement. The ministry said the deficient kits were not part of the new, \u20ac432m Chinese order, and had been bought before the Chinese authorities has issued its list of approved manufacturers. In recent days, Spanish health authorities have been urgently distributing almost 650,000 rapid testing kits to frontline medial staff and residence homes for older people. Spain, which is the European country most affected by coronavirus after Italy, has so far recorded more than 56,000 cases of the disease and more than 4,000 deaths. Health workers, who account for about 14% of the country\u2019s coronavirus victims, have complained of a lack of basic protective equipment such as facemasks and gowns. Authorities in Bosnia have ordered the transfer of thousands of refugees to a remote camp in Lipa, a village about 15 miles (25km) from the border with Croatia, beacuse of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, reports my colleague Lorenzo Tondo. In a document seen by the Guardian, the Biha\u0107 city civil defence headquarters asked that the move be carried out \u201cin order to take urgent measures to prevent the onset of the disease caused by Covid-19\u201d. The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332, while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Here is the death toll for the past five days: 26 March: 157 25 March: 143 24 March: 122 23 March: 127 22 March: 129 A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, the head of the French Hospital Federation said on Friday, with the peak not expected until April, Reuters reports. Paris and its suburbs now account for over a quarter of the 29,000 confirmed coronavirus infections in French hospitals, with almost 1,300 now in intensive care. The death toll nationwide as of Thursday evening stood at 1,696. \u201cWe will clearly need help in the Ile-de-France (Greater Paris region) because what happened in the east is coming here,\u201d Frederic Valletoux, the federation\u2019s president told BFM TV. He was referring to the Grand Est region, where the first major cluster took hold in France and where hospitals are already overwhelmed, with the army helping to transfer some critically ill patients to other cities. \u201cWe will be at the limit of our capacities in 24 or 48 hours. We will need to show real solidarity between regions, hospitals and increase the numbers of patient transfers.\u201d Officials in the Paris area have been scrambling to find more intensive care beds, ventilators and medical staff and spread the load of patients across the capital and its wider suburbs. President Emmanuel Macron imposed on 17 March a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, but doctors say they expect a wave of cases next week after the government pressed ahead with local elections and thousands of people mingled in parks and streets before they were confined at home. \u201cIf we let hospitals cope by themselves, and let every territory that has been taken by the epidemic cope alone, then we shall head towards a catastrophe,\u201d Valletoux said. Ireland and Northern Ireland are preparing improvised morgues as they brace for a sharp increase in the number of deaths from coronavirus. Health officials in Dublin on Thursday night announced 10 more deaths, bringing the republic\u2019s death toll to 19, and warned that Ireland was just starting a curve that would sweep upwards. They also announced 255 new infections, bringing the confirmed total to 1,819. Clusters in nursing homes and healthcare settings are of particular concern. Liz Canavan, assistant secretary for social policy for the taoiseach, told a media briefing the government was preparing temporary morgues. \u201cWe are still, largely, in the preparation phase \u2013 getting the country ready and putting the necessary infrastructure in place, in particular the medical infrastructure, to deal with the surge when it comes.\u201d Authorities in Northern Ireland, which has recorded 10 deaths and 241 cases of infection, plan to use an army base in County Down as a morgue and to set up field hospitals at several sites, possibly including Belfast\u2019s Titanic quarter and the former Maze prison. The health minister, Robin Swann, has warned deaths could exceed the more than 3,500 people killed during the Troubles. Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases now recorded, and 83 deaths, writes Jason Burke. The 56m inhabitants of South Africa woke up to the first day of a rigorous lockdown enforced by the police and army. Streets in much of Johannesburg were quiet, though there was significant activity in many high-density neighbourhoods amid complaints that the tight restrictions on movements would deny many vital income. Similar strict measures are now being rolled out across the continent, though some governments, such as Zimbabwe, are yet to impose full curfews. Eritrea, one of the most authoritarian states on the continent, has so far only suspended public transport and schools. More than 20 countries have suspended almost all passenger flights. South Africa\u2019s high total is partly explained by an aggressive and relatively extensive testing effort, and its official figures are seen by experts as reliable, in contrast to those of Egypt, on 495, for example. The overall figure for the continent is almost certainly a significant underestimate, as testing had been extremely limited in many places. Amid fears of massive casualties from the virus across the developing world, international health officials say there is still a chance Africa can avert catastrophe. About half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa still have a \u201cnarrowing\u201d opportunity to contain the disease, Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO World Health Organisation director for Africa said. \u201cIt has been a very dramatic evolution,\u201d Moeti told reporters. \u201cCountries need to work on this containment while preparing for a possible, broader expansion of the virus.\u201d There is widespread recognition that the virus would be very difficult to control in the overcrowded conditions of many poor neighbourhoods of Africa\u2019s major cities or refugee camps, and could hit vulnerable communities such as sufferers of HIV or tuberculosis very hard. \u201cWe still have a window... it is narrowing every day as data on the geographic spread to more and more countries tell us,\u201d Moeti said. Here is a recap of the main news currently, courtesy of Reuters as of 6am GMT. UK Another 115 people have died in the United Kingdom after testing positive for the coronavirus, bringing the total number of deaths to 578.

The Afghan government said on Thursday that around 10,000 prisoners will be released in coming days to contain spread Coronavirus in prisons. \u201cPeople who we are releasing - some of them by the authority of the president - are not a big threat to society, they had committed small crimes,\u201d said Ahmad Rashid Totakhil, head of the general directorate of prisons. Three deaths and two recoveries have been recorded in Afghanistan so far. South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from COVID-19, says Health Minister Dr Zwelini Mkhize.

Reuters reports: \u201cBecause we stand by our Italian friends. We can only manage this together,\u201d Maas said in a short statement. In Italy, an overwhelmed health care system has witnessed the outbreak kill more people than in any other country.

The fire service in the UK could be drafted in to support the NHS with firefighters taking on roles such as driving ambulances and delivering food and medicine, it emerged this morning. The Press Association report: The General Secretary of the Fire Brigades Union Matt Wrack said it would be \u201cquite a serious challenge\u201d for firefighters to take on more work to help deliver food and medicine and drive ambulances. Wrack told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today Programme: \u201cWell, training is a key element of a document that we will be releasing today. Firefighters are clearly keen to do whatever they can to help in the situation.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have been approached on a number of issues and this next step will be discussions at a local level about what firefighters can do and what firefighters are able to use their skills for and that includes issues like assisting ambulance staff and so on.\u201d Wrack added that there is a \u201cneed to protect core functions\u201d of the fire service while firefighters may be asked to take on additional roles. He said: \u201cI think this is a huge challenge across public services and also clearly we need to ensure that firefighters and others are protected in terms of personal protective equipment because no one can do their job if their own safety is compromised.\u201d This is Alexandra Topping taking over the global coronavirus liveblog from my hard-working colleague Helen Sullivan - thanks to her for her efforts. I\u2019ll be bring you updates from around the world. If you want to tell us about a story or think there is something I\u2019ve missed I\u2019m on: alexandra.topping@theguardian.com @lexytopping on Twitter, DMs are open. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be back with more live world coronavirus news tomorrow. In the meantime, my colleague Alexandra Topping will steer you through Friday\u2019s developments. Here is what has happened in the last few hours: US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call, during which Xi warned that the US must take \u2018substantive actions\u2019 to improve relations, Chinese state media reported. After the call Trump tweeted that the conversation was \u201cvery good\u201d and that: \u201cChina has been through much &amp; has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together.\u201d China will temporarily bar the entry of almost all foreigners and drastically reduce flights to the country as it tries to head off this second wave of infections caused by travellers coming from abroad. The US has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China, with 85,991 reported in the US and 81,872 in China. Italy is third with 80,589. The next big wave of US infections is likely headed for Louisiana, where demand for ventilators has already doubled. In New Orleans, the state\u2019s biggest city, Mardi Gras celebrations late last month are believed to have fuelled the outbreak. Returning travellers to Australia will be be quarantined in hotels and other accommodation for 14 days on arrival, instead of being asked to self-isolate at home. Australia\u2019s federal government is also planning to put the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d, which may involve asking banks, lenders and landlords to waive some business overheads to help them whether the crisis. The UK government has urged homebuyers to avoid moving house during the coronavirus outbreak, as the pandemic brings the country\u2019s property market to a near standstill, Reuters reports. The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe could hit 1.8 million worldwide this year even with swift and stringent measures to stop it, according to a study from Britain\u2019s Imperial College published Thursday. The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed 532,000, according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed deaths worldwide was 24,072. Mainland China reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus infection in three days, although cases involving travellers from overseas continued to dominate the total number of new cases. Argentina declared a six-month rent freeze to help family budgets affected by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown declared last Friday. Vietnam will limit domestic flights and stop public gatherings for two weeks from Saturday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the government said in a statement on Friday. South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight. Vietnam will limit domestic flights and stop public gatherings for two weeks from Saturday in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus, the government said in a statement on Friday. Indoor gatherings of more than 20 people and outdoor gatherings of 10 people or more will be banned, the government said, citing an order signed by Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc. Vietnam has found 153 coronavirus cases but has had no reported deaths, according to the health ministry. More than 57,000 people are in quarantine. The next 10-15 days would be decisive in Vietnam\u2019s fight against the virus, Phuc has said. In the statement on Friday, Phuc also ordered that flights between the capital, Hanoi, and the southern business hub of Ho Chi Minh City and cities across the country be reduced. All major cities should temporarily shut down non-essential services until April 15 at the earliest and residents should stay indoors as much as possible, Phuc said.

UK Finance, the banking industry body, said banks would grant homebuyers who have exchanged contracts the possibility of moving at a later date by extending their mortgage offer for up to three months. This Friday night Britons will head to the pub, theatre or a gig \u2026 online Virtual pubs, comedy clubs, quiz nights and concerts will be among the attractions as a frazzled UK attempts to shake off, however briefly, its most trying week since the second world war by recreating a Friday night out while in lockdown. Groups of friends are working out how to conjure a pub ambience from their front rooms by arranging to meet online dressed up and armed with cocktails, while theatres are streaming performances from their back catalogues, complete with packed audiences, a reminder of a temporarily lost world. Video-sharing platforms such as Zoom and Houseparty have been among the most downloaded apps in the UK. Psychologists are urging people who might be put off by the technology to give it a try, saying studies show socialising by video has similar benefits to face-to-face interaction. Inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies. Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines in development around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, moved into human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d Here are today\u2019s UK front pages for Friday, 27 March 2020: The latest now on that call between US president Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping. Xi told Trump the US needed to take \u201csubstantive actions\u201d to improve China-US relations, according to Chinese state media. Xi told Trump China was willing to offer support to the US in tackling the outbreak, and that he hoped the US would take practical and effective measures to safeguard the lives and health of Chinese nationals in the US. Xi added that China was willing to \u201cenhance macroeconomic policy co-ordination to stabilise the market and secure growth,\u201d according to state media. \u201cChina-US relations are at an important juncture,\u201d Xi reportedly said. He also said China had been open and transparent about the pandemic. If you have tips, news or other thoughts you\u2019d like to share, get in touch with me directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan. China prepares to seal itself off from the world to stem \u2018imported\u2019 coronavirus cases China will temporarily bar the entry of almost all foreigners and drastically reduce flights to the country as it tries to head off a second wave of infections caused by travellers coming from abroad. The ban, which goes into effect at midnight on Friday, comes as the country reported its first locally infected coronavirus infection in three days and reported 54 imported cases. The move was greeted with broad support inside China. The measure applies to those with valid visas or residence permits and amounts to China shutting its borders, inviting criticism given that Beijing previously condemned other countries for similar moves. The World Health Organization had also advised countries not to shut their borders to Chinese travellers. China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration said late on Thursday that 90% of international flights would be suspended. US electric car maker Tesla plans to slash on-site staff at its Nevada battery plant by around 75% due to the coronavirus pandemic, the local county manager said on Thursday. The move comes after its Japanese battery partner Panasonic Corp said it would scale down operations at the Nevada factory this week before closing it for 14 days. The factory produces electric motors and battery packs for Tesla\u2019s popular Model 3 sedans. However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will reopen the New York plant \u201cas soon as humanly possible\u201d to manufacture ventilators for coronavirus patients. New Zealanders, proving that clothes maketh even the virtual man, are spending their second day of a nationwide lockdown dressed to the nines as part of the burgeoning #formalFridays movement. Kiwis are keeping their spirits \u2013 and sartorial standards \u2013 up by working from home while dressed in suits, business attire or full evening-wear. The Australian sharemarket tumbled in afternoon trade after prime minister Scott Morrison said he would put the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d but gave no details of how this would be done. Morrison said Australian businesses would need to be able to spring back into action once the coronavirus crisis was over, and the pain of doing so would be shared with landlords and banks. But he did not outline any concrete proposal for rent relief for businesses and households whose incomes have been reduced to zero by his government\u2019s measures to fight the crisis. The benchmark ASX200 index, which opened the day up as much as 2.4%, finished the day down 5.3%. Morrison also announced that everyone arriving to the country would be placed under mandatory quarantine in hotels and other accommodation paid for by state governments. You can watch that announcement below: Uzbekistan locked down more cities and districts on Friday, and announced large bonus payments for medical workers, in its effort to slow the spread of a coronavirus, as it recorded the country\u2019s first death and the number of cases climbed to 83, Reuters reports. A 72-year old man in the city of Namangan died on Friday morning. He had other diseases in addition to the coronavirus, the healthcare ministry said. Municipal authorities in the province of Navoi said they were locking down the cities of Navoi and Zarafshan, as well as several districts. Authorities in the major tourism hub of Bukhara also said the city would close its borders. The central Asian nation has already locked down some of its biggest cities, including the capital, Tashkent. Eleven infections were among medical workers, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said late on Thursday, announcing large bonus payments for those working in direct contact with the infected. Doctors will get US$2,500 every two weeks, or several times their normal monthly pay, while nurses and laboratory workers will receive $1,500, junior medical workers $1,000 and others $500, Mirziyoyev said. Medical workers who get infected while treating coronavirus patients will get $10,000 each. More on that Trump-Xi phone call now. The South China Morning Post reports that during the call Xi \u201curged unity and solidarity and delivered three main messages: strengthen international efforts to stop the virus; shore up the economy amid downward trends; and a subtle call on the US to stop its hostile moves against China.\u201d The SCMP quotes the Chinese president as telling Trump: The virus knows no boundaries, and the pandemic is our common enemy. All countries must join hands and put up the strictest network for joint prevention and joint control [of the disease] US president Donald Trump has given glowing praise of China and its response to coronavirus \u2013 which he did not refer to as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d \u2013 in a tweet following his call earlier with Chinese president Xi Jinping: The US has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China, with 85,991 reported in the US and 81,872 in China. Italy is third with 80,589. The next big wave of US infections is likely headed for Louisiana, where demand for ventilators has already doubled. In New Orleans, the state\u2019s biggest city, Mardi Gras celebrations late last month are believed to have fuelled the outbreak. Returning travellers to Australia will be be quarantined in hotels and other accommodation for 14 days on arrival, instead of being asked to self-isolate at home. Australia\u2019s federal government is also planning to put the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d, which may involve asking banks, lenders and landlords to waive some business overheads to help them whether the crisis. The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe could hit 1.8 million worldwide this year even with swift and stringent measures to stop it, according to a study from Britain\u2019s Imperial College published Thursday. The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed 532,000, according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed deaths worldwide was 24,072. Mainland China reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus infection in three days, although cases involving travellers from overseas continued to dominate the total number of new cases, leading China to cut international flights. Argentina declared a six-month rent freeze to help family budgets affected by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown declared last Friday. South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight. In Singapore, getting within a metre of another person at a restaurant or a shopping queue can now land you in prison under some of the toughest punishments seen worldwide to implement social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The city-state\u2019s no-nonsense approach and extensive surveillance during a two-month long virus battle has won international praise, and had allowed it to largely avoid curtailing daily life until a surge of cases in the last week. The updates to Singapore\u2019s powerful infectious diseases law, which came into effect on Friday, have been accompanied by other measures such as shutting bars and limiting gatherings to up to 10 people outside work and school. It\u2019s been a long and difficult week and Guardian Australia\u2019s cartoonist First Dog on the Moon has what you need to cheer you up on this Friday afternoon (yes, it\u2019s Friday, not that that means much to people who are self-isolating or under lockdown). He has these true stories of pets in isolation. Enjoy! Just to wrap up if you are just joining us. The Australian prime minister Scott Morrison just delivered a press conference and the key points are: Returning travellers to Australia will be be quarantined for 14 days, instead of self-isolating at home. The cost of their accommodation in places such as hotels will be borne by the states. The Australian Defence Force will be used to enforce measures to ensure people already self-isolating are complying with instructions. The government and states are working on a \u201chibernation package\u201d that will aim to help businesses that have to close to try to ensure they can reopen when this is over. Morrison has been accused of being somewhat unclear in his communication style throughout the Covid-19 crisis, something that has been the cause of much public consternation, and also mockery. So, how clear was his messaging in this press conference? Not very. Morrison was again asked for clarity \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 on what counts as an essential service, and who counts as essential workers. His response, this time to his own rhetorical question, was: \u201cWhat\u2019s an essential job? A job that someone has.\u201d Asked about the business hibernation plan, which he described as a \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cinnovative\u201d idea he responded: We will make announcements on the details. I today wanted to set out what the objective was. There will be a burden for everyone to share. And that will include the business as well. There will be landlords who will suffer. There will be - the banks will be having to make arrangements with them ... The intent is, as far as possible, to ... ensure that a business through no fault of its own \u2013 just like if there\u2019s any Australian who has lost a job through no fault of their own \u2013 we are simply trying to preserve and support them in the best way we possibly can for the simple reason that, A: they are Australian, and that is what we should do, and, B: on the other side we want them to surge. We want Australia to rise again on the other side of this and to go forward strongly. On that comment from New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern that she does not want to \u201csee the scenes of Bondi beach in Australia\u201d: Bondi, in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, is part of the Waverly council area. This week the council which was forced to shut down Bondi Beach after thousands of people went to the beach despite social distancing recommendations. Waverley is now the council area with the highest number of coronavirus cases, at 105. Of these, at least eight people acquired the infection without any known contact with a confirmed case or travel overseas, Guardian analysis shows. In New Zealand, Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian that finance minister Grant Robertson says employers are required to pay employees a government wage subsidy, even if they cannot continue to employ them. This would take the support scheme to an estimated NZ$8-12bn (US$4.8-7.2bn). Meanwhile, modelling released yesterday suggested, left unchecked, the virus would eventually infect 89 percent of New Zealand\u2019s population and kill up to 80,000 people in a worst-case scenario. ICU beds would reach capacity within two months and the number of patients needing intensive care would exceed 10 times that capacity by the time the virus peaked. However, with the strictest suppression measures, which New Zealand had adopted, the fatalities would drop to just 0.0004 percent \u2013 about 20 people. Hospital capacity would not be exceeded for over a year. These measures included social distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and closing schools and universities. That scenario would require the restrictions to remain in place until a vaccine or other treatment was developed. \u201cWhen controls are lifted after 400 days, an outbreak occurs with a similar peak size as for an uncontrolled epidemic,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cIn other words, these strategies can delay but not prevent the epidemic.\u201d Over in New Zealand, which is under total lockdown and a state of emergency, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern is imploring people to \u201cstay local\u201d during a four-week countrywide lockdown and does not want to see \u201cthe scenes of Bondi Beach in New Zealand\u201d, referring to last weekend in Australia when a sunny Friday saw the country\u2019s most famous beach packed locals and tourists. Charles Anderson reports for the Guardian that Ardern again told reporters in Wellington this afternoon that, despite the lockdown, numbers of those infected with Covid-19 will continue to rise for some time. New Zealand is in day two of a four-week lockdown where non-essential businesses have been forced to close and families to stay home. \u201cDon\u2019t take road trips. Don\u2019t go outside of your area. Don\u2019t congregate,\u201d Ardern said. \u201cThere is an expectation that people will stay in their homes.\u201d Ardern said that those who were infected would not know for several days. If they broke their local \u2018bubble\u2019 of who they were isolating with then they put many others, including the elderly, at risk. She sought to reassure New Zealanders that medical professionals had access to enough protective gear to manage demand across the country. Ardern said the border, which is closed to visitors, presented the greatest risk in managing Covid-19 and would be managed accordingly. Australia will be putting the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. He did not explain how it works, but as we understand it, this means that business overheads, including rent and mortgage costs, will be suspended for a while. Australia\u2019s finance minister Matthias Cormann said this could be for six months. Banks, lenders and landlords will wear at least some of this cost. We\u2019re of course hoping for more clarity on the specifics of what Morrison has called an \u201cinnovative\u201d solution soon. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is talking about the plan to put the country\u2019s economy into hibernation now. He says the idea is simple, but does not go on to explain the idea. Part of that plan that we will be announcing will be to seek to hibernate Australian businesses... The idea is simple: there are businesses which will have to close their doors. They will have to keep them closed either because we have made it necessary for them to do so, or simply because there is just not the business to keep their doors open. We want those businesses to start again. And we do not want over the course of the next six months or as long as it takes, for those businesses to be so saddled by debt, so saddled by rental payments, so saddled by other liabilities that they will not be able to start again on the other side. We want these businesses to effectively go into a hibernation, which means on the other side, the employees come back, the opportunities come back, the economy comes back. Australia\u2019s quarantine measures will be enforced by state government with the help of the Australian Defence Force, prime minister Scott Morrison says. The ADF will also be helping to check up on those already in self isolation. Scott Morrison says of the new quarantine measures: By no later than midnight tomorrow - that is 11:59pmSaturday - states and territories will be quarantining all arrivals through our airports in hotels and other accommodation facilities for the two weeks of their mandatory self-isolation before they are able to return to their home. If their home is in South Australia or in Perth or in Tasmania and they have arrived in Melbourne, they will be quarantining in Melbourne. If it\u2019s in Sydney, it will be if Sydney. If it\u2019s Brisbane, and so on. In Australia, Morrison says \u201cToday we have decided to take further actions targeted at our greatest area of concern. What we\u2019re announcing today enables us to deal with the increasing pressure we have from Australians returning home. Two thirds of the cases that we currently have are from an Australian who has come home. Two thirds... As time goes on, the risk of Australians coming home from other countries actually increases.\u201d Morrison says self-isolation measures for Australians returning from overseas will be strengthened. He is showing the self isolation document signed by Australians returning home. \u201cToday we are going even further. In addition to the declaration and the support put in behind that...states and territories will be quarantining all new arrivals in hotels and other accommodations for two weeks before they are able to return to their home.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking now in Canberra. Australians will be looking for clear, firm guidance from their leader today. So far, he is offering praise for the country\u2019s response. The difference between Morrison\u2019s leadership and that of Jacinda Ardern in neighbouring New Zealand has been stark. New Zealand is currently under total lockdown. Ardern was frank with people yesterday, saying things would get worse, despite the measures, before they got better. Morrison has been criticised for offering vague and inconsistent advice. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison is speaking now in Canberra. \u201cWe always knew Australians were up to this test. And you\u2019re proving it every single day,\u201d he says. \u201cWe might have to keep our distance but it doesn\u2019t mean we have to disconnect from each other... no Australian should have to go through this alone.\u201d Have news you think our readers should know or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment? Let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan. We\u2019ll be focussing on Australian news now for a short while. Friday has seen a few key developments in the country and Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to hold a press conference within minutes. Australia has 3,005 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths. Friday\u2019s developments include: One of Australia\u2019s largest aged care providersbanned all visits to its homes, citing the \u201cgrowing risk of Covid-19 infection\u201d and government advice on social distancing. The decision follows moves from most other major aged care providers to close their facilities to visitors last week, which was described by one home as a \u201cvoluntary lockdown\u201d. The Australian market has slipped back into the red after being up as much as 2.4% in early trade. It began to fall shortly before midday and by about 1pm was down 1.7% for the day. There are 162 confirmed cases diagnosed in NSW who were on board the Ruby Princess, up 41 from yesterday. 2,700 passengers disembarked from the ship last week despite three passengers and one crew member displaying flu-like symptoms, having been swabbed for coronavirus and still waiting for results. There are 41 confirmed cases from the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship. Australia finance minister Matthias Cormann told the SBC he is considering puttin the country\u2019s economy into \u201chibernation\u201d . In Japan, queues formed at supermarkets and stores in Tokyo on Friday as residents prepared for a weekend at home after the city\u2019s governor called on them to stay at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Reuters reports. After Governor Yuriko Koike\u2019s plea on Wednesday to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings through 12 April 12, and especially this weekend, residents were stocking up on everything from instant noodles and rice to toiletries and fresh produce, despite public-service warnings against hoarding. Coronavirus infections have climbed to more than 1,400 nationwide with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship that was quarantined last month. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to order his cabinet to compile an economic package with spending worth US$135 billion or more, government officials and lawmakers say, joining global policymakers in rolling out fiscal stimulus to avert a downturn from the spreading pandemic. While Tokyo has not declared an emergency or a full-blown lockdown, Abe has set up a new crisis task force, which is seen as a preliminary step towards declaring a state of emergency. In the US, one or more coronavirus cases have been reported among workers at thirteen of Amazon\u2019s warehouses across the country. Reports that a handful out of Amazon\u2019s hundreds of thousands of US warehouse workers have contracted coronavirus raise the potential of future site closures and operational disruptions at the world\u2019s largest online retailer. Amazon, which did not respond to Reuters requests that it confirm all the cases, said in a statement that it has taken preventive action and that workers\u2019 health and safety is its top priority. Here is more on the role Amazon is playing in the crisis from the Guardian\u2019s technology reporter, Julia Carrie Wong: More on the situation in South Korea now, which has been reporting around 100 new cases per day for two weeks. Authorities pleaded with residents on Friday to stay indoors and avoid large gatherings, Reuters reports. South Korea reported 91 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the national tally to 9,332. The country has reported similar daily numbers for the past two weeks, down from a high of over 900 in late February. The government has sought to convince a restless public that several more weeks of social distancing and self-isolation may be needed to allow health authorities to tamp down the smaller but still steady stream of new cases. \u201cAs the weather is getting nicer, I know many of you may have plans to go outside,\u201d Yoon Tae-ho, director-general for public health policy at the health ministry, told a briefing. \u201cBut social distancing cannot be successful when it\u2019s only an individual, it needs to be the whole community.\u201d Asian stocks rose on Friday as investors wagered policymakers will roll out more stimulus measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic after US unemployment filings surged to a record, Reuters reports. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.2%. Australian shares gave up gains to fall 1.09%, but Japan\u2019s Nikkei rose 1.44%. E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 reversed course and fell 0.95% in Asia following three consecutive days of gains in the S&amp;P 500 on Wall Street. The dollar nursed losses against major currencies as central banks\u2019 steps to solve a dollar shortage in funding markets started to gain traction. The US House of Representatives is expected to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package later on Friday that will flood the world\u2019s largest economy with money to stem the damage caused by the pandemic. US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would not cancel the Republican National Convention in August in Charlotte, North Carolina, because of the coronavirus. In an interview on Fox News, Trump said he believed the country will have rebounded from the coronavirus outbreak by then. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to cancel,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be in great shape long before then.\u201d Trump also told Fox news host Sean Hannity that he pushed back his 9pm call with Chinese president Xi Jinping by an hour and a half so that he could appear on Hannity\u2019s show: US unemployment claims are represented in the New York Times graph below, which you can also find here. Have news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment? Let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Back to Australia now, where finance minister Matthias Cormann is considering putting the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d. The Australian economy was already extremely weak before the coronavirus crisis, according to research from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Melbourne Institute. Like most economists, the institute\u2019s researchers say a recession is now inevitable \u2013 the only question is how bad it will be. The institute\u2019s experimental Nowcast project predicts the economy shrank by 0.1% in the three months to the end of March, a period that includes only a few weeks of the pandemic\u2019s effect. Going backwards in the March quarter reduces the estimated annual growth rate to just 1.6%. \u201cWhat we see now is just the beginning of what is to come when the negative impacts of the lockdowns, to stem the spread of the outbreak, start to take their toll on economic activity across major states,\u201d said a senior research fellow, Viet Nguyen. \u201cThe announced stimulus packages, at both the federal and state levels, are encouraging and helpful to cushion the blow to the economy, particularly to small businesses and employees in retail and hospitality industries, whose revenue and income will be most affected by the lockdowns.\u201d US nurses union head says there is a national shortage of protective equipment. In the US, scarcities of protective masks, gloves, gowns and eyewear for doctors and nurses - reports abound of healthcare workers recycling old face masks, making their own or even using trash bags to shield themselves - have emerged as a national problem, Reuters reports. \u201cOur nurses across the country do not have the personal protective equipment that is necessary to care for Covid patients, or any of their patients,\u201d Bonnie Castillo, head of the largest US nurses union, National Nurses United, told MSNBC. While New York was the coronavirus epicenter in the United States this week, the next big wave of infections appeared headed for Louisiana, where demand for ventilators has already doubled. In New Orleans, the state\u2019s biggest city, Mardi Gras celebrations late last month are believed to have fuelled the outbreak, Reuters reports. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said New Orleans would be out of ventilators by April 2 and potentially out of bed space by April 7 \u201cif we don\u2019t flatten the infection curve soon.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not conjecture, it\u2019s not some flimsy theory,\u201d Edwards told a press conference. \u201cThis is what is going to happen.\u201d About 80% of Louisiana\u2019s intensive care patients are now on breathing machines, up from the normal rate of 30-40%, said Warner Thomas, chief executive of Ochsner Health System, the state\u2019s hospital group. In the US now, Dr Sirous Asgari, an Iranian scientist who was exonerated in a US sanctions trial but remains jailed by immigration authorities, said the conditions in detention were filthy and overcrowded \u2013 and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly coronavirus outbreak. The materials science and engineering professor told the Guardian the \u201cinhumane\u201d treatment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) could cost him his life. He was acquitted in November on charges of stealing trade secrets, but Ice has kept him indefinitely detained. Asgari, 59, is trying to \u201cself deport\u201d to Iran, but remains stuck in a holding facility in Louisiana. There, he alleged: Detainees have no hand sanitizer, and the facility is not regularly cleaning bathrooms or sleeping areas. Asgari and a few other detainees have devised a schedule to try to clean themselves. Detainees lack access to masks. For two weeks, Ice refused to let Asgari wear his own protective mask, which he brought with him to the facility, and it has refused to supply one, despite his history of respiratory problems. There are no physical distancing guidelines at the facility. It appears no procedures have changed in response to Covid-19, even as Louisiana officials have urged isolation. \u201cThe way Ice looks at these people is not like they are human beings, but are objects to get rid of. The way that they have been treating us is absolutely terrifying,\u201d Asgari said. Australia\u2019s federal government is considering putting the economy into \u201chibernation\u201d the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports: The Federal Government is considering a radical suite of measures to effectively put the economy into hibernation, allowing businesses to emerge after the coronavirus crisis, and resume and rehire without crippling debts. As the Government prepares to unveil its third economic rescue package \u201cwithin days\u201d, policies are being developed to help business owners see out the crisis without having to walk away from their companies. Banks, lenders and landlords would all be asked to wear some of the pain, waiving all overheads including rents and mortgage repayments for at least the next six months. More on Argentina now, where tenants are about to receive some welcome relief: a six-month rent freeze to help family budgets affected by the nationwide coronavirus lockdown declared last Friday. The decree about to be signed by President Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez will be a welcome move in a country where rents are tied to the inflation rate, which stands at about a yearly 50%. Authorities meanwhile are busy dealing with violators of the mandatory quarantine, with over six thousand people charged and some one thousand motor cars impounded nationwide so far this week. The northern province of Jujuy has resorted to an extreme measure. Police have begun locking up some violators in outdoor cages on the grounds of a closed down factory. Jujuy security minister Guillermo Corro told the press that around 700 people have been arrested in the province in the last week, most of them held temporarily in police facilities before being charged and released. Mexico has registered 585 cases of coronavirus in the country, up from 475 the previous day, as well as two more deaths, a health ministry official said on Thursday. A total of eight people have died from the virus in Mexico. Nicaragua has registered the Central American country\u2019s first death from coronavirus, an HIV-positive person with multiple health conditions, the health ministry on Thursday. The country has registered one other instance of the virus. In Argentina the number of coronavirus cases rose by 87 to 589 reported cases in on Thursday, and the number of registered deaths to 12 so far. The Japanese government said on Friday there was no need now to declare a state of emergency, after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe the previous day described the coronavirus as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d following a surge of cases in Tokyo. \u201cJapan at this stage is not in a situation where it needs to issue an emergency declaration,\u201d top spokesman Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference. Abe has however set up a new crisis task force, which is seen as a preliminary step towards declaring a state of emergency. South Korea reported 91 new coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the national tally to 9,332, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The figure is down from 104 new coronavirus cases on Thursday. Meanwhile, South Korean boy band BTS will postpone its North America tour by two months to June due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, its management said on Friday. The seven-member K-pop hit group was scheduled to begin its tours in the United States and Canada on April 25 in Santa Clara, including stops in Los Angeles, Dallas, Orlando, Atlanta, New Jersey, Washington and Toronto before wrapping up in Chicago. It is now rescheduled to kick off on June 6, Big Hit Entertainment said, adding all reserved tickets remain valid. \u201cWe are closely monitoring and following the guidance of all local governments regarding public events to ensure we are providing a safe environment for everyone involved as we continue to update our tour plans,\u201d Big Hit said in a statement on the fan community application called Weverse. New to K-Pop? Here\u2019s the music video for their song \u201cBoy with Luv\u201d to wash your hands to. It features Halsey and won the best K-Pop song at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards last year. The video was also nominated for best art direction, best choreography, and best collaboration. Charles Anderson reports from Nelson on New Zealand\u2019s South Island now. New Zealand\u2019s total number of patients with Covid-19 is now at 368 after 76 new cases were identified. The country reported 85 new cases made up of the 76 confirmed and nine suspected. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield addressed media on Friday afternoon in Wellington. He said that there are now eight people in hospitals across the country. Six of these patients are stable, two are in a less stable condition and one is in intensive care in Nelson Hospital. This is the first Covid-19 patient in intensive care in the country. Bloomfield noted that the the person had \u201csignificant\u201d underlying health issues. Bloomfield says that 2,500 retired medical staff have also come forward to help in the effort. He said that the country has enough personal protective equipment for medical staff, including 18 million masks. The US House of Representatives will begin a two-hour debate on a sweeping US$2.2 trillion coronavirus aid bill at 9 am (1300 GMT) on Friday, but it is not clear whether the measure would be able to pass on a voice vote, the House Majority Leader\u2019s office said late on Thursday. While most House members are in their home districts because of the coronavirus outbreak, those able and willing to travel to Washington for a vote should arrive by 10 am (1400 GMT), according to the House advisory. There have been discussions of a possible roll-call vote if a voice vote is blocked by dissenters. Mainland China reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus infection in three days, although cases involving travellers from overseas continued to dominate the total number of new cases. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Friday that 55 new coronavirus cases were reported on the mainland on Thursday, with all but 1 case involving so-called imported cases. There were 67 new cases a day earlier. The one locally transmitted case was in Zhejiang province, the health commission said. The total number of infections for mainland China now stands at 81,340, with the death toll rising by five to 3,292, it said. More US news now. President Donald Trump said he will speak by phone with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later Thursday as the United States overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus cases. Trump told a press conference he would be speaking to Xi at 9:00 pm EST. Trump said he and Xi would be discussing the global pandemic and insisted they have a \u201cvery good relationship.\u201d However, he touched on a nasty row that has erupted in both countries over blame for the disease. Trump has made a point of repeatedly calling Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus,\u201d because it first blew up in the city of Wuhan, angering some in China and sparking accusations of race-baiting at home. Trump says he is pushing back because a Chinese foreign ministry official has led a conspiracy theory that US soldiers brought the virus to China. \u201cNo it came from China,\u201d he underlined Thursday, although adding, \u201cif they feel so strongly about it, we\u2019ll see.\u201d Trump and Xi are also likely to discuss plans to negotiate a new trade agreement between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. Trump suggested the possibility that Xi may \u201cwant to wait\u201d until after the US presidential election in November \u201cto see if Trump gets beaten.\u201d According to Trump his likely Democratic opponent Joe Biden would be Beijing\u2019s \u201cbest dream in the world\u201d when it comes to negotiating. US president Donald Trump again struggled to reassure a fearful nation on Thursday as it emerged the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. News that America had surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection, according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University, broke as the president was holding a press conference at the White House. His instinctive response was to question other countries\u2019 statistics. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the amount of testing that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendous testing, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that\u2019s a little hard.\u201d While the US has increased its testing capacity in recents days the process has been flawed and incoherent, and the country still lags behind leaders such as South Korea in terms of the number of tests administered per-capita. On a grim day, the death toll in America surpassed 1,000 and it was revealed that last week 3.3 million people filed for unemployment \u2013 the biggest single-week jump in history. The president has been widely condemned for failing to act fast enough, misjudging the public mood and seeking to blame others rather than taking personal responsibility. \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d Trump said of the jobless figure. Certainly not in this country. Nobody\u2019s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China on a very early date. I say that because some people don\u2019t want to accept it, but this was a great decision made by our country, or the numbers that you\u2019re talking about \u2013 we\u2019re a big country \u2013 they\u2019d be far greater, far bigger.\u201d Here is a summary of the latest US news now from my colleague Maanvi Singh, as infections there overtook those in China. The US has surpassed China and Italy, with more than 82,000 cases per Johns Hopkins\u2019 tally. A lack of early action and setbacks in testing could be to blame. During a Coronavirus Task Force briefing, Donald Trump expressed skepticism at the news that the US was now worst hit by the pandemic, accusing China of sharing false data. Trump continued to push the idea that the US could revise physical distancing guidelines within two weeks, despite warnings from public health experts that doing so would have disastrous consequences. He said more guidance would come next week, but for now, he told Americans to \u201cstay home, just relax, stay home.\u201d During the briefing, Dr. Deborah Birx \u2014 who is leading the US response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 said reports that hospitals were running out of beds and ventilators, and considering \u201cdo not resuscitate\u201d protocols were irresponsible. She provided an optimistic assessment of the crisis. But her rosy outlook was somewhat at odds with what public health experts and hospitals have been reporting so far. The US labor department announced that a record 3.3 million people filed claims for unemployment. The Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, said the US may very well be headed into a recession. Lawmakers said the emergency economic relief package that passed the Senate last night will help. Nancy Pelosi is \u201ccertain\u201d that the House will pass the US$2tn stimulus package that was approved by the Senate last night. With 435 members, there are some logistical challenges to ensuring the vote is carried out in adherence to social distancing guidelines. The death toll from the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe could hit 1.8 million worldwide this year even with swift and stringent measures to stop it, according to a study from Britain\u2019s Imperial College published Thursday. Researchers estimate that tens of millions of lives could be saved if governments act fast to adopt strict public health measures, including testing, quarantining and broad social distancing, AFP reports. Imperial College London\u2019s previous research spurred the British government to ramp up its efforts to curb the virus. The findings come as Johns Hopkins University figures show the global number of infections passing 525,000 worldwide. Deaths currently stand at 23,956. The Imperial College modelling simulations are based on current data about the severity of the virus \u2013 its contagiousness and estimated mortality rate \u2013 as well as demographic and societal factors. With strict containment measures imposed early enough \u2013 resulting in a rate of deaths of 0.2 per 100,000 of population per week \u2013 the modelling shows a death toll of 1.86 million people, with nearly 470 million infected this year. If the same measures were taken later \u2013 leading to 1.6 deaths per 100,000 of population per week \u2013 the estimated toll rises sharply to 10.45 million deaths and 2.4 billion people infected. New Zealand has reported 85 confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases in the country. Yesterday prime minister Jacinda Ardern warned that infections were likely to get worse before they got better, despite the entire country now under lockdown orders and a state of emergency. Hello and welcome to our global coronavirus news liveblog. For the first time since the outbreak began, China\u2019s number of confirmed Covid-19 infections is outnumbered by another country\u2019s: the United States. As the World Health Organization warned could happen earlier this week, the US is now the centre of the virus, with 83,507 confirmed cases. China has 81,782 and Italy is not far behind, with 80,589. There are more than half a million cases worldwide, and one third of the planet\u2019s population is living under lockdown. I will be with you for the next few hours, bringing you the most important developments from around the world. If you see news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment, let me know on Twitter @helenrsullivan. A lot has happened in the last few hours. Here are the main developments: The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world. Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China with 82,404 reported in the US and 81,782 in China. Italy is third with 80,589. The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed the half a million mark, according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed cases worldwide is 529,093. Leaders of the G20 industrialised nations committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the world-wide pandemic. But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF. China has announced it will close its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week. South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight. Britain\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it. The International Monetary Fund on Thursday asked G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity to strengthen its response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic that is set to cause a global recession in 2020. France began evacuating coronavirus patients from Alsace using a special high-speed train. About 20 patients were taken from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions. The move is aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals overwhelmed in Alsace. The WHO said it sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe. The World Health Organiszation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. A slower rise in deaths was reported in Spain. Spain has announced anothera further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise is deaths in Spain is stabilising. India announced a stimulus package. India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee (\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to millions of people, affected by a nationwide lockdown. Iran posted a record rise in cases. The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period. Five days ago, the numbers being infected daily was below 900. The UK recorded its biggest daily rise in deaths. The number of people who have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals has risen by 115 in a single day to 578, as of 5pm on Thursday. It is the biggest daily rise in deaths across the country since the outbreak began. Moscow shut down as Russia banned flights. Moscow announced it would close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row.",

Trump tried to dissuade the Massie from holding up the vote.<br></p> \n  <p>In a series of tweets on Friday morning, he assailed Massie as a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d Trump also suggested Republicans should \u201cthrow Massie out\u201d of the party.</p> \n  <p>Massie\u2019s statement reads in full:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpresent.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?</p> \n   <p>I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week. The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.</p> \n   <p>This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. </p> \n   <p>That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency.</p> \n   <p>If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?</p> \n   <p>This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person. That\u2019s much more than the $1,200 per person check authorized by this bill.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T16:09:23.450Z\">at 4.09pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7e212b8f081e5eda23815f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T15:52:50.041Z\">3.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to manufacture ventilators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243559373395410957\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!

      "bodyText": "Wrapping up our live politics coverage for tonight. You can continue to follow our global coronavirus liveblog for updates around the world. A summary of the key news from today: Trump signed a historic $2.2tn emergency relief package into law. After delays, the president finally invoked the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to start making ventilators. At the daily White House coronavirus briefing, Trump said that in the next 100 days, the United States would try to produce or obtain 100,000 ventilators. Trump said that the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, told him today \u201cWe need ventilators,\u201d and that if the US made more ventilators than it needed, it would share them with the UK, Italy and other allies. Asked if every American who needed a ventilator would have one during this crisis, Trump lashed out against the reporter, calling him a \u201ccutie pie\u201d and \u201cwise guy\u201d and complained about the difficult situation he had inherited. The conditions in US immigration detention centers sparked a condemnation from Iran\u2019s foreign minister, who called on the US to release Iranians, including a doctor currently being held in an Ice detention center in Louisiana. Hundreds of employees of Bird, a scooter startup based in California, were laid off on Friday as the company grapples with decreased demand amid the coronavirus epidemic. \u201cThe unprecedented Covid-19 crisis has forced our leadership team and the board of directors to make many extremely difficult and painful decisions relating to some of your teammates\u201d, the Bird CEO, Travis VanderZanden, wrote to staffers in a memo obtained by the Guardian. The layoffs represent about 30% of the workforce of the shared scooter company. Bird confirmed the layoffs and said former employees will receive four weeks of pay and three months of health coverage. The company disputed reports that layoffs were carried out over a pre-recorded message on Zoom video conferencing. From Bird: \u201cBird employees are currently all working from home and the impacted individuals received the news on a web-based call. We purposefully and intentionally did not have any video on to protect privacy as we delivered the news live to individuals. A live speaker delivered the news over the web-based call and a slide was projected outlining additional information including four weeks of pay, three months of medical coverage and an extended timeframe to exercise options. Each individual then received a call or email from Bird\u2019s talent team as a follow up. We are eternally grateful to the impacted individuals and wish that the entire situation could have been avoided.\u201d Bird\u2019s layoffs come as many shared transportation companies struggle in the face of a global pandemic. Lime scooters have suspended service in the Bay Area in light of health concerns and Gig car share took cars off the streets to clean them this week, before reinstating them on Friday. The current situation in America\u2019s immigration detention centers is sparking international condemnation. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has called on the US to release Iranians jailed on sanctions-related issues as concerns about the spread of coronavirus are dramatically escalating. Citing the Guardian\u2019s reporting on one Iranian scientist\u2019s ongoing detention in an Louisiana, Zarif accused the US of taking \u201cseveral Iranian scientists hostage\u201d and keeping \u201cinnocent men jailed in horrific facilities\u201d: Dr Sirous Asgari, a materials science and engineering professor, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but remains jailed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). Speaking by phone from an Ice facility in Louisiana, he told the Guardian this week that the conditions inside were filthy and overcrowded, and officials were doing little to prevent a deadly Covid-19 outbreak: After Asgari was acquitted on charges of stealing trade secrets, he tried to \u201cself deport\u201d back to Iran, but Ice has kept him indefinitely detained. Asgari said detainees at his facility have no hand sanitizer and that Ice is not regularly cleaning the bathrooms. For two weeks, he said Ice also refused to let him use a mask he had brought with him even though he has a history of respiratory problems. In his tweet today, Zarif said the US was jailing Iranians \u201cwithout charge or on spurious sanctions charges\u201d and refusing to release them even when its OWN courts reject the absurd charges\u201d. Read more on Dr Asgari\u2019s situation here: Dr Fauci goes deep: \u2018We\u2019re in uncharted waters\u2019 Authority. Experience. The ability to communicate. Dr Anthony Fauci has become a trusted figure for many Americans overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. Today, at the end of another contentious and partially accurate White House coronavirus briefing, a reporter asked Fauci to take a step back and address a more philosophical question. In his years of responding to serious epidemics, had he experienced anything like the past month in the United States? While the HIV/Aids epidemic was incredibly devastating, the suffering and deaths unfolded more slowly than what people around the world are experiencing now, Fauci said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now, in actual real time, is something that\u2019s unprecedented. This is something we have never seen before, at least in our generation. They\u2019ve seen maybe something like this 100 years ago.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really being challenged to not only learn in real time, to be able to respond in a way that\u2019s helpful an effective, we\u2019re also in uncharted waters. That is the thing that I find different...\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if we have an example of how to do it.\u201d Los Angeles CCs 200 people on Covid-19 testing results email It appears the city of Los Angeles inadvertently notified more than 200 people about their Covid-19 results in a mass email that included the names of all recipients, according to LA Times reporter Soumya Karlamangla: The mass email, which reportedly failed to blind copy the recipients, was informing them of negative results, according to a screenshot posted by Karlamangla, who noted this was a major privacy violation: The email came from someone listed as a contract specialist for the mayor\u2019s office of public safety, writing on behalf of the health department\u2019s Covid-19 response team. Spokespeople for the mayor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment this afternoon. Update, 6:45pm local time in California: A spokesperson for the mayor has responded to the Guardian\u2019s questions, saying staff \u201caccidentally\u201d emailed results to 216 recipients who tested negative without blind copying the addresses, adding: \u201cWe apologize for this error, have alerted the recipients of yesterday\u2019s email and have revised the protocols associated with all notifications of this type to protect against any future disclosures.\u201d During briefing, Trump feuds with state governors, makes false claims Two key moments from Trump\u2019s coronavirus briefing today. Trump tossed out barbs at state governors he said have been insufficiently gracious to him, and said he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, just not to return their calls. (But added that Pence called them anyway.) And asked if his administration\u2019s belated push to manufacture or obtain 100,000 ventilators meant that everyone who needed a ventilator will be able to get one, he lashed out at the reporter asking the question, calling him a \u201cwise guy\u201d and complaining about all the problems he had inherited. Fact check: transition to online public school classes was not seamless Besty DeVos, the education secretary, claimed in the White House briefing today that the transition to online classes had been \u201cseamless\u201d. Fact: around 15% of households with school-age children don\u2019t have internet at home, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of 2015 census data. In addition, 20% of teens told Pew researchers (in a separate survey) that they often or sometimes can\u2019t complete homework assignments because they don\u2019t have reliable access to the internet or a computer. Both reports found that affected students are more likely to be from low-income and minority families. Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, told City Lab: \u201cThe kids whose families do have internet connection are going to have at least some learning continuing during this period, and the kids who don\u2019t won\u2019t.\u201d Panera Bread partnering with the USDA to serve meals to kids One of the country\u2019s fast casual food chains announced a partnership with the department of agriculture and a children\u2019s hunger group to serve fresh, healthy meals to kids across Ohio, and eventually across multiple states. Fact check: has Trump always taken coronavirus seriously? Trump today switched from saying that the coronavirus pandemic was unpredictable (see news coverage yesterday), to again claiming he\u2019d always taken it seriously: \u2018I was the first one to say to China, when they had the problem, not to come in and that was a long time ago.\u2019 In fact, at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, Trump repeatedly downplayed the threat, inaccurately comparing it to the flu and told his supporters that growing worry about the coronavirus was a \u201choax.. By the time Trump announced travel restrictions from China on 31 January, most major airlines had already suspended flights, following the lead of several major international carriers that had stopped due to the coronavirus outbreak. Advocates for students with disabilities are worried As the education secretary, Besty DeVos, wraps up her briefing, worth reading this important story: The education secretary, Besty DeVos, is now at the podium at the White House briefing giving an update on efforts to support students even as schools are closed. She also gave a salute to many teachers and other Americans who were doing inspiring things to keep kids learning and on track. In her list: the heroic volunteering efforts of....Karen Pence, the wife of the vice president, Mike Pence. Fact check: No, there will not be enough ventilators for every American In the White House press conference just now, Trump got testy when a reporter pressed him to answer whether he could say that every American who needed a ventilator would be able to access one. Trump did not answer. Instead, he complained that he had inherited a broken and unprepared country. The real answer to the question: no. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months. The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use, there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.\u201d Trump says of coronavirus \u2018I\u2019m not sure people know what it is\u2019 \u201cYou can call it a germ, a flu, a virus, you can call it many things. I\u2019m not sure people know what it is.\u201d That\u2019s the extraordinary comment that Trump made about coronavirus, in an off-hand way, as he riffed on his answer to a question about what he would tell American schoolchildren right now. Fact check: people know what it is: coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2. Can you promise that everyone who needs a ventilator get one? a reporter just asked Trump at the White House briefing. \u201cI think we\u2019re in really good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think we\u2019re in great shape.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve distributed vast numbers of ventilators and we\u2019re prepared to do vast numbers.\u201d The reporter pressed Trump again: Will everyone who needs a ventilator get one? \u201cDon\u2019t be a cutie pie,\u201d Trump told the reporter, repeating, mockingly, \u201c\u2018Everyone who needs one.\u2019\u201d \u201cNobody\u2019s ever done what we\u2019ve done,\u201d Trump went on. He complained the country \u201cwas a mess\u201d when he took over. \u201cIt was a broken country in so many ways. We had a bad testing system. We hd a bad stockpiling system.\u201d By asking the question about whether every American who needs a ventilator will get one, Trump said, the reporter was \u201cbeing a wise guy.\u201d Fact check: \u2018We have the smartest people in the world\u2019 Reassuring Americans that the coronavirus pandemic is very much under control in the United States, Trump said \u2018we [the US] have the smartest people in the world.\u2019 Should you want to fact check that claim: Research by Vouchercloud quantifies intelligence to include the number of Nobel Prizes each nation has won to represent historic intelligence, the current average IQ and \u2018education attainment\u2019 to represent the potential intelligence of the next generation. According to that study, the US ranks fourth behind Japan, Switzerland and China. Trump\u2019s message to school kids stuck at home Many American kids are stuck at home, frustrated, stir-crazy, and doing some school classes online, which is a poor substitute for actually learning in school, one White House reporter told Trump. What message does the president have for them? \u201cYou are a citizen of the greatest country in the world and we were attacked,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re winning the battle and we\u2019re going to win the war and it\u2019s not going to take hopefully that much longer.\u201d \u201cThey have a duty to sit back, watch, behave, wash their hands, stay in the apartment with mom and dad and just learn form it.\u201d \u201cSome of them are really happy not to go to school,\u201d Trump added. Then, back on message: \u201cThey should sit back and be very proud of our country, because we\u2019re doing it for them.\u201d Fact check: has the federal government built hospitals in Washington? Trump said most governors were very grateful to him and the federal government, but once again picked on a handful of governors including Jay Inslee of Washington state, who he referred to as a failed presidential candidate who\u2019s always complaining. \u201cWe\u2019ve built hospitals in Washington,\u201d Trump said. Fact: makeshift field hospitals are springing up in Washington thanks to local authorities and the Lummi nation. Trump has promised to build a new \u201cmedical station\u201d in Washington, but that has not happened yet. Trump says he\u2019s impressed by people complying with social distancing Trump said he was astonished to see so few people on the streets, and how well people were complying with social distancing measures even though there was not \u201ca law\u201d to make them comply. There were two reasons for that, he said. \u201cThey are afraid,\u201d he said, but also, \u201cthey really are wanting to win this thing.\u201d Trump less bullish on reopening the economy immediately After spending the early part of this week pledging that he wanted to end restrictive public health measures in weeks, possibly by Easter Sunday, Trump is now striking a more moderate tone, and suggesting public health guidelines might stay in place longer. Fact check: is the US testing more people than any country in the world? Claim: Trump said the US is now testing 100,000 people a day, more than any other country in the world. Fact: about 65,000 coronavirus tests a day are currently being done on Americans \u2013 a massive rise from 10 days ago but still 35,000 short of Trump\u2019s claim. Public health experts reckon 150,000 tests are needed every day so that infected patients can be identified quickly, traced and quarantined. The US has overtaken South Korea in total numbers of coronavirus tests administered, but, it has conducted far fewer tests per capita. As of Friday, the United States, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 540,718, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a group led by Alexis Madrigal, a staff writer for the Atlantic magazine, with more than 100 volunteers, that compiles coronavirus testing data from states. This equates to 175 tests per 100,000 people in the US (with huge variations depending on the county, city and state) compared to 709 per 100,000 in South Korea and 600 per 100,000 in Italy. Trump said that the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has tested positive for coronavirus, spoke with him today, and \u201cThe first thing he said to me is: \u2018We need ventilators.\u2019\u201d Trump said that it was unfortunate that Johnson had tested positive, but that he was going to be fine. Trump mentioned Johnson \u201casking for ventilators today\u201d twice, once in the context of a question about why Trump had gone from dismissing New York\u2019s needed for 30,000 ventilators yesterday on Fox News to announcing the US would try to obtain or manufacture 100,000 ventilators in the next few months, and would share them with other countries if they were not needed in the United States. Fact check Trump said the federal government had \u2018delivered thousands [of ventilators] to New York and they didn\u2019t know they got them.\u2019 Fact: Governor Andrew Cuomo says New York had 4,000 ventilators when the crisis began and has since bought another 7,000, but needs 30,000 more ventilators. In the past few days, the federal government has pledged a total of 4,000 ventilators to New York; this is additional to 400 that Fema has already sent. In an interview on Fox TV on Thursday, Trump said: he doesn\u2019t believe New York needs that many. \u201cI have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You go into major hospitals sometimes, and they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying, \u2018Can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u2019\u201d Just last night, Donald Trump was on Fox News saying that he was skeptical that New York needed 30,000 or 40,000 ventilators. Today, he\u2019s invoked the Defense Production Act to mandate that General Motors manufacture ventilators, and is saying at a White House press briefing that the US will be manufacturing or obtaining 100,000 ventilators, not just for American hospitals but also for other countries that might need them. Asked by a reporter about about his claim last night that these ventilators were not needed, Trump said, \u201cWell, I think that there\u2019s a very good chance we won\u2019t need that many.\u201d \u201cBut you know, there\u2019s a lot of other countries that are going to need them. There are countries all over the world who are friends of ours.\u201d \u201cWe can make them, and if we don\u2019t need them...that\u2019s OK. We can help Italy. We can help UK.\u201d \u201cAll over the world they want them, and we\u2019re in the position to make them, and others aren\u2019t.\u201d A new fact-check of the claims Trump is making in this press conference. Trump said that the United States had been building new hospitals in two or three days, and \u201cthat\u2019s never been done before\u201d. Fact: the army corps of engineers has set-up field hospitals in countries across the world within days, but so far, the first is yet to open in the US to treat Covid-19 patients. The corps is currently assessing 114 different facilities in 50 states and five territories, according to Lieutenant General Todd Semonite. He said the corps had assessed 81 of the facilities so far, and hoped to have 2,910 rooms ready at the Javits Center in New York by Monday. Trump said that in the next hundred days the US will produce 100,000 ventilators, which he said was three times the number of ventilators made \u201cduring a regular year in the United States\u201d. Maggie Haberman, the New York Times White House correspondent, added some context: After many delays, and then a series of tweets earlier today, Donald Trump is invoking the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to built ventilators for hospitals, he announced at the White House\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, he announced at a White House briefing. The Defense Production Act gives the president powers to direct domestic industrial production to provide essential materials and goods needed in a national security crisis. It allows the president to require businesses and corporations to prioritize and accept contracts for required materials and services. While Trump likes to work cooperatively with the private sector, he said, \u201cWhere an emergency exists and it\u2019s very important that we get to the bottom line and quickly, we will do what we have to do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a brutal pandemic,\u201d Trump said at the beginning of the briefing. The White House coronavirus briefing is about to begin....stand by. National Rifle Association sues California officials over gun store closures Lois Beckett here taking over our live politics coverage here from our California bureau. We\u2019re expecting a White House coronavirus press briefing shortly. Meanwhile, a new front in the battle by American gun rights activists to ensure that gun and ammunition sellers must be deemed \u201cessential businesses\u201d that cannot be shut down, even during a public health crisis: the National Rifle Association and other groups have filed a lawsuit against the California governor, Gavin Newsom, the Los Angeles county sheriff, and other state and local officials. Yesterday, the Los Angeles county sheriff, Alex Villanueva, once again ordered gun shops to close during the coronavirus crisis, citing public health concerns over long lines at gun stores due to panic buying of guns and ammunition. A county legal counsel had advised that gun stores were essential businesses and should remain open. Trump just signed the $2.2tn stimulus package into law. The bill, named the Cares Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act), gives aid to corporation, businesses and taxpayers and eventually received bipartisan report after a tumultuous week in Congress. Navy hospital ship docked in Los Angeles The Mercy hospital ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles on Friday, ready to help California meet an expected surge on hospital beds and provide space to treat patients. Docked ships serve as a backdrop as California governor Gavin Newsom joined Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti to host an afternoon press conference in front of docked ships, underway now. The Mercy, a Navy hospital ship, has about 800 medical staffers, 1,000 hospital beds and 12 operating rooms. The ship will be used to provide care for patients who don\u2019t have Covid-19 so space in hospitals can be used for patients battling the virus. California Governor Gavin Newsom said earlier this week the state will need to add 50,000 hospital beds to help the state prevent a surge on hospitals, like the one now overwhelming New York hospitals. Newsom also announced Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday announced a temporary ban on evictions statewide for those affected by the coronavirus. The order prevents landlords from evicting tenants for not paying, and extends through May 31 and covers those who\u2019ve lost work due to the outbreak. Fourth US representative tests positive for Covid-19 A fourth member of the US House of Representatives has been tested positive for Covid-19. US representative Mike Kelly, a Republican from Pennsylvania, says that he tested positive and is experience mild flu-like symptoms. Kelly is at his home in Pennsylvania. Kelly is the fourth member of the House, and the fifth member of Congress, to test positive for Covid-19. Louisiana reports 119 dead from Covid-19 Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards has just concluded his daily press briefing and reported the state\u2019s largest day-on-day death toll increase. 119 people have now died from Covid-19, an increase of 39 in 24 hours. There are 2,746 cases of the virus in the state, 441 more than yesterday, marking a 19% increase. This is not the sharpest increase in confirmed cases of the virus in the state, but the governor adds that there was less testing yesterday than the day before. \u201cWe are doing everything within our power to respond to this crisis,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cWe remain on the growth curve, the trajectory that we don\u2019t like.\u201d The state is still on track to reach hospital capacity by the first week of April. \u201c[The] trajectory suggests won\u2019t be able to cope,\u201d Edwards said. In an indication of the scale of the crisis and the difficulty the state is facing, Edwards says he has requested 12,000 additional ventilators, 5,000 from the national stockpile and the rest from the private sector. He has received just 192. The state requested federal assistance to create four, 250 bed new hospital units. It was approved for half of those. Edwards say that to date no state inmates have tested positive for Covid-19. Louisiana has the highest rate of incarceration anywhere in the United States. The White House just confirmed that it is invoking the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to start making ventilators. United Airlines says layoffs are expected United Airlines says that it expects to conduct layoffs as a result of the dramatic drop in flights the airline has seen in the last few weeks, according to CNBC. The number of people laid off has yet to be announced. This is in spite of the stimulus package Congress just passed, and the president will be signing in a few minutes, that will give commercial airline carriers $50bn in loans. \u201cThe global economy has taken a big hit, and we don\u2019t expect travel demand to snap back for some time,\u201d United CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement. The company said it has had to cut scheduled flights by 60% and they expect planes to fly at 20% full or less. Donald Trump will be signing the stimulus package at 4pm this afternoon. The signing will be followed by a news conference at 5pm. Donald Trump just released an ad called \u201cHope\u201d that uses sound bytes from various public figures that make it appear they are praising the president for his efforts combating Covid-19. Florida to set up checkpoints to intercept travelers coming from Gulf Coast At a press conference just now, Florida governor Ron DeSantis announced that the state will be setting up checkpoints at major entryways into the state from the Gulf Coast. The state has been trying to intercept travelers coming from hotspot areas, including New York and Louisiana. DeSantis ordered schools, bars and restaurants closed, but he has been criticized for not ordering nonessential workers to stay at home. Florida has nearly 3,000 cases of the illness with a death toll of 35. Third House rep tests positive for Covid-19 Joe Cunningham, a Democratic representative from South Carolina, said that he tested positive for Covid-19. Cunningham, who is in self-quarantine at his home South Carolina, said that he started to lose his sense of smell and taste, which are potential symptoms of the illness. He is the third member of the House to test positive for Covid-19. Two other representatives, one from Florida and another from Utah, said they tested positive last week. Workers at McDonald\u2019s, Waffle House and other fast-food and retail outlets have gone on strike today across Durham and Raleigh in North Carolina in protest against unsafe working conditions, lost hours and pay cuts. The workers are demanding increased safety protocols and payment for lost hours as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fast-food companies have been designated as essential services and can remain open, but the strikers say they have treated their workers as anything but essential, failing to protect them against infections and laying them off as soon as they are not needed. \u201cFrontline workers like us are getting hit the hardest right now,\u201d said Rita Blalock, a McDonald\u2019s cook in Raleigh. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s is calling itself an \u201cessential business\u2019 but isn\u2019t providing us with the essential protections we need to be safe at work.\u201d We wrote about this escalating issue earlier this month. Read our story here: Four passengers aboard Zaandam cruise ship dead from flu-like symptoms Four passengers of the Zaandam cruise ship have died from what appears to be Covid-19, according to the Miami Herald. About 150 passengers on the ship, which is awaiting permission to pass through the Panama Canal, with the end destination of Port Everglades in Florida, have developed flu-like symptoms. Carnival Corp. is the owner of the ship. The captain of the ship announced the deaths to crew members and passengers Friday afternoon and said that healthy passengers would be evacuated onto a nearby sister ship. Cruise ships have been a hotbed for the spread of Covid-19, starting with the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined off the coast of Japan in early February and saw more than 700 people onboard infected. At least 25 other cruise ships have seen confirmed cases onboard. Instacart workers plan nationwide strike Instacart workers are planning a nationwide strike beginning Monday, until the company gives them hazard pay, safety gear and paid leave for sick and at-risk employees. They want an additional $5 per order and an automatic tip of 10%, and they are asking for hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and sprays and soap. They also want workers who are at higher risk because of pre-existing conditions or require self-quarantine to get \u201can extension and expansion of pay.\u201d Instacart has offered workers up to two weeks of paid leave if they test positive for Covid-19, but tests are in short supply. The offer lasts only until April 8, according to Vice. The Instacart Shoppers and Gig Workers Collective said their requests have so far been ignored. \u201cInstacart has turned this pandemic into a PR campaign, portraying itself the hero of families that are sheltered-in-place, isolated, or quarantined,\u201d a Medium post from organizers said. \u201cInstacart has still not provided essential protections to Shoppers on the front lines that could prevent them from becoming carriers, falling ill themselves, or worse. Instacart\u2019s promise to pay Shoppers up to 14 days of pay if diagnosed or placed in mandatory quarantine not only falls short, but isn\u2019t even being honored.\u201d Instacart is currently trying to hire 300,000 additional workers to meet higher demand. The company just posted what appears to be a response to news of the strike on Medium, emphasizing the measures the company has taken in response to Covid-19. \u201cCommunities across North America are facing challenges brought by this uncertain time, and we\u2019re immensely grateful for all that you do to support families and people in need by delivering their groceries and everyday goods,\u201d Instacart said in its statement. The bill \u2013 the largest stimulus package in US history \u2013 went through a tumultuous journey through Congress, though it is expected to go into law once Donald Trump signs it. Senate Republicans drafted the bill last week and went through around-the-clock negotiations with Senate Democrats and the White House to get everyone on the same page. There was a lot of disagreement over how much money to give corporations and what kind of oversight would be given for federal loans. Democrats also called for more aid to hospitals and state and local governments whose budgets have been wrecked by coronavirus response. The Senate managed to pass the bill on Wednesday. But just yesterday, Thomas Massie, a Republican representative from Kentucky, threatened to hold up the voting of the bill by calling for a recorded tally of votes for the bill in the House. That would require representatives to go back to Congress, though many have left the Hill because of the quick spread of Covid-19. Massie was sharply criticized by his Republican and Democratic colleagues who were eager to get the bill passed as quickly as possible. When Massie voiced his desire to hold a vote, Anthony Brown, the presiding officer, ruled that Massie did not have enough support for Quick recap of what\u2019s in the stimulus package: It\u2019s worth over $2tn and provides various aids to corporations, businesses and individuals. The main components are: Direct payment to most Americans \u2013 up to $1,200 per taxpayer. $250bn to bolster unemployment insurance. Over $350bn in loans for small businesses that may be forgiven if firms use them to keep workers on payroll. $500bn in aid for hard-hit industries and states and $50bn for airlines. $130bn in aid to hospitals. $150bn to help state and local governments The House just passed the $2.2tn stimulus package after a Republican representative threatened to delay the vote this morning. The bill will now go to Donald Trump, who has voiced his approval of the bill. New York governor Andrew Cuomo held his daily public briefing on Friday with not just press and a television audience but soldiers brought up from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, to assist the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. The briefing was held at the Jacob Javits conference center on the far west side of midtown Manhattan, where a field hospital with more than 1,000 beds is being prepared. We covered some of Cuomo\u2019s conference earlier, and a lot of news has broken since then. But in summary, he warned that the situation will worsen in New York, especially in the city. Cuomo expects the apex of cases to be reached in 21 days\u2019 time. He said the death toll had surged, up to 519 on Friday morning from 280 on Wednesday, because coronavirus patients in acute condition who had been on ventilators for the last three weeks hadn\u2019t survived. \u201cThe longer you are on a ventilator the less likely that you are goin got come off that ventilator,\u201d he said. Warning that the death toll in the state, but especially the city, will rise, Cuomo said: \u201cIt\u2019s bad news, it\u2019s tragic news, it\u2019s the worst news.\u201d A senior member of the city government in Washington, DC, has died from the coronavirus. The capital\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, announced Friday that George Valentine, deputy director of the mayor\u2019s office of legal counsel, had died that morning, The Associated Press writes. Bowser said Valentine\u2019s death was \u201cdevastating for everybody\u201d and that contact tracing was in progress to determine who Valentine may have come into contact with and who might have been exposed to him. According to his LinkedIn page, Valentine came to the mayor\u2019s office just over a year ago after spending more than 15 years with the Washington, DC, Attorney General\u2019s office. Bowser said he was admitted to a hospital and diagnosed with Covid-19 on Wednesday. Here\u2019s a summary of this morning\u2019s happenings as I hand off to Lauren Aratani for the afternoon: Kentucky representative\u2019s move to delay passage of $2.2tn relief package thwarted. The attempt by maverick congressman Thomas Massie to demand a roll call vote and hold up passage of until most lawmakers return to Washington has apparently been spoiled with a quorum having reported to the House chamber for a vote on Friday afternoon. Andrew Cuomo says New York schools will be closed another two weeks. The New York governor said in Friday\u2019s daily briefing that schools in the state will be open no earlier than 15 April and warned the demand for hospitalization will peak in 21 days and the state is creating a stockpile of medical equipment in preparation for that \u201capex\u201d accordingly. Boris Johnson says he\u2019s tested positive for coronavirus. The UK prime minister and health secretary say they have mild symptoms and will continue to lead Covid-19 response in isolation. Trump invokes Defense Production Act in urging GM to manufacture ventilators. The US has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. Congresspeople have occupied spaces in the public gallery above the House chamber floor to maintain social distancing while establishing the quorum of 216 members necessary to vote for the $2.2tn coronavirus relief bill. A notice has just gone out to House members saying that enough members are present and a vote is likely to be requested within the hour. People who can\u2019t afford April\u2019s or May\u2019s rent thanks to Covid-19 crisis unemployment are being asked to hang a white sheet outside their homes to demand a rent strike. The protest movement, which started in Montreal last week and has already spread across Canada and the US, demands governments pause housing payments while the pandemic ravages people\u2019s ability to earn income. \u201cWe want landlords and tenants to come together in asking the government for cancellation of rent payments and cancellation of mortgage payments, including interest, for the duration of the health emergency,\u201d said Sunny Doyle, one of the organizers of White Sheets For the Rent Strike. \u201cWe can\u2019t be putting people in individualized fights with their landlords, where the power relations aren\u2019t equal.\u201d Doyle said her landlady hung a huge white sheet off the side of the triplex they share. She said even those who can afford their rent are invited to hang a sheet in support. With many provinces now under lockdown, Canada anticipates it will see four million jobless claims by the time the Covid-19 crisis is over. This week, the Canadian government announced a $2,000 monthly benefit for citizens put out of work by the virus. It\u2019s official: Kentucky congressman Thomas Massie will hold up the $2.2tn relief bill, refusing to back down in spite of backlash from Donald Trump. Massie will force the house to take a recorded vote on the stimulus plan, a move that will prolong but ultimately not stop the rescue package from passing. In a series of 11 tweets, Massie outlined his rationale for making his colleagues returning to Washington in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The bill has the votes to pass and the president has said he would sign it. Trump tried to dissuade the Massie from holding up the vote. In a series of tweets on Friday morning, he assailed Massie as a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d Trump also suggested Republicans should \u201cthrow Massie out\u201d of the party. Massie\u2019s statement reads in full: I swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpresent.\u201d The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did? I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week. The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process. This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency. If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country? This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person. That\u2019s much more than the $1,200 per person check authorized by this bill. Donald Trump has invoked the Defense Production Act in a series of tweets urging General Motors to take the lead in manufacturing ventilators. The Defense Production Act gives the president powers to direct domestic industrial production to provide essential materials and goods needed in a national security crisis. It allows the president to require businesses and corporations to prioritise and accept contracts for required materials and services. It also allows the president to provide incentives for the domestic industrial base to expand the production and supply of critical materials and goods, according to a 2 March report by the Congressional Research Service. Cuomo says New York will require 140,000 hospital beds and 40,000 intensive care unit beds with ventilators at the apex. Currently, the state has 53,000 regular hospital beds and 3,000 ICU beds. To meet the need, Cuomo says they will seek to build another four temporary hospitals working with the US army corps of engineers. New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing is under way from the Javits Center on Manhattan\u2019s West Side, which has been temporarily repurposed as a hospital for Covid-19 patients. Cuomo says New York City schools will stay closed for at least another two weeks until at least 15 April. He adds that he expects the demand for hospitalization to peak in 21 days and the state is creating a stockpile of medical equipment in preparation for that \u201capex\u201d accordingly. \u201cWe collect, it we hold, if a hospital needs, a region needs it, then we deploy it,\u201d he says. California lawmaker Adam Schiff, chairman of the intelligence committee, voiced support for the $2tn package on Friday morning, telling CNN that he emerged from self-isolation to do so. \u201cWe cannot see what course this virus will take,\u201d Schiff said as the debate continued on the House floor. \u201cMany months of sacrifice and self-discipline will lie ahead for the American people. We will be tested. And we will prevail.\u201d Former US secretary of state John Kerry has unloaded on Kentucky lawmaker Thomas Massie for his role in holding up the relief bill, finding rare common ground with Donald Trump along the way. A bit of history between the pair: Massie infamously attempted to discredit Kerry\u2019s credentials on climate change during a house oversight and reform committee hearing last year. New York representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, whose district has been devastated by the pandemic, rips into the corporate welfare deeply embedded the $2tn bill on the House floor. The congresswoman\u2019s district includes Elmhurst Hospital, where at least 13 patients died from coronavirus in a 24-hour span earlier this week. \u201cOur community\u2019s reality is this country\u2019s future if we don\u2019t do anything,\u201d said says. \u201cHospital workers do not have protective equipment. We don\u2019t have the necessary ventilators. We have to go into this vote eyes wide open. What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!\u201d California congresswoman Katie Porter, who announced on Wednesday that she was self-quarantining after experiencing symptoms related to Covid-19, says her test came back negative and called the news \u201ca relief\u201d. At least two members of the House and one US senator have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, while more than a dozen are self-quarantined after brushes with people who have symptoms or have tested positive for the disease. A Los Angeles boy who is believed to be the first teenager in the United States to die from complications due to Covid-19 was denied treatment at an urgent care clinic because he didn\u2019t have health insurance. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have insurance, so they did not treat him,\u201d says R Rex Parris, the mayor of Lancaster, California. \u201cHe had been sick for a few days, he had no previous health conditions. On the Friday before he died, he was healthy, he was socializing with his friends.\u201d Los Angeles County currently has 1,216 Covid-19 cases and 21 deaths, according to the county public health department\u2019s website. Haley Stevens, a freshman Democratic senator from Michigan whose district has been hit particularly hard by the virus, has been ruled out of order after shouting through the gavel during the House debate on the relief bill. \u201cTo our doctors and nurses, I wear these latex gloves to tell every American: Do not be afraid!\u201d says Stevens, who drove overnight from Michigan for today\u2019s session. \u201cYou will see darkness! You will be pushed! Our society needs you to stand together at this time! Mary Namorato, a New Yorker separated from her daily gym work-out, has filed a lawsuit against New York Sports Clubs, a chain of more than 50 city gyms, for allegedly refusing to refund her membership fees after the coronavirus pandemic forced the company to close earlier this month. Namorato, who filed the suit on Thursday in Manhattan Federal Court \u201con behalf of herself and all others similarly situated\u201d, claims New York Sports Clubs (\u201cNYSC\u201d) is \u201cdefrauding and stealing from gym members\u201d by continuing to charge gym membership fees to its approximately 605,000 members. The complaint alleges that the chain\u2019s holding company, Town Sports International Holdings, Inc. (\u201cTSI\u201d), has made \u201cit virtually impossible for members to cancel their memberships and has even refused to honor many members\u2019 cancellation requests,\u201d the complaint says. \u201cAt a time when New Yorkers are using all their efforts to help one another and make sacrifices necessary to meet the daily challenges associated with a the health and economic crisis created by the novel coronavirus are suffering, TSI is defrauding and stealing from customers.\u201d In contrast, other New York gyms, including Equinox, Planet Fitness and Blink Fitness have announced that gym membership charges have been suspended due to gym closures, Namorato\u2019s legal representataives said. \u201cWe are standing up for all New Yorkers who are being taken advantage of, lied to and stolen from by New York Sports Clubs,\u201d said lawyer David Gottlieb, a partner at Wigdor LLC. \u201cWe specifically ask the New York State attorney general\u2019s office to join us in this fight to send a message not only to NYSC but to all businesses that this form of fraudulent opportunism has no place in our state and will not be tolerated, particularly during a health and economic crisis.\u201d Representatives of New York Sports Club, and its parent company, Town Sports International LLC, did not return requests for comment. Good morning, this is Bryan Armen Graham in New York, covering the latest on the coronavirus in the US and American politics. The US House of representatives is set to pass a $2.2tn package later Friday to ease the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s devastating toll on the economy and healthcare system following a 96-0 vote in the Senate, though the actions of a single lawmaker could delay proceedings by several hours. Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie, who has voiced his opposition the bill, has threatened to demand a roll call vote, which would hold up passage until most lawmakers return to Washington for a vote, prompting backlash at a time when Americans have been urged to self-quarantine or maintain distance from one another. \u201cHeading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House,\u201d New York representative Peter King wrote on Twitter. \u201cRisk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.\u201d Elsewhere, Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus and will have to work leading the government\u2019s efforts to tackle the pandemic in isolation. In a video posted on Twitter, the prime minister confirmed he had developed mild symptoms \u2013 \u201ca temperature and persistent cough\u201d \u2013 over the last 24 hours and, on the advice of the chief medical officer, he took a test which returned positive for coronavirus. Johnson, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home. He said thanks to \u201cthe wizardry of modern technology\u201d he would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.",

Two people have tested positive for the disease and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms on the Zaandam luxury cruise liner, which has not been able to dock after several Latin American countries closed their ports in response to the global pandemic. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens are in isolation in their rooms and a boat-to-boat operation is underway to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, over the weekend. But there are fears that sick, elderly passengers and crew members will be left stranded at sea during a global pandemic, with some on board isolating in small, humid cabins with no natural light or fresh air. Holland America Line, which owns the cruise ship, confirmed on Friday that four elderly passengers had died onboard. It is not clear whether they died after catching Covid-19. \u201cUnfortunately, four of our fellow guests have passed away \u2013 one last night, two yesterday and one a few days ago,\u201d the ship\u2019s captain Captain Jan Smit said in an announcement, which was obtained by The Guardian. \u201cWe are still seeing both guests and crew with symptoms reporting to the medical center.

The Zaandam, is just one of at least 10 ships stuck at sea as of Thursday-- carrying nearly 10,000 passengers \u2013 around the globe, after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, a Guardian analysis of ship tracking data has found. In a statement on Friday, Holland America Line said that once healthy passengers had been moved to the Rotterdam, the company planned to sail both cruise ships to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, keeping all passengers in isolation on both ships. But when contacted by the Guardian, Broward County authorities in Florida said it had not yet received a formal request for docking from Holland America, nor has a plan been worked out with the federal and state health officials. \u201cIt\u2019s very scary,\u201d said Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine Friday. \u201cWe are waiting for a plan to be presented to us.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the Panama Canal people will let their employees get on a ship with coronavirus in order to get it through the canal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sticky situation.\u201d He said, before the county commission could approve a docking in Fort Lauderdale \u201cwe would need to be sure that it is safe for the residents of South Florida\u201d. \u201cRemember, we\u2019re already a hotspot,\u201d said Udine, noting that hospitals in Broward County are already filling up with Covid-19 patients and running short of medical supplies. \u201cIt would be difficult for us if 1500 people (potentially needing treatment) just got off the ship.\u201d In a statement, the Panama Canal said that all journeys through the system required their staff to board ships and restrictions on ships with Covid-19 outbreaks were in place to protect workers. Panama is battling the largest outbreak in the region, with 786 cases and 14 deaths as of Friday. The British Foreign Office said they are doing \u201call they can\u201d to help citizens on board and are in close contact with the cruise operator and authorities in the region.",

      "bodyText": "The number of interstate coronavirus cases from the Ruby Princess cruise ship has risen sharply after more than 100 Australians outside of New South Wales tested positive for the disease. So far, 171 people in NSW and at least 122 interstate have been diagnosed with Covid-19 after they left the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which was allowed to dock twice in Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay. Queensland Health confirmed on Friday that 32 people in the state had tested positive from the ship across its two trips \u2013 up from only nine on Tuesday. In South Australia there are now 53 cases linked to the Ruby Princess, and 21 cases in the Australian Capital Territory. On 19 March 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark without checks from NSW Health, with many boarding flights interstate. Another boatload of passengers did the same on 8 March. On Tuesday NSW Health revealed there were 11 cases in Western Australia, nine in Queensland, three in Tasmania, two in the Northern Territory and one in the ACT linked to the ship. But on Friday the NSW department said it would stop \u201cproviding any more national or interstate figures, just our NSW figures\u201d, despite the rise in interstate cases. In South Australia cases from the Ruby Princess are the single biggest cluster of coronavirus cases, making up a fifth of the state\u2019s total. Three Queenslanders who were on board the ship told Guardian Australia they were expecting to be tested but had been texted while on the ship to \u201cdisembark\u201d and board a bus to Sydney airport. The daughter of one of the passengers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said her mother and two friends had all tested positive for Covid-19 since leaving Sydney. \u201cWe all assumed they would have to stay on the ship until cleared,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mum and friends thought this would be the case also. \u201cNext thing we know, we all receive a text saying that all passengers had to disembark and were put on a bus to Sydney airport with nothing more than a leaflet instructing them to self-isolate upon arriving home. \u201cMy father, who does not leave home due to his health, made the choice and effort to pick Mum up from the airport [in Queensland] as he didn\u2019t want to risk anyone else\u2019s health.\u201d The passenger\u2019s daughter said her father had also contracted Covid-19. \u201cThis should never have happened,\u201d she said. \u201cHow many people have these passengers encountered on their return home to isolate?

Hospitals in New York City, New Orleans, Detroit and other virus hotspots have sounded the alarm about scarcities of drugs, medical supplies and trained staff. \u201cThis is going to be weeks and weeks and weeks,\u201d the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, told members of the National Guard working at the Javits convention centre which has been converted to hospital. \u201cThis is going to be a long day, and it\u2019s going to be a hard day, and it\u2019s going to be an ugly day, and it\u2019s going to be a sad day.\u201d In California a navy hospital ship, the Mercy, has docked at the Port of Los Angeles to provide 1,000 beds and full medical facilities \u2013 freeing up hospitals on land for seriously ill coronavirus patients, as the state braces for an outbreak potentially on New York\u2019s scale. The president on Friday invoked a national security law compelling General Motors (GM) to mass produce ventilators \u2013 accompanied by barbs that the carmaker had not been acting quickly enough. Some saw it as partly an act of spite amid Trump\u2019s continuing feud with the company \u2013 GM said it had already been working around the clock for more than a week to help build more ventilators. Italy became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching more than 86,000 cases. Its latest 969 deaths represent the highest national one-day figure anywhere since the outbreak began, seemingly dashing hopes that Italy might be flattening its rate of infection. South Korea reported 146 new coronavirus cases on Friday, the highest number in a week, its disease control agency said. Officials said they were \u201cimported\u201d cases: infected people who had arrived from Europe and the United States during recent days. China\u2019s National Health Commission said on Saturday that 54 new coronavirus infections had been reported on the mainland on Friday, all involving so-called imported cases. There were 55 new cases a day earlier. The total number of infections for mainland China stood at 81,394 with the death toll rising by three to 3,295, the commission said. The number of coronavirus deaths in the UK has risen sharply from 578 to 759, the country\u2019s biggest day-on-day increase to date. Passengers on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama have issued a plea to be allowed to dock after four people died on board. It was not yet known on Friday whether the deaths were coronavirus-related but two people tested positive on the Zaandam, operated by Holland America Line, while dozens were taken ill with flu-like symptoms. Hundreds of North American, Australian and British citizens were in isolation in their rooms as a boat-to-boat operation began to move some healthy travellers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, throughout the weekend. Panamanian authorities were refusing to let the Zaandam pass through the canal to reach Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after other countries including Chile and Argentina turned it away. Around the world, quarantine and lockdown conditions have caused a rise in domestic violence. In Hubei province, China, domestic violence reports to police more than tripled in one county during February, activists said. In Spain the Catalan regional government said calls to its helpline had risen by 20% while Italian crisis centres said they were fielding desperate text messages and emails. \u201cOne message was from a woman who had locked herself in the bathroom and wrote to ask for help,\u201d said Lella Palladino, president of D.i.Re, the Women against Violence Network. \u201cThere is more desperation as women can\u2019t go out.\u201d",

It was on that day that a 35-year-old man in Washington state, recently returned from visiting family in Wuhan in China, became the first person in the US to be <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\">diagnosed</a> with the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/new-york-coronavirus-help-de-blasio-urges-trump-us-hotspots-emerge\">New York mayor urges Trump to help as more US coronavirus hotspots emerge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the very same day, 5,000 miles away in Asia, the first confirmed case of Covid-19 was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4\">reported</a> in South Korea. The confluence was striking, but there the similarities ended.</p> \n<p>In the two months since that fateful day, the responses to coronavirus displayed by the US and South Korea have been polar opposites.</p> \n<p>One country acted swiftly and aggressively to detect and isolate the virus, and by doing so has largely contained the crisis. The other country dithered and procrastinated, became mired in chaos and confusion, was distracted by the individual whims of its leader, and is now confronted by a health emergency of daunting proportions.</p> \n<p>Within a week of its first confirmed case, South Korea\u2019s disease control agency had summoned 20 private companies to the medical equivalent of a war-planning summit and told them to develop a test for the virus at lightning speed. A week after that, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-specialrep/special-report-how-korea-trounced-u-s-in-race-to-test-people-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN2153BW?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">first diagnostic test</a> was approved and went into battle, identifying infected individuals who could then be quarantined to halt the advance of the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e9b8e382f2bd553dcf7afd55b54cde69b6f2e06\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e9b8e382f2bd553dcf7afd55b54cde69b6f2e06/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse at testing booth outside the Yangji hospital in Seoul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse at testing booth outside the Yangji hospital in Seoul.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some 357,896 tests later, the country has more or less won the coronavirus war.

Two days after the first diagnosis in Washington state, Donald Trump went on air on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/trump-on-coronavirus-from-china-we-have-it-totally-under-control.html\">CNBC</a> and bragged: \u201cWe have it totally under control.

It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018A fiasco of incredible proportions\u2019</h2> \n<p>A week after that, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion article by two former top health policy officials within the Trump administration under the headline <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/act-now-to-prevent-an-american-epidemic-11580255335\">Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic</a>. Luciana Borio and Scott Gottlieb laid out a menu of what had to be done instantly to avert a massive health disaster.</p> \n<p>Top of their to-do list: work with private industry to develop an \u201ceasy-to-use, rapid diagnostic test\u201d \u2013 in other words, just what South Korea was doing.</p> \n<p>It was not until 29 February, more than a month after the Journal article and almost six weeks after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the country that the Trump administration put that advice into practice. Laboratories and hospitals would finally be allowed to conduct their own Covid-19 tests to speed up the process.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Today, 86,012 cases have been confirmed in the US, pushing the nation to the top of the world\u2019s coronavirus league table</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Those missing four to six weeks are likely to go down in the definitive history as a cautionary tale of the potentially devastating consequences of failed political leadership.

He told the Guardian: \u201cWe are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Konyndyk\u2019s analysis, the White House had all the information it needed by the end of January to act decisively. Instead, Trump repeatedly played down the severity of the threat, blaming China for what he called the <a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/489464-trumps-use-of-the-term-chinese-virus-for\">\u201cChin</a><a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/diversity-inclusion/489464-trumps-use-of-the-term-chinese-virus-for\">ese virus\u201d</a> and insisting falsely that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\">partial travel bans</a> on China and Europe were all it would take to contain the crisis.</p> \n<h2>\u2018The CDC was caught flat-footed\u2019</h2> \n<p>If Trump\u2019s travel ban did nothing else, it staved off to some degree the advent of the virus in the US, buying a little time. Which makes the lack of decisive action all the more curious.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use that time optimally, especially in the case of testing,\u201d said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University medical center. \u201cWe have been playing reluctant catch-up throughout.\u201d</p> \n<p>As Schaffner sees it, the stuttering provision of mass testing \u201cput us behind the eight-ball\u201d right at the start. \u201cIt did not permit us, and still doesn\u2019t permit us, to define the extent of the virus in this country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Though the decision to allow private and state labs to provide testing has increased the flow of test kits, the US remains starkly behind South Korea, which has conducted more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a30402000000&amp;bid=0030\">five times</a> as many tests per capita. That makes predicting where the next hotspot will pop up after New York and New Orleans almost impossible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6634108c11f4d7912db048220fbf46d0d854fe9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6634108c11f4d7912db048220fbf46d0d854fe9/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The National Guard is helping to manage a Covid-19 testing site in the Treme neighborhood of New Orleans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The national guard is helping to manage a Covid-19 testing site in the Treme neighborhood of New Orleans.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bryan Tarnowski for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the absence of sufficient test kits, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially kept a tight rein on testing, creating a bottleneck. \u201cI believe the CDC was caught flat-footed,\u201d was how the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-photos-rush-transcript-novel-coronavirus-briefing-governor-cuomo-declares-state\">put it</a> on 7 March. \u201cThey\u2019re slowing down the state.\u201d</p> \n<p>The CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/health/coronavirus-test-kits-cdc.html\">botched rollout of testing</a> was the first indication that the Trump administration was faltering as the health emergency gathered pace. Behind the scenes, deep flaws in the way federal agencies had come to operate under Trump were being exposed.</p> \n<p>In 2018 the pandemic unit in the national security council \u2013 which was tasked to prepare for health emergencies precisely like the current one \u2013 was disbanded. \u201cEliminating the office has contributed to the federal government\u2019s sluggish domestic response,\u201d Beth Cameron, a former senior director of the office, wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">Washington Post</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We didn\u2019t use that time optimally, especially in the case of testing.

The agency recently indicated that it was looking into the possibility of prescribing the malaria drug <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/489576-fda-commissioner-warns-public-against-taking-any-form-of-chloroquine-unless\">chloroquine</a> for coronavirus sufferers, even though there is no evidence it would work and some indication it could have serious side-effects.</p> \n<p>The decision dismayed experts, given that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-21/trump-pushes-malaria-drug-for-covid-19-but-evidence-is-lacking\">Trump has personally</a> pushed the unproven remedy on a whim. It smacked of the wave of anti-science sentiment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-trump-administration-brain-drain-impeding-response\">sweeping federal agencies</a> under this presidency.</p> \n<p>As the former senior official put it: \u201cWe have the FDA bowing to political pressure and making decisions completely counter to modern science.\u201d</p> \n<p>Highly respected career civil servants, with impeccable scientific credentials, have struggled to get out in front of the president. Dr Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert who has become a rare trusted face in the administration amid the coronavirus scourge, has expressed his frustration.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3587b2b3aabfe766994dba2967b702ae7e4dc08d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3587b2b3aabfe766994dba2967b702ae7e4dc08d/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Secretary of state Mike Pompeo with Dr Anthony Fauci and HHS secretary Alex Azar.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, with Dr Anthony Fauci and the health secretary, Alex Azar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Al Drago/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This week Fauci was asked by a Science magazine writer, <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/i-m-going-keep-pushing-anthony-fauci-tries-make-white-house-listen-facts-pandemic\">Jon Cohen</a>, how he could stand beside Trump at daily press briefings and listen to him misleading the American people with comments such as that the China travel ban had been a great success in blocking entry of the virus. Fauci replied: \u201cI know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has designated himself a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/\">\u201cwartime president\u201d</a>. But if the title bears any validity, his military tactics have been highly unconventional. He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force. </p> \n<p>The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-announces-ambassador-debbie-birx-serve-white-house-coronavirus-response-coordinator/\">appointed Deborah Birx</a> \u201ccoronavirus response coordinator\u201d, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html\">Jared Kushner</a>, the president\u2019s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point of responsibility,\u201d the former senior official told the Guardian. \u201cIt keeps shifting. Nobody owns the problem.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Trump: everything\u2019s going to be great</h2> \n<p>Amid the confusion, day-to-day management of the crisis has frequently come directly from Trump himself via his Twitter feed. The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis.</p> \n<p>On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On 24 February, Trump claimed \u201cthe coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d. The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/cdc-expects-community-spread-of-coronavirus-as-top-official-warns-disruptions-could-be-severe/\">telling the truth</a>, warning the American people that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">reportedly</a> so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier\u2019s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar.</p> \n<p>\u201cMessonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,\u201d Konyndyk told the Guardian. And for that, Trump angrily rebuked her department. \u201cThat sent a very clear message about what is and isn\u2019t permissible to say.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b1a029b5b3129746e52d3c6295846e913d6c1f4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1a029b5b3129746e52d3c6295846e913d6c1f4e/0_0_4416_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders, some in medical masks, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week.

      "bodyText": "When the definitive history of the coronavirus pandemic is written, the date 20 January 2020 is certain to feature prominently. It was on that day that a 35-year-old man in Washington state, recently returned from visiting family in Wuhan in China, became the first person in the US to be diagnosed with the virus. On the very same day, 5,000 miles away in Asia, the first confirmed case of Covid-19 was reported in South Korea. The confluence was striking, but there the similarities ended. In the two months since that fateful day, the responses to coronavirus displayed by the US and South Korea have been polar opposites. One country acted swiftly and aggressively to detect and isolate the virus, and by doing so has largely contained the crisis. The other country dithered and procrastinated, became mired in chaos and confusion, was distracted by the individual whims of its leader, and is now confronted by a health emergency of daunting proportions. Within a week of its first confirmed case, South Korea\u2019s disease control agency had summoned 20 private companies to the medical equivalent of a war-planning summit and told them to develop a test for the virus at lightning speed. A week after that, the first diagnostic test was approved and went into battle, identifying infected individuals who could then be quarantined to halt the advance of the disease. Some 357,896 tests later, the country has more or less won the coronavirus war. On Friday only 91 new cases were reported in a country of more than 50 million. The US response tells a different story. Two days after the first diagnosis in Washington state, Donald Trump went on air on CNBC and bragged: \u201cWe have it totally under control. It\u2019s one person coming from China. It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d \u2018A fiasco of incredible proportions\u2019 A week after that, the Wall Street Journal published an opinion article by two former top health policy officials within the Trump administration under the headline Act Now to Prevent an American Epidemic. Luciana Borio and Scott Gottlieb laid out a menu of what had to be done instantly to avert a massive health disaster. Top of their to-do list: work with private industry to develop an \u201ceasy-to-use, rapid diagnostic test\u201d \u2013 in other words, just what South Korea was doing. It was not until 29 February, more than a month after the Journal article and almost six weeks after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed in the country that the Trump administration put that advice into practice. Laboratories and hospitals would finally be allowed to conduct their own Covid-19 tests to speed up the process. Those missing four to six weeks are likely to go down in the definitive history as a cautionary tale of the potentially devastating consequences of failed political leadership. Today, 86,012 cases have been confirmed across the US, pushing the nation to the top of the world\u2019s coronavirus league table \u2013 above even China. More than a quarter of those cases are in New York City, now a global center of the coronavirus pandemic, with New Orleans also raising alarm. Nationally, 1,301 people have died. Most worryingly, the curve of cases continues to rise precipitously, with no sign of the plateau that has spared South Korea. \u201cThe US response will be studied for generations as a textbook example of a disastrous, failed effort,\u201d Ron Klain, who spearheaded the fight against Ebola in 2014, told a Georgetown university panel recently. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in Washington has been a fiasco of incredible proportions.\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the US government\u2019s response to international disasters at USAid from 2013 to 2017, frames the past six weeks in strikingly similar terms. He told the Guardian: \u201cWe are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.\u201d In Konyndyk\u2019s analysis, the White House had all the information it needed by the end of January to act decisively. Instead, Trump repeatedly played down the severity of the threat, blaming China for what he called the \u201cChinese virus\u201d and insisting falsely that his partial travel bans on China and Europe were all it would take to contain the crisis. \u2018The CDC was caught flat-footed\u2019 If Trump\u2019s travel ban did nothing else, it staved off to some degree the advent of the virus in the US, buying a little time. Which makes the lack of decisive action all the more curious. \u201cWe didn\u2019t use that time optimally, especially in the case of testing,\u201d said William Schaffner, an infectious diseases specialist at Vanderbilt University medical center. \u201cWe have been playing reluctant catch-up throughout.\u201d As Schaffner sees it, the stuttering provision of mass testing \u201cput us behind the eight-ball\u201d right at the start. \u201cIt did not permit us, and still doesn\u2019t permit us, to define the extent of the virus in this country.\u201d Though the decision to allow private and state labs to provide testing has increased the flow of test kits, the US remains starkly behind South Korea, which has conducted more than five times as many tests per capita. That makes predicting where the next hotspot will pop up after New York and New Orleans almost impossible. In the absence of sufficient test kits, the US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initially kept a tight rein on testing, creating a bottleneck. \u201cI believe the CDC was caught flat-footed,\u201d was how the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, put it on 7 March. \u201cThey\u2019re slowing down the state.\u201d The CDC\u2019s botched rollout of testing was the first indication that the Trump administration was faltering as the health emergency gathered pace. Behind the scenes, deep flaws in the way federal agencies had come to operate under Trump were being exposed. In 2018 the pandemic unit in the national security council \u2013 which was tasked to prepare for health emergencies precisely like the current one \u2013 was disbanded. \u201cEliminating the office has contributed to the federal government\u2019s sluggish domestic response,\u201d Beth Cameron, a former senior director of the office, wrote in the Washington Post. Disbanding the unit exacerbated a trend that was already prevalent after two years of Trump \u2013 an exodus of skilled and experienced officials who knew what they were doing. \u201cThere\u2019s been an erosion of expertise, of competent leadership, at important levels of government,\u201d a former senior government official told the Guardian. \u201cOver time there was a lot of paranoia and people left and they had a hard time attracting good replacements,\u201d the official said. \u201cNobody wanted to work there.\u201d It was hardly a morale-boosting gesture when Trump proposed a 16% cut in CDC funding on 10 February \u2013 11 days after the World Health Organization had declared a public health emergency over Covid-19. Schaffner, who describes himself as the \u201cpresident of the CDC fan club\u201d, said he has been saddened by how sidelined the CDC has become over the past two months. \u201cHere we have the public health issue of our era and one doesn\u2019t hear from the CDC, the premier public health organization in the world,\u201d Schaffner said. Under Trump, anti-science sweeps through DC The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the diagnostic tests and will control any new treatments for coronavirus, has also shown vulnerabilities. The agency recently indicated that it was looking into the possibility of prescribing the malaria drug chloroquine for coronavirus sufferers, even though there is no evidence it would work and some indication it could have serious side-effects. The decision dismayed experts, given that Trump has personally pushed the unproven remedy on a whim. It smacked of the wave of anti-science sentiment sweeping federal agencies under this presidency. As the former senior official put it: \u201cWe have the FDA bowing to political pressure and making decisions completely counter to modern science.\u201d Highly respected career civil servants, with impeccable scientific credentials, have struggled to get out in front of the president. Dr Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert who has become a rare trusted face in the administration amid the coronavirus scourge, has expressed his frustration. This week Fauci was asked by a Science magazine writer, Jon Cohen, how he could stand beside Trump at daily press briefings and listen to him misleading the American people with comments such as that the China travel ban had been a great success in blocking entry of the virus. Fauci replied: \u201cI know, but what do you want me to do? I mean, seriously Jon, let\u2019s get real, what do you want me to do?\u201d Trump has designated himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d. But if the title bears any validity, his military tactics have been highly unconventional. He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force. The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly appointed Deborah Birx \u201ccoronavirus response coordinator\u201d, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots. \u201cThere\u2019s no point of responsibility,\u201d the former senior official told the Guardian. \u201cIt keeps shifting. Nobody owns the problem.\u201d Trump: everything\u2019s going to be great Amid the confusion, day-to-day management of the crisis has frequently come directly from Trump himself via his Twitter feed. The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis. On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d On 24 February, Trump claimed \u201cthe coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d. The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of telling the truth, warning the American people that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d. Trump was reportedly so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier\u2019s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar. \u201cMessonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,\u201d Konyndyk told the Guardian. And for that, Trump angrily rebuked her department. \u201cThat sent a very clear message about what is and isn\u2019t permissible to say.\u201d Konyndyk recalls attending a meeting in mid-February with top Trump administration officials present in which the only topic of conversation was the travel bans. That\u2019s when he began to despair about the federal handling of the crisis. \u201cI thought, \u2018Holy Jesus!\u2019 Where\u2019s the discussion on protecting our hospitals? Where\u2019s the discussion on high-risk populations, on surveillance so we can detect where the virus is. I knew then that the president had set the priority, the bureaucracy was following it, but it was the wrong priority.\u201d So it has transpired. In the wake of the testing disaster has come the personal protective equipment (PPE) disaster, the hospital bed disaster, and now the ventilator disaster. Ventilators, literal life preservers, are in dire short supply across the country. When governors begged Trump to unleash the full might of the US government on this critical problem, he gave his answer on 16 March. In a phrase that will stand beside 20 January 2020 as one of the most revelatory moments of the history of coronavirus, he said: \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves.\u201d To date, the Trump administration has supplied 400 ventilators to New York. By Cuomo\u2019s estimation, 30,000 are needed. \u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\u201d Cuomo scathingly asked on Tuesday. He added: \u201cYou pick the 26,000 who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\u201d \u2018A total vacuum of federal leadership\u2019 In the absence of a strong federal response, a patchwork of efforts has sprouted all across the country. State governors are doing their own thing. Cities, even individual hospitals, are coping as best they can. In an improvised attempt to address such inconsistencies, charitable startups have proliferated on social media. Konyndyk has clubbed together with fellow disaster relief experts to set up Covid Local, an online \u201cquick and dirty\u201d guide to how to fight a pandemic. \u201cWe are seeing the emergence of 50-state anarchy, because of a total vacuum of federal leadership. It\u2019s absurd that thinktanks and Twitter are providing more actionable guidance in the US than the federal government, but that\u2019s where we are.\u201d Valerie Griffeth is a founding member of another of the new online startups that are trying to fill the Trump void. Set up by emergency department doctors across the country, GetUsPPE.org seeks to counter the top-down chaos that is putting frontline health workers like herself in danger through a dearth of protective gear.

My two crewmates and I will spend six months on the ISS, coming home around October.</p> <p>We are all trying to navigate the uncertainty. The quarantine has been largely the same as usual: as a crew, we still keep our distance, and I am relatively isolated in my living quarters. The difference now is that other people are doing the same.</p> <p>To my knowledge, there has never been any sickness on the space station. It would be unprecedented to have a virus like this on board. We have lots of medicine, but there is no vaccine. It would be something significant to deal with.</p> <p>The biggest change for me is that my friends and family won\u2019t be at the launch. Nor the US support team and operational group. It will be kind of quiet.</p> <p>The other difference will be when I call my wife and family from the space station. We\u2019ll be talking a lot about how things have changed since I left: can you move around, are your plans cancelled? I think I\u2019ll be asking more questions about their lives than they are asking about mine in space. <br><strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The psychoanalytic psychotherapist</strong></h2> <p><strong>Therapy can go deeper on the phone</strong></p> <p>I am self-isolating because of my age \u2013 I\u2019m over 70 \u2013 and last week began to offer patients telephone or Skype sessions, with email access in between. This way of working is a huge change from being face-to-face or on the couch in a consulting room \u2013 a lot of visual and bodily communication is lost. Normally, as soon as I open the door, I get a sense of how the patient is feeling that day. Over the phone it\u2019s more difficult, but I can hear something in the tone of voice. Not all the indicators are lost. Silences carry a different weight and patients are saying more than they might if we were actually in the room \u2013 I suspect I am, too.</p> <p>New themes are emerging around the possibility of loss, particularly not being able to see family for some time, and there\u2019s a huge sense of anxiety, which most of the population is probably feeling. People are having to think very carefully about their own autonomy: who am I? What do I do here? Who will be there for me? Who can I be there for? Of course, the conflicts patients brought to therapy beforehand will remain or intensify with isolation or illness. There will also be some creativity and resourcefulness emerging.</p> <p>I am more acutely aware of the discrepancy between those who can and can\u2019t afford therapy. For those whose financial circumstances are hugely impacted, I have substantially reduced my fees \u2013 I don\u2019t want anybody to stop having therapy because they can\u2019t afford it. What I\u2019d suggest to people who can\u2019t, particularly those feeling very anxious, is to set up phone calls with one or two trusted people to share feelings and listen. <strong>S</strong><strong>de</strong><strong>R</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Igor Bastidas</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dabe49f87b647c488f1e47490f9109424e939f53/0_82_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator Igor Bastidas\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A Venezuelan artist living in New York, whose illustration appears at the top of this piece, Bastidas says: \u2018In the midst of this collapse, New Yorkers and the rest of the world are looking out for each other. Maybe when this is over, we will have a whole new perspective on the things we have in common.\u2019</p> <h2><strong>The drug dealer</strong></h2> <p><strong>Some people are panic-buying cocaine</strong></p> <p>I sell cannabis and cocaine to suppliers in the north of England. I have around 20 guys on the street, with approximately 200 regular customers. We have two main concerns now: sourcing drugs and getting enough money. We expect no more cocaine shipments from abroad for the next six weeks, so prices have shot up. I\u2019m maintaining the same prices I\u2019ve always charged but I\u2019m concerned that, when stock begins to run low, people higher up the chain will charge more or cut the cocaine and decrease its quality. People are panicking \u2013 the amounts of cannabis they\u2019re buying is ridiculous \u2013 so we are just dealing to regulars now. I\u2019ve told my workers to be strict with what they sell and who to, but they aren\u2019t changing their behaviour much, other than offering to post through letterboxes and accept bank transfers from trusted customers. People running out of money is a big concern, but we\u2019ll always have the regular cokeheads who buy most days. </p> <p>I\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years and don\u2019t have any dependants \u2013 other than sometimes helping my parents out with bits of cash \u2013 so I\u2019m not financially worried. My biggest concern is handling money. I\u2019ve been wearing gloves. <strong>D</strong><strong>H</strong></p> <h2><strong>The City trader</strong></h2> <p><strong>You can\u2019t trade millions while your child is screaming for hot milk</strong></p> <p>A trader\u2019s life is stressful enough: your work is high frequency, intense and filled with risk. No one wants to screw up and lose a bunch of money for their firm. </p> <p>We\u2019ve been tracking coronavirus for months, but no one thought it would get as bad as in China. So when we heard we\u2019d either have to relocate to a disaster recovery site, away from our offices, or set up a trading desk at home, we were shocked.</p> <p>The idea of a disaster recovery site came about after 9/11. The idea was that major investment banks needed to have a building away from their offices so they could keep functioning in an emergency. Goldman Sachs has offices in Croydon; Barclays is in Northolt; JP Morgan in Basingstoke. But they were created as a solution to a terrorist attack, not to a pandemic. In a London lockdown, some traders will struggle to make it to these sites.</p> <p>Working from home brings a lot of problems. Traders tend not to have four screens on their kitchen table, nor recorded lines to make sure we don\u2019t break compliance procedures. Plus I have kids. You can\u2019t expect to trade millions with a child next door screaming for hot milk. Much of trading involves making fast decisions. We\u2019re struggling through what will probably be the toughest time in our career, and we\u2019re worried about patchy wifi and that our kids will be slowing down the connection by watching a streaming service.</p> <p>Everyone\u2019s trying to keep their spirits up, with funny photos of people\u2019s home setup \u2013 I saw a Persian cat sitting in front of someone\u2019s screens, looking like a trader. But this disruption will affect our ability to get the economy back on its feet, at what may be a defining moment in our lives. </p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Yang Sio Maan</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6863fb9768d6af1e3be688d7362654553f2a6057/0_599_2917_2834/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people wearing face masks exercising in a park, with tower blocks behind and cars on the road\" width=\"1000\" height=\"972\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5a0cb6ae260cfbd7755d3f7e045a28d8a0ea43d/41_42_452_496/452.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of illustrator Yang Sio Maan\" width=\"452\" height=\"496\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Yang, who is based in Macau, southern China, says, \u2018This is the most densely populated region in the world. Since the outbreak in late January, most people have been working from home. But while the streets and malls are a ghost town, Coloane island has never been so crowded. This is the lung of the city, covered in hiking trails, and at the weekend, the traffic gets backed up. People exercise wearing surgical masks: jogging, hiking, yoga, or simply absorbing some vitamin D after another week in quarantine.\u2019</p> <h2><strong>On not touching Dad, by Tom Lamont</strong></h2> <p><strong>Hugging was really great</strong></p> <p>A couple of weekends ago, for the first time since the 90s, when I was a shoegaze-addled teen who thought misanthropy was quite sophisticated, I waved hello to my dad. He is 75 now. Never one to take more than his share of anything in the past, he\u2019s recently started stockpiling underlying health conditions, and this puts him among the 30 million vulnerable and/or elderly people in the UK who\u2019ll be getting some coronavirus clearing room for the foreseeable future, whether any of us like it or not. I warned him on the way in: \u201cI\u2019m only going to wave, Pa! From the other side of the room!\u201d Overdoing it, making light of it, first with the chorus dancer\u2019s jazz hands, then with the big, all-arm, side-to-side motion, as if I was a gameshow contestant encouraged to say hi to a parent watching at home.</p> <p>It felt about as silly and contrived as a gameshow, greeting him this way. Not hugging your dad? We chuckled it off at the time. We settled, on different sofas, into our usual routine of company and snacks. I felt weirdly agitated, as if I\u2019d left something unfinished \u2013 like when you keep one hand out of bath water, to hold a magazine or a phone, and the rest of your body seems to nag at you: \u201cSubmerge the other hand, Tom. Submerge the bloody hand!\u201d</p> <p>I come from a family that, for the most part, could be defined as Way-Tactile Jew. We kiss each other. We hug. We really get in there. I am not by nature overfamiliar, but this tactility when saying hello is hardwired in me. It has led to more than my share of greetings errors with men who vaguely resemble my father or grandfather, yet who don\u2019t, weirdly, relish the full bear hug on a first encounter.</p> <p>Maybe for this reason I\u2019ve always been interested in how, physically, we say hello. A couple of years ago, I wrote a story for this magazine on the subject, interviewing dozens of people about their own habits. There was a lot of contradiction, between generations and genders and cultures. Hand slaps. Fist bumps. \u201cA curt nod and a please-move-on-now look.\u201d The one- or two-arm hug. Chaos, someone called it. An 80-year-old told me she was tired of it all. Why couldn\u2019t we just choose a few blanket rules and stick to them?</p> <p>Coronavirus has given us those rules. Strangers get a wide berth \u2013 the government-mandated two metres \u2013 so that now we slalom the pavements to get to the supermarket, avoiding accidental incursions by anyone travelling the other way. </p> <p>Among friends and relatives, the transition has been the hardest. For a while (until about 10 days ago, at the time of writing), the hugging and kissing carried on with a kind of fuck-you heedlessness. No global pandemic was about to stop us grabbing a bezzie around the shoulder, or giving Mum a peck on either cheek. Then, with a creeping sense of the seriousness of things (seven days ago? six?), there was a period of honest forgetfulness. People would smash a wet one on you and then touch their foreheads, remembering. Horribly quickly it became unthinkable. Kissing would be like punching somebody in the mouth. No more arm-squeezes, no wrist-grabs. So there I was, in my parents\u2019 living room, with my back against the wall, waving. \u201cHOW ARE YOU OVER THERE?\u201d</p> <p>By the end of the visit, I had realised how much we used to communicate around the edges of our talk. You can tease \u2013 but without the fond finger-jab on the shoulder, teasing registers as mean. You can suggest a hot drink \u2013 but without the palm on the thigh, to mean, \u201cI know you like one around now\u201d, this may as well be the offer of a well-intentioned stranger. There was that sense of something half-done, and when it was time to say goodbye, this feeling clarified into a more fundamental one of abandonment. My dad knew why I was waving at him as if he were a distant parade float. I knew why. This didn\u2019t change the fact that a wave was inadequate.</p> <p>I worry that when this is over, we\u2019ll all have been reprogrammed not to touch, to fear proximity. I worry that the self-conscious elbow bump will become the standard, and that entering a stranger\u2019s two-metre exclusion zone will for ever be considered uncool. I worry that we\u2019ll never rid ourselves of the sense, bedding deeper as I write, that to do the most natural thing in the world and embrace someone elderly and ailing and who we love might only be to hurry them on their way. </p> <h2><strong>The Guardian magazine model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Winston will miss being in the Guardian\u2019s All Ages fashion shoots</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46422517478f189ebfc4c812ab2edeb9bb58ee68/615_188_1224_3016/406.jpg\" alt=\"All Ages model Winston\" width=\"406\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018All Ages is like a family. \u2018</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Newby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I started modelling when I was 73. I\u2019m 83 now, though people tell me I look 56. I was introduced to modelling by chance, by my neighbour Lydia, and I\u2019ve been lucky. Coxy, my agent, says: \u2018\u2018There is something in your face that people like.\u201d I\u2019ve been a regular in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/series/fashion-for-all-ages+mens-fashion\">All Ages</a> for four years, and I\u2019ve worked all over the world.</p> <p>I\u2019ve had five shoots cancelled so far. All Ages is suspended after this week because we need to self-isolate; work trips to Romania, Sweden and Nigeria have been called off. I was supposed to play a dead body in a film shoot in Germany; that\u2019s off. I\u2019m lucky that, as a retired engineer, modelling isn\u2019t my only source of income. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I don\u2019t have too many worries. The one thing I will miss is the company of the Guardian team: All Ages is like a family. </p> <p>A friend told me I am supposed to stay indoors now, but I do go out, just to shop. I live alone and my daughter comes at weekends to check that Daddy is OK. I\u2019m very cautious. I wash my hands and use Dettol. If I saw a person coughing on the bus, I would stay far away.</p> <p>Touch wood, I\u2019ve always been lucky health-wise. I eat a strict diet; I like green tea, cabbage, chicken, wild salmon. I\u2019ve been weightlifting since I was 15. In 1997 we extended our garage and put barbells in there, so I can exercise at home.</p> <p>I saw people fighting over toilet paper on the news. To me that is selfishness, though I\u2019m lucky again there: in the 80s, I bought a dozen packets of toilet paper in a cash and carry, and I\u2019m still getting through them now. <strong>H</strong><strong>M</strong></p> <h2><strong>The life-drawing model</strong></h2> <p><strong>Getting naked in a stranger\u2019s living room can be cosy</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m an actor, but like most I am often between roles. I started life modelling as a way to earn extra money and it\u2019s been a good source of income. When coronavirus started limiting public gatherings, I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t be able to model any more, just as theatres were closing and acting work was drying up. But one of the drawing clubs I model for, <a href=\"http://atyn.co.uk/\" title=\"\">All The Young Nudes</a>, has begun running a livestreamed class and they asked me to model for the first one.</p> <p>We did it at an organiser\u2019s home. Sometimes these sessions are cold and uncomfortable \u2013 you have to sit on a plastic chair \u2013 so it was nice being in a warm room with a fire and a couch. There was a camera operator there to set up the technical side. Around 100 artists then paid \u00a34 (a normal session is \u00a36) to get a link to the private stream, for two hours.</p> <p>It might seem strange to watch a livestream when you could just draw from a picture, but all the artists I\u2019ve spoken to say that, psychologically, it\u2019s a very different practice: you\u2019re responding to something in the moment (often poses are held for only five minutes) and you\u2019re time-limited. It makes people draw differently, and it still felt like a drawing club because there was an online chat with some discussion of the works, which people posted on social media afterwards.</p> <p>For me, the only thing the technology changed was that there was a lag on the camera. So sometimes when I changed pose I\u2019d glance at the monitor and see how I\u2019d looked. It made me remember: life drawing poses are not meant to be flattering. And at moments it felt strange, in the way that being alone and naked in someone else\u2019s living room would.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware livestreaming is more open to abuse than live sessions: someone could be screenshotting me, or they might be at home wanking. It\u2019s important I am not recognised as a model in other areas of my life, and there\u2019s a greater risk of that happening online. I\u2019m placing a lot of trust in the artists. <strong>Sam Wolfson</strong></p> <h2><strong>The IndyCar racer</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.indycar.com/Series/IndyCar-Series/Felix-Rosenqvist\" title=\"\">Felix Rosenqvist</a> finds a virtual car race is sweatier than a real one</strong></p> <p>I was in Florida for the start of the IndyCar Series when they cancelled the whole thing. Two days later, back home in Indianapolis, I put on shorts and socks \u2013 no shoes \u2013 and got into my racing simulator in my little man cave. Most pros now practise in simulators before each race weekend. It\u2019s a whole business: companies scan tracks and sell them to teams who integrate them into their simulators. I got mine so I could mess around in winter; it\u2019s got a racing seat and pedals, and a 49in screen.</p> <p>A lot of pros are on<a href=\"https://www.iracing.com/\" title=\"\"> iRacing</a>, an online simulation game where you get matched against people with the same rating. I use it a bit, and sometimes I\u2019ll get tagged in an Instagram post: \u201cOh, Felix Rosenqvist just drove into me!\u201d It\u2019s a pretty cool way for fans to engage with racers, though the best gamers always beat us. It kind of lowers your self-confidence, but it\u2019s different because they don\u2019t need to be brave.</p> <p>After the Formula One season also got suspended because of the pandemic, a company called <a href=\"https://torqueesport.com/\" title=\"\">Torque Esports</a> organised an all-star e-racing battle. They invited pro gamers as well as pro racing drivers from IndyCar and F1 to compete, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/max-verstappen\" title=\"\">Max Verstappen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/piquetjr/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Nelson Piquet Jr</a>.</p> <p>About 70,000 viewers watched the battle stream live. I got to the final and started 12th but finished 7th and was the best driver. It\u2019s weird: I sweated more in that race than I do on the track, because I was concentrating and squeezing the wheel so hard. I was done for the day. Real driving will always be my priority, but this is something new, and these strange times will put it on the radar. <strong>S</strong><strong>U</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Rebecca Hendin</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cc5fce201e0282307fd77a0b2b26fd1aafb555/0_0_2627_1693/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of woman in blue-tinted room sitting looking out of window with pink flowers and leaves outside it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"644\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51816c3829e5ae9612a3cdc4f4ad6a252afc813/0_0_548_548/500.jpg\" alt=\"Headshot of illustrator Rebecca Hendin\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The London-based American illustrator and animator, who won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/guardians-rebecca-hendin-wins-award-for-boris-johnson-cartoon\">2019\u2019s political cartoon of the year</a> award, says, \u2018I wanted to focus on the dichotomy of the horrific news, and the world outside.

But it\u2019s also up to me to decide what we do when something serious happens outside the Big Brother house. The 14 contestants for the current series went into the house on 10 February, when there were only 14 confirmed infections in Germany.</p> <p>As a general rule, the contestants are not meant to know what is going on in the outside world. But when the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe began to increase dramatically, we knew we needed to tell them. Cancelling the show wasn\u2019t an option, but if one of the people had told us they wanted to be with their family, we would have let them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just television.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t want there to be a great drama; just to give the contestants a sober account of what was happening outside. That\u2019s why we sat the Big Brother doctor, who assessed the contestants, next to the host, behind a glass wall. The German Big Brother container is located near Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state that has seen the highest number of infections and deaths.</p> <p>There were a lot of shocked faces, and some tears. But 23 hours later, life in the Big Brother house had pretty much resumed as normal.</p> <p>After the contestants were given an update, there were individual messages from parents, siblings and friends. Luckily, they are all fine. The sister of one of the contestants is in quarantine, but only as a precautionary measure. A lot of relatives begged the contestants to stay in the house. It\u2019s the safest place in Germany right now: you are effectively already under quarantine.</p> <p>It\u2019s also the only place in Germany that doesn\u2019t need to apply any social distancing measures, or handwashing routines, because we know all the contestants are healthy. The celebrities who were introduced to the house later on were all tested beforehand. If Angela Merkel had wanted to give her corona address to the nation from inside the Big Brother house, we would have let her in.</p> <p>What would we do if the next contestant to be voted out asked to stay? If they\u2019re voted out, they have to leave the house. Those are the rules. <strong>P</strong><strong>O</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Jesuit sister</strong></h2> <p><strong>A simpler life might lead more people to </strong><strong>God, hopes Jane Livesey</strong></p> <p>Normally I live a peripatetic life. A significant part of my work, as general superior of the <a href=\"https://www.congregationofjesus.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Congregation of Jesus</a>, is visiting communities all over the world \u2013 we have about 1,500 sisters in 20 countries \u2013 to support and encourage them. But now we\u2019re all in lockdown \u2013 I\u2019ve been out once in 12 days \u2013 and I can see cabin fever is not unlikely. We\u2019re a small community in Rome, aged mainly from our mid-50s to mid-70s, and like everyone else we don\u2019t go out. People are only allowed to the supermarket and pharmacy. Fortunately, we have space and gardens, unlike most Romans. We\u2019re trying to keep in touch with our communities in the wider world. At least we\u2019re blessed to be enduring this crisis in a time of technology and social media. We\u2019re completely wired up here.</p> <p>Normally we have Mass daily; not now, but we\u2019re praying more. Faith is important to people in times such as this. For all of us, the crisis is triggering questions about what is important. Having a pope like Francis is wonderful; he sent out a beautiful message: \u201cTonight before falling asleep, think about when we will return to the street, hug again\u2026 We will go back to laughing together. Strength and courage. See you soon!\u201d</p> <p>It will be interesting to see what happens in the longer term \u2013 whether some people turn to faith. Faith is about finding meaning, and everyone is now trying to do that. People are living a stripped-back life and that means they\u2019ve been given time for reflection. This crisis has shown us that vulnerability has something to teach us; suddenly, we\u2019re all vulnerable.</p> <p>The temptation is to retreat, to look inwards. But once this is over, do we stay behind borders or will we have learned things? We might have opened our hearts in ways we hadn\u2019t thought about before. <strong>HS</strong></p> <h2><strong>The round-the-world sailor</strong></h2> <p><strong>You\u2019re safe in the middle of the ocean, says Afshin Ahmadian</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t have any sailing background; I was working in finance in London when I saw an ad on the underground for the <a href=\"https://www.clipperroundtheworld.com/\" title=\"\">Clipper Round The World Race</a>. It started in September from St Katharine Docks in east London, with a crew of all nationalities: Chinese, French, Iranian, British, Australian, Swedish and Italian. We went to Portugal, Uruguay, South Africa, across the Southern Ocean to Australia; then we were supposed to go to Sanya in south-west China.</p> <p>When we set off, there was no sign of coronavirus; we were just happy to be going to sea. Everything was new and interesting \u2013 the watch system, the storms, the sunrises and sunsets.</p> <p>Then the skipper got an email saying the destination would be changing because of an outbreak. That was in February; we thought it was just an isolated incident. On the boat you are quite shut off, just focusing on the race and how to keep yourself fit, fed and hydrated.</p> <p>When we arrived in the Philippines, I realised the situation in Iran had become severe \u2013 for a time, it had the highest number of cases after China, before the Italian situation worsened. My family is in Iran and my girlfriend is Italian; they are OK, but all the countries close to my heart were badly affected.</p> <p>We were in no danger on the boat: we were in the middle of the ocean and hadn\u2019t been in any contaminated regions. But when we came back to the Philippines, around 14 March, the whole event was postponed. We had five more months to go.</p> <p>I have a flight booked to Italy, and will move into my girlfriend\u2019s place. We are all hoping that in 10 months\u2019 time we can continue the race. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The prison inmate</strong></h2> <p><strong>A hotel-size bar of soap, says Joe Vanderford, doesn\u2019t last a week in jail</strong></p> <p>I\u2019ve been in US prisons across three states for 33 years. Never in my life did I think I would envy an Iranian prisoner [85,000 were temporarily released this month]. I\u2019m in the Shakopee women\u2019s correctional facility in Minnesota. There have been no commutations or early releases in this state so far. Cases of Covid-19 on the outside are rising: 89 at the time of writing. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in our facility yet.</p> <p>There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to how this virus is being managed inside these walls. One officer travelled to Europe and returned to work. Another went to a nearby state, and hasn\u2019t been allowed back in. One guard says this is all an overreaction, a conspiracy against Trump, and refuses to clean anything. Another is constantly wiping her shoes with hospital-grade disinfectant. When I went for my arthritis checkup, they\u2019d taken most of the chairs out of the waiting room, an attempt to force social distancing. But the trash was overflowing, a rubber glove lying on the filthy floor.</p> <p>Meanwhile, people are being transferred in from county jails every day, and service providers are coming in from other states. Yesterday, an eye doctor who services a bunch of prisons in the area treated several women here. In the middle of appointments, he was stopped: the Wisconsin system, where he had just seen patients, has people quarantined. He said he had no symptoms, but the women who were treated are furious.</p> <p>If someone here gets diagnosed with Covid-19, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll go. We have an isolation room intended for a single person. They\u2019ve already taken two people up there, with more to follow. One of them had already been quarantined for days in her cell with two roommates who remain in the general population. They\u2019re serving the sick people food on paper plates. In another unit, someone has fallen ill; she was using the open restrooms, which means people go to the bathroom while you brush your teeth. They\u2019re testing them all for the virus. No results yet.</p> <p>I\u2019m on a biohazard task crew. We have special gear, but we\u2019re short on supplies. They\u2019re rationing toilet paper and giving us each a hotel-sized bar of soap, which won\u2019t last a week with handwashing alone. There\u2019s no hand sanitiser, except in the kitchen. I see on the news the public is hoarding, panicked. As incarcerated people, we\u2019re the bottom of the barrel. Times will just get tougher for us.</p> <p>Most of my friends are older: women in wheelchairs, women with respiratory conditions, women who spray the door handles without being asked. We\u2019re a village, trying to protect each other. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if, we will be exposed. I\u2019m 52. I wasn\u2019t sentenced to death. But it\u2019s a crapshoot from here on out. <strong>Jvd</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <h2><strong>The musician</strong></h2> <p><strong>We\u2019ll be desperate to dance when this is over, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/frank-turner\" title=\"\">Frank Turner</a></strong></p> <p>My last three shows \u2013 in Bath, Aylesbury, Southend \u2013 were three of the weirdest days of my life. My tour started on 3 March and the first week was fine. You don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real at first, then the bad news starts piling up and what you can\u2019t contemplate becomes reality at remarkable speed. Every day was a rollercoaster. I\u2019d wake up thinking we should cancel everything, then I\u2019d do a show and think, actually, this is what people want. There was a redemptive feeling in the room.</p> <p>Usually, my line of work survives catastrophic events because people want to gather and lose themselves in art, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re supposed to be doing right now. Looking out at a room full of people who were standing close to each other was troubling on a moral level. You ask yourself: am I part of the problem? I mentioned coronavirus halfway through the show in Bath and people got nervous. I realised I wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring them about their decision to come.</p> <p>Over that weekend, the national mood shifted. I started copping a lot of flak on social media from people who were very angry the shows were going ahead. By the time we got to Southend, we still had 800 people but the mood was really odd. It felt like last orders. Before I went on, I was 95% sure this was the last one; when I came off stage, I told my tour manager, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done now.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of doing a live stream seemed obvious. I set up a fundraiser for my touring crew, because if they don\u2019t work they don\u2019t get paid. As we speak it\u2019s raised \u00a343,000, which is incredible, but it\u2019s a one-off for a specific cause. I\u2019m not sure I could make my living this way. I think when shows become viable again, there may well be a golden period because people will be extremely relieved to be out of the house. The problem is nobody knows how far off that is. My worry is how much of the live infrastructure is still going to be there. All my friends who run independent venues are staring into the abyss right now. It\u2019s catastrophic. <strong>D</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <p><strong>The illustrator\u2019s take: Andrea Ucini</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"03e010bba98ce0561562a309281772910da159a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03e010bba98ce0561562a309281772910da159a8/0_451_2734_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration of people under umbrellas sitting at opposite ends of zebra crossing in the rain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a9ebad416b90cc4cfafc2d4117f57be061a269c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9ebad416b90cc4cfafc2d4117f57be061a269c4/0_339_342_342/342.jpg\" alt=\"Illustrator Andrea Ucini\" width=\"342\" height=\"342\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Originally from Italy and now living in Denmark, Ucini illustrated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/elena-ferrantes-weekend-column\">Elena Ferrante\u2019s weekly Guardian Weekend column</a> in 2018.

They are patiently waiting, and staying close to each other, even from a distance.\u2019</p> <h2><strong>The store assistant</strong></h2> <p><strong>Supermarket workers are now the fifth emergency service</strong></p> <p>People started stockpiling at the beginning of March. The next week we limited everything. But even then, loo roll, kitchen roll, wipes, baby milk and nappies are going in a flash. As soon as we bring a pallet out, it\u2019s gone before we can get it on the shelves. There\u2019s one lonely tin of oxtail soup where there used to be a whole section of tinned tomatoes and kidney beans. Our supply chain is good but they can\u2019t get it to us fast enough.</p> <p>Of course, if you see an empty shelf, you panic. It\u2019s human nature. This morning there were 150 people snaking around the car park half an hour before we opened. We\u2019re selling more than Christmas Eve every day, seven days a week.</p> <p>You\u2019re seeing everyday dramas unfold. One minute, there\u2019s someone with the last four packs of pasta and they\u2019re giving two to an older person; the next you\u2019re seeing an 18-year-old mum in floods of tears because there\u2019s no baby milk and she\u2019s got newborn twins. I would say that 90% of people are fine, but I\u2019ve had girls I work with called the worst names you can imagine just for saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, you can\u2019t have that whole trolley-full of loo roll.\u201d There\u2019s been an unspoken divide in this country between people who are mindful of how their actions might affect people who are less comfortable than them, and the small minority who don\u2019t care about anybody else. We\u2019ve got zero tolerance for them.</p> <p>Morale is really good. The company\u2019s been brilliant. What was a mundane job has turned into a really important social responsibility. We feel like the fifth emergency service. You know those magnetic sirens <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/mar/26/kojak-your-next-box-set\" title=\"\">Kojak</a> used to put on his car? I want one of those for when I\u2019m driving to work. We\u2019re all exhausted, but I\u2019ll do what I can until I drop. <strong>D</strong><strong>L</strong></p> <h2><strong>The Antarctic researcher</strong></h2> <p><strong>At the bottom of the world, says <a href=\"https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/mrian\" title=\"\">Mike Brian</a>, there\u2019s always telemedicine</strong></p> <p>There are 124 people on the Rothera Research Station today and I am responsible for their health, safety and welfare. My first action was to make sure we were not bringing in any unessential staff. We also started screening staff before they depart for Antarctica. We are a small community and live in relatively close proximity. But there\u2019s always a doctor here, even in winter when we go down to 20 people; right now we have two.</p> <p>When something like this happens, we feel a long way away but well connected. We have good internet access and great support from our headquarters in Cambridge, England. We also have our own dedicated medical unit, experts in telemedicine who can give a whole station advice.</p> <p>My folks are in Fort William, Scotland, and my father said very cheerfully that it gives him a perfect excuse to spend lots of time in the garden by himself. That and turning down social engagements makes him very happy. <strong>Sam Wollaston</strong></p> <h2><strong>The drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ</strong></h2> <p><strong>Club culture will return with the mother of all parties, says <a href=\"https://andyc.cc/about\">Andy C</a></strong></p> <p>The last shows I played were in Moscow and Prague at the end of February. We landed in Moscow and they wouldn\u2019t let us off the plane. Without explanation, a woman with a mask got on and started going up to every passenger and taking their temperature. Then in the airport a whole planeload of people arriving from the far east of Russia were herded into a corner. There were people in hazmat suits taking temperatures before you got to baggage claim. Then the whole airport was locked down. We thought we were going to be quarantined in Moscow. That was unnerving. The show was actually fantastic \u2013 a beautiful vibe \u2013 but the urge to get home to my family was huge.</p> <p>At that point my diary was still full. The first cancellation was Ultra in Miami. I should have been in Vienna on 14 March but that got cancelled. Would I have gone if it hadn\u2019t been cancelled? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer now. If I don\u2019t turn up, nobody gets paid, but then the moral approach is to make sure everybody\u2019s safe. If we all work together and heed these warnings, then this is going to be over quicker. My kid got sent home with a cough, so we\u2019re indoors for 14 days.</p> <p>On a personal level, the next few months are wiped out but my main concern is covering the people who put the stages together, do the lighting, work behind bars, security\u2026 It\u2019s savage for our industry. Loads of DJs are doing tutoring online, uploading mixes, doing virtual sets. I\u2019m definitely going to be in the studio a lot more. I\u2019m holding on to the hope that the second half of this year is going to be a lot more positive. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene is such a beautiful, communal scene and we will bounce back with the mother of all parties. I was listening to a set earlier and thinking, oh yeah, that\u2019s when we used to go out and rave. <strong>DL</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Nasa astronaut Chris Cassidy, the next spaceman to launch, won\u2019t get a sendoff At Star City, a small community outside Moscow city centre, we are in the final weeks of quarantine, leading up to launch to the International Space Station on 9 April, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. My two crewmates and I will spend six months on the ISS, coming home around October. We are all trying to navigate the uncertainty. The quarantine has been largely the same as usual: as a crew, we still keep our distance, and I am relatively isolated in my living quarters. The difference now is that other people are doing the same. To my knowledge, there has never been any sickness on the space station. It would be unprecedented to have a virus like this on board. We have lots of medicine, but there is no vaccine. It would be something significant to deal with. The biggest change for me is that my friends and family won\u2019t be at the launch. Nor the US support team and operational group. It will be kind of quiet. The other difference will be when I call my wife and family from the space station. We\u2019ll be talking a lot about how things have changed since I left: can you move around, are your plans cancelled? I think I\u2019ll be asking more questions about their lives than they are asking about mine in space. Sam Wollaston The psychoanalytic psychotherapist Therapy can go deeper on the phone I am self-isolating because of my age \u2013 I\u2019m over 70 \u2013 and last week began to offer patients telephone or Skype sessions, with email access in between. This way of working is a huge change from being face-to-face or on the couch in a consulting room \u2013 a lot of visual and bodily communication is lost. Normally, as soon as I open the door, I get a sense of how the patient is feeling that day. Over the phone it\u2019s more difficult, but I can hear something in the tone of voice. Not all the indicators are lost. Silences carry a different weight and patients are saying more than they might if we were actually in the room \u2013 I suspect I am, too. New themes are emerging around the possibility of loss, particularly not being able to see family for some time, and there\u2019s a huge sense of anxiety, which most of the population is probably feeling. People are having to think very carefully about their own autonomy: who am I? What do I do here? Who will be there for me? Who can I be there for? Of course, the conflicts patients brought to therapy beforehand will remain or intensify with isolation or illness. There will also be some creativity and resourcefulness emerging. I am more acutely aware of the discrepancy between those who can and can\u2019t afford therapy. For those whose financial circumstances are hugely impacted, I have substantially reduced my fees \u2013 I don\u2019t want anybody to stop having therapy because they can\u2019t afford it. What I\u2019d suggest to people who can\u2019t, particularly those feeling very anxious, is to set up phone calls with one or two trusted people to share feelings and listen. SdeR The illustrator\u2019s take: Igor Bastidas A Venezuelan artist living in New York, whose illustration appears at the top of this piece, Bastidas says: \u2018In the midst of this collapse, New Yorkers and the rest of the world are looking out for each other. Maybe when this is over, we will have a whole new perspective on the things we have in common.\u2019 The drug dealer Some people are panic-buying cocaine I sell cannabis and cocaine to suppliers in the north of England. I have around 20 guys on the street, with approximately 200 regular customers. We have two main concerns now: sourcing drugs and getting enough money. We expect no more cocaine shipments from abroad for the next six weeks, so prices have shot up. I\u2019m maintaining the same prices I\u2019ve always charged but I\u2019m concerned that, when stock begins to run low, people higher up the chain will charge more or cut the cocaine and decrease its quality. People are panicking \u2013 the amounts of cannabis they\u2019re buying is ridiculous \u2013 so we are just dealing to regulars now. I\u2019ve told my workers to be strict with what they sell and who to, but they aren\u2019t changing their behaviour much, other than offering to post through letterboxes and accept bank transfers from trusted customers. People running out of money is a big concern, but we\u2019ll always have the regular cokeheads who buy most days. I\u2019ve been doing this for 12 years and don\u2019t have any dependants \u2013 other than sometimes helping my parents out with bits of cash \u2013 so I\u2019m not financially worried. My biggest concern is handling money. I\u2019ve been wearing gloves. DH The City trader You can\u2019t trade millions while your child is screaming for hot milk A trader\u2019s life is stressful enough: your work is high frequency, intense and filled with risk. No one wants to screw up and lose a bunch of money for their firm. We\u2019ve been tracking coronavirus for months, but no one thought it would get as bad as in China. So when we heard we\u2019d either have to relocate to a disaster recovery site, away from our offices, or set up a trading desk at home, we were shocked. The idea of a disaster recovery site came about after 9/11. The idea was that major investment banks needed to have a building away from their offices so they could keep functioning in an emergency. Goldman Sachs has offices in Croydon; Barclays is in Northolt; JP Morgan in Basingstoke. But they were created as a solution to a terrorist attack, not to a pandemic. In a London lockdown, some traders will struggle to make it to these sites. Working from home brings a lot of problems. Traders tend not to have four screens on their kitchen table, nor recorded lines to make sure we don\u2019t break compliance procedures. Plus I have kids. You can\u2019t expect to trade millions with a child next door screaming for hot milk. Much of trading involves making fast decisions. We\u2019re struggling through what will probably be the toughest time in our career, and we\u2019re worried about patchy wifi and that our kids will be slowing down the connection by watching a streaming service. Everyone\u2019s trying to keep their spirits up, with funny photos of people\u2019s home setup \u2013 I saw a Persian cat sitting in front of someone\u2019s screens, looking like a trader. But this disruption will affect our ability to get the economy back on its feet, at what may be a defining moment in our lives. The illustrator\u2019s take: Yang Sio Maan Yang, who is based in Macau, southern China, says, \u2018This is the most densely populated region in the world. Since the outbreak in late January, most people have been working from home. But while the streets and malls are a ghost town, Coloane island has never been so crowded. This is the lung of the city, covered in hiking trails, and at the weekend, the traffic gets backed up. People exercise wearing surgical masks: jogging, hiking, yoga, or simply absorbing some vitamin D after another week in quarantine.\u2019 On not touching Dad, by Tom Lamont Hugging was really great A couple of weekends ago, for the first time since the 90s, when I was a shoegaze-addled teen who thought misanthropy was quite sophisticated, I waved hello to my dad. He is 75 now. Never one to take more than his share of anything in the past, he\u2019s recently started stockpiling underlying health conditions, and this puts him among the 30 million vulnerable and/or elderly people in the UK who\u2019ll be getting some coronavirus clearing room for the foreseeable future, whether any of us like it or not. I warned him on the way in: \u201cI\u2019m only going to wave, Pa! From the other side of the room!\u201d Overdoing it, making light of it, first with the chorus dancer\u2019s jazz hands, then with the big, all-arm, side-to-side motion, as if I was a gameshow contestant encouraged to say hi to a parent watching at home. It felt about as silly and contrived as a gameshow, greeting him this way. Not hugging your dad? We chuckled it off at the time. We settled, on different sofas, into our usual routine of company and snacks. I felt weirdly agitated, as if I\u2019d left something unfinished \u2013 like when you keep one hand out of bath water, to hold a magazine or a phone, and the rest of your body seems to nag at you: \u201cSubmerge the other hand, Tom. Submerge the bloody hand!\u201d I come from a family that, for the most part, could be defined as Way-Tactile Jew. We kiss each other. We hug. We really get in there. I am not by nature overfamiliar, but this tactility when saying hello is hardwired in me. It has led to more than my share of greetings errors with men who vaguely resemble my father or grandfather, yet who don\u2019t, weirdly, relish the full bear hug on a first encounter. Maybe for this reason I\u2019ve always been interested in how, physically, we say hello. A couple of years ago, I wrote a story for this magazine on the subject, interviewing dozens of people about their own habits. There was a lot of contradiction, between generations and genders and cultures. Hand slaps. Fist bumps. \u201cA curt nod and a please-move-on-now look.\u201d The one- or two-arm hug. Chaos, someone called it. An 80-year-old told me she was tired of it all. Why couldn\u2019t we just choose a few blanket rules and stick to them? Coronavirus has given us those rules. Strangers get a wide berth \u2013 the government-mandated two metres \u2013 so that now we slalom the pavements to get to the supermarket, avoiding accidental incursions by anyone travelling the other way. Among friends and relatives, the transition has been the hardest. For a while (until about 10 days ago, at the time of writing), the hugging and kissing carried on with a kind of fuck-you heedlessness. No global pandemic was about to stop us grabbing a bezzie around the shoulder, or giving Mum a peck on either cheek. Then, with a creeping sense of the seriousness of things (seven days ago? six?), there was a period of honest forgetfulness. People would smash a wet one on you and then touch their foreheads, remembering. Horribly quickly it became unthinkable. Kissing would be like punching somebody in the mouth. No more arm-squeezes, no wrist-grabs. So there I was, in my parents\u2019 living room, with my back against the wall, waving. \u201cHOW ARE YOU OVER THERE?\u201d By the end of the visit, I had realised how much we used to communicate around the edges of our talk. You can tease \u2013 but without the fond finger-jab on the shoulder, teasing registers as mean. You can suggest a hot drink \u2013 but without the palm on the thigh, to mean, \u201cI know you like one around now\u201d, this may as well be the offer of a well-intentioned stranger. There was that sense of something half-done, and when it was time to say goodbye, this feeling clarified into a more fundamental one of abandonment. My dad knew why I was waving at him as if he were a distant parade float. I knew why. This didn\u2019t change the fact that a wave was inadequate. I worry that when this is over, we\u2019ll all have been reprogrammed not to touch, to fear proximity. I worry that the self-conscious elbow bump will become the standard, and that entering a stranger\u2019s two-metre exclusion zone will for ever be considered uncool. I worry that we\u2019ll never rid ourselves of the sense, bedding deeper as I write, that to do the most natural thing in the world and embrace someone elderly and ailing and who we love might only be to hurry them on their way. The Guardian magazine model Winston will miss being in the Guardian\u2019s All Ages fashion shoots I started modelling when I was 73. I\u2019m 83 now, though people tell me I look 56. I was introduced to modelling by chance, by my neighbour Lydia, and I\u2019ve been lucky. Coxy, my agent, says: \u2018\u2018There is something in your face that people like.\u201d I\u2019ve been a regular in All Ages for four years, and I\u2019ve worked all over the world. I\u2019ve had five shoots cancelled so far. All Ages is suspended after this week because we need to self-isolate; work trips to Romania, Sweden and Nigeria have been called off. I was supposed to play a dead body in a film shoot in Germany; that\u2019s off. I\u2019m lucky that, as a retired engineer, modelling isn\u2019t my only source of income. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but I don\u2019t have too many worries. The one thing I will miss is the company of the Guardian team: All Ages is like a family. A friend told me I am supposed to stay indoors now, but I do go out, just to shop. I live alone and my daughter comes at weekends to check that Daddy is OK. I\u2019m very cautious. I wash my hands and use Dettol. If I saw a person coughing on the bus, I would stay far away. Touch wood, I\u2019ve always been lucky health-wise. I eat a strict diet; I like green tea, cabbage, chicken, wild salmon. I\u2019ve been weightlifting since I was 15. In 1997 we extended our garage and put barbells in there, so I can exercise at home. I saw people fighting over toilet paper on the news. To me that is selfishness, though I\u2019m lucky again there: in the 80s, I bought a dozen packets of toilet paper in a cash and carry, and I\u2019m still getting through them now. HM The life-drawing model Getting naked in a stranger\u2019s living room can be cosy I\u2019m an actor, but like most I am often between roles. I started life modelling as a way to earn extra money and it\u2019s been a good source of income. When coronavirus started limiting public gatherings, I was concerned I wouldn\u2019t be able to model any more, just as theatres were closing and acting work was drying up. But one of the drawing clubs I model for, All The Young Nudes, has begun running a livestreamed class and they asked me to model for the first one. We did it at an organiser\u2019s home. Sometimes these sessions are cold and uncomfortable \u2013 you have to sit on a plastic chair \u2013 so it was nice being in a warm room with a fire and a couch. There was a camera operator there to set up the technical side. Around 100 artists then paid \u00a34 (a normal session is \u00a36) to get a link to the private stream, for two hours. It might seem strange to watch a livestream when you could just draw from a picture, but all the artists I\u2019ve spoken to say that, psychologically, it\u2019s a very different practice: you\u2019re responding to something in the moment (often poses are held for only five minutes) and you\u2019re time-limited. It makes people draw differently, and it still felt like a drawing club because there was an online chat with some discussion of the works, which people posted on social media afterwards. For me, the only thing the technology changed was that there was a lag on the camera. So sometimes when I changed pose I\u2019d glance at the monitor and see how I\u2019d looked. It made me remember: life drawing poses are not meant to be flattering. And at moments it felt strange, in the way that being alone and naked in someone else\u2019s living room would. I\u2019m aware livestreaming is more open to abuse than live sessions: someone could be screenshotting me, or they might be at home wanking. It\u2019s important I am not recognised as a model in other areas of my life, and there\u2019s a greater risk of that happening online. I\u2019m placing a lot of trust in the artists. Sam Wolfson The IndyCar racer Felix Rosenqvist finds a virtual car race is sweatier than a real one I was in Florida for the start of the IndyCar Series when they cancelled the whole thing. Two days later, back home in Indianapolis, I put on shorts and socks \u2013 no shoes \u2013 and got into my racing simulator in my little man cave. Most pros now practise in simulators before each race weekend. It\u2019s a whole business: companies scan tracks and sell them to teams who integrate them into their simulators. I got mine so I could mess around in winter; it\u2019s got a racing seat and pedals, and a 49in screen. A lot of pros are on iRacing, an online simulation game where you get matched against people with the same rating. I use it a bit, and sometimes I\u2019ll get tagged in an Instagram post: \u201cOh, Felix Rosenqvist just drove into me!\u201d It\u2019s a pretty cool way for fans to engage with racers, though the best gamers always beat us. It kind of lowers your self-confidence, but it\u2019s different because they don\u2019t need to be brave. After the Formula One season also got suspended because of the pandemic, a company called Torque Esports organised an all-star e-racing battle. They invited pro gamers as well as pro racing drivers from IndyCar and F1 to compete, including Max Verstappen and Nelson Piquet Jr. About 70,000 viewers watched the battle stream live. I got to the final and started 12th but finished 7th and was the best driver. It\u2019s weird: I sweated more in that race than I do on the track, because I was concentrating and squeezing the wheel so hard. I was done for the day. Real driving will always be my priority, but this is something new, and these strange times will put it on the radar. SU The illustrator\u2019s take: Rebecca Hendin The London-based American illustrator and animator, who won 2019\u2019s political cartoon of the year award, says, \u2018I wanted to focus on the dichotomy of the horrific news, and the world outside. I\u2019ve been self-isolating, watching through a window with no small amount of sadness as spring comes, and people continue to live their lives. It feels bittersweet at the best of times and deeply upsetting at the worst.\u2019 The Big Brother producer The Big Brother house, says Rainer Laux, is the safest place in Germany right now I have to consult with the channel, SAT.1, about what each episode of the show looks like: what games the contestants have to play or what challenges they have to solve. But it\u2019s also up to me to decide what we do when something serious happens outside the Big Brother house. The 14 contestants for the current series went into the house on 10 February, when there were only 14 confirmed infections in Germany. As a general rule, the contestants are not meant to know what is going on in the outside world. But when the number of Covid-19 cases in Europe began to increase dramatically, we knew we needed to tell them. Cancelling the show wasn\u2019t an option, but if one of the people had told us they wanted to be with their family, we would have let them. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just television. We didn\u2019t want there to be a great drama; just to give the contestants a sober account of what was happening outside. That\u2019s why we sat the Big Brother doctor, who assessed the contestants, next to the host, behind a glass wall. The German Big Brother container is located near Cologne, in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German state that has seen the highest number of infections and deaths. There were a lot of shocked faces, and some tears. But 23 hours later, life in the Big Brother house had pretty much resumed as normal. After the contestants were given an update, there were individual messages from parents, siblings and friends. Luckily, they are all fine. The sister of one of the contestants is in quarantine, but only as a precautionary measure. A lot of relatives begged the contestants to stay in the house. It\u2019s the safest place in Germany right now: you are effectively already under quarantine. It\u2019s also the only place in Germany that doesn\u2019t need to apply any social distancing measures, or handwashing routines, because we know all the contestants are healthy. The celebrities who were introduced to the house later on were all tested beforehand. If Angela Merkel had wanted to give her corona address to the nation from inside the Big Brother house, we would have let her in. What would we do if the next contestant to be voted out asked to stay? If they\u2019re voted out, they have to leave the house. Those are the rules. PO The Jesuit sister A simpler life might lead more people to God, hopes Jane Livesey Normally I live a peripatetic life. A significant part of my work, as general superior of the Congregation of Jesus, is visiting communities all over the world \u2013 we have about 1,500 sisters in 20 countries \u2013 to support and encourage them. But now we\u2019re all in lockdown \u2013 I\u2019ve been out once in 12 days \u2013 and I can see cabin fever is not unlikely. We\u2019re a small community in Rome, aged mainly from our mid-50s to mid-70s, and like everyone else we don\u2019t go out. People are only allowed to the supermarket and pharmacy. Fortunately, we have space and gardens, unlike most Romans. We\u2019re trying to keep in touch with our communities in the wider world. At least we\u2019re blessed to be enduring this crisis in a time of technology and social media. We\u2019re completely wired up here. Normally we have Mass daily; not now, but we\u2019re praying more. Faith is important to people in times such as this. For all of us, the crisis is triggering questions about what is important. Having a pope like Francis is wonderful; he sent out a beautiful message: \u201cTonight before falling asleep, think about when we will return to the street, hug again\u2026 We will go back to laughing together. Strength and courage. See you soon!\u201d It will be interesting to see what happens in the longer term \u2013 whether some people turn to faith. Faith is about finding meaning, and everyone is now trying to do that. People are living a stripped-back life and that means they\u2019ve been given time for reflection. This crisis has shown us that vulnerability has something to teach us; suddenly, we\u2019re all vulnerable. The temptation is to retreat, to look inwards. But once this is over, do we stay behind borders or will we have learned things? We might have opened our hearts in ways we hadn\u2019t thought about before. HS The round-the-world sailor You\u2019re safe in the middle of the ocean, says Afshin Ahmadian I don\u2019t have any sailing background; I was working in finance in London when I saw an ad on the underground for the Clipper Round The World Race. It started in September from St Katharine Docks in east London, with a crew of all nationalities: Chinese, French, Iranian, British, Australian, Swedish and Italian. We went to Portugal, Uruguay, South Africa, across the Southern Ocean to Australia; then we were supposed to go to Sanya in south-west China. When we set off, there was no sign of coronavirus; we were just happy to be going to sea. Everything was new and interesting \u2013 the watch system, the storms, the sunrises and sunsets. Then the skipper got an email saying the destination would be changing because of an outbreak. That was in February; we thought it was just an isolated incident. On the boat you are quite shut off, just focusing on the race and how to keep yourself fit, fed and hydrated. When we arrived in the Philippines, I realised the situation in Iran had become severe \u2013 for a time, it had the highest number of cases after China, before the Italian situation worsened. My family is in Iran and my girlfriend is Italian; they are OK, but all the countries close to my heart were badly affected. We were in no danger on the boat: we were in the middle of the ocean and hadn\u2019t been in any contaminated regions. But when we came back to the Philippines, around 14 March, the whole event was postponed. We had five more months to go. I have a flight booked to Italy, and will move into my girlfriend\u2019s place. We are all hoping that in 10 months\u2019 time we can continue the race. Sam Wollaston The prison inmate A hotel-size bar of soap, says Joe Vanderford, doesn\u2019t last a week in jail I\u2019ve been in US prisons across three states for 33 years. Never in my life did I think I would envy an Iranian prisoner [85,000 were temporarily released this month]. I\u2019m in the Shakopee women\u2019s correctional facility in Minnesota. There have been no commutations or early releases in this state so far. Cases of Covid-19 on the outside are rising: 89 at the time of writing. We don\u2019t know if it\u2019s in our facility yet. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to how this virus is being managed inside these walls. One officer travelled to Europe and returned to work. Another went to a nearby state, and hasn\u2019t been allowed back in. One guard says this is all an overreaction, a conspiracy against Trump, and refuses to clean anything. Another is constantly wiping her shoes with hospital-grade disinfectant. When I went for my arthritis checkup, they\u2019d taken most of the chairs out of the waiting room, an attempt to force social distancing. But the trash was overflowing, a rubber glove lying on the filthy floor. Meanwhile, people are being transferred in from county jails every day, and service providers are coming in from other states. Yesterday, an eye doctor who services a bunch of prisons in the area treated several women here. In the middle of appointments, he was stopped: the Wisconsin system, where he had just seen patients, has people quarantined. He said he had no symptoms, but the women who were treated are furious. If someone here gets diagnosed with Covid-19, I don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll go. We have an isolation room intended for a single person. They\u2019ve already taken two people up there, with more to follow. One of them had already been quarantined for days in her cell with two roommates who remain in the general population. They\u2019re serving the sick people food on paper plates. In another unit, someone has fallen ill; she was using the open restrooms, which means people go to the bathroom while you brush your teeth. They\u2019re testing them all for the virus. No results yet. I\u2019m on a biohazard task crew. We have special gear, but we\u2019re short on supplies. They\u2019re rationing toilet paper and giving us each a hotel-sized bar of soap, which won\u2019t last a week with handwashing alone. There\u2019s no hand sanitiser, except in the kitchen. I see on the news the public is hoarding, panicked. As incarcerated people, we\u2019re the bottom of the barrel. Times will just get tougher for us. Most of my friends are older: women in wheelchairs, women with respiratory conditions, women who spray the door handles without being asked. We\u2019re a village, trying to protect each other. It\u2019s a matter of when, not if, we will be exposed. I\u2019m 52. I wasn\u2019t sentenced to death. But it\u2019s a crapshoot from here on out. JvdL The musician We\u2019ll be desperate to dance when this is over, says Frank Turner My last three shows \u2013 in Bath, Aylesbury, Southend \u2013 were three of the weirdest days of my life. My tour started on 3 March and the first week was fine. You don\u2019t believe it\u2019s real at first, then the bad news starts piling up and what you can\u2019t contemplate becomes reality at remarkable speed. Every day was a rollercoaster. I\u2019d wake up thinking we should cancel everything, then I\u2019d do a show and think, actually, this is what people want. There was a redemptive feeling in the room. Usually, my line of work survives catastrophic events because people want to gather and lose themselves in art, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re supposed to be doing right now. Looking out at a room full of people who were standing close to each other was troubling on a moral level. You ask yourself: am I part of the problem? I mentioned coronavirus halfway through the show in Bath and people got nervous. I realised I wasn\u2019t exactly reassuring them about their decision to come. Over that weekend, the national mood shifted. I started copping a lot of flak on social media from people who were very angry the shows were going ahead. By the time we got to Southend, we still had 800 people but the mood was really odd. It felt like last orders. Before I went on, I was 95% sure this was the last one; when I came off stage, I told my tour manager, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done now.\u201d The idea of doing a live stream seemed obvious. I set up a fundraiser for my touring crew, because if they don\u2019t work they don\u2019t get paid. As we speak it\u2019s raised \u00a343,000, which is incredible, but it\u2019s a one-off for a specific cause. I\u2019m not sure I could make my living this way. I think when shows become viable again, there may well be a golden period because people will be extremely relieved to be out of the house. The problem is nobody knows how far off that is. My worry is how much of the live infrastructure is still going to be there. All my friends who run independent venues are staring into the abyss right now. It\u2019s catastrophic. DL The illustrator\u2019s take: Andrea Ucini Originally from Italy and now living in Denmark, Ucini illustrated Elena Ferrante\u2019s weekly Guardian Weekend column in 2018. He says: \u2018This is a strange and very difficult period, but I see hopeful and strong people, who don\u2019t give up. They are patiently waiting, and staying close to each other, even from a distance.\u2019 The store assistant Supermarket workers are now the fifth emergency service People started stockpiling at the beginning of March. The next week we limited everything. But even then, loo roll, kitchen roll, wipes, baby milk and nappies are going in a flash. As soon as we bring a pallet out, it\u2019s gone before we can get it on the shelves. There\u2019s one lonely tin of oxtail soup where there used to be a whole section of tinned tomatoes and kidney beans. Our supply chain is good but they can\u2019t get it to us fast enough. Of course, if you see an empty shelf, you panic. It\u2019s human nature. This morning there were 150 people snaking around the car park half an hour before we opened. We\u2019re selling more than Christmas Eve every day, seven days a week. You\u2019re seeing everyday dramas unfold. One minute, there\u2019s someone with the last four packs of pasta and they\u2019re giving two to an older person; the next you\u2019re seeing an 18-year-old mum in floods of tears because there\u2019s no baby milk and she\u2019s got newborn twins. I would say that 90% of people are fine, but I\u2019ve had girls I work with called the worst names you can imagine just for saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, you can\u2019t have that whole trolley-full of loo roll.\u201d There\u2019s been an unspoken divide in this country between people who are mindful of how their actions might affect people who are less comfortable than them, and the small minority who don\u2019t care about anybody else. We\u2019ve got zero tolerance for them. Morale is really good. The company\u2019s been brilliant. What was a mundane job has turned into a really important social responsibility. We feel like the fifth emergency service. You know those magnetic sirens Kojak used to put on his car? I want one of those for when I\u2019m driving to work. We\u2019re all exhausted, but I\u2019ll do what I can until I drop. DL The Antarctic researcher At the bottom of the world, says Mike Brian, there\u2019s always telemedicine There are 124 people on the Rothera Research Station today and I am responsible for their health, safety and welfare. My first action was to make sure we were not bringing in any unessential staff. We also started screening staff before they depart for Antarctica. We are a small community and live in relatively close proximity. But there\u2019s always a doctor here, even in winter when we go down to 20 people; right now we have two. When something like this happens, we feel a long way away but well connected. We have good internet access and great support from our headquarters in Cambridge, England. We also have our own dedicated medical unit, experts in telemedicine who can give a whole station advice. My folks are in Fort William, Scotland, and my father said very cheerfully that it gives him a perfect excuse to spend lots of time in the garden by himself. That and turning down social engagements makes him very happy. Sam Wollaston The drum\u2019n\u2019bass DJ Club culture will return with the mother of all parties, says Andy C The last shows I played were in Moscow and Prague at the end of February. We landed in Moscow and they wouldn\u2019t let us off the plane. Without explanation, a woman with a mask got on and started going up to every passenger and taking their temperature. Then in the airport a whole planeload of people arriving from the far east of Russia were herded into a corner. There were people in hazmat suits taking temperatures before you got to baggage claim. Then the whole airport was locked down. We thought we were going to be quarantined in Moscow. That was unnerving. The show was actually fantastic \u2013 a beautiful vibe \u2013 but the urge to get home to my family was huge. At that point my diary was still full. The first cancellation was Ultra in Miami. I should have been in Vienna on 14 March but that got cancelled. Would I have gone if it hadn\u2019t been cancelled? It\u2019s a difficult question to answer now. If I don\u2019t turn up, nobody gets paid, but then the moral approach is to make sure everybody\u2019s safe. If we all work together and heed these warnings, then this is going to be over quicker. My kid got sent home with a cough, so we\u2019re indoors for 14 days. On a personal level, the next few months are wiped out but my main concern is covering the people who put the stages together, do the lighting, work behind bars, security\u2026 It\u2019s savage for our industry. Loads of DJs are doing tutoring online, uploading mixes, doing virtual sets. I\u2019m definitely going to be in the studio a lot more. I\u2019m holding on to the hope that the second half of this year is going to be a lot more positive. The drum\u2019n\u2019bass scene is such a beautiful, communal scene and we will bounce back with the mother of all parties. I was listening to a set earlier and thinking, oh yeah, that\u2019s when we used to go out and rave. DL",

Here are some of the significant advances this week.</p> <h2><strong>Antibody testing for all is on the horizon</strong></h2> <p>Cheap, reliable antibody tests that reveal whether someone has previously had Covid-19 are viewed as crucial for managing the next phase of the pandemic. Population-level screening can gauge the overall level of immunity and can allow people to incrementally return to work. Various teams around the world are already using lab-based antibody testing, but this is challenging to scale up, partly because the tests need to be performed a few weeks after infection. In parallel, companies have been working on home-testing kits that work something like a pregnancy test. This week, the UK government signalled it thought such tests could be reliable enough, announcing it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-mass-home-testing-to-be-made-available-within-days\">had bought 3.5m testing kits</a>, with a view to making them available first to healthcare workers, and then to the public through high street chemists or Amazon delivery.

On Monday, World Health Organization officials also said they were also looking into the possible link. \u201cWe are reaching out to a number of countries and looking at the cases that have already been reported to see if this is a common feature,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, the head of the WHO\u2019s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the answer to that yet.\u201d</p> <p>The good news is that even if the coronavirus kills off some of your olfactory cells, the nose lining contains stem cells to make replacements. \u201cColleagues in Italy report encouraging rates of recovery, with many patients reporting return of sense of smell within seven to 14 days,\u201d the British association advises. \u201cThis seems to be the experience of patients in the UK.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The virus appears to be very stable</strong></h2> <p>Coronaviruses, in general, don\u2019t tend to mutate rapidly and this week scientists provided further reassurance that this is true for Covid-19.

This suggests that if an effective vaccine is found it should continue to work for some time. However, there is still an open question about how stable the human immune response is to Covid-19, and whether people who are infected once will be protected against reinfection long into the future.</p> <h2><strong>Exit strategy</strong></h2> <p>Hopes that life could get back to normal some time soon were dampened this week with models suggesting that lockdown measures need to remain in place for months to have their intended effect.

China\u2019s decision to maintain its lockdown until early April was estimated to reduce the average number of new infections by the end of 2020 by 24%. The restrictions currently in place in the UK will be reviewed on 13 April.</p> <h2><strong>Men appear to be more susceptible to Covid-19</strong></h2> <p>Evidence is growing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">men are more likely to die from the disease</a> than women. This was first observed in China, where the fatality rate was around 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women and the pattern has been mirrored as successive countries have released data. This week Spain reported that around twice as many men as women had died. The difference was initially put down to high rates of male smoking in China \u2013 about half of men smoke compared with just 2% of women. However, as the same trend has been replicated in countries with more equal proportions of male and female smokers, scientists are starting to consider other possibilities, including that women\u2019s immune systems may be better able to overcome the virus. Serological studies from China, tracking the immune response throughout the course of infection, should soon start to provide some answers about why men appear more vulnerable and whether behaviour, lifestyle factors or biology is the leading factor.</p>",

There have been reports a peak is expected in hospitals on 10 April, but these reports were not true, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong> says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I want to also address the issue of intensive care beds and hospital beds. And this question that keeps coming to us from various places: is Australia ready? Is the healthcare system ready? </p> \n   <p>Well, I can really assure people that the healthcare system in Australia is very adaptable. And it is absolutely ready for this matter. In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. </p> \n   <p>We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular.<br></p> \n   <p>One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow. So these matters are very much in hand and will be developing through the day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T04:26:29.546Z\">at 4.26am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7ecd178f081e5eda238673\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T04:08:37.093Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy medical chief medical officer, <strong>Prof Paul Kelly, said isolation of returned travellers combined with physical distancing, and tracing contacts of known Covid-19 cases, are the key measures being focused on. </strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We really need to get on top of the people who have returned from overseas ... from countries that had a much wider and worse epidemic of Covid-19 than we currently do here in Australia.

I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/24/decades-old-drug-in-two-australian-trials-related-to-covid-19-but-experts-urge-caution\">wrote about those clinical trials here</a> including why a massive degree of caution is needed. Clinical trials are important and should be done, but the way hydroxychloroquine has been reported on has led to massive hype about it as a Covid-19 treatment, prompting shortages worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/australian-doctors-warned-off-after-prescribing-potentially-deadly-covid-19-trial-drug-to-themselves\">including in Australia</a>.</p> \n  <p>There are good reasons media do not normally report on these clinical trials until they are complete and have undergone peer review. Last week the US president, <strong>Donald Trump, </strong>touted hydroxychloroquine as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d. He also said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\u201d And he incorrectly announced the drug\u2019s approval had been fast-tracked.

This morning <strong>the national total is approaching </strong><strong>more than 3,200 cases, and almost half of those are in New South Wales. </strong>Thousands have lost their jobs and we are in more stringent lockdown.</p> \n  <p>A significant amount of spread has come from the Ruby Princess cruise ship \u2013 more than 200 cases are linked to that cruise. Yesterday we learned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/interstate-coronavirus-cases-from-ruby-princess-jump-as-32-queenslanders-test-positive\">32 Queenslanders from the ship tested positive to the disease</a>. Meanwhile 162 people in NSW and at least 49 interstate have been diagnosed with Covid-19 after they left the cruise ship,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/anatomy-of-a-coronavirus-disaster-how-2700-people-were-let-off-the-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-by-mistake\"> which was allowed to dock twice in Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay</a> this month. </p> \n  <p><strong>NSW and Victoria are preparing to announce a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/27/nsw-on-the-brink-of-announcing-italy-style-stage-3-lockdown-to-slow-the-spread-of-coronavirus\">stricter shutdown than the rest of Australia</a></strong>. In Victoria 22 people are in hospital with the virus, and 574 people have been infected. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is expected to announce the state will keep only essential service services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, petrol stations and health facilities open. <strong>Those two states, with significantly more cases than elsewhere, keep flagging stage 3 of a shutdown, but neither the federal government nor states have revealed how many stages there are or what each stage means.</strong></p> \n  <p>The imminent state measures come as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gladys-berejiklian\">Berejiklian</a> revealed there were at least 145 Covid-19 cases that appeared to be due to community transmission \u2013 they could not be explained by overseas travel or contact with a person that had travelled.<br></p> \n  <p>Queensland, too, has a significant number of cases: more than 550. There <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/27/queensland-elections-coronavirus-poses-lethal-risk-to-voters-experts-say\">are concerns about today\u2019s local government elections which many said should have been postponed</a>.</p> \n  <p>Finally, late last night <strong>Myer announced it would stand down 10,000 staff as it closes all its stores from tomorrow. </strong></p> \n  <p>Internationally, the British prime minister, <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>, tested positive for Covid-19 \u2013 he originally insisted he would keep shaking hands with people, including Covid-19 patients. </p> \n  <p>Don\u2019t heed advice from Johnson. Keep that distance and flatten the curve.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for joining me here.

This is a difficult time. People with sick loved ones interstate and overseas are wondering when they will next get to visit. Thousands have lost their jobs and are facing financial uncertainty.

The median age is 48, and 67% are linked to travel. A 91-year-old woman from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney died overnight, bringing the death toll sadly up to 14. Victoria\u2019s chief medical officer slammed the behaviour of beachgoers, who headed to crowded spots this weekend. An unnamed A-League player has tested positive, only days after the season was suspended. Millions of Queenslanders turned out to vote in local government elections and two byelections, despite experts labelling this a \u201clethal risk\u201d. NSW, Victoria and SA police confirmed they can hand out on-the-spot fines for people breaking quarantine restrictions. Total job losses across Australia exceeded 75,000 as more retailers announced closures \u2013 including clothing store Country Road. Ruby Princess cases nearly hit 300. There are now 171 cases in NSW linked to the ship and 122 interstate. More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, returned. And from midnight tonight, all travellers arriving in Australia from overseas must be quarantined in hotels for 14 days. Thanks for reading and stay safe. Voting has just closed in Queensland for 77 local councils, and two byelections for state parliament. But the results may not be known for some time, given over 570,000 people applied for postal votes due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, overall turnout is expected to be very low, which could speed the physical vote counting process. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer has come out with some pretty strong language after many residents were spotted out at the beach today in close proximity. \u201cSome of the behaviour today has been really crap,\u201d Brett Sutton said. \u201cWe\u2019re headed to 100,000 in 2-3 weeks without change.\u201d And from earlier, thousands of Australians are stranded in India after wide-randing lockdowns and the cancellation of commercial flights. Jai Houltham told Guardian Australia that \u201cpolice roam the streets with lathis [bamboo poles used to enforce crowd control], ensuring everyone stays inside\u201d. Read the full story here: If you refresh the blog, you\u2019ll see that the correct data is now in that graphic. Something you may have missed from earlier, South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria police have all confirmed today that they can issue on-the-spot fines for breaching quarantine orders. SA police commissioner Grant Stevens said SA police could issue $1,000 fines to people, and $5,000 fines to businesses. There\u2019s a slight glitch with our automated data set at the top of the blog, and the Australian death total is showing a number in the 400s. To all those emailing in, rest assured, as stated in the blog post below, the death toll is at 14. We\u2019re working on fixing that graphic now. To recap everything that has happened so far today: Australia\u2019s total cases have risen to 3,400. The median age is 48, and 67% are linked to travel. A 91-year-old woman from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney died overnight, bringing the death toll sadly up to 14. An A-League player has tested positive, only days after the season was suspended. The unnamed Newcastle Jets player was a member of the squad for last weekend\u2019s matches against Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City Millions of Queenslanders turned out to vote in local government elections and two byelections, despite experts labelling this a \u201clethal risk\u201d. Total job losses across Australia have exceeded 75,000 as more retailers announced closures. Ruby Princess cases nearly hit 300. There are now 171 cases in NSW linked to the ship and 122 interstate. From midnight tonight, all travellers arriving in Australia from overseas must be quarantined in hotels for 14 days. More than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, have returned. And more on store closures, it\u2019s not just Country Road, it\u2019s Mimco, Politix, Trenery and Witchery \u2013 who are all owned by South African company Woolworths Holdings. David Jones, also owned by the same company, will close some smaller stores but leave large ones open, AAP report. Myer yesterday announced it would shut all shops for four weeks. The United States has become the first country in the world to exceed 100,000 cases of coronavirus, after an additional 15,000 cases on Friday local time. Super Netball players have become the latest professional sportspeople to commit to a pay reduction due to the coronavirus pandemic while Netball Australia has stood down half its staff. The league and the Australian Netball Players\u2019 Association announced on Saturday a reduction to player payments for five weeks, AAP report. Contracted players are set to take two weeks\u2019 leave from Monday and then remain at home on \u201cactive rest\u201d for seven hours per week for the following three weeks at a 70% reduction in pay. Half of the staff from from Netball Australia and from the Super Netball league have been temporarily stood down, while those remaining are working reduced hours and taking pay cuts \u2013 including NA chief executive Marne Fechner and Super Netball boss Chris Symington, who are giving up 50% of their salaries. These reductions will be in place until 31 May 2020. More dispatches from the Queensland elections. Empty in some places, long lines in others. A reminder that the second edition of Isolaid festival is on tonight. Some of Australia\u2019s best musicians are streaming sets from their living rooms, for you to also enjoy from your living room. Today\u2019s lineup has already begun on Instagram live, and it\u2019s on again tomorrow. An unnamed A-League player has become the first Australian footballer to test positive for Covid-19. The Newcastle Jets player tested positive on Friday, the club confirmed, only days after the A-League was postponed. The player was a member of the Jets\u2019 squad for last weekend\u2019s matches against Brisbane Roar and Melbourne City, according to AAP. Newcastle Jets\u2019 chief executive Lawrie McKinna said the player was asymptomatic and remains in good health. And more on new NSW cases. A two-year-old child and a childcare worker at the same Sydney childcare centre have tested positive for Covid-19, as has a three-year old child who was a household contact of someone who contracted the disease overseas. And another case has been confirmed at the Opal Bankstown residential aged care facility. As of Friday 8pm, 22 people were in intensive care units and, of those, 11 are on ventilators. NSW Health have also revealed that more than 100 Australian doctors and dentists, who were stranded on a cruise ship off the coast of Chile, have today returned to Australia. Last week, we reported the doctors were on board as part of a medical convention when Chile banned cruise vessels from docking. Today NSW Health confirmed they had returned and none were identified as being \u201cunwell\u201d. \u201cTwo international flights arrived in Sydney overnight and this morning with 245 passengers ... These passengers include numerous doctors and nurses who had been attending a health convention onboard who had not been able to berth off the South American coast,\u201d the department said. \u201cAirport screening was immediately commenced, including symptom assessment and temperature, and no passengers were identified as being unwell. \u201cAll passengers are subject to the requirement for 14-day isolation under ministerial direction. This includes those who were able to safely return to their place of residence as well as around 150 people who are in quarantine in two Sydney hotels.\u201d Earlier, we told you that there are now 1,617 cases of Covid-19 in NSW. NSW Health has just released some further details of the latest new cases. 171 people who were on board the Ruby Princess cruise ship have now tested positive for Covid-19. And, earlier, we revealed that more than 100 people interstate from the same ship had also contracted the virus. The ship\u2019s 2,700 passengers had been allowed to disembark at Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay on 19 March without mass testing, even though four people later tested positive for Covid-19 the next day. On Tuesday, NSW Health was releasing state-by-state breakdowns, but abruptly said on Friday that they would stop \u2013 just as the number of interstate cases rose. There are 53 passengers in SA who have tested positive, 32 in Queensland and 21 in the ACT. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou and I\u2019ll be on the blog for the rest of today. Thanks to Melissa Davey for all her work today. Earlier, we mentioned that private hospitals say they could close within the next week without government intervention. Here\u2019s our full report, by Adam Morton: A quick late-afternoon recap. 3,400 cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Australia, including 14 deaths. The latest death is a 91-year-old woman from the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in NSW. New measures will take effect from midnight which will mean all travellers arriving in Australia from overseas will be taken to hotels and monitored by authorities for 14 days. The deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said Australia\u2019s hospitals, including intensive care departments, are ready and prepared. He rejected claims that Australia is expecting a peak on 10 April. Queenslanders have gone to the polls to vote in local government elections and two byelections. Extra precautions have been put in place as voters were told to bring their own pens, keep a 1.5-metre distance and handing out how-to-vote material was banned. More clothing retailers have announced they will close Australia-wide including Country Road and Cotton On. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said $198m was being provided to support regional airlines struggling through the crisis, and an additional $100m will also be available to smaller regional airlines should they need it. On that note I\u2019m handing the blog over to reporter Naaman Zhou who will keep you updated through the evening. Thanks to Naaman and my colleagues Scott Heinrich, Bridie Jabour, Judy Prisk, Nick Evershed and Gabriel Wilder for their help throughout the day. Stay safe and look after each other \u2013 my thoughts are with all of those with loved ones far away, who are ill, and who are facing financial hardship. It\u2019s been a tough couple of months. Just a quick look overseas. Reporter Peter Beaumont writes that Italy has recorded its single biggest leap in coronavirus deaths, with 969 people dying from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Beaumont writes; Seemingly dashing hopes that the rate of infection might be flattening there, Italy also became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching 86,498 cases. That included 66,414 current infections, up 4,401 from Thursday. On Thursday the US became the country with the largest infection caseload, with 93,000 reported. An extension of Italy\u2019s coronavirus containment measures is inevitable, the country\u2019s supreme health council said. Read the full story here. The deputy chief medical officer is speaking about how well Australia\u2019s hospital system is prepared. There have been reports a peak is expected in hospitals on 10 April, but these reports were not true, Paul Kelly says: I want to also address the issue of intensive care beds and hospital beds. And this question that keeps coming to us from various places: is Australia ready? Is the healthcare system ready? Well, I can really assure people that the healthcare system in Australia is very adaptable. And it is absolutely ready for this matter. In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular. One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow. So these matters are very much in hand and will be developing through the day. The deputy medical chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, said isolation of returned travellers combined with physical distancing, and tracing contacts of known Covid-19 cases, are the key measures being focused on. We really need to get on top of the people who have returned from overseas ... from countries that had a much wider and worse epidemic of Covid-19 than we currently do here in Australia. So of that group that have come from overseas, 496 of those have come from cruise ships. We now have almost 200 from the Ruby Princess and others from other cruise ships, including ... the Diamond Princess. So 200 from the Ruby Princess. Of the locally acquired cases ... most of those have a very clear contact with a known case of Covid-19. This demonstrates that we are finding the cases we need to find, tracing their contacts, and dealing with those issues so that they are isolated from the community and to decrease the transmission from person to person of this very infectious disease. Deputy medical officer Prof Paul Kelly is up. Apologies. Earlier I said the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, would be giving the address. Kelly says: We have had 3,400 cases of Covid-19 reported in Australia and the median age ... is 48 years. But we have had a very wide range. The oldest person is 98 and we have had a couple of small babies who have also developed this disease. 67% of the confirmed cases, so two-thirds of the cases remain travel related, so these are people who have returned from overseas. And that is the main concern. More clothing retailers have announced they will close. Country Road said on Facebook the closure will be temporary. heir statement says: As a heritage Australian brand, we recognise that we have an important role to play in slowing the spread of Covid-19. Therefore we have made the decision to temporarily close our Australian retail stores from end of day Saturday 28 March until further notice. This is a decision that has not been made lightly, and one we feel is necessary to protect the health and wellbeing of our team, customers and wider community. For those who wish to continue shopping with us, our online store remains open. Meanwhile Witchery will temporarily close stores as of Sunday 29 March until further notice. The online store will remain open for now. Cotton On will also still be available online, but announced on Saturday from 5pm Sunday 29 March that all Australian stores would temporarily close. Prof Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, is expected to give an update shortly. We\u2019ll bring you that as it happens. The national death toll is now 14. *Note we put deaths at 15 earlier due to counting one death twice. Apologies. Catholic Health Australia, the Australian Private Hospitals Association and Day Hospitals Australia have issued a joint statement warning crucial clinical staff will be stood down and private and non-profit hospitals closed in a matter of days after all category 2 and 3 non-elective surgeries were suspended. The statement says: The hospitals are now faced with the very difficult decision to stand down staff and furlough services as a direct result, just when the entire health system is bracing itself for the surge in Covid-19 patients. Catholic Hospitals Association\u2019s chief executive, Pat Garcia, said: \u201cWhat should be happening at this time, in this breathing space we have before the full coronavirus onslaught, is all hospitals turn their attention to training up their existing clinical staff, and hiring additional staff \u2013 both clinical and non-clinical \u2013 to treat patients. We also acknowledge that winter, which is just around the corner, tests the hospital system at the best of times let alone when there is global pandemic. Hospitals cannot simply close down entire wards and ICUs, then turn them back on at the flick of a switch. If we need to close down wards and hospitals, they may not be available when we need them. Many thanks to Naaman Zhou for taking on the liveblog for a bit. Melissa Davey back with you now to take you through to about 4pm. Just a bit more on our post from earlier about community groups calling on the federal government to provide energy relief. The government has said it is working with state and territory governments, industry and stakeholders to ensure supply is maintained. The Australian Energy Regulator has set reasonable expectations of energy companies to protect householders and small business customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its statement of expectations sets out a range measures, including: waiving any disconnection, reconnection and/or contract break fees for small businesses which have gone into hibernation, along with daily supply charges to retailers, during any period of disconnection until at least 31 July; offering all households and small businesses who indicate they may be in financial stress a payment plan or hardship arrangement; not disconnecting customers who may be in financial stress, without their agreement before 31 July and potentially beyond. If you\u2019re worried about paying your bill, you can find more information here. Some images from Queensland\u2019s council elections and state byelections. And here\u2019s that full story on Perth Glory standing down its players and staff: A coalition of community groups is calling on the government and energy retailers to provide energy bill relief to those vulnerable during the coronavirus pandemic. The Australian Council of Social Service, the Ethnic Communities Council, the Uniting Communities, St Vincent de Paul Society and the Public Interest Advocacy Centre have all joined to ask for funding for bill relief and energy efficiency programs. The group is also calling on energy retailers to employ Australians in call centres as they close overseas offices. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the ACT has risen to 71, up by nine from yesterday. Of the new cases, six are men and three are women, all aged between 48 and 73, the ACT health department says. Seven of the new cases are \u201clinked to overseas travel, including cruise ships\u201d, one is a close contact of a confirmed case, and one is still under investigation. \u201cThere remains no evidence of local transmission in the ACT,\u201d the department says. Also in sport, the football players\u2019 union has said it is ready to take legal action against A-League club Perth Glory and its owner Tony Sage after he stood down the club\u2019s players and staff. From AAP: Less than a week after the FFA suspended the 2019-20 A-League season until at least 22 April due to the coronavirus outbreak, Sage has stood down all the club\u2019s players and staff. The outspoken club owner said the decision was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t remember sadder days except when my mum died and my brother died. It\u2019s heartbreaking. Very, very sad,\u201d Sage told the West Australian. Professional Footballers Australia, however, says it will initiate legal proceedings against Sage if the players aren\u2019t immediately reinstated. \u201cA fortnight ago it was fine to relocate players to the east coast away from their families and expose them to a global pandemic,\u201d PFA chief executive John Didulica said. \u201cNow, when the opportunity arises, it is considered acceptable to stop paying them.\u201d The Australian Rugby League commission\u2019s chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, will present his plan to slash costs from NRL headquarters on Monday in a move expected to hand players an additional $7m for this year. The Rugby League Players\u2019 Association has been negotiating with the NRL for wage cuts to keep the game alive through the toughest financial challenge it has ever faced. A model for an 87% drop in wages for the coming months due to the coronavirus suspension has already been presented, based on a worst-case scenario. However, the rescue package to be presented by V\u2019landys at Monday\u2019s meeting is set to take the original offer of $12.4m for players for the rest of the season up to about $20m. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou taking over the liveblog for a bit. Queensland\u2019s total cases of coronavirus have risen to 625, an increase of 70. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said this increase was \u201cfairly steady\u201d, AAP reports. As of midnight, people transiting through Brisbane international airport will be sent to a hotel for a 14-day quarantine period. The state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, said 1,047 people arrived in Brisbane from overseas yesterday, but that was down from about 7,000 a week ago. Let\u2019s recap on the day so far, as Australian cases of Covid-19 hit 3,378. Another death has been reported in NSW, a 91-year-old woman. The national death toll is now 14. From midnight anyone arriving at an Australian airport from overseas will be taken straight to a hotel. The Victorian and NSW premiers have explained how this will work: travellers will be given health checks and taken straight by bus to hotel rooms. They will be monitored by authorities to ensure they are adhering to quarantine and so they can be given treatment if they become unwell. They will be provided with food. Another airline support package has been announced to support regional communities that depend on aviation for medical and food supplies. The additional $198m was announced by the deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, with about 140 communities relying on regional aviation. Victoria and South Australia have followed NSW in introducing on-the-spot fines for businesses and individuals breaching social distancing restrictions. Total job losses across Australia have exceeded 75,000. Queenslanders are heading to the polls for local government elections and two state byelections, with the state\u2019s Covid-19 total now at 625. Melissa Davey with you, I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Naaman Zhou shortly while I refill the coffee cup and prepare to take you through the afternoon liveblog coverage. It\u2019s tough to keep up with the multiple press conferences that happen every day from the federal government as well as the states and territories, plus the opposition. Thankfully our friends at AAP have filed this update on the press conference in South Australia earlier today. AAP reports: South Australians who breach self-isolation or quarantine orders will be slapped with a $1,000 on-the-spot fine under new regulations and $5,000 fines for companies and businesses that trade against the current rules. The SA police commissioner, Grant Stevens, said while most people were doing the right thing, some were not. \u201cThe principal objective here is to ensure that people who are required to self-quarantine, who we believe are at risk of spreading the infection, comply with those obligations,\u201d he said. Before the new rules, police had to launch a formal prosecution and take the matter to court. New regulations will also ban gatherings of more than 10 people. Gatherings of fewer than 10 would have to follow the one person per four square metres rule. The premier, Steven Marshall, said the government understood the restrictions were changing people\u2019s lives: \u201cBut they are not optional. Everyone needs to understand that from today failure to follow the directions to the letter of the law will leave individuals and businesses liable for significant on-the-spot fines. \u201cThe period of education regarding restrictions during this pandemic really has come to end and the period of enforcement has begun.\u201d South Australia has 257 confirmed coronavirus cases with six being treated in intensive care. Gladys Berejiklian is asked whether NSW is going to move towards stricter shutdowns ahead of the other states and territories. She says: If we see those numbers and community transmission go up at a rate that we are not comfortable with, we will have to put in stricter measures. And we would rather hold off before we need to do that. But if we need to do that, we will. And as I said yesterday, and the day before that, I get daily briefs from the experts on what those numbers are telling us. We also get daily briefs on what people are doing. And I have to say, in the main, we have seen a major reduction in the number of people moving around, and that is a good thing. Because unless you have to go out of your home, you shouldn\u2019t really be moving around. A reporter asks for some clarity because businesses are scared and confused. When will more of them have to close? Can I say, this is an uncertain time for all of us and I\u2019m not going to pretend it is not. But what I am intending to do is make sure that every time we make a decision, people understand what it means for them. We have been very clear on that to this point in time, and I have said that NSW is looking at stricter conditions in relation to people\u2019s activity if we don\u2019t feel comfortable that the decisions we made last week are making a real difference. We are starting to get some information which suggests those actions have resulted in some positive results, but it is too early to determine whether it is enough, and that is why I am putting NSW on notice, just to say never, ever will you have to worry about getting what you need. Never, ever do you have to hoard from supermarkets. Supermarkets will always be open, pharmacies, service stations, essential things that people need. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has given an update saying NSW now has 1,617 confirmed cases. This is an increase of 212 new cases since 8pm on Thursday 26 March. Chant said 84,907 people have been tested and excluded. Of those infected, 22 are in intensive care. A 91-year-old woman who was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility died overnight. The death toll in the state is now eight. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, is speaking about the additional restrictions that will take effect from midnight. Travellers returning from overseas will be taken straight to hotel rooms for 14 days isolation, he says. They will be monitored by police and other authorities. Travellers will be transported to hotels by bus straight from the airport and will undergo health checks. They are not criminals. They will be given food and hotel rooms and they will have positive health outcomes. They will spend 14 days in a controlled environment. And why? That is because we know that they are those who spread the virus. And we need to stop the spread. I know it is challenging times for those people returning home. They probably just want to come home and lie on their own bed and see their family members, but the reality is that this is truly unprecedented times. We will treat people with absolute respect and dignity but we will need their support in terms of understanding. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is urging travellers to bear with the government throughout shutdown and quarantine measures: It is frustrating time for many of us. It is really hard and frustrating for all of us. And so I say to those travellers: you need to bear with us and do the right thing. There will be enforcement procedures in place from both the federal perspective and state perspective. But we are also asking people to do the right thing. I\u2019m not pretending it will be a perfect system. I\u2019m not going to pretend that we are going to be able to make sure that every single person abides by the rules. But I will say that our entire police force is ready for the task and we are looking forward to working with border force and also the Australian defence force, as well as other authorities involved, because we know that by working together closely we can keep our community safe. We draw a line in the sand from midnight. The police are in charge of managing the operations, along with the ADF and border force. And we want to make sure that we keep our community safe by making sure the people adhere to strict isolation measures. We know the largest number of people with coronavirus are bringing it in from overseas. The next category of people are those they are in close contact with. Unless we control the job at that level, we won\u2019t have a chance to contain the spread in the community. Stationery retailer kikki.K, which was already in receivership, has shut its 59 stores and stood down 440 staff because of the coronavirus crisis. This adds to 10,000 stand downs announced last night by the department store Myer, which will shut for a month when doors close on Monday night. It brings total job losses announced by airlines, retailers, sporting codes and retailers over the past week to more than 75,000, with hundreds of thousands more estimated to be gone from hospitality. Retailers in particular haven\u2019t waited for an order from the government to shut their doors, and have also stopped paying rent to landlords. Receiver Barry Wight of Cor Cordis said kikki.K\u2019s online shop remained open and he hoped to sell the business as a going concern. Melbourne reporter Matilda Boseley has this update: Thirty-nine Australians who were on board the Costa Luminosa and are now trapped in quarantine in Rome have got word that at least two of their international shipmates have died. Italian authorities demanded the group isolate for two weeks before returning to Australia after Coronavirus infections broke out on board their cruise ship. They may soon be joined by 200 Australians on the Costa Victoria. Facebook groups have been created for Luminosa passengers and family members around the world to share updates. In the past day, two people have posted to say their elderly relatives had died \u2013 one in an intensive care ward of a hospital in Savona, the Italian town where the cruise ship is docked. At least two Australian passengers have been admitted to hospital for Covid-19 since arriving in Italy. One is in critical condition. It\u2019s unknown how many more may have the virus. US and Canadian passengers were evacuated via charter plane when the ship docked in France on 20 March. Since arriving home many have posted to say they have tested positive, and at least one man is in intensive care in the US. With the Italian health care system under extreme strain, family members fear Australians who fall ill will not receive sufficient care. A 91-year-old woman is latest person to die in NSW after testing positive to Covid-19. The woman was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care facility in Macquarie Park. It is the fourth Covid-19 death related to the facility. The number of deaths in NSW related to coronavirus is now eight. Nineteen people are in intensive care and nine are on mechanical ventilation. BaptistCare manages the Dorothy Henderson Lodge and its chief executive, Ross Low, said: Words fail to express the deep sense of sadness and grief we are all feeling at this time. I have spoken with the family to express my condolences. My heart and thoughts are with them all, along with the friends and staff who loved and cared for our resident. Over the past several weeks, teams of people have been working tirelessly to protect the health of our residents. To lose another person in our care is a painful loss for us all. A bitter stand-off between the AFL and its players has ended, with players agreeing to a 50% pay cut until the end of May owing to the coronavirus shutdown. They are also prepared to play games until December to ensure the season is completed. In an agreement reached on Friday, the players\u2019 pay cut will increase to 70% if the season is delayed beyond 31 May, but will stay at 50% when games recommence. McCormack is asked whether it\u2019s appropriate that the Queensland council elections and byelections are going ahead today despite the pandemic. The state has more than 550 cases. He says: I know [the Queensland premier] Annastacia Palaszczuk has been working with the prime minister very well through the cabinet process. She has been cooperating. I appreciate that for Queensland they are practising social distancing measures. I understand they are taking every measure to ensure that people are the right distance away from each other as they vote in those elections. I have every faith that that process is being followed through. We will see what happens as a result of that. We\u2019re doing a callout for voicemails for Guardian Australia\u2019s Full Story news podcast which is now daily and looking for your stories about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected you. We want to know: How are you feeling? How has your life changed? You can leave a voicemail on (02) 8076 8550 and leave your first name and number if you wouldn\u2019t mind us getting in touch with you. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, is speaking in Wagga Wagga in the NSW Riverina and says the aviation industry is one of the hardest hit due to Covid-19, with cuts to flights especially harsh on regional Australia which relies on planes to bring in essential supplies. Today I\u2019m announcing $198m as part of an aviation network support measure to help subsidise the 138 or so communities that rely on aviation. These are airline companies that are flying in and out of centres such as Wagga Wagga, where I am now, the home of the Wagga Air Centre and Rex. They will be subsidised so that regional airlines, the dozen or so regional aviation companies, and others, [can continue to fly] in each and every day. Of course regional aviation has been smashed by Covid-19. Regional aviation, like all aviation, is doing it very, very tough. An emergency department health worker at the Mersey Community hospital is among the new cases in Tasmania. Patients and close contacts are being identified. Overnight, Tasmanian public health services were also informed that a separate Tasmanian case involves a passenger who was on board the Sun Princess cruise ship that disembarked from Sydney on 19 March. Any Tasmanians who were on the Sun Princess have been told to go into quarantine from today until 2 April. The Tasmania premier adds that from midnight Sunday, any non-essential traveller arriving in the state, either through airports or through the ferry port, will be placed into self-quarantine for 14 days in a government-run facility. Peter Gutwein says the facilities will be managed and overseen by Tasmanian police with support from the Australian defence force. He says the record jump in cases in Tasmania reported on Friday meant vigilance is needed: I can\u2019t be clearer. We are an island state. We have an advantage. But we need people to work with us. The events of yesterday are a wake-up call. The events of yesterday should send a signal to Tasmanians that we are not immune from this. We need to ensure that the rules are followed, and we can only beat this virus if everyone plays their part. Stay home unless you absolutely need to go out. If you are not going to work, if you are not taking your children to school, if you are not out buying supplies, stay home. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, has opened a press conference with the words: \u201cStay home and save lives.\u201d We introduce the direction that if more than 10 people congregate at a park or beach, that will be an offence. If you go to somebody\u2019s house and you have a party, that will be an offence. We need to ensure that we follow the rules. In terms of compliance, I want to just touch on this. So far there have been 730 compliance checks. The vast majority of Tasmanians are doing the right thing, but 18 people were not \u2013 out of 730. We are currently working through those individual circumstances, and I want to be absolutely clear. Anybody that was found to be blatantly breaching those rules will be charged. Now I want to say to Tasmanians, understand that this is serious. If you are asked to go into self-isolation, then you need to stay in self-isolation. This is not a game. We have both the benefit and the challenge that more than 98% of our cases today relate to cruisers or overseas travel. We are leading the way in terms of the way that we have managed our borders, but we need to do more. A little earlier I asked you all to email me with your stories of kindness during this difficult time, where people are separated from their loved ones, losing their jobs, and facing uncertainty. And wow, did you deliver. I have been overwhelmed with stories of people walking their elderly neighbours\u2019 dogs, leaving thank you notes to retail staff in supermarkets, children writing letters of support to health workers, and people dropping care packages to neighbours. Here are a few of the stories you\u2019ve sent this morning. Thanks for sharing ... Is someone cutting onions in here? Rachael West told me that her Melbourne apartment building has pulled together a WhatsApp group which means neighbours who would never have met otherwise are now talking. Some of the requests for help that have been met include glass jars for jam making, dog-sitting and book-swaps. Amber wrote in to tell me that her daughter, Victoria, has been busy making up boxes of goods for elderly relatives and dropping them off in suburbs around Melbourne. The boxes include handmade letters and pictures from grandchildren. Dandenong market has launched a \u201cBe Kind\u201d campaign encouraging the community to engage in random acts of kindness for each other. You can read about here. They\u2019re donating bags of fresh fruit and vegetables to the most vulnerable in the community. Charlotte emailed to say that one of her neighbours had anonymously left a roll of toilet paper on every doorstep in the street in Coburg, Victoria. Andrew Nicholson said his Bendigo neighbours of the past five have become fast friends with his family due to them having children of similar ages. He says: \u201cIsolation has been making it hard this week, so my wife, Laura Russo, came up with a great idea of removing some colour-bond panels from our shared fence and replacing them with transparent polycarbonate so we could hang out without breaching social distancing measures. Friday night drinks worked out so well we\u2019re going to do it every day. Dance-offs are on the cards.\u201d And Jamie Derkenne emailed: \u201cWhen the fires hit Little Forest on the NSW south coast in late December last year the community started a WhatsApp group chat for the entire area. It proved invaluable for sharing information and resources as the fires raged, and is now proving it\u2019s worth again with Covid-19. Through this group chat the community has been able to do such things as resource computers for home-schooled kids and share-shopping duties and tips. This group chat has certainly helped the community remain strong, and has helped us settle quickly into a community we only moved into in mid December.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, police commissioner, Mick Fuller, and police minister, David Elliott, will provide an update on Covid-19 at noon today AEDT. NSW has flagged introducing more stringent measures to control the pandemic. The state has more than 1,400 cases; there are more than 3,100 cases across Australia. Thousands of Australians caught by India\u2019s dramatic nationwide shutdown say they face running out of food and water or being evicted from accommodation, as 1.3 billion people across the world\u2019s second-most populous nation are ordered to stay indoors. \u201cThere will be a total ban on venturing out of your homes \u2026 Forget what going out means,\u201d the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, told the nation. Thousands of Australian tourists, expatriate workers and \u201coverseas citizens of India\u201d have been stranded by India\u2019s dramatic shutdown, the largest lockdown the world has seen to arrest the Covid-19 pandemic. There are no commercial flights permitted in or out of India until at least 15 April, and Australians fear they will not be able to get home without a government-sponsored repatriation flight, which India\u2019s government is allowing. Australian Jai Houltham is stranded in Goa on India\u2019s west coast. He has been moved on from two hotels that were closed by police and fears he may be forced out again. He has nowhere left to go. \u201cWe are now at the end of the fifth day of a total lockdown, police roam the streets with lathis [bamboo poles used to enforce crowd control] ensuring everyone stays inside, many unable to get supplies,\u201d Houltham said. \u201cThe lockdown has been extended to the 14th of April, and there is talk of it being extended for three months, with currently no option for Australians to get home.\u201d Houltham said many tourists had tried to get back to Australia when the government first called for citizens to return, but had faced unannounced flight cancellations, sudden border closures or restrictions on transiting through international airports. \u201cNow with complete lockdown, accommodation closing and people being left on the streets, and being unable to access food, water or medicines, people have had enough and are desperate for the Australian government to step in.\u201d Australia\u2019s high commission in New Delhi has told citizens: \u201cWe would encourage you all to stay indoors and avoid any crowded place. Please note there are no evacuation plans yet declared by the Australian government for Australians in India. \u201cIf your situation is, or becomes, life-threatening, or you have serious concerns for your welfare (eg cannot find any accommodation whatsoever, or any food, or essential medications), please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us.\u201d I\u2019d love to include some stories about kindness and being positive during these difficult times. If you have stories of neighbours helping each other out, friends supporting each other in isolation, and other acts of kindness, feel free to email me melissa.davey@theguardian.com or teeet me, and I\u2019ll include them in this blog. Superannuation funds have asked the government for taxpayer backing to help them meet withdrawals by members without being forced to sell assets, as the coronavirus crisis sparks one of the worst stock market routs in the past 100 years. But sources said that so far the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has rebuffed the proposal for a \u201cliquidity backstop facility\u201d designed to protect funds from taking heavy losses if or when a large number of people withdraw money because they have lost their jobs due to government restrictions. Guardian Australia understands there are fears within the super industry that withdrawals will be much higher than estimates of $25bn to $27bn that were circulating this week. The industry super funds, which tend to have a higher proportion of their assets in harder-to-sell but more lucrative unlisted assets such as roads and ports, have led the push for the facility. For-profit funds represented by the Financial Services Council do not support the proposal. Read more here. Just to recap those measures just announced in Victoria to penalise those breaking physical distancing rules. New South Wales has introduced a similar system of on-the-spot fines. In Victoria from today: Police have been given the power to issue on-the-spot fines of up to $1,652 for individuals and up to $9,913 for businesses that don\u2019t follow the rules. The fines can be issued to those people and businesses who, for example, fail to self-isolate for 14 days after arriving at an airport; organise or attend a mass gathering; organise or attend a wedding that has present more than the people being married, the celebrant, and two witnesses; organise an auction. Victoria police has established a coronavirus enforcement squad of 500 officers to ensure containment measures are followed. Yet again Daniel Andrews has flagged \u201cstage three\u201d of a lockdown is coming but without giving clarity around what stage 3 means, how many stages there are, or when the next stage might come. Despite this, Andrews insists he has been clear. He says: In terms of next stages, I\u2019ve been very clear about this: there was a stage one, and when we announced that, I told you all there would be a stage two, we\u2019ve done that. There will be a stage three. It will come at an appropriate time. The national cabinet understands what is going on in Victoria is very different from what is happening in the Northern Territory; what is happening down the eastern seaboard is a different magnitude \u2013 it poses a different threat and risk than other parts of the country. We have the full support of the national cabinet for a differentiated approach \u2013 the measures that help Victoria flatten the curve, the same for New South Wales, and the same for parts of Queensland. That\u2019s national cabinet working well. Compare that with New Zealand, which has published clear definitions for each phase of its response. Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, is speaking about how the $1.7bn economic survival package announced one week ago will be rolled out: We\u2019ve been very clear that this is not about economic stimulus. There\u2019s no stimulus going on. There\u2019s a very deliberate strategy put in place by government to make sure that we preserve the economic architecture of the state. So this is about business survival to the best of our capacity. We can\u2019t put customers into people\u2019s businesses at the moment. And that\u2019s largely due to the fact that our social isolation strategies are aimed at that not happening. What we can do is give cash. Give cash for survival, not for stimulus. One of the things we\u2019ve been very clear in the business survival package is the $1.7bn of support and assistance that we\u2019ve identified is being directly provided to businesses. Now we\u2019ve come up with the strategy of making sure those targeted businesses \u2013 all whom can apply from Monday this week for these grants \u2013 the aim will be to ensure that the first part of that $500m package of support for smaller payroll businesses will apply. These grants are for small business only. That\u2019s a business with a payroll of less than $650,000 who weren\u2019t eligible for payroll tax relief in the broader allocations. The payroll refund and waiver arrangements \u2013 businesses were emailed on Monday of this week to update their bank details to tell us if in fact the state revenue office had the appropriate details for the purposes of providing the refunds we have identified. The cash has started to flow. In fact some $52m has already been refunded to many businesses. Victoria\u2019s police minister, Lisa Neville, is now speaking, elaborating on enforcement measures including on-the-spot fines just mentioned by Daniel Andrews: We\u2019ve seen the biggest overnight increase in infection since this has started in Australia. So the measures we\u2019re announcing today are more important than ever. This will give Victoria police an additional tool. At the moment we\u2019ve had over 2,600 checks by Victoria police of people through spot-checking and phone calls where someone has rung in to say that someone is not complying. Giving them this tool of an additional on-the-spot fine means that people understand the consequences of their actions straightaway. Individuals can face a fine of just over $1,600, if they are, for example, not self-quarantining as required, if they travelled back from overseas. If you\u2019re holding a wedding and you\u2019re over the numbers, you\u2019re a business who is also being closed and you are now opened ... those are all subject to this on-the-spot fine. If you\u2019re a business you can face an on-the-spot fine of $10,000. The Victorian premier has just said there are now a total of 685 coronavirus cases in Victoria. That is 111 more since he updated us yesterday. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is holding a press conference with the state\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas. Andrews is speaking about breaches of isolation rules and measures for returning travellers: As you may be aware, we\u2019re going beyond simply an infringement notice and a court-based process for the enforcement of these very important issues. We\u2019re moving to an on-the-spot fine system. Yesterday the national cabinet agreed that all returning overseas travellers would go to a hotel rather than their own place of residence. And they\u2019ll be quarantined. They\u2019ll be self-isolated; they\u2019ll be isolated for 14 days. I want to thank the hotel industry who have done an amazing job. This is the closest thing to bookings they\u2019ve seen for many weeks. So it\u2019s very good health policy. It\u2019s also good for jobs. We have offers of some 26,000 rooms made by hotels all across the city and into the regions. We have 5,000 of those ready, set up to go right now. You may have missed the news which came late yesterday \u2013 after 9pm \u2013 that the federal government has extended the suspension of mutual obligations until 27 April \u201cto support job seekers through this difficult period\u201d. The government announced it had suspended mutual obligations on Tuesday and said it would review the decision on Friday. Documents seen by Guardian Australia suggest it did not plan to directly inform jobseekers of this. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, and the social services minister, Anne Ruston, issued this late night statement: As demand remains high on government services, the suspension of mutual obligation requirements will alleviate some of this congestion and give certainty to the sector. This announcement means jobseekers will not be penalised for being unable to either attend, or report their attendance, at appointments or activities. Payments will be not be suspended and no compliance action will be taken. These arrangements will continue to be reviewed regularly. During these challenging times jobseekers are encouraged to stay job ready and connected to their employment services provider in their local area. Radio New Zealand reports that the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has \u201cpleaded with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, to make an exception to the rule that bars many of the 650,000 New Zealanders there from receiving a benefit\u201d for unemployment. Ardern said: New Zealanders who are in Australia are more likely to be employed, they earn more, they are Australia\u2019s best migrant workforce, and I\u2019d like to think they could be supported during this horrific time for everyone, alongside their fellow Australian workers.\u201d Read the full story here. The US president, Donald Trump, has just announced that 100,000 ventilators will be produced in the next 100 days. He adds that the airline Boeing has offered the US use of a \u201cvery big\u201d plane to distribute medical supplies. Trump says: Boeing is also offering us the use of what they call the dream lifter cargo plane ... They called up just a little while ago, and that can sort of take anything, that\u2019s the biggest in the world, and they\u2019re letting us use that for the distribution of product all over the country, especially heavy product or large quantities of product. Boeing will dedicate three planes to the flying of medical supplies anywhere we need it. Each plane can carry 63,000 pounds of cargo per flight. That\u2019s a lot of cargo.\u201d He\u2019s signed a relief package worth US$2tn. Just looking over to New Zealand for a second where yesterday it was announced there had been 76 new cases in the 24 hours prior, bringing the total to 338. Associate Prof Arindam Basu, an epidemiologist, wrote this for The Conversation explaining the jump which has come despite the stringent lockdowns the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced from early on. He writes that lessons learned from China and its lockdown revealed: \u201cThe number of confirmed cases only reached a plateau at the beginning of March, suggesting that it takes a little over a month for a strict lockdown to take effect.\u201d Meanwhile my colleague Kate Lyons has written this lovely piece about how New Zealanders are keeping their spirits up in lockdown. I have been reporting on the drug hydroxychloroquine, a medicine used in many countries overseas to treat malaria, and in Australia to treat people with serious and often excruciating autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. The drug is being explored in clinical trials, including ones being run in Australia, as a potential treatment or preventive for Covid-19. I wrote about those clinical trials here including why a massive degree of caution is needed. Clinical trials are important and should be done, but the way hydroxychloroquine has been reported on has led to massive hype about it as a Covid-19 treatment, prompting shortages worldwide, including in Australia. There are good reasons media do not normally report on these clinical trials until they are complete and have undergone peer review. Last week the US president, Donald Trump, touted hydroxychloroquine as possibly \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d. He also said: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to kill anybody.\u201d And he incorrectly announced the drug\u2019s approval had been fast-tracked. Soon afterwards a US man died after he began drinking a form of chloroquine found in fish tank cleaner because he was scared of getting sick. In Nigeria, people have been poisoned attempting to take the drug as a preventive. But now prominent advertisements paid for by the former federal politician Clive Palmer which have run in the Australian and on Facebook have promoted hydroxychloroquine as a potential \u201ccure\u201d for Covid-19. These ads are \u201cethically immoral\u201d according to Prof Peter Collignon, a former WHO adviser who worked on Australia\u2019s response to the Sars virus. The two-page ad in the Australian states hydroxychloroquine, when combined with another medication, could \u201cwipe out the virus in test tubes\u201d, and Australia\u2019s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, is now investigating whether the ad breaches drugs advertising rules. The ad says Palmer had agreed to personally fund the acquisition or manufacture of 1m doses \u201cto ensure all Australians would have access to the drug as soon as possible\u201d. Much of the hype for the drug has been generated by a small French study which, although reported by some media, has since been widely disputed, found to have omitted data, and to contain spurious results. A small but well-conducted study from China found no benefit to chloroquine being given to Covid-19 patients. Palmer has not responded to my attempts to reach him for comment. What a lot changes in a few hours, let alone a week, when it comes to Covid-19. Melissa Davey here, and when I was with you on the liveblog last Saturday, Australia had crossed 1,000 cases by the end of the day. This morning the national total is approaching more than 3,200 cases, and almost half of those are in New South Wales. Thousands have lost their jobs and we are in more stringent lockdown. A significant amount of spread has come from the Ruby Princess cruise ship \u2013 more than 200 cases are linked to that cruise. Yesterday we learned 32 Queenslanders from the ship tested positive to the disease. Meanwhile 162 people in NSW and at least 49 interstate have been diagnosed with Covid-19 after they left the cruise ship, which was allowed to dock twice in Sydney\u2019s Circular Quay this month. NSW and Victoria are preparing to announce a stricter shutdown than the rest of Australia. In Victoria 22 people are in hospital with the virus, and 574 people have been infected. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is expected to announce the state will keep only essential service services such as grocery stores, pharmacies, petrol stations and health facilities open. Those two states, with significantly more cases than elsewhere, keep flagging stage 3 of a shutdown, but neither the federal government nor states have revealed how many stages there are or what each stage means. The imminent state measures come as Berejiklian revealed there were at least 145 Covid-19 cases that appeared to be due to community transmission \u2013 they could not be explained by overseas travel or contact with a person that had travelled. Queensland, too, has a significant number of cases: more than 550. There are concerns about today\u2019s local government elections which many said should have been postponed. Finally, late last night Myer announced it would stand down 10,000 staff as it closes all its stores from tomorrow. Internationally, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, tested positive for Covid-19 \u2013 he originally insisted he would keep shaking hands with people, including Covid-19 patients. Don\u2019t heed advice from Johnson. Keep that distance and flatten the curve. Thanks for joining me here. If I miss anything as this story moves rapidly, feel free to email me melissa.davey@theguardian.com or say hi over at Twitter. This is a difficult time. People with sick loved ones interstate and overseas are wondering when they will next get to visit. Thousands have lost their jobs and are facing financial uncertainty. People have lost their businesses and livelihoods. Lives have been lost. So let\u2019s try to keep the interaction and comments kind. We are all bound to get aspects of this rapidly moving situation wrong.",

      "bodyText": "The past few weeks have brought considerable reason to question the purpose of human existence. Between the examples of influencers licking toilets during this pandemic and the people who think it\u2019s funny to cough on food at the grocery store, are we seriously still supposed to believe in Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution? Although people continually and recklessly flouting social distancing rules is infuriating, we, the sensible public, can at least rest safe in the knowledge that experts are experts for a reason, and ignoring them is not best advised. What\u2019s the point in respecting all those measures if no one else is listening, I hear you ask? Well, it turns out that some of this month\u2019s biggest violators are having to learn these lessons themselves. So before you consider doing something stupid, too, read this list.

      "body": "<p>In Italy they are singing and sharing recipes. In France, humour is saving the day. In Spain, communal staircases have become the new running tracks, and in Germany, ordinarily disorderly hackers are busy coding corona-busting apps.</p> \n<p>As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained \u2013 and to counter what the continent\u2019s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement.</p> \n<p>Like everyone else, Italy\u2019s 60 million citizens, who went into lockdown on 9 March, have been \u201casked to make sacrifices\u201d, said Sara Raginelli, a psychologist in Ancona. \u201cAnd as we live in a rather dramatic way, our mental health is being challenged.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a survey during the first week of Italy\u2019s confinement, 93% of respondents said they felt at least a little anxious, while 42% described a distinct drop in their mood and 28% reported that they were not sleeping well.</p> \n<p>Italians are entitled to a free online consultation from the health ministry, which has warned of a \u201cpsychological emergency\u201d, saying people risk being \u201coverwhelmed by fear of a insidious virus that has banned us from hugging and being close to others\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1abbb996-3fa9-4ddc-90b6-4916220ddec7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nd0siJpru4Y?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Some 9,000 psychologists are involved in the #psicologionline scheme, offering phone or video consultations aimed also at countering the \u201cheartbreaking effects of the daily death toll, warlike scenes, and easy risk of infection if we don\u2019t stay home\u201d.</p> \n<p>Some degree of anxiety, of course, is only normal. Borwin Bandelow, from G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, said humans developed into social creatures to survive, so isolation was an unnatural state for most. \u201cIn the past we lived in tribes, and those who broke away from those tribes had very little chance,\u201d he told Der Spiegel<em>.</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s about knowing this isn\u2019t an individual and isolated suffering, but a collective suffering.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Aur\u00e9lia Schneider, psychologist</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That meant isolation \u201ccan cause some to develop pathological angst conditions,\u201d he said. But overall, the long-term negative effects of physical isolation should be considerably lessened by the knowledge that everyone is experiencing them, said Bandelow, who has made a special study of fear.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs soon as an exceptional situation affects many people, the effect is less strong \u2026 During the war in Yugoslavia, patients who habitually suffered panic attacks were no more scared than the next person. In fact, the number of panic attacks decreased, because they were suddenly faced with other, very concrete things they had to fear. They needed to protect themselves, and so needed to have control over their bodies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Germans who suffer from angst or panic at an avalanche of coronavirus news can turn to a fear-free news service, <a href=\"https://www.angstselbsthilfe.de/angstfrei-news/\">angstfrei.news</a>, which twice a day publishes a short news overview so that they can stay informed without being overwhelmed by horror stories.</p> \n<p>French psychologists echo the importance of realising that the pain is shared. While everyone will respond differently, we all \u201chave to be able to make sense of the situation\u201d, said Aur\u00e9lia Schneider. \u201cThis will give us psychological protection. It\u2019s about knowing this isn\u2019t an individual and isolated suffering, but a collective suffering.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Spain, however, clinical psychologist Albert Soler warned against the dangers of trying to stay falsely upbeat. \u201cWhen things are bad, being pressured to be positive can be positively harmful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positivism of Instagram is dangerous at the best of times \u2013 but now it\u2019s even worse.\u201d</p> \n<p>In terms of practical advice, Europe\u2019s psychologists mainly stress the importance of staying in touch and keeping busy, if necessary with the help of daily to-do lists. In Italy, Raginelli\u2019s advice was to \u201cmaintain contact with others\u201d by every means possible and as much as possible.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"376e9c3d-016c-4773-ab24-92c1f60b2ead\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/up53FltNpsY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rosella De Leonibus, a psychologist in Perugia, said that keeping active was vitally important. What counted, she said, was \u201ceverything that\u2019s an action \u2013 with a result. Passive is no use; passivity makes you feel anxious and increases anxiety.\u201d</p> \n<p>Erik Scherder, a professor of neuropsychology at VU university in Amsterdam, said the crisis presented a challenge and an opportunity: to exercise. \u201cThe biggest gains are for those who are very sedentary,\u201d he told <a href=\"https://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20200325_04902478?articlehash=BBF42F032202527A5A91C5C7F971CA3CDFB577E5C595515F5E0B95A375A4C8A29CCB7C5F2185D09574B4BFEA6E807A8730F6683E20C5BAE341DAA79A5EDE35B4\">De Standaard.</a> \u201cWhich is most of us.\u201d</p> \n<p>Belgians, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/18/belgium-enters-lockdown-over-coronavirus-crisis-in-pictures\">went into confinement</a> on 17 March, are getting regular down-to-earth suggestions on how to live their best locked-down lives by the spokesman at the national crisis centre, Beno\u00eet Ramacker, who advises basic everyday activities such as cooking, reading, gardening and DIY.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe psycho-social dimension is very important in this crisis,\u201d Ramacker said at one briefing, urging people not to spend the whole day on social media and to establish a routine that gives structure to their days. \u201cYou can do a lot at home.\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are bound to be tensions. When the inevitable rows do break out, Jean-Luc Aubert from Nantes suggests self-isolating for a while in the bathroom. \u201cEveryone is a little anxious, so it doesn\u2019t take much for everyone to get upset, angry, worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge this, to be very careful and on our guard.\u201d</p> \n<p>Whether they have listened to the psychologists or not, millions across the continent have developed coping strategies. Gregarious by nature and used to living life outdoors, Spaniards \u2013 most of whom, like many Europeans, live in apartments \u2013 are finding solitude, silence and confinement particularly hard.</p> \n<p>Rooftop terraces have become a popular location for workouts, although not everyone has access. Many have taken to running up and down the communal staircase. One father reported that his daughter was keeping up volleyball practice at home, using a toilet roll as a ball so as to avoid breakages.</p> \n<p>Many, too, have been faced with the delicate challenge of educating elderly relatives they would habitually visit at least once a week in the use of mobile technology. \u201cI\u2019ve taught my 82-year-old mother how to make video calls,\u201d said Reme, one Barcelona resident. \u201cNow there\u2019s no stopping her.\u201d</p> \n<p>Italians, also suffering from having to lead an indoor life, cheered the world in the early stages of their confinement by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/solidarity-balcony-singing-spreads-across-italy-during-lockdown\">singing or playing musical instruments from their balconies</a> each night in a show of solidarity, although reports suggest that has tapered off over the past week.</p> \n<p>Many have now taken to doing online yoga or are sharing their fitness regimes. Others have been writing, painting, and cooking more \u2013 and sharing their recipes online. Many are joining top chef Massimo Bottura for his live <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/massimobottura/?hl=en\">Instagram show</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a masterclass, it\u2019s kitchen quarantine with our family,\u201d Bottura said. \u201cWe just want to have fun and show to the world that with a few things \u2013 a table, a few ingredients, a family \u2013 we can have fun.\u201d</p> \n<p>Simona Fabrizio, another international chef and the owner of Sagraincasa in Orvieto, Umbria, asks her followers to pick one ingredient \u2013 eggs, tuna, chicken \u2013 and create a recipe with an additional four ingredients, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B-AReoGJwzp/?igshid=1c0n9j1efa8ad\">then share their pictures</a>.</p> \n<p>In Germany, <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/wie-42-000-freizeithacker-das-virus-bekaempfen-a-b9ba7f2e-0a11-4a4c-a958-d20ac9600823\">42,000 programmers and software designers gathered online</a> for a mass hackathon. #Wirvsvirus (we against the virus) came up with possible solutions to problems including virus tracking, improving inter-hospital communication, distributing food to the homeless, and helping farmers find people to bring in the harvest, and ended with a mass party on YouTube and Slack.

      "bodyText": "In Italy they are singing and sharing recipes. In France, humour is saving the day. In Spain, communal staircases have become the new running tracks, and in Germany, ordinarily disorderly hackers are busy coding corona-busting apps. As hundreds of millions of Europeans languish in lockdown, people are finding increasingly inventive ways to keep themselves entertained \u2013 and to counter what the continent\u2019s psychologists warning are the very real risks of confinement. Like everyone else, Italy\u2019s 60 million citizens, who went into lockdown on 9 March, have been \u201casked to make sacrifices\u201d, said Sara Raginelli, a psychologist in Ancona. \u201cAnd as we live in a rather dramatic way, our mental health is being challenged.\u201d In a survey during the first week of Italy\u2019s confinement, 93% of respondents said they felt at least a little anxious, while 42% described a distinct drop in their mood and 28% reported that they were not sleeping well. Italians are entitled to a free online consultation from the health ministry, which has warned of a \u201cpsychological emergency\u201d, saying people risk being \u201coverwhelmed by fear of a insidious virus that has banned us from hugging and being close to others\u201d. Some 9,000 psychologists are involved in the #psicologionline scheme, offering phone or video consultations aimed also at countering the \u201cheartbreaking effects of the daily death toll, warlike scenes, and easy risk of infection if we don\u2019t stay home\u201d. Some degree of anxiety, of course, is only normal. Borwin Bandelow, from G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, said humans developed into social creatures to survive, so isolation was an unnatural state for most. \u201cIn the past we lived in tribes, and those who broke away from those tribes had very little chance,\u201d he told Der Spiegel. That meant isolation \u201ccan cause some to develop pathological angst conditions,\u201d he said. But overall, the long-term negative effects of physical isolation should be considerably lessened by the knowledge that everyone is experiencing them, said Bandelow, who has made a special study of fear. \u201cAs soon as an exceptional situation affects many people, the effect is less strong \u2026 During the war in Yugoslavia, patients who habitually suffered panic attacks were no more scared than the next person. In fact, the number of panic attacks decreased, because they were suddenly faced with other, very concrete things they had to fear. They needed to protect themselves, and so needed to have control over their bodies.\u201d Germans who suffer from angst or panic at an avalanche of coronavirus news can turn to a fear-free news service, angstfrei.news, which twice a day publishes a short news overview so that they can stay informed without being overwhelmed by horror stories. French psychologists echo the importance of realising that the pain is shared. While everyone will respond differently, we all \u201chave to be able to make sense of the situation\u201d, said Aur\u00e9lia Schneider. \u201cThis will give us psychological protection. It\u2019s about knowing this isn\u2019t an individual and isolated suffering, but a collective suffering.\u201d In Spain, however, clinical psychologist Albert Soler warned against the dangers of trying to stay falsely upbeat. \u201cWhen things are bad, being pressured to be positive can be positively harmful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe positivism of Instagram is dangerous at the best of times \u2013 but now it\u2019s even worse.\u201d In terms of practical advice, Europe\u2019s psychologists mainly stress the importance of staying in touch and keeping busy, if necessary with the help of daily to-do lists. In Italy, Raginelli\u2019s advice was to \u201cmaintain contact with others\u201d by every means possible and as much as possible. Rosella De Leonibus, a psychologist in Perugia, said that keeping active was vitally important. What counted, she said, was \u201ceverything that\u2019s an action \u2013 with a result. Passive is no use; passivity makes you feel anxious and increases anxiety.\u201d Erik Scherder, a professor of neuropsychology at VU university in Amsterdam, said the crisis presented a challenge and an opportunity: to exercise. \u201cThe biggest gains are for those who are very sedentary,\u201d he told De Standaard. \u201cWhich is most of us.\u201d Belgians, who went into confinement on 17 March, are getting regular down-to-earth suggestions on how to live their best locked-down lives by the spokesman at the national crisis centre, Beno\u00eet Ramacker, who advises basic everyday activities such as cooking, reading, gardening and DIY. \u201cThe psycho-social dimension is very important in this crisis,\u201d Ramacker said at one briefing, urging people not to spend the whole day on social media and to establish a routine that gives structure to their days. \u201cYou can do a lot at home.\u201d But there are bound to be tensions. When the inevitable rows do break out, Jean-Luc Aubert from Nantes suggests self-isolating for a while in the bathroom. \u201cEveryone is a little anxious, so it doesn\u2019t take much for everyone to get upset, angry, worse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to acknowledge this, to be very careful and on our guard.\u201d Whether they have listened to the psychologists or not, millions across the continent have developed coping strategies. Gregarious by nature and used to living life outdoors, Spaniards \u2013 most of whom, like many Europeans, live in apartments \u2013 are finding solitude, silence and confinement particularly hard. Rooftop terraces have become a popular location for workouts, although not everyone has access. Many have taken to running up and down the communal staircase. One father reported that his daughter was keeping up volleyball practice at home, using a toilet roll as a ball so as to avoid breakages. Many, too, have been faced with the delicate challenge of educating elderly relatives they would habitually visit at least once a week in the use of mobile technology. \u201cI\u2019ve taught my 82-year-old mother how to make video calls,\u201d said Reme, one Barcelona resident. \u201cNow there\u2019s no stopping her.\u201d Italians, also suffering from having to lead an indoor life, cheered the world in the early stages of their confinement by singing or playing musical instruments from their balconies each night in a show of solidarity, although reports suggest that has tapered off over the past week. Many have now taken to doing online yoga or are sharing their fitness regimes. Others have been writing, painting, and cooking more \u2013 and sharing their recipes online. Many are joining top chef Massimo Bottura for his live Instagram show. \u201cIt\u2019s not a masterclass, it\u2019s kitchen quarantine with our family,\u201d Bottura said. \u201cWe just want to have fun and show to the world that with a few things \u2013 a table, a few ingredients, a family \u2013 we can have fun.\u201d Simona Fabrizio, another international chef and the owner of Sagraincasa in Orvieto, Umbria, asks her followers to pick one ingredient \u2013 eggs, tuna, chicken \u2013 and create a recipe with an additional four ingredients, then share their pictures. In Germany, 42,000 programmers and software designers gathered online for a mass hackathon. #Wirvsvirus (we against the virus) came up with possible solutions to problems including virus tracking, improving inter-hospital communication, distributing food to the homeless, and helping farmers find people to bring in the harvest, and ended with a mass party on YouTube and Slack. A jury will decide which projects will be supported, with government funding guaranteed for the best. Like many across Europe, Brussels residents have taken to applauding healthcare workers at at their windows and balconies at 8pm every evening. Belgium\u2019s King Philippe flies a white flag from the Royal Palace in tribute. In France, confined since 17 March and allowed out \u2013 on pain of a heavy fine \u2013 only to shop for essentials, exercise or walk the dog, humour has \u2013 for the time being \u2013 become a mainstay of social media conversation. Comedians post a new video every day. Photoshopped images of exhausted dogs (\u201cEveryone in the apartment block has walked me today; when will it end?\u201d) abound. President Emmanuel Macron, his face digitally aged by a decade, informs the nation: \u201cCompatriots, you may now go out.\u201d A spoof tourist guidebook promises \u201cthe indispensable guide to the finest undiscovered corners of your place of residence\u201d. Videos of neighbours cycling round the balcony and flatmates playing foot-ping have gone viral while on Twitter individuals share their tales of lockdown woe: \u201cMy mother: \u2018You don\u2019t get fed up spending the whole day on your computer?\u2019 Me: \u2018I run a web marketing department.\u2019 Mother: \u2018So?\u2019\u201d tweeted one. Another lamented that after only four days of confinement, his mother could take no more: \u201cShe told me to go out \u2013 and she\u2019d pay the fine.\u201d Reporting by Angela Giuffrida, Kate Connolly, Kim Willsher, Jennifer Rankin and Stephen Burgen.",

      "bodyText": "Video conferences from a basement, glitchy internet and bouts of restlessness. Joe Biden, like the rest of America, is working from home. The former vice-president\u2019s confinement began abruptly on 10 March, when he touched down in Cleveland for a primary-night campaign event only to learn that the state\u2019s governor had called for all major indoor events to be canceled as the nation slowly grasped the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. That night, one of the most consequential of the Democratic primary, he delivered a victory speech from a nearly empty room in Philadelphia, near where his campaign is headquartered. It was his last traditional event on a campaign trail that has now changed beyond recognition. Since then Biden, a retail politician who enjoys rope lines and now-forbidden handshakes, has become an unwilling pioneer in presidential campaigning in the age of the coronavirus as the pandemic has thrown the Democratic race \u2013 and all US politics \u2013 into confusion. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook for what a former vice-president should be doing or saying in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who helped catapult the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg from obscurity to contention in the Democratic primary. \u201cWe are in uncharted waters here.\u201d Biden\u2019s campaign has converted fundraising events to virtual ones and his podium is a room in his basement in his Wilmington, Delaware, home. His public appearances are usually once-a-day televised critiques of whatever Donald Trump\u2019s administration is doing to combat the virus. His campaign has cautiously been exploring new ways to keep supporters active. But the Democratic frontrunner is still grappling with how to adapt to the new challenges. His first live-streamed town hall, on 13 March, was hampered by audio and technical difficulties. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,\u201d Biden said, his irritation evident. He then seemed to fade from the national stage, eclipsed by Trump\u2019s daily White House coronavirus briefings and by governors including Andrew Cuomo, whose daily updates on the toll of the crisis in New York have become must-watch TV for many Americans. Biden\u2019s absence inspired the Twitter hashtag #whereisJoe, which was promoted and shared by supporters of his Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, before being picked up by the Trump campaign. On a fundraising call last weekend, a Biden donor noted that Americans watch Trump every day at his briefings, events that his critics say increasingly resemble \u2013 in tone and length \u2013 the campaign rallies he has been forced to abandon. \u201cI would just love to see you more,\u201d the donor said of the Democrat. \u201cLike how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?\u201d Biden assured the donor that he was raring for a comeback: his team had installed high-speed internet and built a TV studio in his basement. Soon Biden was pushing out his message. In a matter of days the question would be: where isn\u2019t Biden? He began the week with an address from the newly outfitted recreation room, books, a lamp and memorabilia from his decades in public life behind him. The speech was followed by back-to-back TV appearances, roundtables, a virtual happy hour with young voters, the launch of a newsletter, a podcast in the works and a CNN town hall. The former vice-president has also enlisted an advisory board to counsel the campaign on the coronavirus that includes Ron Klain, who coordinated the Obama White House\u2019s Ebola response. An explainer video featuring Klain and a white board has already racked up millions of views. \u201cThe new technologies are quite effective,\u201d Biden mused to reporters on Wednesday, noting that a recent address was not carried by the national TV networks but received 3.8m views online. Yet even with the ramped-up online schedule, it can still be difficult for Biden to break through as he is overshadowed by other figures actually fighting on the frontlines. On Monday, he delivered his speech an hour earlier than advertised; it would otherwise have conflicted with a Cuomo press briefing. His interview with The View on Wednesday was pre-empted by another Cuomo briefing and a press conference with the Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser. After serving more than 30 years in the Senate and eight years as vice-president, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of watching his former colleagues \u2013 and presidential rivals \u2013 confront the pandemic while he watched from the sidelines as a private citizen with nothing but a bully pulpit at his disposal. \u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some things,\u201d Biden told reporters on video conference press call hosted by Zoom. \u201cBut I am where I am.\u201d But critics still aren\u2019t convinced that Biden is doing enough to prove that he is ready to take on Trump in November. \u201cI think that he needs to lead,\u201d Larry Cohen, the chairman of the pro-Sanders Our Revolution organization, said. \u201cHe could collaborate with Bernie, who\u2019s doing plenty, and they could lead together on an issue that unites all Democrats.

When supplies ran low she sent her teenage children to the grocery store only to discover her debit card wasn\u2019t working. She checked her account. It was thousands of dollars overdrawn. Cavalli suspected fraud and after spending hours on the phone with her bank trying to find out what happened, she was informed a court judgment had been made against her by a creditor to garnish her wages directly from her bank account for credit card debt she accrued a few years ago while her husband, who is now disabled, was experiencing a debilitating illness. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about the wage garnishment until it was posted on my account,\u201d said Cavalli. \u201cI have zero funds.

      "body": "<p>Anxiety is very much a collective experience at the moment, but how one soothes it is an individual matter. I am currently taking two approaches. The first is the somewhat meta tactic of calming myself by watching videos of celebrities calming themselves. First there was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1239383795205169152?s=20\" title=\"\">posted a video</a> of himself cuddling his ponies in his kitchen while wearing a Terminator T-shirt, looking a lot like Linus from Peanuts, clutching his security blanket while sucking his thumb, were Linus a 72-year-old Austrian-American multimillionaire. But I think my favourite so far is Sam Neill <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwoPaddocks/status/1240438128738889728?s=20\" title=\"\">showing the world</a> how he is getting through self-isolation: by washing his trainers. \u201cI made quite a discovery. I didn\u2019t realise I had so many shoes that are pretty much exactly the same,\u201d he marvels, looking at his windowsill of damp plimsolls. \u201cBut, boy do they smell good,\u201d he concludes, taking a hearty sniff of a sneaker and making the same twinkly-eyed grin of delight he once made while looking at a grazing brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park. I never thought I\u2019d derive so much pleasure from watching Sam Neill smell his own shoe, but we are living in strange times.</p> <p>Part of the reason I enjoy that Neill video is, I suspect, because of the memories he himself brings back. Specifically, the very 1990s memories of watching two of his greatest movies, The Piano and Jurassic Park, both seminal cinema experiences in their different ways. And this brings me to my main method of what a nurse in the hospital where I gave birth last year called \u201cself-soothing\u201d: the theory that mothers shouldn\u2019t pick their baby up and stick a breast in its mouth every time it cries, but rather teach it to self-soothe.

      "bodyText": "Anxiety is very much a collective experience at the moment, but how one soothes it is an individual matter. I am currently taking two approaches. The first is the somewhat meta tactic of calming myself by watching videos of celebrities calming themselves. First there was Arnold Schwarzenegger, who posted a video of himself cuddling his ponies in his kitchen while wearing a Terminator T-shirt, looking a lot like Linus from Peanuts, clutching his security blanket while sucking his thumb, were Linus a 72-year-old Austrian-American multimillionaire. But I think my favourite so far is Sam Neill showing the world how he is getting through self-isolation: by washing his trainers. \u201cI made quite a discovery. I didn\u2019t realise I had so many shoes that are pretty much exactly the same,\u201d he marvels, looking at his windowsill of damp plimsolls. \u201cBut, boy do they smell good,\u201d he concludes, taking a hearty sniff of a sneaker and making the same twinkly-eyed grin of delight he once made while looking at a grazing brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park. I never thought I\u2019d derive so much pleasure from watching Sam Neill smell his own shoe, but we are living in strange times. Part of the reason I enjoy that Neill video is, I suspect, because of the memories he himself brings back. Specifically, the very 1990s memories of watching two of his greatest movies, The Piano and Jurassic Park, both seminal cinema experiences in their different ways. And this brings me to my main method of what a nurse in the hospital where I gave birth last year called \u201cself-soothing\u201d: the theory that mothers shouldn\u2019t pick their baby up and stick a breast in its mouth every time it cries, but rather teach it to self-soothe. Well, my baby has yet to master this trick, but I have been learning to self-soothe this week by suckling on 90s pop culture. Ever since the world came to a slow and then jarring and shocking halt, I have been listening to 90s American music: the canon, of course (Nirvana, Alanis Morissette, Macy Gray, Lauryn Hill, The Notorious BIG, A Tribe Called Quest, Britney Spears, \u2018NSync and Backstreet Boys), but also the less enduring likes of Spin Doctors, Lisa Loeb and K-Ci &amp; Jojo.

      "bodyText": "Across Los Angeles, the air is fresh and unpolluted, the freeways are empty and there\u2019s plenty of parking. The unprecedented shutdown of the entire region feels like Christmas Day on repeat, except instead of staying at home to celebrate, people are staying inside to remain alive. \u201cIt\u2019s a ghost town,\u201d said Gregory Johnson, 23, who was walking by the deserted Venice Beach boardwalk with his six-year-old daughter on Thursday, a week after LA closed all school campuses, shutting down the second-largest school district in the US. \u201cEverybody\u2019s paranoid. People are just terrified of even saying hello.\u201d The two had been watching nonstop TV, but now were hoping to find a taqueria that was still doing takeout, Johnson said as he squirted hand sanitizer on to his daughter\u2019s hands: \u201cI decided to come outside today with hella Germ-X.\u201d Los Angeles last week shut down all non-essential activities and ordered residents to shelter in place in an effort to slow the coronavirus spread. By Friday, the Covid-19 death toll in LA county had increased to 26, with more than 1,400 confirmed cases and projections of much worse to come. \u201cIt feels like a bad sci-fi movie \u2013 like a Sharknado but it\u2019s a virus,\u201d said Kat Williams, a 35-year-old LA chef who runs a Jamaican catering business, but is now isolating and only going on brief neighborhood walks. The tight restrictions in LA came after Bay Area officials enacted the country\u2019s first shelter-in-place order and the same day California\u2019s governor directed people across the state to stay home as much as possible. Some Angelenos responded to the mass closures by taking a break at local beaches and popular hiking spots, creating crowds large enough that days later officials were forced to shut down access and close beach parking. At Griffith Park, with its views of the famed Hollywood sign, the city put plastic bags over public binoculars, eventually closed trails and sent police officers out on bikes. \u201cIt feels weird,\u201d said Andres Ralda, 23, wearing a wetsuit and on a break from surfing in Venice on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s less crowded than usual, but everyone is out and about.\u201d His restaurant business was now on hold and he didn\u2019t want to stay inside his apartment for hours: \u201cI\u2019ve been surfing every day. But I try to keep my space. I don\u2019t talk to people.\u201d Walking past the shuttered street vendors and ice cream stands along the boardwalk, Charles Melendez, 62, said he\u2019s living out of his car nearby and hadn\u2019t changed his routine: \u201cThe beach seems normal. It\u2019s not like there are dead bodies in the street.\u201d But, he added, \u201cI can cross the street without getting hit by a car.\u201d With no end in sight to the shutdowns, restaurants workers, taco stand owners, actors, retail workers and others in this city that loves its dining, shopping and nightlife were coming to terms with the terrifying realities of lost wages and April rent. \u201cEverything is absurd and unstable,\u201d said Sasha Jones, 32-year-old manager of Cuties, an East Hollywood queer coffee shop that has stayed open with limited hours. \u201cI feel bad encouraging people to come in and shop. I know we\u2019re all struggling right now, but people have been showing up.\u201d As an LGBTQ+ community space, it was sad to transition Cuties into takeout-only, she said: \u201c It\u2019s hard when the regulars come in that I would usually hug. There\u2019s this strange energy. Nobody knows how to move or be any more.\u201d Jones has been organizing meditation and other online events on Cuties\u2019 Instagram in replacement of in-person events. Williams, the Jamaican chef, who has done popups at Cuties, said they didn\u2019t know how they would survive with their entire income gone overnight: \u201cMy landlord is giving me options, but none of them seem feasible.\u201d Williams is isolating with their girlfriend and her eight-year-old daughter, and they have been focusing on home-schooling and other home projects: \u201cWe\u2019ve been borderline doomsday preppers.

      "body": "<p>If everything went as well for Halesowen Town as planned, their time spent in the Southern League Division One Central would have been over in a flash. After years of struggling in the division above, last season they were finally relegated. The failure prompted a complete rehauling of the team, with an entirely new set of players and a new head coach brought in. It worked. By March they sat second, one point off the top with a game in hand, well on course for promotion.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, all those hopes and expectations dissolved. After weeks of postponements because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Football Association finally announced in conjunction with the National League System that all leagues from steps three to six were cancelled. All results have been \u201cexpunged\u201d and no teams will face promotion or relegation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/all-english-football-below-national-league-level-to-be-voided\">FA decision to cancel seasons beneath National League provokes anger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Halesowen\u2019s head coach, Paul Smith, asserted that public health was the priority, he could not hide his disappointment. After 27 league games completed, 71% of the league season, in official terms their effort had been reduced to nothing.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible situation for us and the statement that came out from the FA has put us all in a horrible place right now because the work and effort that\u2019s gone in all season,\u201d said Smith. \u201cFrom the work that\u2019s gone in from behind the scenes to the owners and the board to my management staff and then the players, for it to be wiped away in a couple of sentences, it is very difficult to take.\u201d</p> <p>A total of 45 leagues are affected and all of the clubs flitting towards promotion have been charged with coming to terms with the irrelevance of their efforts.

      "bodyText": "If everything went as well for Halesowen Town as planned, their time spent in the Southern League Division One Central would have been over in a flash. After years of struggling in the division above, last season they were finally relegated. The failure prompted a complete rehauling of the team, with an entirely new set of players and a new head coach brought in. It worked. By March they sat second, one point off the top with a game in hand, well on course for promotion. On Thursday afternoon, all those hopes and expectations dissolved. After weeks of postponements because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Football Association finally announced in conjunction with the National League System that all leagues from steps three to six were cancelled. All results have been \u201cexpunged\u201d and no teams will face promotion or relegation. Although Halesowen\u2019s head coach, Paul Smith, asserted that public health was the priority, he could not hide his disappointment. After 27 league games completed, 71% of the league season, in official terms their effort had been reduced to nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible situation for us and the statement that came out from the FA has put us all in a horrible place right now because the work and effort that\u2019s gone in all season,\u201d said Smith. \u201cFrom the work that\u2019s gone in from behind the scenes to the owners and the board to my management staff and then the players, for it to be wiped away in a couple of sentences, it is very difficult to take.\u201d A total of 45 leagues are affected and all of the clubs flitting towards promotion have been charged with coming to terms with the irrelevance of their efforts. However, Halesowen\u2019s success presents a unique predicament. This season they have pieced together a delirious, unexpected run to the semi-finals of the FA Trophy.

      "body": "<p>This week, as citizens in countries across the world isolate themselves to combat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>, Lionel Richie, who co-wrote the 1985 USA for Africa charity mega-single We Are the World with Michael Jackson, <a href=\"https://people.com/music/lionel-richie-we-are-the-world-for-coronavirus-victims/\">told People magazine</a> that he was revisiting the kitsch anthem that reportedly raised more than $75m (\u00a361.1m) for Ethiopian famine relief. Richie is still proud of the central line of World\u2019s chorus, \u201cThere\u2019s a choice we\u2019re making \u2013 we\u2019re saving our own lives,\u201d which he says has new relevance in the time of Covid-19. \u201cWhat happened in China, in Europe, it came here [to America],\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if we don\u2019t save our brothers there, it\u2019s going to come home. It\u2019s all of us. All of us are in this together.\u201d</p> <p>To his credit, Richie is leery of openly celebrating the 35th birthday of the song, released on 7 March 1985. \u201cTwo weeks ago, we said we didn\u2019t want to do too much [about the song] because this is not the time to sell an anniversary,\u201d he told People. \u201cBut the message is so clear \u2026 every time I try and write another message, I write those same words.\u201d</p> <p>Richie\u2019s heart is in the right place \u2013 the world could use more supra-national fellow feeling during a pandemic \u2013 and he has not yet begun rounding up stars for a new version presumably spliced together from home recordings. Surely such a reboot couldn\u2019t be worse than the recent, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/mar/19/gal-gadot-celeb-friends-singing-self-isolation-jared-leto\">awful, multi-superstar video-selfie singalong to John Lennon\u2019s Imagine</a>? But idle hands are the devil\u2019s playthings, and before the stir-crazy, homebound Richie starts texting the luminaries in his phone book, he might want to remember the last time We Are the World was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/02/we-are-the-world-haiti\">revived, in 2010</a>. Heck, he might want to remember the suspicion that greeted the song in 1985.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AjkUyX0rVw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9AjkUyX0rVw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>USA for Africa: We Are the World \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>From the start, World\u2019s motives were not entirely pure. It was America\u2019s response to an implied dare. As I chronicled in an episode of my podcast <a href=\"https://slate.com/podcasts/hit-parade\">Hit Parade</a> about <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/culturegabfest/2017/07/the_rise_and_fall_of_the_charity_megasingle.html\">the history of the charity mega-single</a>, the whole reason artist manager Ken Kragen and musician and social activist Harry Belafonte mounted USA for Africa was to imitate \u2013 and better \u2013 Band Aid\u2019s 1984 UK benefit record <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/nov/15/band-aid-in-defence-of-its-legacy\">Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?</a> Bob Geldof, co-writer of Christmas? and instigator of Band Aid, made the dare to America plain, by travelling to Los Angeles the night of the We Are the World recording to lecture the Yanks on the horrors of Ethiopian famine and their obligation to record. Reportedly, Geldof\u2019s sermon so freaked out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/michaeljackson\">Michael Jackson</a> that <a href=\"https://www.inquisitr.com/2097568/michael-jackson-allegedly-hid-in-the-bathroom-after-bob-geldof-rant-during-we-are-the-world-recording/\">he hid in the toilet</a>.</p> <p>On release, World was a <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/we-are-the-world-a-minute-by-minute-breakdown-54619/\">smashing success</a> \u2013 four weeks at No 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/we-are-the-world-a-minute-by-minute-breakdown-54619/\">8m copies</a> sold in the States alone \u2013 but even at the time it was not without its detractors. The very line Richie cherishes, \u201cWe\u2019re saving our own lives\u201d, was called out as nakedly self-serving, enshrining the idea that Americans could only be moved to help others if the effort helped themselves. That idea was even baked into the song\u2019s title. Of course, Band Aid\u2019s holiday chestnut had earned its own criticism the previous year, particularly for the Geldof-penned line sung by Bono: \u201cTonight thank God it\u2019s them instead of you\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking as a pop fan, I have affection for both singles, but the truly damning thing about them is their legacy. First, there was the raft of massed-celebrity recordings that followed in their wake, including a bizarre 1986 song-cum\u2013human chain, Hands Across America, that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/24/us-review-jordan-peele-lupita-nyongo\">Jordan Peele</a> rightly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/movies/us-hands-across-america.html\">satirised last year in his movie Us</a>; and culminating in a pair of competing 1991 singles during the first Gulf war that were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyzSk8HVZTc\">jumbled</a> and essentially <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol6vr5_CY1o\">meaningless</a> \u2013 so meaningless that The Simpsons parodied the trend in 1992 with the brilliantly savage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbhiLbT_yGo\">We\u2019re Sending Our Love Down the Well</a>, which killed off charity mega-singles for the rest of the 90s.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbhiLbT_yGo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nbhiLbT_yGo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Simpsons: We\u2019re Sending Our Love Down the Well \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Second, and arguably worse than the wave of imitative recordings, were the limp remakes of the original two songs. Geldof has been the worst repeat offender, rebooting Christmas three times. Each time \u2013 in 1989, 2004 and 2014 \u2013 the new version has topped the British chart, regardless of whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZjb3YEUQ8\">Bros and Jason Donovan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOKTW6Zt_cU\">Chris Martin and Dido</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w7jyVHocTk\">Bastille and Sam Smith</a> doing the singing. Indeed, three of the four versions have been <a href=\"https://slate.com/culture/2018/12/the-annual-contest-to-score-the-u-k-christmas-no-1.html\">the UK Christmas No 1</a> (only the 2014 edition peaked too soon).

      "bodyText": "This week, as citizens in countries across the world isolate themselves to combat coronavirus, Lionel Richie, who co-wrote the 1985 USA for Africa charity mega-single We Are the World with Michael Jackson, told People magazine that he was revisiting the kitsch anthem that reportedly raised more than $75m (\u00a361.1m) for Ethiopian famine relief. Richie is still proud of the central line of World\u2019s chorus, \u201cThere\u2019s a choice we\u2019re making \u2013 we\u2019re saving our own lives,\u201d which he says has new relevance in the time of Covid-19. \u201cWhat happened in China, in Europe, it came here [to America],\u201d he said. \u201cSo, if we don\u2019t save our brothers there, it\u2019s going to come home. It\u2019s all of us. All of us are in this together.\u201d To his credit, Richie is leery of openly celebrating the 35th birthday of the song, released on 7 March 1985. \u201cTwo weeks ago, we said we didn\u2019t want to do too much [about the song] because this is not the time to sell an anniversary,\u201d he told People. \u201cBut the message is so clear \u2026 every time I try and write another message, I write those same words.\u201d Richie\u2019s heart is in the right place \u2013 the world could use more supra-national fellow feeling during a pandemic \u2013 and he has not yet begun rounding up stars for a new version presumably spliced together from home recordings. Surely such a reboot couldn\u2019t be worse than the recent, awful, multi-superstar video-selfie singalong to John Lennon\u2019s Imagine? But idle hands are the devil\u2019s playthings, and before the stir-crazy, homebound Richie starts texting the luminaries in his phone book, he might want to remember the last time We Are the World was revived, in 2010. Heck, he might want to remember the suspicion that greeted the song in 1985. From the start, World\u2019s motives were not entirely pure. It was America\u2019s response to an implied dare. As I chronicled in an episode of my podcast Hit Parade about the history of the charity mega-single, the whole reason artist manager Ken Kragen and musician and social activist Harry Belafonte mounted USA for Africa was to imitate \u2013 and better \u2013 Band Aid\u2019s 1984 UK benefit record Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas? Bob Geldof, co-writer of Christmas? and instigator of Band Aid, made the dare to America plain, by travelling to Los Angeles the night of the We Are the World recording to lecture the Yanks on the horrors of Ethiopian famine and their obligation to record. Reportedly, Geldof\u2019s sermon so freaked out Michael Jackson that he hid in the toilet. On release, World was a smashing success \u2013 four weeks at No 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, 8m copies sold in the States alone \u2013 but even at the time it was not without its detractors. The very line Richie cherishes, \u201cWe\u2019re saving our own lives\u201d, was called out as nakedly self-serving, enshrining the idea that Americans could only be moved to help others if the effort helped themselves. That idea was even baked into the song\u2019s title. Of course, Band Aid\u2019s holiday chestnut had earned its own criticism the previous year, particularly for the Geldof-penned line sung by Bono: \u201cTonight thank God it\u2019s them instead of you\u201d. Speaking as a pop fan, I have affection for both singles, but the truly damning thing about them is their legacy. First, there was the raft of massed-celebrity recordings that followed in their wake, including a bizarre 1986 song-cum\u2013human chain, Hands Across America, that Jordan Peele rightly satirised last year in his movie Us; and culminating in a pair of competing 1991 singles during the first Gulf war that were jumbled and essentially meaningless \u2013 so meaningless that The Simpsons parodied the trend in 1992 with the brilliantly savage We\u2019re Sending Our Love Down the Well, which killed off charity mega-singles for the rest of the 90s.

And, each time, proceeds from the latest Band Aid track have gone to a good cause, but it\u2019s always African charity roulette: benefiting Sudan\u2019s troubled Darfur region in 2004, or the Ebola crisis in 2014.

      "body": "<p>The surging popularity of Instagram Live streaming has allowed celebrities to continue receiving their necessary fixes of attention, even while in self-isolation. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/23/rappers-coronavirus-cardi-b-dj-imarkkeyz\">hip-hop</a> and R&amp;B stars, a bunch of people particularly resistant to PR training, have stepped up to the plate.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how they\u2019re passing the time during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Cardi B delivers lectures on socialism \u2026 and spreads misinformation</strong></h2> <p>Cardi B has been holding regular live streams that feel like reality show confessionals meet presidential press briefings. The boisterous rants have led many to call Cardi the new president, an epithet she basks in. In the sessions, you can find her lamenting her current diet (\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be eating cereal! I should be in a restaurant <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FRANKIETWT/status/1242644897708027911\">eating sushi right now</a>\u201d), calling for expansions of Medicare and unemployment benefits, and accusing celebrities of enjoying easier access to coronavirus tests. All while frequently wearing a bedazzled face mask inside her Atlanta mansion.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Cardi\u2019s lectures can occasionally veer off course and become more InfoWars than CNN. During one, she briefly indulged in rumors, spread within China, that the US or another superpower had planted Covid-19 in China. \u201cA lot of people owe money to China, y\u2019all,\u201d she said. Before that, she wondered if the government was paying celebrities to say they have coronavirus. Why they would do so Cardi never made clear and, after days of pondering on this wild, off-the-cuff accusation, I still can\u2019t come up with an explanation, because the last thing Miss Rona needs is more publicity. Regardless, Cardi is not concerned with the morality of such an elaborate conspiracy theory \u2013 she simply wants a check too. \u201cIf you are \u2026 pay me too!\u201d she pleaded to the government, implying she would be willing to lie about having the virus. \u201cBitch tryna get paid.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242629195517362176\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Cardi B calls out celebrities &amp; the government:<br><br>\u201cIf [Trump] is saying \u2018if you don\u2019t have any symptoms of the Coronavirus do not get tested because we don\u2019t have enough tests\u2019 but a celebrity is saying \u2018I don\u2019t have symptoms but I got tested &amp; I\u2019m positive\u2019 that causes confusion\u201d <a href=\"https://t.co/VgKFqIBH8h\">pic.twitter.com/VgKFqIBH8h</a></p>&mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1242629195517362176?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2><strong>Lil Yachty creates his own virtual Fear Factor game</strong></h2> <p>Rapper Lil Yachty loves a good laugh \u2026 at the expense of his own fans. Yachty, who first found fame through Soundcloud and Instagram, paid fans to perform bizarre acts for his amusement. \u201cErase it,\u201d he joked as a fan vigorously shaved their eyebrow off for the meager price of $200. Then the stream took a dark and abusive turn as fans ate items including condoms, shaving cream, deodorant and dog food. Lil Yachty called the entire affair a \u201ctalent show\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The surging popularity of Instagram Live streaming has allowed celebrities to continue receiving their necessary fixes of attention, even while in self-isolation. And hip-hop and R&amp;B stars, a bunch of people particularly resistant to PR training, have stepped up to the plate. Here\u2019s how they\u2019re passing the time during the coronavirus pandemic. Cardi B delivers lectures on socialism \u2026 and spreads misinformation Cardi B has been holding regular live streams that feel like reality show confessionals meet presidential press briefings. The boisterous rants have led many to call Cardi the new president, an epithet she basks in. In the sessions, you can find her lamenting her current diet (\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be eating cereal! I should be in a restaurant eating sushi right now\u201d), calling for expansions of Medicare and unemployment benefits, and accusing celebrities of enjoying easier access to coronavirus tests. All while frequently wearing a bedazzled face mask inside her Atlanta mansion. Unfortunately, Cardi\u2019s lectures can occasionally veer off course and become more InfoWars than CNN. During one, she briefly indulged in rumors, spread within China, that the US or another superpower had planted Covid-19 in China. \u201cA lot of people owe money to China, y\u2019all,\u201d she said. Before that, she wondered if the government was paying celebrities to say they have coronavirus. Why they would do so Cardi never made clear and, after days of pondering on this wild, off-the-cuff accusation, I still can\u2019t come up with an explanation, because the last thing Miss Rona needs is more publicity. Regardless, Cardi is not concerned with the morality of such an elaborate conspiracy theory \u2013 she simply wants a check too. \u201cIf you are \u2026 pay me too!\u201d she pleaded to the government, implying she would be willing to lie about having the virus. \u201cBitch tryna get paid.\u201d Lil Yachty creates his own virtual Fear Factor game Rapper Lil Yachty loves a good laugh \u2026 at the expense of his own fans. Yachty, who first found fame through Soundcloud and Instagram, paid fans to perform bizarre acts for his amusement. \u201cErase it,\u201d he joked as a fan vigorously shaved their eyebrow off for the meager price of $200. Then the stream took a dark and abusive turn as fans ate items including condoms, shaving cream, deodorant and dog food. Lil Yachty called the entire affair a \u201ctalent show\u201d. Sadistic would have been a better word. Tory Lanez\u2019s IG Live becomes a strip club Perhaps we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that someone who has written multiple odes to butts has appointed himself the judge of a twerking competition. Tory Lanez channeled Billy Porter in the FX series Pose and MC-ed his female fans \u201cbending it over\u201d for over 30K viewers. Twerking can be an empowering experience. However, this IG Live featured plain old-fashioned objectification and sexism as Lanez pressured female fans to lift up their skirts and \u201cclap that ass\u201d for the internet. Toxic.

Don\u2019t be around people, and [for] people that are in recovery, that\u2019s like a recipe for disaster,\u201d said Denny Kolsch, a licensed mental health counselor, who is in recovery, and founded a mental health and addiction <a href=\"https://peace.club/\">treatment facility in Florida</a>.</p> <p>Although it\u2019s only been a few weeks since local and state governments in the United States started taking drastic measures to limit the spread of the virus, health professionals have already seen relapses or near-relapses as people experience more urges and cravings to use drugs and alcohol.</p> <p>Kolsch said one person relapsed on fentanyl and heroin after losing their new job when their workplace suddenly shuttered. And in every group therapy session over the last two weeks, the conversation has turned to Covid-19 \u2013 \u201cEvery single one of \u2019em,\u201d Kolsch said.</p> <p>Elie G Aoun, <a href=\"https://www.eliegaounmd.com/\">a psychiatrist</a> who serves as vice-chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s council on addiction psychiatry, was surprised to discover that one of his patients had filled a prescription for oxycodone even as he was prescribing a treatment for addiction to the drug.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that this is because of the coronavirus crisis, but the social distancing and the isolation that this person was experiencing is what he used as an excuse to justify why he did that,\u201d Aoun said.</p> <p>On the flip side, mental health professionals feared that people would be forced into abstinence because of supply chain disruptions, potentially suffering lethal withdrawals or overdosing when they use again.</p> <p>Under normal circumstances, Americans dealing with addiction rely heavily on their community and routine for support when they decide to get sober. But now, there\u2019s no gym, no coffees with friends or sponsors, and few in-person gatherings.</p> <p>Workers, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/us-unemployment-coronavirus-hospitality-food-industries-claims\">are getting laid off in droves</a>, and some people are spending most of their day cooped up with their significant others, sometimes while fighting or experiencing abuse.</p> <p>Others are completely on their own. One of Aoun\u2019s patients, who is sitting at home not talking to anyone, is feeling more and more depressed, a major trigger for his alcohol use and gambling, Aoun said.</p> <p>Andrea St Clair, a mental health and substance use disorder professional at an outpatient program in Seattle, worried about people who may be missing even the most mundane interactions such as handshakes or hugs.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a time where people are subject to having more thoughts, more triggers, more urges,\u201d St Clair said.</p> <p>The excessive downtime right now \u201cis not helping,\u201d said Jimmy Hamm, who owns a <a href=\"https://www.thebridgenyc.net/\">sober living home in New York City</a>. Usually, he tries to fill his clients\u2019 schedules so they\u2019re busy and out of the house most of the time. Now, though, his Manhattan residence is in the middle of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/new-york-andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-cases\">Covid-19 global hotspot</a>, and because of the virus, he\u2019s not even allowing the men he works with to go on walks without a staff member.</p> <p>\u201cWe keep telling them, \u2018listen, we\u2019re not punishing you. Listen, we\u2019re all suffering here. But be grateful that you all have each other,\u201d Hamm said.</p> <p>Even so, Hamm makes sure that his clients attend meetings \u2013 one at his sober home and two by video every day. With social distancing and self-isolation, support groups, meetings and mental health professionals have mostly moved online.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to acknowledge how hard this moment is, but we also want to encourage people to take advantage of the <a href=\"https://twloha.com/self-care/support-groups/\">resources and solutions</a> that are still available,\u201d said Jamie Tworkowski, founder of <a href=\"https://twloha.com/\">To Write Love on Her Arms</a>, a not-for-profit that in part helps people struggling with addiction. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to think, \u2018Oh, I just can\u2019t get any help right now because I\u2019m alone in my house.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The jury\u2019s still out on whether telehealth and online recovery resources on such a massive scale can effectively replace in-person contact for addiction treatment. At least two patients have told Aoun that they don\u2019t want to use his new online platform, and even if people do seek care or support, some of them may have additional screens in view, pulling their attention from the group they\u2019ve joined virtually, St Clair said.</p> <p>Some of Hamm\u2019s clients are tuning out during the virtual meetings, he said. Others seem to enjoy them. Regardless, Hamm didn\u2019t know what people would be doing without that lifeline.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, to be honest, I have a mixed bag about it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only option we have.\u201d</p>",

One of Aoun\u2019s patients, who is sitting at home not talking to anyone, is feeling more and more depressed, a major trigger for his alcohol use and gambling, Aoun said. Andrea St Clair, a mental health and substance use disorder professional at an outpatient program in Seattle, worried about people who may be missing even the most mundane interactions such as handshakes or hugs. \u201cI think it\u2019s definitely a time where people are subject to having more thoughts, more triggers, more urges,\u201d St Clair said. The excessive downtime right now \u201cis not helping,\u201d said Jimmy Hamm, who owns a sober living home in New York City. Usually, he tries to fill his clients\u2019 schedules so they\u2019re busy and out of the house most of the time. Now, though, his Manhattan residence is in the middle of a Covid-19 global hotspot, and because of the virus, he\u2019s not even allowing the men he works with to go on walks without a staff member. \u201cWe keep telling them, \u2018listen, we\u2019re not punishing you. Listen, we\u2019re all suffering here. But be grateful that you all have each other,\u201d Hamm said. Even so, Hamm makes sure that his clients attend meetings \u2013 one at his sober home and two by video every day. With social distancing and self-isolation, support groups, meetings and mental health professionals have mostly moved online. \u201cWe want to acknowledge how hard this moment is, but we also want to encourage people to take advantage of the resources and solutions that are still available,\u201d said Jamie Tworkowski, founder of To Write Love on Her Arms, a not-for-profit that in part helps people struggling with addiction. \u201cWe don\u2019t want anyone to think, \u2018Oh, I just can\u2019t get any help right now because I\u2019m alone in my house.\u2019\u201d The jury\u2019s still out on whether telehealth and online recovery resources on such a massive scale can effectively replace in-person contact for addiction treatment. At least two patients have told Aoun that they don\u2019t want to use his new online platform, and even if people do seek care or support, some of them may have additional screens in view, pulling their attention from the group they\u2019ve joined virtually, St Clair said. Some of Hamm\u2019s clients are tuning out during the virtual meetings, he said. Others seem to enjoy them. Regardless, Hamm didn\u2019t know what people would be doing without that lifeline. \u201cI mean, to be honest, I have a mixed bag about it, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s the only option we have.\u201d",

A black and red accordion stands among the overturned pews, children\u2019s belongings are strewn across the floor, and a Bible \u2013 open at the Book of Revelation \u2013 rests on the wooden pulpit. Below it, seven crosses have been etched into the green moss of the floor. When police arrived at the indigenous village of Alto Terr\u00f3n on 14 January, they found 15 villagers tied up next to the carcass of a sacrificed goat. They had been beaten with machetes and Bibles, and some had their tongues burned with hot embers in attempt to \u201crid them of the devil\u201d. In a shallow grave nearby lay the bodies of seven other victims, including Bellin Flores, 33 \u2013 who was pregnant - and her five children. \u201cThey came for my family armed with wire and machetes and they rounded them up like chickens,\u201d Flores\u2019s husband, Josu\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez, told the Guardian. His six-year-old son had managed to escape and warn Gonz\u00e1lez, who was working in a nearby village. \u201cI alerted the authorities, but they didn\u2019t have the capacity to enter the area that evening,\u201d he said, hugging the boy close. By the time the officers reached the village, the violent exorcism ritual at the Nueva Luz de Dios \u2013 New Light of God \u2013 sect was well into its fourth day. Local villagers, members of the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 indigenous group, are adamant that \u2013 were it not for a long history of state abandonment \u2013 lives could have been saved. Panama has the highest GDP per capita in Latin America; its extreme poverty rate is just 6.6%, but in the Ng\u00e4be-Bugl\u00e9 comarca \u2013 semi-autonomous indigenous region \u2013 that figure is 96%. In Alto Terr\u00f3n, there was no police presence or healthcare facilities.

According to the police\u2019s investigating office, Rafael Baloyes, one of Pl\u00e1tano\u2019s sons claimed to have had a \u201cdivine revelation\u201d that the group needed to perform an exorcism on the people of Alto Terr\u00f3n and, \u201cif they showed no evidence that the evil had left their body then they should end their lives\u201d. \u201cI could hear them singing and praying from my house,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez. \u201cThe noises they made were frightening, but I never imagined they would go this far.\u201d When the rituals turned violent, the response by other villagers and the Panamanian authorities was complicated by an absence of local police and health services \u2013 and the village\u2019s isolation. The first injured victims of the ceremony approached the village\u2019s cacique, or leader, Evangelisto Santo, on 11 January, but he had to wait till the next day to escort them to the nearest town, R\u00edo Luis \u2013 an hour\u2019s hike down a steep, muddy track, and then a two-hour canoe trip away.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes being a journalist means having to improvise. It was Sunday 23 February when Italy announced draconian measures to stop people leaving or entering 11 towns that had been put under quarantine - 10 in the Lombardy region and one in Veneto. I got up early that day to hike around Lake Albano in Castel Gandolfo, about 40 minutes by train from Rome. I had left home more prepared for the possibility of needing to work \u2013 bringing with me a notepad and pen \u2013 than I did for the hike. </p> <p>Sure enough, 20 minutes into the walk the announcement came. I stopped, found a spot by the lake, and wrote the first 600 words that began the Guardian\u2019s coverage of Italy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/23/italy-draconian-measures-effort-halt-coronavirus-outbreak-spread\">coronavirus outbreak</a>. Fortunately, I have a robust smartphone. Sitting by the lake, I had a feeling that life as we knew it had stopped. By the end of that day, three people had died of the virus and 152 were infected.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-reporting-guardian-fear-threat-disease\">Reporting on coronavirus: 'fear is almost as great a threat as the disease'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We knew Covid-19 had made it to Italy in late January, when two Chinese tourists in Rome were confirmed to have contracted it. \u201cNo more masks\u201d signs started to appear on the windows of chemists; my neighbour in Rome began disinfecting the banisters of the building\u2019s stairwell and door handles. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said one morning, smoking a cigarette. I chalked most of this up to paranoia, not quite grasping that something that was happening so far away in China could reach Europe.</p> <p>So when the outbreak suddenly emerged, it caught most of us off guard. As with any major breaking news story, a journalist\u2019s first instinct is to get to the scene quickly. In recent years, I\u2019ve covered an earthquake, an avalanche and the collapse of Genoa\u2019s Morandi bridge. All of those were tragedies that had a profound impact, but they were also ones in which the cause of the events and level of destruction was known and clearly visible. Covering the coronavirus outbreak, especially in the early stages, has been different in the sense that the threat is there, but cannot be seen or properly understood. Coverage needs more caution and planning.</p> <p>With journalists unable to cross into the quarantined towns, the closest I got to the centre of the outbreak was Milan. That was on 25 February. I was fairly relaxed, worrying most about meeting my deadline. This time I had my computer with me, and filed the story from the foyer of a hotel close to the cathedral. A group of tourists were sitting nearby, coughing repeatedly. Did they have coronavirus? I became hypervigilant for potential symptoms.</p> <p>Since then, most of my reporting has been done by phone, as the country rapidly shut down.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/italys-coronavirus-death-toll-rises\">death toll and number of people infected kept going up</a>. However, the high number of those recovering, including the two Chinese tourists, was reassuring. Three people I spoke to who had recovered said their symptoms were mild. My first insight <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/this-is-surreal-italian-towns-struggle-under-coronavirus-lockdown\">into the virus\u2019s real destructiveness</a> only came when I spoke to Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda, one of the first Lombardy towns under quarantine, on 6 March. The town lost 18 citizens in less than two weeks, one of them a 55-year-old man who had no known underlying health issues. Three of the town\u2019s five doctors were in quarantine, the other two hospitalised with the virus. \u201cWe have many people with a fever who are at home and who are unable to be visited by a doctor,\u201d Pesatori said.<br></p> <p>Still, at that point, the voices \u2013 including some medics \u2013 saying \u201cthis is no worse than flu\u201d or \u201cmillions die of flu\u201d were louder than the voices of people such as Pesatori. The media came under attack. In one post shared on Facebook, coronavirus was described as \u201ca godsend\u201d for journalists who were using it to enjoy a moment in the limelight. Seeing friends who run small businesses in Italy worrying about their livelihoods, I felt guilty. Was I being irresponsible? But the more I wrote, the more I learned about the virus.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes being a journalist means having to improvise. It was Sunday 23 February when Italy announced draconian measures to stop people leaving or entering 11 towns that had been put under quarantine - 10 in the Lombardy region and one in Veneto. I got up early that day to hike around Lake Albano in Castel Gandolfo, about 40 minutes by train from Rome. I had left home more prepared for the possibility of needing to work \u2013 bringing with me a notepad and pen \u2013 than I did for the hike. Sure enough, 20 minutes into the walk the announcement came. I stopped, found a spot by the lake, and wrote the first 600 words that began the Guardian\u2019s coverage of Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, I have a robust smartphone. Sitting by the lake, I had a feeling that life as we knew it had stopped. By the end of that day, three people had died of the virus and 152 were infected. We knew Covid-19 had made it to Italy in late January, when two Chinese tourists in Rome were confirmed to have contracted it. \u201cNo more masks\u201d signs started to appear on the windows of chemists; my neighbour in Rome began disinfecting the banisters of the building\u2019s stairwell and door handles. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said one morning, smoking a cigarette. I chalked most of this up to paranoia, not quite grasping that something that was happening so far away in China could reach Europe. So when the outbreak suddenly emerged, it caught most of us off guard. As with any major breaking news story, a journalist\u2019s first instinct is to get to the scene quickly. In recent years, I\u2019ve covered an earthquake, an avalanche and the collapse of Genoa\u2019s Morandi bridge. All of those were tragedies that had a profound impact, but they were also ones in which the cause of the events and level of destruction was known and clearly visible. Covering the coronavirus outbreak, especially in the early stages, has been different in the sense that the threat is there, but cannot be seen or properly understood. Coverage needs more caution and planning. With journalists unable to cross into the quarantined towns, the closest I got to the centre of the outbreak was Milan. That was on 25 February. I was fairly relaxed, worrying most about meeting my deadline. This time I had my computer with me, and filed the story from the foyer of a hotel close to the cathedral. A group of tourists were sitting nearby, coughing repeatedly. Did they have coronavirus? I became hypervigilant for potential symptoms. Since then, most of my reporting has been done by phone, as the country rapidly shut down. The death toll and number of people infected kept going up. However, the high number of those recovering, including the two Chinese tourists, was reassuring. Three people I spoke to who had recovered said their symptoms were mild. My first insight into the virus\u2019s real destructiveness only came when I spoke to Costantino Pesatori, the mayor of Castiglione d\u2019Adda, one of the first Lombardy towns under quarantine, on 6 March. The town lost 18 citizens in less than two weeks, one of them a 55-year-old man who had no known underlying health issues. Three of the town\u2019s five doctors were in quarantine, the other two hospitalised with the virus. \u201cWe have many people with a fever who are at home and who are unable to be visited by a doctor,\u201d Pesatori said. Still, at that point, the voices \u2013 including some medics \u2013 saying \u201cthis is no worse than flu\u201d or \u201cmillions die of flu\u201d were louder than the voices of people such as Pesatori. The media came under attack. In one post shared on Facebook, coronavirus was described as \u201ca godsend\u201d for journalists who were using it to enjoy a moment in the limelight. Seeing friends who run small businesses in Italy worrying about their livelihoods, I felt guilty. Was I being irresponsible? But the more I wrote, the more I learned about the virus. I thought about family and friends who would be vulnerable to it, those either suffering or recovering from cancer, those with heart issues, diabetes, or high blood pressure. This wasn\u2019t an illness that affected only the elderly or frail. People were dying before their time, regardless of their age. As we told stories about the victims, the overwhelmed hospitals and how Italy was struggling to bury its dead, the horror of the virus\u2019s impact started to hit home, especially abroad. When a reader emailed thanking us for our \u201cresponsible\u201d coverage, I cried. The reader had shared a story about Bergamo, the worst-affected province, with friends in the UK and said it had made an impact in terms of the message sinking in there. The whole of Italy has been under lockdown for almost three weeks. Every day at 6pm the population solemnly tunes in for the \u201cwar bulletin\u201d, when the civil protection authority gives an update on the number of deaths and infected. There was hope on Monday when, for two days in a row, the numbers for both had decreased. All we have now is hope that Italy will soon turn a corner. And when it does, I look forward to finishing the hike around Lake Albano.",

      "body": "<p>In 1939, in <a href=\"https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/lewiscs-transposition/lewiscs-transposition-00-h.html\" title=\"\">a sermon</a> preached at Oxford University in the midst of a different global crisis, CS Lewis made a distinction that\u2019s worth revisiting today. It wasn\u2019t the case, he pointed out, that the outbreak of war had rendered human life suddenly fragile; rather, it was that people were suddenly realising it always had been. \u201cThe war creates no absolutely new situation,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice\u2026 We are mistaken when we compare war with \u2018normal life\u2019. Life has never been normal.\u201d</p> <p>In this time of acute collective anxiety, this sort of insight might not bring much peace of mind on its own. But it is a crucial first step, because it suggests that something about our gut-churning feelings of helplessness \u2013 the sense that we\u2019re facing an absolutely horrible, unprecedented emergency, which we\u2019ll surely lack the personal resilience to cope with \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly accurate. And it implies that we might be much better than we think at dealing with radical uncertainty \u2013 because in fact, every hour of every day, we already do.</p> <p>The special trouble with uncertainty is that it\u2019s a doorway to infinity. When you\u2019ve no idea what tomorrow will bring, it\u2019s easy to fill that gap with fantasy, and the world of fantasy knows no bounds. It\u2019s possible to imagine things getting limitlessly bad. (Most of us are vulnerable to what the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbg-pwEfu90\" title=\"\">psychotherapist Bruce Tift</a> calls \u201cannihilatory panic\u201d: the unconscious belief that there are certain feelings that would literally destroy us if we had to feel them.) Unsurprisingly, this feeds the destructive and self-perpetuating thought pattern that cognitive therapists call \u201ccatastrophising\u201d: taking every morsel of bad news as evidence that things are going to be globally, absolutely and eternally terrible. By contrast, when even extremely bad things happen, the situation, however dire, remains finite. An event occurs; it\u2019s over; then the people directly affected can begin to reconfigure their lives.</p> <p>One overarching strategy for dealing with the experience of intense uncertainty is to do whatever you can to bring yourself back to the world of the finite \u2013 to things as they actually are in your own concrete world, and the concrete things you can control. As a first step, try not to see anxious feelings as something you\u2019ve got to get rid of. <a href=\"https://www.lisamarchiano.com/\" title=\"\">Lisa Marchiano</a>, a therapist and writer based in Philadelphia, suggests making it your mission \u201cto tolerate uncertainty, rather than having to make it go away. That creates a different frame for thinking about things: all you have to do is tolerate it. Of course, that may be very difficult \u2013 but it can get us out of this place where we\u2019re spinning our wheels, trying to fix something it isn\u2019t within our power to fix.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I recommend the \u2018shaking practice\u2019 which has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with misery</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many of the most fruitful techniques for coping with uncertainty involve a similar move: they are ways to refocus your attention away from your runaway fantasies. If you\u2019re confined to your home at the moment, giving yourself some structure by drawing up an approximate schedule can reconnect you to the texture of the day. (\u201cEven if we hate our jobs, having somewhere to be at 9am is very containing, psychologically,\u201d Marchiano says.) You\u2019ll get a related \u201cgrounding\u201d effect by returning to the body through virtually any form of physical exercise. (As a specific antidote to anxious feelings, I highly recommend the \u201cshaking practice\u201d demonstrated by the coach Deepika Sheleff <a href=\"http://www.deeperintolife.com/videos.html\" title=\"\">on her website</a>, which is what it sounds like \u2013 and has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with total misery.)</p> <p>There\u2019s no harm in a little distraction, if you can manage it. But one of the most intriguing insights of Buddhist psychology is that focusing on discomfort is even more effective. In another demonstration of the power of returning to concrete reality, if you spend a few moments paying attention as closely as possible to the physical sensations you\u2019re experiencing at this very moment, you\u2019ll probably find them much easier to tolerate. The meditation teacher <a href=\"https://kennethfolkdharma.com/\" title=\"\">Kenneth Folk</a> frames this as a matter of \u201cattentional bandwidth\u201d: your capacity to pay attention is strictly limited \u2013 and so the more of it you manage to dedicate to the experience you\u2019re having, the less remains available for dwelling on how unpleasant it is. (Complement this with the powerfully calming <a href=\"https://www.drweil.com/videos-features/videos/breathing-exercises-4-7-8-breath/\" title=\"\">4-7-8 breathing technique</a>: breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, then exhale through your mouth, emptying the lungs as fully as possible, for a count of eight.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, as your to-do list isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 depending on your situation, it may just have become unfeasibly longer \u2013 you\u2019ll need a way to get things done in the presence of uncertainty, and here, too, a short-range, down-to-earth, finitude-focused approach is likely to the most effective.

      "bodyText": "In 1939, in a sermon preached at Oxford University in the midst of a different global crisis, CS Lewis made a distinction that\u2019s worth revisiting today. It wasn\u2019t the case, he pointed out, that the outbreak of war had rendered human life suddenly fragile; rather, it was that people were suddenly realising it always had been. \u201cThe war creates no absolutely new situation,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt simply aggravates the permanent human situation so that we can no longer ignore it. Human life has always been lived on the edge of a precipice\u2026 We are mistaken when we compare war with \u2018normal life\u2019. Life has never been normal.\u201d In this time of acute collective anxiety, this sort of insight might not bring much peace of mind on its own. But it is a crucial first step, because it suggests that something about our gut-churning feelings of helplessness \u2013 the sense that we\u2019re facing an absolutely horrible, unprecedented emergency, which we\u2019ll surely lack the personal resilience to cope with \u2013 isn\u2019t wholly accurate. And it implies that we might be much better than we think at dealing with radical uncertainty \u2013 because in fact, every hour of every day, we already do. The special trouble with uncertainty is that it\u2019s a doorway to infinity. When you\u2019ve no idea what tomorrow will bring, it\u2019s easy to fill that gap with fantasy, and the world of fantasy knows no bounds. It\u2019s possible to imagine things getting limitlessly bad. (Most of us are vulnerable to what the psychotherapist Bruce Tift calls \u201cannihilatory panic\u201d: the unconscious belief that there are certain feelings that would literally destroy us if we had to feel them.) Unsurprisingly, this feeds the destructive and self-perpetuating thought pattern that cognitive therapists call \u201ccatastrophising\u201d: taking every morsel of bad news as evidence that things are going to be globally, absolutely and eternally terrible. By contrast, when even extremely bad things happen, the situation, however dire, remains finite. An event occurs; it\u2019s over; then the people directly affected can begin to reconfigure their lives. One overarching strategy for dealing with the experience of intense uncertainty is to do whatever you can to bring yourself back to the world of the finite \u2013 to things as they actually are in your own concrete world, and the concrete things you can control. As a first step, try not to see anxious feelings as something you\u2019ve got to get rid of. Lisa Marchiano, a therapist and writer based in Philadelphia, suggests making it your mission \u201cto tolerate uncertainty, rather than having to make it go away. That creates a different frame for thinking about things: all you have to do is tolerate it. Of course, that may be very difficult \u2013 but it can get us out of this place where we\u2019re spinning our wheels, trying to fix something it isn\u2019t within our power to fix.\u201d Many of the most fruitful techniques for coping with uncertainty involve a similar move: they are ways to refocus your attention away from your runaway fantasies. If you\u2019re confined to your home at the moment, giving yourself some structure by drawing up an approximate schedule can reconnect you to the texture of the day. (\u201cEven if we hate our jobs, having somewhere to be at 9am is very containing, psychologically,\u201d Marchiano says.) You\u2019ll get a related \u201cgrounding\u201d effect by returning to the body through virtually any form of physical exercise. (As a specific antidote to anxious feelings, I highly recommend the \u201cshaking practice\u201d demonstrated by the coach Deepika Sheleff on her website, which is what it sounds like \u2013 and has the added benefit of being so ridiculous as to be incompatible with total misery.) There\u2019s no harm in a little distraction, if you can manage it. But one of the most intriguing insights of Buddhist psychology is that focusing on discomfort is even more effective. In another demonstration of the power of returning to concrete reality, if you spend a few moments paying attention as closely as possible to the physical sensations you\u2019re experiencing at this very moment, you\u2019ll probably find them much easier to tolerate. The meditation teacher Kenneth Folk frames this as a matter of \u201cattentional bandwidth\u201d: your capacity to pay attention is strictly limited \u2013 and so the more of it you manage to dedicate to the experience you\u2019re having, the less remains available for dwelling on how unpleasant it is. (Complement this with the powerfully calming 4-7-8 breathing technique: breathe in through your nose for a count of four, hold your breath for a count of seven, then exhale through your mouth, emptying the lungs as fully as possible, for a count of eight.) Meanwhile, as your to-do list isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2013 depending on your situation, it may just have become unfeasibly longer \u2013 you\u2019ll need a way to get things done in the presence of uncertainty, and here, too, a short-range, down-to-earth, finitude-focused approach is likely to the most effective. Even at the best of times, it\u2019s a good idea to limit the number of tasks you\u2019re working on at any given moment to three or four, seeing them through to completion before embarking on others; and in times of high stress, it may be worth reducing that limit to one. Pick a task, write it on a Post-it, position it somewhere prominent, then do that task; for that moment, it\u2019s the only goal you need to worry about accomplishing. Then repeat. Soon, you\u2019ll accumulate a pleasing number of Post-its, a testament to all the constructive stuff you\u2019ve managed to get done. As the anxiety abates a little, it may even become possible to glimpse the profound truth that, as Marchiano puts it, \u201ca crisis can heighten the opportunity to find meaning, to get clear about what matters most\u201d. What\u2019s your role here? There\u2019s solace to be found in figuring out what this moment demands from you, then doing it as well as you can. It may not look like anything heroic from the outside. (\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just making sure the kids stay on top of their schoolwork, or doing your job as a clerk in a grocery store,\u201d Marchiano says.) It won\u2019t change the fact that nobody knows what tomorrow holds. But, then again, nobody has ever known what tomorrow held \u2013 yet life has always gone on, including its most uplifting forms.

Tara Reade, who worked with Biden when he was a Delaware senator, alleges he inappropriately touched her and penetrated her with his fingers without consent in 1993.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened all at once, and then \u2026 his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,\u201d Reade recalled in an interview <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/katie-halper/tara-to-post\">with podcast host Katie Halper</a> on Wednesday. \u201cHe said \u2018come on, man, I heard you liked me. For me, it was like, everything shattered \u2026 I wanted to be a senator; I didn\u2019t want to sleep with one.\u201d</p> <p>Rightwing news outlets have gleefully seized upon the accusations against Biden; the story has also been discussed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">left</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">wing commentators</a>. However, the mainstream media has largely ignored the allegations. Instead there have been headlines like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar/index.htm\">The top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as VP</a> (CNN) and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d71a735b53f8a5c9c417e144de9af544\">Joe Biden\u2019s inner circle: No longer a boy\u2019s club</a> (AP).</p> <p>It is hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden. However, it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many liberals turning a blind eye. The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren\u2019t they being taken seriously?</p> <p>One obvious reason is that Reade\u2019s accusations are very hard to prove. The incident happened a long time ago and there weren\u2019t any witnesses. Reade also gave a slightly different version of events last year; she <a href=\"https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/\">accused Biden</a> of touching her neck and shoulders in a way that was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but did not say anything sexual took place. This inconsistency obviously doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying; unfortunately, it is easy to use against her.</p> <p>Reade\u2019s story may be impossible to verify, but this is the case with the vast majority of sexual assault allegations. It is nearly always a case of \u201che said, she said\u201d \u2013 and it is nearly always the \u201che\u2019 that is automatically believed. The #MeToo mantra \u201cBelieve Women\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that women never lie; it means that our systems of power are biased towards believing men never lie. It means that it takes decades of allegations and scores of women coming forward for powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby to be brought to justice. All the mantra means is that you shouldn\u2019t automatically disbelieve women.</p> <p>You know who has talked publicly about the importance of taking women seriously? Biden. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Biden stood up for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-when-a-woman-alleges-sexual-assault-presume-she-is-telling-the-truth/2018/09/17/7718c532-badd-11e8-a8aa-860695e7f3fc_story.html\">noting</a>: \u201cFor a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real.\u201d</p> <p>Does this presumption not apply when the guy being accused is a Democrat running for president? It would seem that way. In January, according to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/\">reporting from the Intercept</a>, Reade asked for help from the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has supported accusers of high-profile people like Weinstein. Reade was reportedly told by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the organization within which the Time\u2019s Up fund is housed, that it couldn\u2019t assist with accusations against a presidential candidate because it would jeopardize their non-profit status. The Intercept further notes that \u201cthe public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is the top adviser to Biden\u2019s presidential campaign\u201d.</p> <p>There are some people who will insist that drawing attention to the new allegations against Biden is playing into the Republicans\u2019 hands. That it will destroy Biden\u2019s campaign and guarantee us four more years of Trump. Not only is that argument hypocritical, it is also hugely unlikely that Reade\u2019s accusations will do any damage whatsoever to Biden\u2019s ambitions. Allegations of sexual assault certainly haven\u2019t posed any hindrance to Trump. The allegations against Kavanaugh didn\u2019t stop him from becoming a supreme court justice. The allegations against Louis CK didn\u2019t kill his career in comedy. And the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-allegations-women-2020-campaign-2019-6\">multiple women</a> who have accused Biden of touching them inappropriately in the past haven\u2019t exactly derailed his career.</p> <h2>Why does coronavirus kill more men than women?</h2> <p>Around the world, men in every age bracket are dying from coronavirus at higher rates than women. Men have accounted for 71% of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, for example. And in Spain twice as many men as women have died. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">Nobody is entirely sure what\u2019s causing this gender gap</a>. Biology, lifestyle and behaviour probably all play a role but we won\u2019t know what the balance is until sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.</p> <h2>Telegram sexual abuse scandal shocks South Korea</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/outrage-in-south-korea-over-telegram-sexual-abuse-ring-blackmailing-women-and-girls\">Police have named</a> 25-year-old Cho Ju-bin as the man who allegedly ran a sexual blackmail ring on the app Telegram. Women and underage girls were blackmailed into sending degrading images of themselves through the app; the images were then made available to subscribers. Police took the unusual step of naming Cho after five million South Koreans signed petitions demanding his identity be revealed.

      "bodyText": "The Week in Patriarchy is a weekly roundup of what\u2019s happening in the world of feminism and sexism. If you\u2019re not already receiving it by email, make sure to subscribe. Why are sexual assault and misbehaviour allegations against Biden being ignored? Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has been accused of sexual assault by a former staffer. Tara Reade, who worked with Biden when he was a Delaware senator, alleges he inappropriately touched her and penetrated her with his fingers without consent in 1993. \u201cIt happened all at once, and then \u2026 his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,\u201d Reade recalled in an interview with podcast host Katie Halper on Wednesday. \u201cHe said \u2018come on, man, I heard you liked me. For me, it was like, everything shattered \u2026 I wanted to be a senator; I didn\u2019t want to sleep with one.\u201d Rightwing news outlets have gleefully seized upon the accusations against Biden; the story has also been discussed by leftwing commentators. However, the mainstream media has largely ignored the allegations. Instead there have been headlines like The top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as VP (CNN) and Joe Biden\u2019s inner circle: No longer a boy\u2019s club (AP). It is hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden. However, it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many liberals turning a blind eye. The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren\u2019t they being taken seriously? One obvious reason is that Reade\u2019s accusations are very hard to prove. The incident happened a long time ago and there weren\u2019t any witnesses. Reade also gave a slightly different version of events last year; she accused Biden of touching her neck and shoulders in a way that was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but did not say anything sexual took place. This inconsistency obviously doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying; unfortunately, it is easy to use against her. Reade\u2019s story may be impossible to verify, but this is the case with the vast majority of sexual assault allegations. It is nearly always a case of \u201che said, she said\u201d \u2013 and it is nearly always the \u201che\u2019 that is automatically believed. The #MeToo mantra \u201cBelieve Women\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that women never lie; it means that our systems of power are biased towards believing men never lie. It means that it takes decades of allegations and scores of women coming forward for powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby to be brought to justice. All the mantra means is that you shouldn\u2019t automatically disbelieve women. You know who has talked publicly about the importance of taking women seriously? Biden. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Biden stood up for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, noting: \u201cFor a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real.\u201d Does this presumption not apply when the guy being accused is a Democrat running for president? It would seem that way. In January, according to reporting from the Intercept, Reade asked for help from the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has supported accusers of high-profile people like Weinstein. Reade was reportedly told by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the organization within which the Time\u2019s Up fund is housed, that it couldn\u2019t assist with accusations against a presidential candidate because it would jeopardize their non-profit status. The Intercept further notes that \u201cthe public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is the top adviser to Biden\u2019s presidential campaign\u201d. There are some people who will insist that drawing attention to the new allegations against Biden is playing into the Republicans\u2019 hands. That it will destroy Biden\u2019s campaign and guarantee us four more years of Trump. Not only is that argument hypocritical, it is also hugely unlikely that Reade\u2019s accusations will do any damage whatsoever to Biden\u2019s ambitions. Allegations of sexual assault certainly haven\u2019t posed any hindrance to Trump. The allegations against Kavanaugh didn\u2019t stop him from becoming a supreme court justice. The allegations against Louis CK didn\u2019t kill his career in comedy. And the multiple women who have accused Biden of touching them inappropriately in the past haven\u2019t exactly derailed his career. Why does coronavirus kill more men than women? Around the world, men in every age bracket are dying from coronavirus at higher rates than women. Men have accounted for 71% of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, for example. And in Spain twice as many men as women have died. Nobody is entirely sure what\u2019s causing this gender gap. Biology, lifestyle and behaviour probably all play a role but we won\u2019t know what the balance is until sex-disaggregated data is more widely available. Telegram sexual abuse scandal shocks South Korea Police have named 25-year-old Cho Ju-bin as the man who allegedly ran a sexual blackmail ring on the app Telegram. Women and underage girls were blackmailed into sending degrading images of themselves through the app; the images were then made available to subscribers. Police took the unusual step of naming Cho after five million South Koreans signed petitions demanding his identity be revealed. His arrest comes just months after the \u201cBurning Sun Scandal\u201d, in which a number of K-pop stars were implicated in a prostitution ring. Should women be eligible for the US military draft? A congressionally mandated commission thinks so. The National Commission on Military, National and Public Service released a report on Wednesday recommending that women register for possible obligatory military service. Incels are thrilled with the coronavirus lockdowns They\u2019re gleeful that nobody can have casual sex any more, apparently. However while quarantine may stop people hooking up with strangers, it seems some are having sex parties on Zoom. The week in pet-riarchy The one silver lining to the public health crisis we\u2019re currently facing? New York City, the center of America\u2019s pandemic, is running out of shelter animals. There\u2019s been a huge spike in people fostering dogs and cats to help them get through these ruff times. \u2022 The headline of this article was amended on 30 March 2020 to more accurately reflect the nature of Reade\u2019s allegations against Biden.",

The easing of the quarantine, allowing people to enter the city of 11 million and the global ground zero of the coronavirus outbreak, comes as China plans measures to kickstart its pandemic-battered economy. Trains have been fully booked for over a week in advance. But as some restrictions are loosened in China \u2013 with observers urging intense caution because of concerns over a potential re-emergence of the disease \u2013 the virus continued to rage around the world, with reported US cases passing the 100,000 mark as the world\u2019s worst-infected country. Chinese state media on Saturday showed crowds of passengers arriving at Wuhan station, many wheeling suitcases. Some people had managed to slip back into the city a day earlier on rail services that were stopping in the city, but had nominally banned passengers from disembarking. A study this week found the lockdown in Wuhan \u2013 where more than 2,500 people are still in hospital \u2013 had succeeded in stopping the fast-spreading virus in its tracks and given healthcare facilities crucial breathing room, but warned against opening up the city too soon.

Brighton and Hove city council has temporarily suspended kerbside recycling collections amid \u201cvery limited staff,\u201d with many self-isolating and working from home.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a> recorded its single biggest leap in coronavirus deaths, announcing that 969 people had died from Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The country also became the second country to overtake China in terms of the number of infections, reaching 86,498 cases.

The FA voided the season for all tiers of the women\u2019s pyramid from the National League down (tiers three to seven and grassroots football) on Thursday. The move drew criticism from a number of clubs, including Barnsley, who said they were not consulted until shortly before the plans were made public and urged the FA to \u201cimmediately reconsider\u201d the decision. As a part of that announcement the FA said it \u201cremains in consultation with the Barclays FA Women\u2019s Super League and FA Women\u2019s Championship Board and clubs regarding the most appropriate way to complete the current season; including the Barclays FA Women\u2019s Super League Academy\u201d. In a conference call on Friday, those discussions resulted in several options being put to clubs: teams return to training in three weeks; the return to training is pushed back by a few weeks each time, with resumption only when it is deemed safe to do so; and, if the other possibilities prove unfeasible, that both seasons are voided. The FA was notified of clubs\u2019 estimated losses for March, April and May during the week and there was a sense of disbelief from some at the lack of financial support alongside the extension to the season stretching into the foreseeable future.

      "body": "<p>The global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again?</p> <p>Put more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning?</p> <p>Genuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse.</p> <p>For countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them?</p> <p>Some analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored.</p> <p>But there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in <em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\">Foreign Policy</a></em><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/20/world-order-after-coroanvirus-pandemic/\"> </a>magazine.</p> <p>Walt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d</p> <p>Is Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next.</p> <p>It\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs.</p> <h2>Balance of power</h2> <p>After early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/china-prepares-to-seal-itself-off-from-the-world-to-stem-imported-coronavirus-cases\">soft power tool</a> to overtake its superpower rival, the US.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules</p> <footer> <cite>Mira Rapp-Hooper, US Council on Foreign Relations</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in <em><a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-03-18/coronavirus-could-reshape-global-order\">Foreign Affairs</a></em> magazine.</p> <p>In contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued.</p> <h2>Authoritarianism and democracy</h2> <p>China\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect.</p> <p>The trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f677aaf7e4b2682a6d53d427c63656cd83d2c64/0_316_4928_2958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, may be tempted to use the pandemic to keep his country in a state of emergency.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isopix/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/putin-criminal-incompetent-president-enemy-of-his-own-people-russia\">extend his presidency</a> in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d </p> <p>Governments such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/egypt-forces-guardian-journalist-leave-coronavirus-story-ruth-michaelson\">Egypt</a>\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed.</p> <p>Most people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies.</p> <h2>Globalisation and multilateralism</h2> <p>Unprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached.</p> <p>What the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure?</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d.</p> <p>For Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-20/coronavirus-ushers-in-the-globalization-we-were-afraid-of?srnd=opinion\">new and re-emerging global divisions</a>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them</p> <footer> <cite>David Miliband, International Rescue Committee</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats.

      "bodyText": "The global impact of the coronavirus pandemic poses a fundamental question: is this one of those historic moments when the world changes permanently, when the balance of political and economic power shifts decisively, and when, for most people, in most countries, life is never quite the same again? Put more simply, is this the end of the world as we know it? And, equally, could the crisis mark a new beginning? Genuinely pivotal global moments, watersheds or turning points (pick your own terminology) are actually quite rare. Yet if the premise is correct \u2013 that there can be no return to the pre-Covid-19 era \u2013 then it poses many unsettling questions about the nature of the change, and whether it will be for better or worse. For countless individuals and families, normal life has already been upended in previously unimaginable ways. But how will the pandemic influence the future behaviour of nation states, governments and leaders \u2013 and their often dysfunctional relationships? Will they work together more closely, or will this shared trauma further divide them? Some analysts see grounds for optimism, for example in beneficial environmental effects in northern Italy and China. Countries hitherto at odds, such as Iran and the UAE, are cooperating, at least temporarily. In the Philippines, the crisis prompted a ceasefire with Communist rebels. Global interdependence and the importance of collective, multilateral approaches have been vividly underscored. But there is also a more pessimistic view, typified by Stephen Walt, professor of international relations at Harvard University. \u201cThe pandemic will strengthen the state and reinforce nationalism. Governments of all types will adopt emergency measures to manage the crisis, and many will be loath to relinquish these new powers when the crisis is over,\u201d he wrote in Foreign Policy magazine. Walt continued: \u201cCovid-19 will also accelerate the shift in power and influence from west to east. The response in Europe and America has been slow and haphazard by comparison [with China, South Korea and Singapore], further tarnishing the aura of the western \u2018brand\u2019\u2026 We will see a further retreat from hyper-globalisation, as citizens look to national governments to protect them and as states and firms seek to reduce future vulnerabilities. \u201cIn short, Covid-19 will create a world that is less open, less prosperous and less free.\u201d Is Walt right? The cop-out answer is only time will tell. Yet the outcome is not preordained. The responses of everybody, from presidents and prime ministers to ordinary citizens, to the myriad challenges and upheavals arising from the pandemic will help determine what happens next. It\u2019s a chance to reset both global and personal landscapes. Notwithstanding present feelings of powerlessness, there are choices to be made about what kind of future awaits. After Covid-19, everything could be up for grabs. Balance of power After early blunders, China\u2019s government is working hard to turn Covid-19, first detected in Wuhan in November, into a national success story. It claims draconian measures to suppress the disease have largely worked. Now, by offering assistance to Italy and other badly affected countries, China is reinforcing its credentials as a global leader. The virus has become a soft power tool to overtake its superpower rival, the US. \u201cA critical part of this narrative is Beijing\u2019s supposed success in battling the virus. A steady stream of propaganda articles, tweets and public messaging, in a wide variety of languages, touts China\u2019s achievements and highlights the effectiveness of its model of domestic governance,\u201d wrote commentators Kurt Campbell and Rush Doshi in Foreign Affairs magazine. In contrast, Donald Trump is struggling to dispel a widespread perception of gross incompetence. \u201cThe US government\u2019s pandemic leadership has been its own special brand of catastrophe\u2026. [It] has placed its own citizens in unnecessary peril, while sidelining itself from acting as a global crisis leader,\u201d wrote Mira Rapp-Hooper of the US Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThis domestic and international governance crisis could change the nature of the international order in several ways \u2026. If the US remains absent without leave, China may take the crisis as an opportunity to start setting new rules according to its own global governance vision,\u201d she continued. Authoritarianism and democracy China\u2019s challenge to US hegemony was already strengthening on many fronts before the Covid-19 crisis erupted. The pandemic may accelerate this shift. For US-allied democracies that value open governance, civil rights and free speech, this is a worrying prospect. The trend towards centralised, authoritarian rule evident in countries such as India, Brazil and Turkey, and typified by China and Russia, has coincided with the rise of rightwing nationalist-populist governments and parties in Europe. Some are now following China\u2019s lead in attempting to weaponise the virus for political ends. \u201cThe pandemic unquestionably presents an era-defining challenge to public health and the global economy [but] its political consequences are less well-understood,\u201d the independent monitor, International Crisis Group, warned last week. \u201cUnscrupulous leaders may exploit the pandemic to advance their objectives in ways that exacerbate domestic or international crises \u2013 cracking down on dissent at home or escalating conflicts with rival states \u2013 on the assumption that they will get away with it while the world is otherwise occupied,\u201d the ICG said. One example cited by the report was Vladimir Putin\u2019s recent attempt to indefinitely extend his presidency in Russia (although the virus has since forced him to postpone a vote that could have allowed him to stay in power until 2036). Another was a bid by Viktor Orb\u00e1n, Hungary\u2019s nationalist leader, to renew a state of emergency \u201cthat prescribes five-year prison sentences for those disseminating false information or obstructing the state\u2019s crisis response.\u201d Governments such as Egypt\u2019s have followed China\u2019s example in expelling foreign journalists, restricting media access and curtailing public discussion. Like Boris Johnson and many European leaders, Trump has also assumed emergency powers. From Bolivia, India, Sri Lanka and Iraq to the US, UK and France, elections have been postponed, parliaments suspended, and lockdowns and curfews imposed. Most people may support such measures in the short term. But what if the crisis is protracted, with a \u201csecond wave\u201d running into next year? And what if the new controls are not relaxed or withdrawn after it ends? This is what Harvard\u2019s Stephen Walt meant about the danger of \u201cless free\u201d post-pandemic societies. Globalisation and multilateralism Unprecedented government aid packages for businesses and workers, intended to mitigate the disease\u2019s economic and financial impact, have led some analysts to suggest \u201cthe state is back\u201d \u2013 and that the limits of the postwar neoliberal, free market model have finally been reached. What the crisis has shown, it is argued, is that when the challenge is truly existential, only the state can offer holistic and equitable solutions. A natural corollary is that the high-water mark of globalisation has arrived. These are radical paradigm shifts. Will they endure? \u201cThe pandemic could be the straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back of economic globalisation,\u201d wrote Robin Niblett, director of the Chatham House thinktank. The architecture of global economic governance established in the 20th century was at risk, he warned, raising the prospect that political leaders may \u201cretreat into overt geopolitical competition\u201d. For Robert Kaplan of the Eurasia Group, \u201ccoronavirus is the historical marker between the first phase of globalisation and the second \u2026. Globalisation 2.0 is about separating the globe into great-power blocs with their own burgeoning militaries and separate supply chains, about the rise of autocracies, and about social and class divides that have engendered nativism and populism \u2026. In sum, it is a story about new and re-emerging global divisions.\u201d If that\u2019s true, few will mourn the passing of the globalisation era. And support for Kaplan\u2019s theory may be found in increased post-pandemic protectionism if, as some predict, countries attempt to limit future exposure to global threats. The UN warned last week of worldwide food shortages caused by lack of workers, tougher immigration controls, sanctions and tariffs \u2013 and called for a new, more open approach. The weakening of multilateral forums and institutions, evident before the crisis, is another sign of a shrinking world. Trying to revive their collective clout, the wealthy G20 countries belatedly pledged last week to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to fight the virus. But it remains largely unclear what that entails in practice, and who will take the lead. Fragile world The pandemic and its aftermath could be a game-changer for poorer countries with limited resources and means of recovery, and for refugees and people in conflict zones \u2013 but probably not in a good way. The ICG report is blunt: \u201cThe global outbreak has the potential to wreak havoc in fragile states [and] trigger widespread unrest \u2026. If the disease spreads in densely packed urban centres, it may be virtually impossible to control.\u201d This is precisely the fear stalking South Africa\u2019s townships right now. The report said the dramatic global economic slowdown would disrupt trade flows and create unemployment in commodity-exporting poorer countries. \u201cIts implications are especially serious for those caught in the midst of conflict if, as seems likely, the disease disrupts humanitarian aid flows, limits peace operations, and postpones diplomacy.\u201d War-afflicted Syrians, Afghans, Somalis, South Sudanese and Yemenis could be especially badly affected. That\u2019s why the UN last week launched an appeal for $2bn in humanitarian aid. Its secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, wants trillions more in global financial stimulus to prevent \u201cmillions\u201d of deaths. \u201cCovid-19 is threatening the whole of humanity and the whole of humanity must fight back,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic is a powerful reminder of two things: the shared challenges of our global village, and the deep inequalities we must grapple with to fight them,\u201d said David Miliband, who heads the International Rescue Committee. \u201cCoronavirus is not just a problem for rich countries.

Elisabeth Braw of the Royal United Services Institute warns of a moment of extreme geopolitical vulnerability. \u201cThe coronavirus is a perfect opportunity for the west\u2019s adversaries to watch how countries cope \u2013 or don\u2019t cope \u2013 with a major crisis,\u201d she wrote. But John Ikenberry, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is less fearful, pointing to the US-led recovery after the 1930s Depression. Intensifying great power rivalry in a fractured, damaged, poorer world might indeed be the future that awaits, Ikenberry suggested.

According to the newspaper, on 1 March, the day after the first coronavirus death in the US, two Tennessee brothers, Matt and Noah Colvin, went to every store in their home town and cleaned it out of hand sanitiser. Over the next three days, Noah embarked on a 1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a rented truck with thousands of bottles of the stuff and thousands of packs of antibacterial wipes.</p> <p>Having cornered the market, the Colvins then set about selling their wares on Amazon. Initially they sold 300 bottles for between $8 and $70 each, and presumably started laughing all the way to the bank. The glee was short-lived, however, for the next day Amazon pulled their items and thousands of other listings for sanitiser, wipes and face masks. The company also suspended some of the sellers behind the listings and warned many others that if they kept increasing prices, they\u2019d lose their accounts. In this way, the Colvin boys found themselves with 17,700 bottles of sanitiser and nowhere to sell them.

It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than \u00a360m.</p> <p>The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government\u2019s policy came in for criticism.</p> <p>\u201cBadgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,\u201d Dyer said.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">'Seismic shift\u2019: ministers signal end of badger cull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/05/badger-cull-phased-out-replaced-vaccinations-bovine-tb-england\">not a long-term solution</a> to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease.</p> <p>But farmers insist a cull is necessary. The <a href=\"https://www.nfuonline.com/sectors/animal-health/animal-health-rh-panel/bovine-tb/\">National Farmers Union</a> has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling.</p> <p>Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: \u201cIn areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.\u201d</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to include a comment from Defra.</p>",

Dominic Dyer, the chief executive of the Badger Trust, said: \u201cThe government licensed the killing of 35,034 badgers in 2019 in 40 culling zones stretching from Cornwall to Cumbria in the largest destruction of a protected species in living memory.\u201d More than 70% of the badgers (24,645) were killed as a result of controlled shooting. \u201cThis is a method of killing which is condemned by the British Veterinary Association as inhumane as it can result in badgers taking more than five minutes to die from multiple bullet wounds, blood loss and organ failure,\u201d Dyer said. Only 149 (0.6%) of the total 35,034 badgers killed were monitored to establish that they were dispatched humanely. The total number of badgers killed since the cull policy started now stands at 102,349. It has been estimated that the cull has cost the taxpayer more than \u00a360m. The figures were supposed to have been published months ago but were delayed as the efficacy of the government\u2019s policy came in for criticism. \u201cBadgers are now being slaughtered at such a rate across England that they could face local extinction in areas of the country which they have inhabited since the Ice Age,\u201d Dyer said. \u201cDespite this mass destruction of a protected species, the government has failed to produce any reliable evidence to prove that the culling of badgers is making any significant impact on lowering bovine-TB in cattle in or around the cull zones.\u201d In response to an independent review into its TB policy, the government recently acknowledged that the mass slaughter of badgers was not a long-term solution to reducing bovine-TB. Instead there is to be a new emphasis on vaccinating cattle against the disease. But farmers insist a cull is necessary. The National Farmers Union has expressed frustration that culling and badger vaccination are being given a \u201cfalse equivalence\u201d. The NFU said vaccination had never been demonstrated to reduce bovine-TB with the same efficacy as culling. Following the change in government policy, the NFU deputy president, Stuart Roberts, said: \u201cIn areas where TB in badgers is endemic, we must retain culling as a vital tool enabling industry to get on top of the disease quickly and reduce further transmission.\u201d A Defra spokesperson said: \u201cBovine TB leads to the slaughter of over 30,000 cattle every year and considerable trauma for farmers as they suffer the loss of highly prized animals and valued herds. As independent research has shown, the badger cull has led to a significant reduction in the disease but no one wants to continue the cull of this protected species forever. We recently set out the next phase of our strategy to combat bTB, which includes field trials of a cattle vaccine, plans to vaccinate more badgers against the disease and improved testing to intercept bTB earlier.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 30 March 2020 to include a comment from Defra.",

      "body": "<p>Craig Brown, 62, is an award-winning satirist, columnist and critic who has written the parodic diary in <em>Private Eye</em> since 1989. He\u2019s also the author of 18 books, including recent bestseller <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/17/maam-darling-by-craig-brown-review-princess-margaret\">Ma\u2019am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret</a></em>. His new book is <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/one-two-three-four-the-beatles-in-time-9780008340001.html\">One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time</a></em>.</p> <p><strong>How did your new book about the Beatles come about?<br></strong>I was working on a book about the River Thames and mentioned to my publisher that I had an idea for the next one: a big, kaleidoscopic book about the Beatles, similar to what I did with Princess Margaret. He emailed the next day to ask if I\u2019d be able to get it out by 10 April 2020 because that\u2019s the 50th anniversary of the Beatles\u2019 breakup. So I shelved the Thames one to do this.</p> <p><strong>Are you glad you did?<br></strong>Very, because the Beatles story has got everything. It\u2019s a complete contrast to Princess Margaret\u2019s, which is a sort of stationary life. Theirs is a rags-to-riches human drama. Once they became successful, of course, it didn\u2019t make them happier. There\u2019s the sociological backdrop, the curious phenomenon of fandom, the array of interesting weirdos in their orbit\u2026 It\u2019s endlessly fascinating. The book is 600 pages but could\u2019ve been 10 times the length.</p> <p><strong>Do you remember when you first heard the Beatles?<br></strong>I was 10 in 1967, so came in at the <em>Sgt Pepper</em> period. I also remember singing Yellow Submarine at boy scout camp.</p> <p><strong>Did you ever meet any of the Fab Four?<br></strong>I briefly met Paul at a gig in 1973 and asked him to sign the only thing I had on me, which happened to be a Roxy Music album. I can\u2019t claim a lifelong friendship but he was very pleasant.</p> <p><strong>Who was your favourite Beatle?<br></strong>Paul was the one I always wanted to be and since doing the book, he remains my favourite. He not only had this extraordinary genius for melody but for lyrics too. Things like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaBPY78D88g\">She\u2019s Leaving Home</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuS5NuXRb5Y\">Eleanor Rigby</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdcSFVXd3MU\">Here, There and Everywhere</a> are so beautiful. The others often resented Paul for being the band\u2019s driving force but without him, they wouldn\u2019t have achieved nearly as much.</p> <p><strong>How did your multicoloured approach to writing biographies evolve?<br></strong>I\u2019ve always found exhaustive biographies, which is most of them, boring. They recount details of no interest. My system is to cut those boring bits out. Dogged chronology is untrue to life, too. If you\u2019re thinking about your life, past, present and future all merges together, so I try to reflect that.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Alan Sugar cancelled coming on Have I Got News for You after I did him, which was gratifying</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You\u2019ve been writing your </strong><em><strong>Private Eye</strong></em><strong> diaries for 31 years now. That\u2019s 750-plus parodies\u2026<br></strong>I suppose it is. I should get a gold watch. But fresh people come along all the time. There\u2019s been such an explosion of celebrity that the ducks line up for me.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your technique?<br></strong>They\u2019re sort of verbal caricatures. I take the truth and exaggerate it. My aim is to make it so each sentence could have been written by the real person but it\u2019s the combination of sentences that makes it ridiculous. I might look up someone\u2019s tweets, YouTube clips or articles, steal half their real words, then fluff the rest up. This morning I was doing Piers Morgan, Michael Parkinson and the Duchess of York discussing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a>. I find myself thinking in their voice. I\u2019m like a comical version of that fraudulent medium Doris Stokes.</p> <p><strong>Is there anyone you\u2019ve struggled to spoof?<br></strong>Anyone with a distinctive voice can be aped. Alan Bennett has been suggested but I can\u2019t see the point of parodying someone I wholeheartedly admire. I like nonsensical humour but not purposeless humour. There has to be some motivation to spark it. It\u2019s usually irritation [laughs]. Irritation is my daffodil, as it were. It\u2019s also difficult to do boring people, since they tend not to have a voice.

      "bodyText": "Craig Brown, 62, is an award-winning satirist, columnist and critic who has written the parodic diary in Private Eye since 1989. He\u2019s also the author of 18 books, including recent bestseller Ma\u2019am Darling: 99 Glimpses of Princess Margaret. His new book is One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time. How did your new book about the Beatles come about? I was working on a book about the River Thames and mentioned to my publisher that I had an idea for the next one: a big, kaleidoscopic book about the Beatles, similar to what I did with Princess Margaret. He emailed the next day to ask if I\u2019d be able to get it out by 10 April 2020 because that\u2019s the 50th anniversary of the Beatles\u2019 breakup. So I shelved the Thames one to do this. Are you glad you did? Very, because the Beatles story has got everything. It\u2019s a complete contrast to Princess Margaret\u2019s, which is a sort of stationary life. Theirs is a rags-to-riches human drama. Once they became successful, of course, it didn\u2019t make them happier. There\u2019s the sociological backdrop, the curious phenomenon of fandom, the array of interesting weirdos in their orbit\u2026 It\u2019s endlessly fascinating. The book is 600 pages but could\u2019ve been 10 times the length. Do you remember when you first heard the Beatles? I was 10 in 1967, so came in at the Sgt Pepper period. I also remember singing Yellow Submarine at boy scout camp. Did you ever meet any of the Fab Four? I briefly met Paul at a gig in 1973 and asked him to sign the only thing I had on me, which happened to be a Roxy Music album. I can\u2019t claim a lifelong friendship but he was very pleasant. Who was your favourite Beatle? Paul was the one I always wanted to be and since doing the book, he remains my favourite. He not only had this extraordinary genius for melody but for lyrics too. Things like She\u2019s Leaving Home, Eleanor Rigby and Here, There and Everywhere are so beautiful. The others often resented Paul for being the band\u2019s driving force but without him, they wouldn\u2019t have achieved nearly as much. How did your multicoloured approach to writing biographies evolve? I\u2019ve always found exhaustive biographies, which is most of them, boring. They recount details of no interest. My system is to cut those boring bits out. Dogged chronology is untrue to life, too. If you\u2019re thinking about your life, past, present and future all merges together, so I try to reflect that. You\u2019ve been writing your Private Eye diaries for 31 years now. That\u2019s 750-plus parodies\u2026 I suppose it is. I should get a gold watch. But fresh people come along all the time. There\u2019s been such an explosion of celebrity that the ducks line up for me. What\u2019s your technique? They\u2019re sort of verbal caricatures. I take the truth and exaggerate it. My aim is to make it so each sentence could have been written by the real person but it\u2019s the combination of sentences that makes it ridiculous. I might look up someone\u2019s tweets, YouTube clips or articles, steal half their real words, then fluff the rest up. This morning I was doing Piers Morgan, Michael Parkinson and the Duchess of York discussing the coronavirus. I find myself thinking in their voice. I\u2019m like a comical version of that fraudulent medium Doris Stokes. Is there anyone you\u2019ve struggled to spoof? Anyone with a distinctive voice can be aped. Alan Bennett has been suggested but I can\u2019t see the point of parodying someone I wholeheartedly admire. I like nonsensical humour but not purposeless humour. There has to be some motivation to spark it. It\u2019s usually irritation [laughs]. Irritation is my daffodil, as it were. It\u2019s also difficult to do boring people, since they tend not to have a voice. Iain Duncan Smith is quite tricky. Do your subjects see it as a badge of honour or do they react badly? Some enjoy the joke and I\u2019m happy they do, because some of my parodies are almost like appreciations. Then there are others where I really want to upset the person because they get on my nerves. Alan Sugar cancelled coming on Have I Got News for You after I did him, which was gratifying. Is it hard to satirise people like Trump and Johnson? Is the world getting beyond parody? If you were living through the reign of Henry VIII or Hitler\u2019s rise to power, you might be justified in saying that but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s true now. There\u2019s a rather good recent book by Andrew Gimson about the brief lives of the US presidents and it shows that some have been Trump\u2019s equal in their revoltingness and absurdity. You\u2019re very prolific. Does it feel that way? It does, I suppose. Then again, I mainly do humour, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going out to the Middle East like a war reporter or interviewing MPs like a lobby correspondent. Mine is a sort of imaginary journalism. Your wife\u2019s niece is Florence Welch. Are you a fan of Florence + the Machine\u2019s music? Absolutely, she\u2019s terrific. Whatever it is, she\u2019s just got it. My heart swells with pride whenever I see her on screen or stage. I think she\u2019ll be around for a long time. Which writer do you return to most often? John Updike is pretty reliable. I also love diaries like Kenneth Williams\u2019s. You\u2019ve been based in Aldeburgh, Suffolk for 25 years. What do you love about living there? When we moved here, a nice old poet called Bertie Lomas \u2013 who\u2019s since died \u2013 said you could prove Aldeburgh was the best place to live because it\u2019s the only seaside town of 3,000 people that has a bookshop, a cinema and a concert hall.

      "body": "<p>Charter flights to bring in agricultural workers from eastern Europe are needed as a matter of urgency, otherwise fruit and vegetables will be left unpicked in Britain\u2019s fields, the government is being warned.</p> <p>Some large farms have already been chartering planes to bring in labour from eastern Europe. But farming organisations and recruitment agencies say that, in the face of massive disruption to the agricultural sector caused by the spread of the coronavirus, the government needs to step in and help organise more flights.</p> <p>Some 90,000 positions need to be filled, many in just a few weeks\u2019 time. One leading supplier, the charity <a href=\"https://www.concordiavolunteers.org.uk/\">Concordia</a>, was looking to bring in around 10,000 labourers \u2013 half from the EU and the rest from Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Barbados. But all of the non-EU countries are closed. On Wednesday, in a big setback, Ukraine extended its lockdown from 2 April until 23 April.</p> <p>Stephanie Maurel, Concordia\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur recruitment outside the EU is stalled which leaves us with Lithuania, which has closed borders, Romania with no airplanes, and Bulgaria which is our little beacon.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Although Bulgaria is on countrywide lockdown, farm workers are classed as key workers and can move around the country. But most airlines that operate in Bulgaria \u2013 including EasyJet \u2013 are grounded. A Wizz Air flight bringing in 450 people landed a week ago on Saturday.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about chartering planes to bring workers in,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cIt costs around \u00a310,000 for an hour\u2019s flight carrying 229 people \u2013 that\u2019s \u20ac45,000 Sofia to London, or around \u20ac250 per person.\u201d</p> <p>Maurel, who said the plan was being actively discussed by both the National Farmers\u2019 Union and the Association of Labour Providers, called on the government to help provide urgent clarity.</p> <p>\u201cIf I put up reserves and guarantees [to secure a charter flight], I need to know it can take off.\u201d</p> <p>Some farms were struggling even before the crisis hit. A tightening of the labour market, a combination of Brexit and the booming domestic economies of eastern Europe proving more attractive to seasonal workers, had seen a decline in the number of fruit and vegetable pickers coming to the UK.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of the tightening of labour, we had already lost a percentage of farms,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cThis will finish others off. You won\u2019t have fruit and veg in shops. Asparagus and beans start in a couple of weeks, cucumbers early April, tomatoes are all year round; in May it\u2019s soft fruits \u2013 strawberries, raspberries; lettuces have been in the ground since December.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Marston, the chairman of British Summer Fruits, which represents soft fruit growers, acknowledged that his industry was \u201centering an unprecedented time\u201d.</p> <p>Last year, 98% of fruit pickers \u2013 now classed as \u201ckey workers\u201d \u2013 came from outside the UK, the vast majority from Bulgaria and Romania.</p> <p>British growers have been contacting companies in the hospitality sector to recruit laid-off staff.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.britishsummerfruits.co.uk/jobs\">British Summer Fruits website</a> carries an interactive map showing the locations of farms around the UK and the jobs on offer.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very optimistic about the ability of UK residents to come out and help us,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThey may be people from eastern Europe who were working here in the hospitality sector, who are relatively young and don\u2019t have that many ties and want a job paying reasonable pay in reasonable conditions.\u201d</p> <p>The environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cOur farmers are doing a fantastic job of feeding the nation during this immensely challenging time. I have been speaking with industry about the critically important issue of seasonal workers, who usually come from Europe to pick fruit and vegetables.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to mobilise the British workforce to fill that gap and make sure our excellent fruit and vegetables are on people\u2019s plates over the summer months. There are already brilliant recruitment efforts underway by industry and I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up.</p> <p>\u201cWe will also be looking at other ways to make sure farmers have support they need ahead of the busy harvest months, while also keeping workers safe and protected.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Charter flights to bring in agricultural workers from eastern Europe are needed as a matter of urgency, otherwise fruit and vegetables will be left unpicked in Britain\u2019s fields, the government is being warned. Some large farms have already been chartering planes to bring in labour from eastern Europe. But farming organisations and recruitment agencies say that, in the face of massive disruption to the agricultural sector caused by the spread of the coronavirus, the government needs to step in and help organise more flights. Some 90,000 positions need to be filled, many in just a few weeks\u2019 time. One leading supplier, the charity Concordia, was looking to bring in around 10,000 labourers \u2013 half from the EU and the rest from Russia, Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia and Barbados. But all of the non-EU countries are closed. On Wednesday, in a big setback, Ukraine extended its lockdown from 2 April until 23 April. Stephanie Maurel, Concordia\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cOur recruitment outside the EU is stalled which leaves us with Lithuania, which has closed borders, Romania with no airplanes, and Bulgaria which is our little beacon.\u201d Although Bulgaria is on countrywide lockdown, farm workers are classed as key workers and can move around the country. But most airlines that operate in Bulgaria \u2013 including EasyJet \u2013 are grounded. A Wizz Air flight bringing in 450 people landed a week ago on Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about chartering planes to bring workers in,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cIt costs around \u00a310,000 for an hour\u2019s flight carrying 229 people \u2013 that\u2019s \u20ac45,000 Sofia to London, or around \u20ac250 per person.\u201d Maurel, who said the plan was being actively discussed by both the National Farmers\u2019 Union and the Association of Labour Providers, called on the government to help provide urgent clarity. \u201cIf I put up reserves and guarantees [to secure a charter flight], I need to know it can take off.\u201d Some farms were struggling even before the crisis hit. A tightening of the labour market, a combination of Brexit and the booming domestic economies of eastern Europe proving more attractive to seasonal workers, had seen a decline in the number of fruit and vegetable pickers coming to the UK. \u201cBecause of the tightening of labour, we had already lost a percentage of farms,\u201d Maurel said. \u201cThis will finish others off. You won\u2019t have fruit and veg in shops. Asparagus and beans start in a couple of weeks, cucumbers early April, tomatoes are all year round; in May it\u2019s soft fruits \u2013 strawberries, raspberries; lettuces have been in the ground since December.\u201d Nick Marston, the chairman of British Summer Fruits, which represents soft fruit growers, acknowledged that his industry was \u201centering an unprecedented time\u201d. Last year, 98% of fruit pickers \u2013 now classed as \u201ckey workers\u201d \u2013 came from outside the UK, the vast majority from Bulgaria and Romania. British growers have been contacting companies in the hospitality sector to recruit laid-off staff. The British Summer Fruits website carries an interactive map showing the locations of farms around the UK and the jobs on offer. \u201cWe are very optimistic about the ability of UK residents to come out and help us,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThey may be people from eastern Europe who were working here in the hospitality sector, who are relatively young and don\u2019t have that many ties and want a job paying reasonable pay in reasonable conditions.\u201d The environment secretary, George Eustice said: \u201cOur farmers are doing a fantastic job of feeding the nation during this immensely challenging time. I have been speaking with industry about the critically important issue of seasonal workers, who usually come from Europe to pick fruit and vegetables. \u201cWe need to mobilise the British workforce to fill that gap and make sure our excellent fruit and vegetables are on people\u2019s plates over the summer months. There are already brilliant recruitment efforts underway by industry and I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up. \u201cWe will also be looking at other ways to make sure farmers have support they need ahead of the busy harvest months, while also keeping workers safe and protected.\u201d",

Even Ivor Novello, composer of the famous first world war song, Keep the Home Fires Burning, was jailed for four weeks in 1944 for the misuse of petrol coupons given to him by a female fan and by the end of the war there had been more than 114,000 prosecutions for black marketeering. So far today, overall crime figures have dropped. Andy Cooke, the Merseyside chief constable, noted on Wednesday that \u201cthere is less violence from pub fights, less burglaries as everyone is at home\u201d but warns that \u201cwhat you will see are increases in domestic violence, with people cooped up in the same home, and internet crime such as fraud and scams\u201d. Profiteering from the current crisis is already under way at an international level. Last week, US customs officers seized what appeared to be fake Covid-19 tests at Los Angeles airport in a package that had come from Britain. Jury trials are currently suspended for the foreseeable future but when they return those who have used the virus for their own ends may find that \u201clockdown\u201d in Wormwood Scrubs or Barlinnie jail is not quite as cosy and public-spirited as the one currently imposed on the nation. In 1941, at the height of the blitz, one Harry Dobkin strangled his wife, Rachel, and left her body at a London bomb site in the hope that she would be seen as a victim of the Luftwaffe rather than a cunning husband. He didn\u2019t get away with it and was hanged in Wandsworth prison. So far there have been no reports of similar opportunistic attempts but who knows, with the police\u2019s attention elsewhere and few potential witnesses on the street, what quiet gangland revenge plot could now be under way to arrange the \u201csocial distancing\u201d of a rival for ever?",

It\u2019s not just about typing in your pyjamas (though obviously that\u2019s a major perk). As all we seasoned home-workers know, the needs of the house, and its occupants, tend to seep osmosis-style into your personal workspace. Show me the child who cares one jot about your deadlines.

This is a time for us all to pull together as one. Still, habitual office-goers of Britain, admit it \u2013 working from home isn\u2019t such a doddle, is it? I\u2019ve been noticing items about lawyers, business types and the like, who\u2019ve been forced to work from home, trying to carve out a modicum of workspace privacy, in some cases, putting \u201camusing\u201d signs on home office doors to keep the kids away. Ha ha ha! Amateurs! People across the land seem to be finding out that working from home isn\u2019t the cushy number it\u2019s made out to be. It\u2019s not just about typing in your pyjamas (though obviously that\u2019s a major perk). As all we seasoned home-workers know, the needs of the house, and its occupants, tend to seep osmosis-style into your personal workspace. Show me the child who cares one jot about your deadlines. Feel the deepening rage when somebody wonders if you could just pop some washing on if you \u201cget a mo\u201d. And so on. Every minute of every hour of every day. For ever. Perhaps now it\u2019s clearer to office-bound folk that one doesn\u2019t have to travel to another building to be working. One positive thing to emerge from all this may be some overdue respect for the nation\u2019s stoic, beleaguered home-workers. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

The number of people to have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus rose to 1,019, up from 759 yesterday \u2013 a dramatic increase of 260. Broken down, a further 246 people died in England, a further four in Wales, a further seven in Scotland, and a further two people died in Northern Ireland. If the number of deaths can be kept below 20,000 the government will have done well, said the medical director of NHS England, Stephen Powis. He said we can still beat coronavirus but only if people take physical distancing measures seriously, to reduce the transmission of the virus. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, announced changes to insolvency rules to allow firms greater flexibility as they face the current crisis. The measures, Sharma said, would allow firms extra time to keep trading. The Home Office will pause evictions and terminations of asylum support for the next three months, even if someone\u2019s claim or appeal has been decided. A third cabinet member is self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, is the third cabinet member to self-isolate after he developed a cough and mild temperature. He has yet to be tested. Prisoners in Scotland who are approaching the end of their sentences could be released from next week, as the Scottish government moves to prevent an \u201cincreasingly alarming\u201d coronavirus crisis in the country\u2019s jails. Boots has opened two drive-through testing sites for NHS workers with coronavirus symptoms. Testing will initially be for NHS staff by invitation only and will be free of charge. Burberry became the first leading British fashion house to pledge resources to the NHS fightback against Covid-19. The company will deliver surgical masks to NHS staff and produce non-surgical gowns and masks for patients. The Local Government Association has called for members of the public to respect the \u201ctireless efforts\u201d of council staff, following reports of council workers being subjected to verbal and physical abuse in public. There\u2019s been an average of 30% increase in deaths each day in the UK, higher than Spain and Italy at this point who were closer to 25%, a correspondent at Sky News says. There will be improvements in the insolvency system, so that businesses facing bust will be supported. The Medical Director of the NHS said that if deaths remain below 20,000 we\u2019ll have \u201cdone very well\u201d. London is not yet at capacity, but is being expanded constantly. Recovery areas and operating theatres, as well as Nightingale hospitals, are being used to treat patients. Testing will be increased for NHS staff \u201cin recent days\u201d. Another plea was made to the public to act responsibly, saying we all had the chance to \u201csave a life\u201d. \u201cYou have the chance to save a life,\u201d Powis says. \u201cIt really is as simple as that,\u201d he says. \u201cAvoid contact with others, stay at home, and if you\u2019re symptomatic, isolate. That will result in fewer deaths.\u201d Powis reiterates that 20,000 deaths in the UK is a \u201cgood result\u201d, although each one is a tragedy. On personal protective equipment, Powis says that supplies are coming in constantly. About 170m masks have come in to hospitals in recent weeks, and 40m gloves and 25m face masks in recent days. Sharma adds that suppliers have been asked to prioritise PPE over any other products. Sharma said that companies who were required to hold annual general meetings would be able to do so flexibly in a matter compatible with public health guidance. \u201cThis might include postponing or holding the AGM online, or by phone using only proxy voting,\u201d he said. Sharma says that the Foreign Office are working hard to organise more charter flights to get Britons stranded abroad home. The business secretary has announced changes to insolvency rules to allow firms \u201cgreater flexibility as they face the current crisis\u201d. \u201cIt is crucial when the crisis passes, as it will, we are ready to bounce back,\u201d Sharma said, as he detailed measures to help businesses \u201cemerge intact the other side of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. \u201cThese measures will give those firms extra time and space to weather the storm and be ready when the crisis ends whilst ensuring creditors get the best return possible in the circumstances,\u201d he continued. The new rules will allow companies undergoing restructuring to continue access to supplies and raw materials. And, he said, there would be a temporary suspension of wrongful trading provisions for company directors to remove the threat of personal liability during the pandemic, which will apply retrospectively from 1 March. \u201cHowever, to be clear, all of the other checks and balances that help to ensure directors fulfil their duties properly will remain in force.\u201d When asked if the government can turn the tide sooner than 12 weeks, Sharma says they\u2019re guided by medical advice. Sharma reiterates that where possible people should work from home, and puts responsibility on employers to follow PHE guidelines and keep their employees safe. If they aren\u2019t doing this, regulatory organisations should be told, he says. Deaths in the UK have reached 1,019. \u201cWe can beat this virus, we can reduce the number of deaths,\u201d Powis says, but only if the people take social distancing measures seriously. \u201cEvery one of us has a part to play, and we know it can work.\u201d Powis says that if the government can keep deaths below 20,000 during this epidemic, it will have done well. Boris Johnson is showing mild symptoms but continues to lead the country\u2019s effort in combating Covid-19, chairing a meeting this morning, Alok Sharma says. It is absolutely critical to introduce testing for NHS staff, Powis says. He says they\u2019re ramping up testing all the time to test NHS staff, and that they\u2019re working with NHS organisations \u201cas I speak\u201d, and an increases in tests should be in place in coming days. Stephen Powis, medical director of NHS England, says London is not yet at capacity, but new beds are being opened all the time. Another 500 beds coming via operation Nightingale are set to become available next week. The daily briefing with business secretary Alok Sharma has just begun. He has announced that the government will be removing administrative barriers to production of face masks and hand sanitiser. Sharma said \u201cred tape\u201d would be reduced to allow new producers of hand sanitiser to bring products to market \u201cin a matter of days\u201d. \u201cWe are also introducing a range of measures to boost the supply of personal protective equipment, such as face masks, to protect frontline NHS staff,\u201d he told the daily coronavirus press conference in Downing Street. \u201cAnd we\u2019re removing administrative barriers to the production of hand sanitiser. By reducing the amount of red tape, new suppliers and businesses that produce ingredients for safe hand sanitiser will be able to bring their products to market in a matter of days.\u201d Hello, this is Molly Blackall taking over the live blog. I\u2019ll be sharing all the updates on coronavirus as they come through, beginning with the government\u2019s daily briefing which is due to start any minute. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter, @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to everything, but will try to read it all. Thanks in advance! The government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference will take place shortly, fronted by the business secretary, Alok Sharma, and NHS England\u2019s medical director, Stephen Powis. England women\u2019s cricket captain Heather Knight is one of more than 700,000 people who have signed up for the NHS volunteer scheme launched to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. Knight said: I have a lot of free time on my hands and I want to help as much as I can. My brother and his partner are doctors, and I have a few friends who work in the NHS, so I know how hard they are working and how difficult it is for everyone. I\u2019m going to get the car out as I\u2019ve volunteered to transport medicine, and also speak to people who are self-isolating. If someone is home alone, you can ring them up and chat. They have had so many people sign up. Reacting to the latest figures confirming that 1,019 patients in the UK have now died, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the toll can be expected to grow substantially in the coming weeks and people must continue to adhere to physical distancing. He said: The news that we have passed the milestone of 1,000 Covid-19 deaths, while very sad, is unsurprising. Over the coming weeks we can expect to see the UK\u2019s toll of the disease grow substantially, with increasingly large day-on-day numbers of the deceased. It is widely anticipated that we will reach a peak of numbers in around a fortnight, but it should be remembered that the strategy of suppressing the peak, will cause it to broaden and we will see peak mortality level off and stay high for some time before it starts to decrease. It\u2019s therefore essential that people observe social distancing rules in order to start to turn the tide on the coronavirus. Students and staff at the University of Lincoln\u2019s school of engineering are manufacturing safety visors and producing ventilators to help healthcare workers in United Lincolnshire hospitals NHS trust. Prof Mary Stuart, vice-chancellor of the university, said: As a university we have a responsibility to serve the community in which we sit, and there has never been a more important time for us to step up and try to make a positive difference to the immense challenges faced by the health service in combating the Covid-19 virus. We are moving as quickly as we can to support our local community, and the university is contributing a large part of the cost needed to produce the equipment, but we are asking for your help to raise the remaining funds required. Any amount you can give matters; I know that together, we can make a difference, and I hope as many of you as possible can support our efforts. If you would like to contribute to the campaign, here is the JustGiving page. A rocket launch startup has said all of its UK operations are now geared towards tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. The Edinburgh-based rocket company, Skyrora said it is now producing face visors using its 3D-printing facilities along with hand sanitiser, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s guidelines. It aims to produce more than 10,000 250ml bottles of hand sanitiser per week. Skyrora said it is in discussions with the Scottish government to determine where their 3D-printed face visors can have the largest impact on protecting health workers. Initial tests are being completed before mass production can begin. Volodymyr Levykin, chief executive officer of Skyrora, said: We all must answer to the government and NHS for support and Skyrora is in a fortunate enough position to do so. We are confident that we will get through this stronger. The startup, founded in 2017, had been working towards test flights of its first spacecraft, and there are surprising links between rocketry and hand sanitiser, TechCrunch reported. Ethanol, the form of alcohol which provides the main disinfecting ingredient in hand sanitizer, was used in early rocket fuel. However, Skyrora\u2019s \u201cEcosene\u201d fuel is a type of kerosene \u2013 a more modern rocket fuel ingredient. Lidl has announced it will be donating thousands of its fresh fruit and vegetable bags to NHS staff across the country in an effort to help provide frontline health workers with fresh produce. The initiative comes through the retailer\u2019s partnership with Royal Voluntary Service, which is committed to supporting those who need it most in hospitals and communities around the country. The Lidl bags will be distributed to NHS staff at hospital sites UK-wide, getting fresh fruit and vegetables into the hands of frontline health workers. Christian H\u00e4rtnagel, CEO of Lidl GB, said: We are so grateful to the NHS and all of its staff for their hard work every day to help keep the nation safe. This is our small gesture to say thank you, and help provide NHS staff, who may not be able to get into store regularly for basic groceries, with fresh fruit and vegetables. We hope that through working with Royal Voluntary service to donate these bags to hospitals, we can help make a difference to their daily life. Burberry will leverage its global supply chain to fast-track the delivery of more than 100,000 surgical masks to the NHS for its medical staff. It is the latest British company to throw its weight behind the fight against coronavirus and the first major UK fashion house to do so. The luxury label will also repurpose its trench coat factory in Yorkshire to make non-surgical gowns and masks for patients. It is also funding research into a single-dose vaccine developed by the University of Oxford that is on course to begin human trials next month. Marco Gobbetti, CEO of Burberry, said: In challenging times, we must pull together. The whole team at Burberry is very proud to be able to support those who are working tirelessly to combat Covid-19, whether by treating patients, working to find a vaccine solution or helping provide food supplies to those in need at this time. Covid-19 has fundamentally changed our everyday lives, but we hope that the support we provide will go some way towards saving more lives, bringing the virus under control and helping our world recover from this devastating pandemic. Coventry rugby club have taken legal advice and launched a petition that has been signed by thousands of businesses in the leisure industry after the Championship club\u2019s insurer refused to pay out when the season ended prematurely. Income from the club\u2019s stadium, Butts Park Arena, stopped abruptly because of the coronavirus lockdown, leaving them with a shortfall of \u00a3750,000. Backer Jon Sharp stepped in to keep the club afloat and ensure this month\u2019s wages were paid. The Midlands outfit fear that their dire circumstances are commonplace outside the rugby union elite, and that some clubs will go to the wall without help and a change in insurers\u2019 policies. Coventry\u2019s managing director, Nick Johnston, said: We pay \u00a330,000 a year for insurance and were covered by notifiable diseases under the business disruption clause. We were turned down because no one employed by us has tested positive for the virus, and the excuse another Championship club was given was that Covid-19 was not listed among the diseases covered. It is new, so how could it be? We are one of many businesses throughout the land in this position and we have taken legal counsel. I appreciate that the [government\u2019s] priority is saving lives but make no mistake, we are talking about the future of rugby clubs. Read the full exclusive story here. A 14-year-old boy has been charged after a 66-year-old woman was coughed on and spat at in Tameside, Greater Manchester. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with one count of section 39 assault and will appear at Tameside youth ourt on April 7, Greater Manchester police said. Officers were called just before 8.30pm on 17 March to a report that a boy had been coughing and shouting \u201ccoronavirus\u201d at a woman in Ashton-under-Lyne town centre. The Department of Health and SocialCare said another 260 people across the UK had died in the 24 hours up to 5pm on Friday, marking a dramatic one-day rise from 759 \u2013 by far the largest since the outbreak began. The total number of deaths is now 34% higher than the equivalent figure yesterday, the largest day-on-day percentage increase since 18 March, when the total rose from 71 to 104 \u2013 a 46% jump. In England, a further 246 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths there to 935, NHS England said. \u201cPatients were aged between 33 and 100 years old and all but 13 (aged between 63 and 99 years old) had underlying health conditions,\u201d it said in a statement. A further four people died from coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths there to 38, health officials have said, adding there are 172 new confirmed cases \u2013 bringing the total number to 1,093. Dr Robin Howe, incident director for the Covid-19 outbreak response at Public Health Wales, warned that the true number of cases was likely to be higher: Coronavirus is now circulating in every part of Wales. The single most important action we can all take in fighting coronavirus is to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, and save lives. We know that staying at home can be hard, and we want to thank each and every person across Wales for doing their bit to help slow the spread of the virus. In Scotland, a further seven people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total there to 40, the Scottish government announced. Two further people with Covid-19 have died in Northern Ireland, taking the toll to 15, the nation\u2019s Public Health Agency said. There were also 49 new positive cases of coronavirus confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of known cases there to 324. Across the UK, a total of 120,776 people have been tested for coronavirus as of 9am on March 28, with 17,089 positive results. As of 5pm on Friday, of those threated in hospital in the UK, 1,019 have died. Police have warned they will take robust action against anyone who coughs on people while claiming to have coronavirus to frighten them. Officers said they are aware of a number of incidents where people have deliberately coughed, or threatened to cough, on elderly or vulnerable people after suggesting they are infected with Covid-19. Police Scotland said it was not a \u201charmless prank\u201d and was extremely upsetting for victims. Ch Supt David Duncan said: These are difficult times and we all need to look out for others and do what we can to keep our communities as safe as possible. We\u2019ve become aware of a number of incidents where people have suggested they are infected with coronavirus and deliberately coughed, or threatened to cough, on elderly or vulnerable people. This is not a harmless prank - this is extremely upsetting to victims and causes fear and increased anxiety at an already stressful time. We will not tolerate this kind of behaviour and we will take robust action against anyone threatening other people in this way. The call comes after police confirmed a group of teenagers in Cheshire who claimed to have coronavirus and deliberately coughed at NHS staff would be prosecuted. Meanwhile, a man in Manchester has also been charged with assault after allegedly coughing at a police officer and claiming to have the coronavirus. Greater Manchester police said Mateusz Rejewski, 33, of no fixed abode, was charged with one count of common assault on an emergency service worker \u2013 who is now self-isolating as a precaution \u2013 and one count of breaching a dispersal notice. Rejewski has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester magistrates court on Tuesday. Police have urged motorcyclists to stay out of the countryside and told them they cannot claim it is part of their permitted daily exercise. Insp Mark Gee, manning a vehicle check point in Richmondshire, North Yorkshire, said: We have had motorcyclists coming into the Dales claiming they are exercising. We have to remind people, exercise should be done from your home address, on foot unless you\u2019re on a bike. Every time you are on a road there\u2019s an increased chance of a collision and if that happens, it is putting a strain on our local NHS resources which are limited in any case, even without us facing a worldwide crisis. Meanwhile, in North Wales, officers have criticised a driver who took their child out for a driving lesson because they wanted to make the most of the quiet roads, saying this was not an essential journey. And in Bournemouth a woman has been arrested after \u201cendlessly driving around for no reason\u201d, police said. In a Facebook post, the force said an officer \u201cpleaded\u201d with the woman to go home before she swore at him and told him: \u201cI\u2019ll do what I like\u201d. Police said she was then arrested for breaching a dispersal notice, the BBC reported. Fitness coach Joe Wicks has said he is donating \u201cevery single penny\u201d of the money made by his online PE sessions to the NHS. Wicks\u2019s YouTube channel, The Body Coach, has live fitness sessions aimed at children in a bid to help them stay active while the UK is in lockdown and schools are closed. In the first two days alone, more than 5 million people had viewed his lessons. A medical fetish site says it has donated its entire stock of disposable scrubs to an NHS hospital that was \u201cdesperate\u201d for supplies. In a thread posted on Twitter, MedFetUK wrote: We have been contacted this week by representatives of NHS procurement all over the country, trying to source basic protective equipment and clothing. When we, a tiny company set up to serve a small section of the kink community, find ourselves being sought out as a last-resort supplier to our National Health Service in a time of crisis, something is seriously wrong. In fact, it\u2019s scandalous. Last night the British Red Cross says it received a letter from the Home Office minister Chris Philp announcing that people will not be evicted from asylum accommodation for the next three months, even if their claim has been rejected, as part of measures to combat the coronavirus outbreak. In the letter the minister said: The practical outcome is that those who would ordinarily have their support stopped because their asylum claim or appeal has been rejected, will remain accommodated. I expect this decision to considerably relieve pressures on local authorities. Philp said that those who are granted refugee status, and so would be required to make their own arrangements, will also be able to remain in their current accommodation. The decision will be reviewed before the end of June. Welcoming the decision on Twitter, the charity said this will ensure that almost 50,000 people currently housed by the Home Office have the same protection against eviction as those in private accommodation, and financial support will also continue. A full list of the changes can be found on the Refugee Council website here. The secretary of state for Scotland, Alister Jack, is self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. He is the third cabinet member, after Boris Johnson and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday, to self-isolate after experiencing symptoms. In the past 24 hours, Jack said he had developed a cough and mild temperature so was self-isolating and working from home. He has yet to be tested. Prisoners in Scotland who are approaching the end of their sentences could be released from next week, as the Scottish government moves to prevent an \u201cincreasingly alarming\u201d coronavirus crisis in the country\u2019s jails. Boots has opened two drive-through testing sites for NHS workers with coronavirus symptoms. Testing will initially be for NHS staff by invitation only and will be free of charge. The Local Government Association has called for members of the public to respect the \u201ctireless efforts\u201d of council staff, following reports of council workers being subjected to verbal and physical abuse in public. A third member of Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. The secretary of tate for Scotland, Alister Jack, said: In the past 24 hours, I have developed mild symptoms associated with coronavirus. In line with medical guidance, I am self-isolating and working from home. The Conservative MP for Dumfries and Galloway has a mild temperature and a cough and has not been tested. Boots has opened testing sites to be able to test NHS workers showing coronavirus symptoms free of charge at drive-through centres. The company opened facilities at its headquarters in Nottingham and at Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey to support the government\u2019s bid to test doctors and nurses who have been self-isolating and are unsure whether they have the virus. Boots said locations for more test centres are still being defined around the country, but they will not be in its stores. The sites will initially be for NHS staff by invitation only. Richard Bradley, pharmacy director for Boots UK, told PA: We are here today at the home of Boots in Beeston, Nottingham, to open a testing site for Covid-19 to be able to test NHS workers completely free of charge so that they can return to work to support their colleagues on the frontline. In the first instance, the tests are for the NHS workers who are isolating themselves, unsure if they have Covid-19 or not. Council workers have been spat on and sworn at as they carry out their duties during the coronavirus crisis \u2013 while one had his leg broken after a cyclist rode into him. The Local Government Association (LGA) said there had been a number of \u201csickening physical and verbal assaults\u201d on workers as it called on the public to respect the \u201ctireless efforts\u201d of council staff. Southend-on-Sea borough council said police were investigating after a cyclist rode into a community safety patrol officer and broke his leg on Thursday. The incident, which took place in Southend High Street, was captured on CCTV. Meanwhile, Swindon borough council reported that staff at its household waste recycling centre had been \u201cspat and sworn at\u201d last weekend, when the site was restricted to essential recycling only. Councillor James Jamieson, the chairman of the LGA, said: Local government workers should always be respected and valued - even more so in these challenging times - when they are needed more than ever. It is becoming increasingly concerning to hear that local government workers are being subjected to physical and verbal abuse as they try and play their part in keeping the country running through this crisis. This is unacceptable, and it has to stop. Prisoners in Scotland who are approaching the end of their sentences could be released from next week, as the Scottish government moves to prevent an \u201cincreasingly alarming\u201d coronavirus crisis in the country\u2019s jails. Scotland\u2019s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said on Friday that he was \u201cactively considering\u201d options for early release: I cannot envisage a situation where we\u2019re seeing the rate of infection, the spread of the virus in our prison establishment, the rate of absence amongst our prison officers and staff, where we do not release prisoners to make that a safer environment. Yousaf told BBC Scotland\u2019s The Nine: We are actively looking at options to do that. It could happen as early as next week. The situation is increasingly alarming. As of Friday, the Scottish Prison Service confirmed that 111 individuals across 10 establishments were self-isolating. Get the full story here. With birthdays and other celebrations no exception to the rules of physical distancing and remaining confined to our homes, one-year-old David\u2019s grandparents pulled out all the stops to recreate that scene from Love, Actually to wish him a happy birthday through the front window. You can read more about how neighbours around the country have been rallying to mark birthdays while in isolation here. Lidl is to roll out thousands of reusable protective safety visors to its staff working in its 800 supermarkets in England, Scotland and Wales, to ensure the safety of its workforce and customers. The safety visors will help create a barrier between staff and customers during conversation at a safe distance. Made to be worn multiple times, they are easy to wipe down and disinfect after wear. Christian H\u00e4rtnagel, chief executive of Lidl GB, commented: We\u2019re committed to ensuring our colleagues and customers feel safe, which is why we\u2019re providing all stores here in Great Britain with safety visors. On Tuesday it said it would be installing thousands of safety screens at checkouts as well as creating up to 2,500 new store jobs to provide necessary additional support to its workforce and customers. Frozen food specialist Iceland has ordered protective gloves and face masks for staff although managing director Richard Walker told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that huge demand meant the masks were unlikely to arrive in store until next week. A man has urged the British people to stay at home in an emotional video filmed hours after losing his mother to coronavirus. Stuart Hamlin\u2019s mother, Tracy, was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms and died four days later. I\u2019m doing this because I want people to understand that this virus is not a joke. Losing someone is hard enough, but not being able to hold your family close when you do is the most gut-wrenching pain I\u2019ve ever felt in my life. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has called on school staff to do what they can to keep schools open for NHS staff and carers during the two weeks that would have been the Easter holidays. Speaking in a video on Twitter, Williams said: In this time of national need, our school community has stepped up and met the challenge. More than 700 schools have stayed open to look after the children of NHS staff, carers, people who are saving lives. I am now asking you to do more and keep schools open during what would have been school holidays. It has never been more important for our children and young people to be surrounded by the people they know and trust. I am asking you to be flexible, and to offer up some time during the Easter period to continue to support both vulnerable children and the families of our critical workers. Williams said she was not asking school staff to put themselves at risk and reiterated that teachers should follow the latest Welsh government guidance of making school settings safe and the latest public health advice. The minister also confirmed that the current provision of assistance to families of children in receipt of free school meals would include the Easter school holiday period. Following the news yesterday that the prime minister had tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating and faces accusations of complacency in adhering to his advice on physical distancing, let us cast our minds back to Boris Johnson\u2019s comments at a news briefing earlier this month. I was at a hospital the other night where, I think, there were actually a few coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you\u2019ll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands. That aged well. Good morning. Hundreds of frontline NHS workers in England will begin being tested for coronavirus this weekend, starting with critical care doctors and nurses. The move, announced yesterday, follows much criticism over the lack of testing for health workers during the outbreak so far. Boris Johnson will continue commanding the response to the coronavirus pandemic while self-isolating in Downing Street after testing positive for the disease yesterday. The head of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council has told the Times (paywall) that with another sunny weekend is upon us, the public need to be aware that \u201cthis is a national emergency not a national holiday\u201d. Martin Hewitt told the public to respect the rules of the lockdown, as police face a battle to prevent people from leaving their homes.

Home Office minister Chris Philp wrote to the charity on Friday to confirm that people would not be asked to leave their asylum accommodation once their claim or appeal had been decided. The move, which will be reviewed in June this year, comes in response to measures introduced this week ensuring people do not leave their homes unnecessarily to prevent the spread of Covid-19. In a letter to the charity, Philp said: \u201cThe practical outcome is that those who would ordinarily have their support stopped because their asylum claim or appeal has been rejected, will remain accommodated.\u201d He said that those who had been granted refugee status - and so would normally be required to make their own arrangements - would also be able to remain in their current accommodation. \u201cI expect this decision to considerably relieve pressures on local authorities,\u201d he added. Home Office officials have asked accommodation providers to source additional capacity across the UK in anticipation that the changes will mean the supported asylum population will grow. The British Red Cross welcomed the announcement after it had called on the Home Office to take urgent steps to bring the asylum system in line with the lockdown guidance. The announcement would mean that about 50,000 people were spared the threat of losing their accommodation in the coming months, it added. Alex Fraser, UK director of refugee support and restoring family links at the British Red Cross, said: \u201cNobody should be at risk of homelessness and destitution, and this is an important first step to ensuring that people are able to protect themselves, their families and their communities. \u201cSteps like this are vital to ensuring that everyone has access to secure accommodation, financial support and healthcare at this time.

      "body": "<p>Where did the virus causing the current pandemic come from? How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">A study of its genetic s</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9\">equence</a>, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories.</p> <p>The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen\u2019s team showed \u2013 like the Chinese before them \u2013that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in \u201cwet\u201d markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can\u2019t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.</p> <p>If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin \u2013 or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host \u2013 occur?</p> <p>\u201cOur study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cHowever, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.\u201d</p> <p>Case closed then, and President Trump is right to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">call S</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">ars-CoV-2 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d</a>. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago \u2013 since Chinese people\u2019s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new \u2013 you have to include a number of other factors. \u201cWe can blame the object \u2013 the virus, the cultural practice \u2013 but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af1a5624e7aad3f184147d07b18c1f58af9f6e76/0_185_4000_2401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, in China\u2019s Hubei Province, in January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">as anthropologists </a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\">Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/why-shutting-down-chinese-wet-markets-could-be-a-terrible-mistake-130625\"> have documented</a>, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming \u201cwild\u201d species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren\u2019t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too \u2013 closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.</p> <p>It\u2019s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.</p> <p><br>Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. \u201cThere is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,\u201d says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e0573688276e584fe1409eb5358e14f24d95fff/0_41_3008_1806/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pangolin, the scaly mammal thought to be a possible intermediate host for the coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: N/A</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace\u2019s 2016 book <em><a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781583675892/big-farms-make-big-flu/\">Big Farms Make Big Flu</a></em>, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another \u2013 having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus\u2019s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2018.00084/full\">a paper published in 2018</a>, Gilbert\u2019s group reviewed historical \u201cconversion events\u201d, as they call them \u2013 when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu \u2013 H5N1 and H7N9 \u2013 have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, \u201cnothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a48b0309e695838ee46c8ce80a8107f492bff522/0_24_4928_2959/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A banner reading \u201cWe are all pangolins\u201d hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A banner reading \u2018We are all pangolins\u2019 hangs on a balcony in Bordeaux, France. The entire country has been on coronavirus lockdown since 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicolas Tucat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>China is one of the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.worldstopexports.com/chicken-exports-by-country/\">major exporters of poultry</a>, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs diversified its holdings and <a href=\"https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2008/08/goldman-sachs-buys-chinese-poultry-farms\">moved into Chinese poultry farms</a>. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn\u2019t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d</p> <p>Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.</p> <p>Still, Worobey doesn\u2019t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year \u2013 but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible \u2013 though by no means certain \u2013 that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago \u2013 drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs \u2013 another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24531761\">A few years ago, Worobey suggested</a> \u2013 controversially \u2013 that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses.

      "bodyText": "Where did the virus causing the current pandemic come from? How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading. Let\u2019s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. A study of its genetic sequence, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered. Puff go the conspiracy theories. The next step is a little less certain, but it seems likely that the original animal reservoir for the virus was bats. Andersen\u2019s team showed \u2013 like the Chinese before them \u2013that the sequence of Sars-CoV-2 is similar to other coronaviruses that infect bats. Since other bat coronaviruses have transited to humans via an intermediate animal host, it seems likely that this one did too. That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in \u201cwet\u201d markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can\u2019t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins. If this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin \u2013 or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host \u2013 occur? \u201cOur study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cHowever, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.\u201d Case closed then, and President Trump is right to call Sars-CoV-2 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago \u2013 since Chinese people\u2019s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new \u2013 you have to include a number of other factors. \u201cWe can blame the object \u2013 the virus, the cultural practice \u2013 but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota. Starting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, as anthropologists Lyle Fearnley and Christos Lynteris have documented, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming \u201cwild\u201d species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren\u2019t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too \u2013 closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover. It\u2019s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses. Take flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. \u201cThere is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,\u201d says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium. The reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace\u2019s 2016 book Big Farms Make Big Flu, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another \u2013 having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus\u2019s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble. In a paper published in 2018, Gilbert\u2019s group reviewed historical \u201cconversion events\u201d, as they call them \u2013 when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China. That doesn\u2019t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu \u2013 H5N1 and H7N9 \u2013 have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, \u201cnothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.\u201d China is one of the world\u2019s major exporters of poultry, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs diversified its holdings and moved into Chinese poultry farms. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn\u2019t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d Not everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place. Still, Worobey doesn\u2019t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year \u2013 but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events. It\u2019s possible \u2013 though by no means certain \u2013 that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago \u2013 drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs \u2013 another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. A few years ago, Worobey suggested \u2013 controversially \u2013 that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it\u2019s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans. Not everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, \u201cmost avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation\u201d, and they don\u2019t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds \u2013 especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now. And we\u2019re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was first described in the US in the late 1980s, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. A 2015 study carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US \u2013 the largest global exporters of pigs \u2013 are also the largest exporters of swine flu. There have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been blocked by mainstream news organisations as \u201cpartly false\u201d. But the claims are also partly true.

The Higher Health Institute (ISS) said that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic in Italy was approaching. \u201cWe have seen an apparent reduction in the infection curve since 20 March but we are not yet in a downward phase,\u201d ISS president Silvio Brusaferro told the Italian press agency ANSA.",

In a letter to the health secretary, the politically neutral Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) said sufficient supplies of good quality personal protective equipment (PPE) were required immediately amid growing concern for those who have worked closely with suspected Covid-19 patients. It cited reports of PPE stock failing to reach social care workers despite reports of deliveries, as evidence grows of a devastating shortage of protective gear after it emerged previous high-level medical advice to provide NHS staff with certain protective equipment was rejected in 2017 because stockpiling it would be too expensive. \u201cEnsuring [social workers\u2019] safety must be the number one priority alongside the safety of those they are supporting,\u201d the letter from ADASS resident Julie Ogley and LGA chairman Cllr James Jamieson said. \u201cDespite welcome recognition from government of the importance of PPE, we continue to receive daily reports from colleagues that essential supplies are not getting through to the social care frontline.\u201d The letter, first reported by the Local Government Chronicle, described the current tasks for thousands of social workers in regulated and non-regulated services as \u201cdangerous\u201d and warned they were putting themselves, their families and their communities at risk with the lack of protective equipment. \u201cFurthermore, national reporting that equipment has been delivered to providers on the CQC registered list does not tally with colleagues\u2019 experience on the ground,\u201d the letter added. \u201cOf equal concern, there is a notable lack of confidence in national planning for, and provision of, PPE for the thousands of people who work in non-regulated services, such as personal assistants.\u201d Social workers have been advised to contact their local council, according to Ogley and Jamieson, despite councils not having PPE stocks to distribute, while the available stocks are in some cases unfit for purpose. \u201cWe have been sent pictures of PPE that is used, dirty and damaged,\u201d they added. \u201cThis cannot and will not be used.

Some are also experiencing staff shortages as symptomatic care workers self-isolate. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, and there have been multiple deaths within single care homes in the US and Spain. MHA, which runs 200 care homes, said this week that there had been deaths where the disease was suspected, but that there was no way of confirming the outbreak because of the absence of testing for care home staff. The Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need to tackle this outbreak. \u201cThe full weight of the government is behind this effort and we are working closely with industry and social care providers to make sure care staff have the protection they deserve.\u201d On Wednesday, NHS England said some 55m more items of PPE for frontline staff had been delivered to health services services across the country in the past day alone.",

Australia\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is thankfully one of the lowest in the world so far, but most of the deaths have been people aged 70 and over. Globally, the mortality rate is highest for the 80-plus age group, which now stands above 10%. Children, meanwhile, seem less susceptible to the worst effects but carry the risk of infecting others. For the grandmother of four and her husband, an 80-year-old psychiatrist, that means a strict new diktat: grandparenting from a distance. With their grandchildren living over the garden fence and their daily lives deeply entwined, familial distancing is no small undertaking. \u201cThe last time we had any physical contact was the 14th of March,\u201d Susan says. \u201cAll my time was geared around the children but it\u2019s all changed. They\u2019re not allowed into the house any more and so we see them over the fence and on FaceTime. \u201cI understand it but it\u2019s hard. It goes against all our ideas of togetherness and contact and the bonds that you make with children. I keep thinking, \u2018Why aren\u2019t they here?\u2019\u201d Susan\u2019s daughter Lizzie is getting used to a new daily juggle of work, childcare and family life without the parental support she and her partner relied upon. \u201cThe hardest thing is that, because we are working, we don\u2019t have the option of taking our children out of school and daycare without the normal help from my parents,\u201d says the medical device specialist, 42. \u201cBut letting them spend time together is not worth the risk.\u201d By erring on the side of caution, they are among the growing number of families without underlying illnesses who pre-empted, and went further than, the warnings of the likes of the Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who this week told parents: \u201cIf you have a grandparent who is unwell, who has one of those chronic conditions, you must not take your children to visit those grandparents.

They are not just going badly, they are going badly quickly. Through my lifetime there have been three \u201cworst since the Great Depression\u201d times for the economy \u2013 the early 1980s, the early 90s and the global financial crisis. In each case we never really got close to experiencing dramatic declines in production and income that happened during the 30s. Out of those three cases the worst our GDP per capita ever fell in a year was 2.2%. By contrast, during the Depression, there were three consecutive years where it fell by more than 3.5% and one where it fell by more than 10%. Most of us have lived in a time of moderation. Consider that from 1920 to 1946, Australia\u2019s annual GDP per capita either rose or fell by more than 4% 14 times; over the past 50 years it has happened just once. Right now it would not be a shock if such a fall occurs in the June quarter alone. In the US things have ground to a halt such that the total number of unemployed has increased by more than 50% in a week. When such things occur, even comparison with the Great Depression fails. Here in Australia the numbers are going to be just as bad. The numbers of people this week applying for Newstart this week are unprecedented (though not unanticipated) and Westpac economists now predict our unemployment rate will hit 11% by June. Were that to happen the unemployment rate would have risen six percentage points in four months. The previous biggest four-month jump was in 1982 when unemployment rose 2.4 percentage points, from 7% to 9.4%. The Great Depression was as bad as it was because economies around the world went backwards for three to four years. Australia\u2019s GDP per capita in 1931 was 20% below what it was in 1928; in the US it fell 31% from 1929 to 1933. Were our GDP per capita to fall by 20% that would take us back to 2001 levels \u2013 20 years of growth wiped away. Fortunately, things are a bit different now from the 30s. Firstly, the world is not on the gold standard as it was in the 20s and 30s, so central banks have been able to engage in an extremely strong monetary policy response. And secondly, John Maynard Keynes has already written his General Theory, so we know that fiscal expansion, not austerity, is the best response. This, of course, is a different economic crisis \u2013 people are unemployed because the government has in effect mandated that their workplaces close. And so the hope is that when the crisis is over everything snaps back into place. But generally it takes longer to recover than it does to fall. It took two years of the Great Depression to lose 20% of GDP per capita and five years to make it back. During the 90s recession it took three years for the level of employment to fall from 59.6% to 55.5% and more than seven years to get back to the pre-recession level. And in this instance we need to consider the virus and the response of governments around the world. The global economy is only as strong as the weakest link. And right now the US, led by Donald Trump, is in a pitiful state. Until it is safe to return to normal business \u2013 and crucially until we feel safe \u2013 we will not see much recovery. But importantly, until we can say the same about other major nations, we will not see the global economy recover. It may feel as though Trump\u2019s incompetence does not affect us but it very much does. All facets of our economy are affected \u2013 almost beyond comprehension. But it is all irrelevant until the concerns about our health \u2013 and the health of those in our major trading partners \u2013 are at an end.

They face having no income between them. \u201cIt\u2019s placed enormous stress on us, just thinking about how are we going to pay our mortgage, the bills,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cThere\u2019s so many of us with so many questions, and right now there really is no surety.\u201d In three days at least 35,000 workers lost their jobs, 280,000 Australians lodged \u201cintent to claim\u201d benefit forms in a single morning as lines at Centrelink offices across the country snaked around blocks and the government\u2019s MyGov website crashed repeatedly. Some economists predict Australia could shed more than 1m jobs before the crisis is over, which would push the country\u2019s unemployment rate above 10%. The federal government has effectively doubled welfare payments since the outbreak but there are loud calls for further relief in the way of rent and housing assistance. Homelessness advocacy group Everybody\u2019s Home has been calling on the government to use empty hotels as emergency accomodation for those facing homelessness, along with rental assistance for people who have lost their job as a result of the crisis and a halt on evictions. \u201cRight now, we have a hospitality industry facing an extended period with thousands of unoccupied beds, while similar numbers of at-risk individuals are in desperate need of somewhere to sleep,\u201d policy manager for the group Kate Colvin said. \u201cWith modest financial support, the Morrison government could match up supply and demand and help minimise the spread of the coronavirus and the impact it\u2019s having on our communities. \u201cWe recognise there will be many calls for government support at this time, but we urge the government to place society\u2019s most vulnerable at the centre of their attention.\u201d Lyssa Tredgett was among those in Centrelink line. The 32-year-old had gone into the office of her marketing job early to make her husband, Jason, a birthday card for his 50th the next day. When she saw two of her bosses in a meeting room she wasn\u2019t initially concerned \u2013 the couple had been worried about Jason\u2019s job as a chef but believed that her position would be secure \u2013 for a while at least. It wasn\u2019t. \u201cMy boss came out and asked me for a chat and the minute he said that I knew,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was that. I went outside and cried on the road.\u201d She spent her husband\u2019s birthday applying for \u201cliterally hundreds\u201d of jobs, many of which she knows no longer exist. Then three days later Jason was let go too. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have grown up taught to be who you want to be, follow your dreams and grow a career. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say it was my dream to be a marketing manager at a landscape company but it\u2019s something I chose. That complete removal of choice is so jarring, and you mourn it.\u201d The couple rent a home in Leichhardt in Sydney\u2019s inner west that costs them $1,740 a fortnight. With two young sons aged three and eight months, they already live on a tight budget. Now, with no income, they have to entirely rethink their way of life. They have been hoping for a government announcement on rent assistance but by Friday that had not happened. \u201cThe worst part about it is I feel shit but I have to get on with my day,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have savings. We don\u2019t have a safety net. But I think the real shock is two weeks down the line when the money we have now is gone. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with grief. Somebody dies and two weeks later they fall apart in the supermarket. So not only are we waiting for the worst of the health and economic implications for the country, I\u2019m sitting here with my jigsaw puzzles and playdough for my kids while I wait to have a breakdown.\u201d After days of failing to access MyGov, Weatherall set an alarm for 2.45am and finally got through. \u201cI just feel so confused all the time,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think about what\u2019s going to happen in the future but I think that is exactly what I feel upset about. It\u2019s too hard for us to comprehend everything that\u2019s happened but I feel like the government should be making it easier and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.\u201d In Melbourne, Marlee Jane Ward, a 37-year-old writer and receptionist, posted a screenshot of the documents she\u2019d been asked to provide Centrelink online after she successfully made her claim. It was shared hundreds of times. The winner of the 2016 Victorian premier\u2019s literary award for writing for young adults, Ward paid the bills with a day job as a receptionist that disappeared last Monday. The work she had as a writer and speaker had already completely dried up. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no framework for what the future is going to look like, especially for anyone who works in the arts or a customer-facing position,\u201d she says. \u201cMy job that paid the bills was casual so I had no leave entitlements or redundancy. It\u2019s really revealed how fucking tenuous everything was to begin with.\u201d Common among all the people Guardian Australia spoke to this week was a recognition that Covid-19 had prompted a dramatic reshaping of modern life which could not quickly be undone. \u201cI don\u2019t think the world is going to be the same after this,\u201d Ward says. \u201cMaybe, I hope, it will be a little bit fairer for people who don\u2019t have as much. If capitalism can\u2019t last two weeks without completely falling apart maybe it\u2019s time to look for something a bit fucking better.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "An organ transplant specialist has become the first working NHS surgeon to die from coronavirus. Adil El Tayar, 63, died on Wednesday at West Middlesex university hospital in London, his family said. The doctor, who had worked around the world, spent his final days volunteering on the frontlines against the outbreak in an A&amp;E department in the Midlands. \u201cHe wanted to be deployed where he would be most useful in the crisis,\u201d his cousin, British-Sudanese journalist Zeinab Badawi, said in a moving tribute on BBC Radio 4. \u201cIt had taken just 12 days for Adil to go from a seemingly fit and capable doctor working in a busy hospital to lying in a hospital morgue.\u201d Tayar started self-isolating at home after developing symptoms about two weeks ago, but was taken to hospital and placed on a ventilator after his condition worsened. Four days later medics told his family that his lungs had \u201ccome under attack\u201d from the virus and he could no longer breathe unaided. \u201cUntil I had learned of Adil\u2019s death I had been fairly phlegmatic about the pandemic,\u201d Badawi said. \u201cBut there is nothing like a death in the family to bring home the realities of what we are facing.\u201d Badawi learned of her cousin\u2019s death on Thursday, three minutes before she joined millions across the UK in applauding NHS workers. She said: \u201cClapping along with my neighbours engendered in me a feeling of unity that we are all in this together and that we sink or swim together. \u201cPerhaps this transformation will be permanent. I hope it will be.\u201d Former colleague Abbas Ghaznafar, a renal transplant surgeon at St George\u2019s University in Tooting, described Tayar as a \u201cnoble human being\u201d who was a \u201chard-working, dedicated surgeon\u201d. Dr Hisam El Khidir, another of the surgeon\u2019s cousins, told the BBC that he suspected Tayar had caught the virus while working on frontlines. The British ambassador to Sudan Irfan Siddiq tweeted: \u201cSaddened to hear of Sudanese doctor Adel Altayar\u2019s death in the UK from Covid-19. \u201cHealth workers around the world have shown extraordinary courage. We cannot thank them enough. In this fight we must listen to their advice.\u201d Tayar leaves behind a wife and four children, two of whom also work as doctors in the NHS. El Khidir told the BBC: \u201cAdil was someone who was central to our family, who was well respected by so many people. \u201cSince his death on Wednesday, I have had hundreds of text messages from his colleagues and friends. He will be sorely missed.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><br>As Boris Johnson went into solitary confinement in his flat above No 11 Downing Street on Friday, having tested positive for Covid-19, a member of his staff noted how the atmosphere had quickly changed at the heart of power. It was not just the PM who had taken himself out of circulation in the preceding hours. \u201cThere are quite a lot of others not here now because they are self-isolating,\u201d said the official. \u201cThose who are, are just getting on with their jobs. The whole place has become very quiet.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street is a huge rambling complex of corridors and offices in which staff can, in normal times, move fairly freely, running errands and attending meetings in small rooms in No 10, No 11 and the Cabinet Office. Until Thursday, the place had buzzed with activity, day and night. Many members of staff were exhausted, working 18-hour days, or more, at what had for weeks been the national nerve centre for coordinating responses to the pandemic. Some were sleeping in the building to avoid the risks of public transport and to save time.</p> <p>Senior ministers including Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, were regularly in and out of formal meetings and more impromptu discussions with the PM, as were Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser to the government, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Until the middle of last week, meetings of Cobra, the emergency committee, were still taking place, mainly person to person, rather than remotely. But when Johnson tested positive, having developed a cough and temperature during Thursday afternoon \u2013 and it was later announced that Hancock had contracted the virus, too \u2013 such gatherings, and the free movement of people inside Downing Street, were halted.</p> <p>At lunchtime on Friday, Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, appeared to have recognised the urgency of the situation and was seen running out of the building by a back exit with a large rucksack on his back. A decision was taken to close and lock the door between Nos 10 and 11. Johnson\u2019s solitary confinement meant food, drink and papers had to be left outside his door. Hancock stayed at home. Then, on Saturday, the secretary of state for Scotland, Alister Jack, announced that he was self-isolating after developing coronavirus symptoms. He had yet to be tested.</p> <p>For Downing Street staff who were still at work keeping the machine going, new routes had to be taken. \u201cNow, we have to go via an underground passage if we want to get to another part of the building,\u201d said an insider. After days of telling the public where they could and could not go, staff at the heart of government were having to fall into line, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f309e49bb4b7cef00b58a6d42c69645b004f912\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f309e49bb4b7cef00b58a6d42c69645b004f912/0_248_901_541/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings runs out of Downing Street shortly after Johnson announced he tested positive for Covid-19.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings runs out of Downing Street shortly after Johnson announced he tested positive for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV News</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The news that Johnson and Hancock had contracted Covid-19 \u2013 and, later on Friday, that Whitty had developed symptoms \u2013 raised two urgent new questions to add to the long list already facing ministers. Most immediately: how was it that three of the four-strong team of politicians and medical experts leading the national appeals to people to stay at home and observe social distancing had allowed themselves to fall victim to the virus? And how could government at this time of national emergency continue to function if Covid-19 took many more victims in high places in Westminster, Whitehall and Downing Street?</p> <p>Johnson had certainly not practised what he had preached. As well as attending Cobra meetings in person, with key ministers and the country\u2019s leading medical experts, he had been pictured in the Commons on Wednesday, after prime minister\u2019s questions, in a close cluster around the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle. On Friday, Hoyle felt he had to issue a statement saying he was fit and well, given Johnson that had just tested positive. On Wednesday too, the prime minister posed for pictures standing alongside the Labour MP Rupa Huq and her son. The London MP writes an article for Sunday\u2019s <em>Observer</em> on the failure of parliament to adapt to safer working practices during the outbreak.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-has-completely-changed-how-uk-politics-works\">Coronavirus has completely changed how UK politics works</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fellow Labour MP Lucy Powell said the whole of government should have decided to operate remotely far earlier: \u201cIt is extraordinary that we did not take measures to close parliament earlier than we did. Westminster and Whitehall have not set a good example to the country, which may be why people have been slow to act on the advice. There are high numbers of MPs who have already had the virus or have got it now. Nadine Dorries had it two weeks ago. So parliament could, and should, have moved to working via [video conferencing platform] Zoom instead of gathering in an epicentre and then disbursing round the country.\u201d</p> <p>By and large, the public is still supportive of the government\u2019s actions and responses, aware of the complexity and enormity of the crisis, and the unprecedented nature of the challenge. An Opinium survey for the <em>Observer</em> taken in the latter half of last week, but before news of Johnson\u2019s illness broke, shows 65% of voters approve of the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But 56% think government did not move fast enough on a number of fronts, including testing and social distancing. As the number of cases of and deaths from coronavirus grows, questions about the adequacy and speed of the response will only grow. Jonathan Ashworth, Labour\u2019s health spokesperson, who has offered support to the government where possible, said the most criticisms came from within the medical establishment so could not be dismissed as mere political point scoring.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cA pandemic demands resolve and rapid action from governments. In recent weeks, there have been more and more voices in the wider medical community questioning whether the UK was moving at the speed necessary. NHS staff have continued to warn of delays in accessing protective equipment, we still have not got the ventilators that will be vital, we are not testing at the levels the World Health Organization recommends and many believe social-distancing measures should have been implemented earlier.\u201d</p> <p>Inevitably at such a time, there have been tensions at the heart of government, notably between Hancock and Gove, over the handling of the crisis and signs of a lack of central control. Whitehall insiders say there is concern that No 10 has not been clear to other departments what their roles should be. There is also dismay that Downing Street has leaked out initiatives, such as plans for a total lockdown of London, which it has not then gone on to announce, causing huge confusion and alarm. \u201cAt times, it has seemed that one arm of government does not know what the other arm is doing,\u201d said one source.</p> <p>Last week, some in medical circles were questioning why ministers had not opted to take part in an EU bulk-buying scheme for ventilators, which it was eligible for as the UK is still in its Brexit transition phase. At one stage, Downing Street said it had missed a vital email about a deadline for joining the system. The <em>Observer</em> also understands that offers from foreign companies, including at least one from China, to provide badly needed medical equipment to the UK were held up because of bureaucracy and the UK\u2019s insistence that they would be subject to high customs duties. Chinese companies have found that trying to donate ventilators to the UK has proved far more difficult than it has been to other European countries because of paperwork and arguments over whether they meet NHS standards.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ede9da996af13b9707faf4905f552cd736701ced\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ede9da996af13b9707faf4905f552cd736701ced/0_0_542_471/500.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock\u2019s twitter, making the announcement that he has tested positive for the virus.\" width=\"500\" height=\"435\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock\u2019s twitter, making the announcement that he has tested positive for the virus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @MattHancock/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The acting co-leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey said confusion over the orders of ventilators was inexcusable: \u201cWho in their right mind wouldn\u2019t want to act with other countries to source ventilators?\u201d Referring to the UK\u2019s failure to join the EU scheme, he added: \u201cWhat it shows is, when it comes to the European issue, the government is so unclear about how they are going to handle the relationship with Europe that they can\u2019t get their act together.

      "body": "<p>In the kitchen of the four-star Ch\u00e2teau de Courban hotel in the heart of Burgundy\u2019s vineyards, chef Takashi Kinoshita would normally be preparing the three, five and seven-course gastronomic menus that have earned him a coveted Michelin star. On an ordinary weekend, the restaurant would be fully booked with diners travelling hundreds of miles, including from the UK, to sample Kinoshita\u2019s food.</p> <p>But this is no ordinary weekend.</p> <p>With the hotel closed because of the coronavirus crisis, Kinoshita is technically \u2013 if temporarily \u2013 out of work. So, instead of cooking for his usual guests, he is turning out dishes for the doctors, nurses and staff working round the clock at the nearest main hospital in the eastern French city of Dijon.</p> <p>On Sunday, the chef will set off in a borrowed refrigerated van to deliver 100 simple three-course meals to hospital staff. \u201cIn Japan, if there is a catastrophe the cultural response is to make something to eat, so I\u2019m very happy to be doing this. I was wondering what I could do to help at this time, and cooking for the health workers is a pleasure,\u201d Kinoshita, 40, told the <em>Observer</em>. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s my job. Where else would I be but in my kitchen?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3555ee7b043f168795fe09b3cd86cf0409d732e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3555ee7b043f168795fe09b3cd86cf0409d732e9/0_0_4370_2622/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Ch\u00e2teau de Courban\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kinoshita took over at the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurent Duquesne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>True, it is not the usual fare of oysters <em>\u00e0 la japonaise</em> or <em>cerise de l\u2019Yonne</em> and foie gras. For the hungry medics, Takashi \u2013 who is cooking while wearing a mask and gloves as well as his chef\u2019s whites \u2013 is creating a more hearty repast of quiche with vegetables and trout, mixed salad spring rolls in soft wraps and cream-filled choux pastries.</p> <p>\u201cWe are making what we can using what we have in stock and ingredients donated by local producers who didn\u2019t even think twice before showing their support and solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from creating a gastronomic menu because the health workers need to eat something quick, substantial and balanced.\u201d</p> <p>France has confirmed more than 35,000 cases of Covid-19, with 2,314 deaths recorded as of Saturday night, up 319 in a day. Of those being treated in hospital, more than 3,700 were in intensive care. A government-ordered lockdown was extended last week for another fortnight, to 15 April \u2013 but the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has warned it could be prolonged again \u201cif the health situation requires\u201d.</p> <p>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vandendriessche, who runs the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban hotel, says news of the order for all restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and non-essential public places to close came halfway through dinner on 14 March. \u201cThe restaurant was full and we didn\u2019t know as we were working. Suddenly we had clients asking if they had to eat up and be out by midnight. It was a terrible shock, like something out of a film,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Vandendriessche\u2019s father, Pierre, an interior decorator, bought the 19th-century house as a family home in 1998. Twenty-two years on, it now has 24 rooms with showers and slipper baths, a spa and pool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06362de82f8532a8102d6f844b4220d264c58794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06362de82f8532a8102d6f844b4220d264c58794/0_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View of the chateau at night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The order to close restaurants in France on 14 March came halfway through the chateau\u2019s dinner service.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chateau de Courban</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like many small and medium-sized businesses in France hit by the lockdown \u2013 about to enter its third week \u2013 Vandendriessche hopes the government will come good on its \u201csolidarity fund\u201d to guarantee loans and its promise that none will go out of business. The hotel\u2019s 30 low-season staff are on \u201cpartial unemployment\u201d with 86% of their salaries covered by the government. Vandendriessche says the hotel is making up the difference plus four hours of overtime staff normally work each week.</p> <p>\u201cOur priority is to look after the people working for us so they continue working for us when this is over,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen all this is over we will need everyone to make an effort to boost the economy.</p> <p>\u201cBut we wanted to do more, particularly Takashi; a chef who isn\u2019t working is like a lion in a cage. We looked at the perishable food that we didn\u2019t want to throw away and posted an appeal asking for donations of food. Within two minutes we had the first reply,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Kinoshita, who grew up in a Tokyo suburb, came to France in 2002 and after working under several illustrious chefs and a spell in the kitchens at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace, became master of his own kitchen at the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban in 2015.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u00e9lan of solidarity has been incredible,\u201d said Vandendriessche. \u201cWhen you see the news and you see these people who are on the front line you want to help.</p> <p>\u201cWe are an hour from Dijon hospital and at the moment we can only make 100 meals and deliver them once a week on a Sunday using a refrigerated van loaned by another local person. There are 300 health staff at Dijon hospital. If the lockdown goes on then hopefully every one of them will get a meal.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. After all, a Michelin star chef is symbolic of French gastronomy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "In the kitchen of the four-star Ch\u00e2teau de Courban hotel in the heart of Burgundy\u2019s vineyards, chef Takashi Kinoshita would normally be preparing the three, five and seven-course gastronomic menus that have earned him a coveted Michelin star. On an ordinary weekend, the restaurant would be fully booked with diners travelling hundreds of miles, including from the UK, to sample Kinoshita\u2019s food. But this is no ordinary weekend. With the hotel closed because of the coronavirus crisis, Kinoshita is technically \u2013 if temporarily \u2013 out of work. So, instead of cooking for his usual guests, he is turning out dishes for the doctors, nurses and staff working round the clock at the nearest main hospital in the eastern French city of Dijon. On Sunday, the chef will set off in a borrowed refrigerated van to deliver 100 simple three-course meals to hospital staff. \u201cIn Japan, if there is a catastrophe the cultural response is to make something to eat, so I\u2019m very happy to be doing this. I was wondering what I could do to help at this time, and cooking for the health workers is a pleasure,\u201d Kinoshita, 40, told the Observer. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s my job. Where else would I be but in my kitchen?\u201d True, it is not the usual fare of oysters \u00e0 la japonaise or cerise de l\u2019Yonne and foie gras. For the hungry medics, Takashi \u2013 who is cooking while wearing a mask and gloves as well as his chef\u2019s whites \u2013 is creating a more hearty repast of quiche with vegetables and trout, mixed salad spring rolls in soft wraps and cream-filled choux pastries. \u201cWe are making what we can using what we have in stock and ingredients donated by local producers who didn\u2019t even think twice before showing their support and solidarity,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s different from creating a gastronomic menu because the health workers need to eat something quick, substantial and balanced.\u201d France has confirmed more than 35,000 cases of Covid-19, with 2,314 deaths recorded as of Saturday night, up 319 in a day. Of those being treated in hospital, more than 3,700 were in intensive care. A government-ordered lockdown was extended last week for another fortnight, to 15 April \u2013 but the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, has warned it could be prolonged again \u201cif the health situation requires\u201d. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vandendriessche, who runs the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban hotel, says news of the order for all restaurants, bars, caf\u00e9s and non-essential public places to close came halfway through dinner on 14 March. \u201cThe restaurant was full and we didn\u2019t know as we were working. Suddenly we had clients asking if they had to eat up and be out by midnight. It was a terrible shock, like something out of a film,\u201d he said. Vandendriessche\u2019s father, Pierre, an interior decorator, bought the 19th-century house as a family home in 1998. Twenty-two years on, it now has 24 rooms with showers and slipper baths, a spa and pool. Like many small and medium-sized businesses in France hit by the lockdown \u2013 about to enter its third week \u2013 Vandendriessche hopes the government will come good on its \u201csolidarity fund\u201d to guarantee loans and its promise that none will go out of business. The hotel\u2019s 30 low-season staff are on \u201cpartial unemployment\u201d with 86% of their salaries covered by the government. Vandendriessche says the hotel is making up the difference plus four hours of overtime staff normally work each week. \u201cOur priority is to look after the people working for us so they continue working for us when this is over,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen all this is over we will need everyone to make an effort to boost the economy. \u201cBut we wanted to do more, particularly Takashi; a chef who isn\u2019t working is like a lion in a cage. We looked at the perishable food that we didn\u2019t want to throw away and posted an appeal asking for donations of food. Within two minutes we had the first reply,\u201d he said. Kinoshita, who grew up in a Tokyo suburb, came to France in 2002 and after working under several illustrious chefs and a spell in the kitchens at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e palace, became master of his own kitchen at the Ch\u00e2teau de Courban in 2015. \u201cThe \u00e9lan of solidarity has been incredible,\u201d said Vandendriessche. \u201cWhen you see the news and you see these people who are on the front line you want to help. \u201cWe are an hour from Dijon hospital and at the moment we can only make 100 meals and deliver them once a week on a Sunday using a refrigerated van loaned by another local person. There are 300 health staff at Dijon hospital. If the lockdown goes on then hopefully every one of them will get a meal. \u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. After all, a Michelin star chef is symbolic of French gastronomy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We are closing this blog now, after another dramatic, alarming and at times confusing day in a country shut down by the coronavirus outbreak. With some reports putting the US death toll above 2,000, here\u2019s our nightlead, by Richard Luscombe and Victoria Bekiempis: Here, meanwhile, is Tom McCarthy and Ed Pilkington\u2019s coruscating look at how Donald Trump failed his greatest test \u2013 preparing for Covid-19: And Sam Levin, from Los Angeles: And Oliver Milman itemising some of Trump\u2019s most misleading claims about the coronavirus outbreak: And finally, our updating map of coronavirus cases in the US: Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Trump and Cuomo clash as president weighs New York quarantine. The US president floated the idea of an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d of parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, an idea which New York\u2019s governor would later in the afternoon brand \u201cpreposterous\u201d and a recipe for \u201cchaos and mayhem\u201d. Rhode Island governor issues \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 order amid pandemic. One day after announcing her state\u2019s first two deaths from the coronavirus, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo has issued an order mandating that residents stay at home. ER doctor who criticized lack of protective gear says he was fired. An emergency room doctor who spoke out about the lack of coronavirus safety protections in place at his workplace in Bellingham, Washington, about 90 miles north of Seattle, said he was fired on Friday. Former Republican senator Tom Coburn dies. The Republican senator from Oklahoma has died at 72. A doctor who resigned his Senate seat following his cancer diagnosis, Coburn pushed for a constitutional convention and advocated for a range of conservative fiscal causes. \u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about my health, my prognosis or even my hopes and desires,\u201d he said then. President attacks \u2018lamestream media\u2019 as coronavirus cases rise. Trump started his Saturday tweeting complaints about \u201cthe Lamestream media\u201d. Various stories have got the president\u2019s goat, including one which said he has consulted New York Yankees star, drugs cheat and partner of Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez about how to tackle the crisis. Cuomo also says he would sue the state of Rhode Island if they don\u2019t roll back their \u201creactionary and illegal policy\u201d to stop cars with New York license places to ensure passengers are self-quartantining, though he remains confident they can work it out \u201camicably\u201d. \u201cNo state should be using police to limit interstate travel,\u201d Cuomo said. Earlier today, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo issued an executive order mandating that residents stay at home, banning gatherings of more than five people, shuttering all non-essential businesses for two weeks and requiring that all people entering into the state for a nonwork-related purpose self-quarantine for 14 days. New York governor Andrew Cuomo says Trump\u2019s proposal of an enforceable quarantine for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut is a \u201cpreposterous\u201d idea and counter-productive toward the president\u2019s goals of restarting the economy. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem,\u201d Cuomo said on CNN. \u201cIf you start walling off areas all across the country, it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, antisocial.\u201d He added: That\u2019s not a quarantine. That would be a lockdown. If you said that we are geographically confining people, that would be a lockdown. Then we would be Wuhan, China. And that wouldn\u2019t make any sense. \u201cThis is a time when the president says he\u2019s trying to restart the economy. New York is the financial sector. You geographically restrict a state, you would paralyze the financial sector. You think the Dow Jones has gone down [now], it would drop like a stone. I don\u2019t even believe it\u2019s legal [due to the] interstate commerce clause. \u201cI think it would be exactly the opposite of everything the president is talking about. How would you ever operationally stop goods from coming to New York and New Jersey and Connecticut?\u201d Cuomo says he doubts Trump was even serious about the idea, saying the president didn\u2019t mention it even in passing when they spoke on the phone this morning. If the president was considering this, I guarantee you he would have called me. We talk about relatively trivial matters when it comes to dealing with this situation. This, this is a civil war kind of discussion.\u201d Here\u2019s our report on Trump\u2019s remark which is now of course subject to being rewritten\u2026 The Illinois department of health has announced the first known infant death from Covid-19 in the state. Illinois governor JB Pritzker said an investigation is under way to determine the cause of death and whether the child, who was younger than one year, had other health issues. \u201cThere has never before been a death associated with COVID-19 in an infant,\u201d said Dr Ngozi Ezike, the director of the Illinois department of public health. \u201cA full investigation is under way to determine the cause of death. We must do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. If not to protect ourselves, but to protect those around us.\u201d According to the AP, the infection rate among children of Covid-19 is extremely rare: The risk of death and severe illness from Covid-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with Covid-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized. Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill. The Associated Press reports that leaders of a number of South Carolina cities are defying the opposition of the state\u2019s governor to stay-at-home orders: Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures. In Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday. Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city\u2019s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson\u2019s Friday opinion is incorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis. McMaster issued a new executive order on Friday mandating that anyone entering South Carolina from New York and other known coronavirus hotspots \u2013 New Jersey, Connecticut and New Orleans \u2013 must quarantine themselves for 14 days, but the Republican governor reiterated his stance that he sees no reason for residents to remain at home or shelter-in-place. \u201cWe hope that our visitors will be as responsible as the people of South Carolina have been in following the recommendations and requirements,\u201d McMaster said at a Friday afternoon news conference. \u201dThis is a requirement that has the force of law.\u201d There were 539 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths on Friday at the time of McMaster\u2019s order. One day after announcing her state\u2019s first two deaths from the coronavirus, Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo has issued an order mandating that residents stay at home. Raimondo said the directive will extend through 13 April and will ban gatherings of more than five people, shutter all non-essential businesses for two weeks and mandate that all people entering into the state for a nonwork-related purpose self-quarantine for 14 days. \u201cToday, I\u2019m issuing a stay at home order that will be in place until April 13. This means unless you\u2019re getting food, medicine, gas or going to work, you need to stay home,\u201d Raimondo said. She continued: \u201cYou can go outside to get some fresh air, but if you leave your home, keep the time out to a minimum and always keep 6 feet away from others. Starting immediately, all gatherings of more than 5 people are banned. This means everywhere. If you have to go to work, you should be limiting your time there and interacting with as few people as possible. \u201cIn addition, starting immediately, any person coming to RI by any mode of transportation after visiting any other state for a non-work-related purpose must self-quarantine for 14 days. This restriction will not apply to public health, public safety or healthcare workers. \u201cI want to make a note to commuters. As I\u2019ve already said, if you\u2019re able to work from home, you\u2019re required to do so. If you live in RI and work in another state at a job where you can\u2019t work from home, you can go to work. But when you come home to RI, you must self-quarantine. Starting Monday, all non-essential retail businesses must shut down their stores. I don\u2019t make this decision lightly, but I\u2019m hearing too many reports of crowded stores. So for now, we need you to shop online to support your local retailers.\u201d The death of one person in their 80s on Friday night and another in their 70s on Saturday in Rhode Island leaves only three US states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming. More than 200 people have been confirmed to have the virus in the Ocean State, according to the Rhode Island department of health. A supplemental pool nugget \u2013 the best kind of nugget \u2013 lands in the Guardian\u2019s nugget-riddled inbox: New acting chief of staff Mark Meadows, who also deplaned Marine 1, responded to questions about POTUS\u2019 authority to quarantine states: We\u2019re evaluating those options right now. \u201cDeplaned\u201d \u2013 the most irritating bit of official-ese in current use? Probably not. But it would still be nice to be able to tell anyone who uses it\u2026 where to get off. Trump is back at the White House after his visit to Norfolk, Virginia for the departure of the USNS Comfort, the navy hospital ship which is heading for New York. On arrival the president did not answer questions, the pool reports, about his remarks about possible quarantine for the Empire state, New Jersey and Connecticut. Here\u2019s what was said at Joint Base Andrews earlier, as rendered by the pool reporter: THE PRESIDENT: Well, we\u2019re looking at it. We\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be making a decision. A lot of the states that aren\u2019t infected, that don\u2019t have a big problem, they\u2019ve asked me if I\u2019d look at it. So we\u2019re going to look at it. And it will be for a short period of time, if we do it at all. Q Would it be -- THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019ll be New York. Q Would you call up the national guard? THE PRESIDENT: It\u2019ll be New York, parts of Connecticut, and parts of New Jersey. Q And then, do you close down the subway? Do you close down the bridges, the tunnels? THE PRESIDENT: No, we won\u2019t do that. We\u2019re talking about leaving New York. Leaving New York. They go to Florida, and a lot of people don\u2019t want that. So we\u2019ll see what happens. We\u2019re going to make a decision. Q Would you use the military for that, sir? Would you call up the guard? THE PRESIDENT: We\u2019re not going to need much. The people of New York, they understand it better than anybody, and they\u2019ll be great. Trump\u2019s remarks have certainly sowed confusion, seeming to blindside New York governor Andrew Cuomo as he gave a press conference in Albany, the state capital. At Joint Base Andrews, the president said: \u201cI\u2019ll speak to the governor about it later.\u201d Here\u2019s Victoria Bekiempis with the report on the day so far: Florida governor Ron DeSantis says his administration is looking into ways to secure the state border amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying \u201cit\u2019s not fair to the people of Florida\u201d that outsiders have continued to flock to the state. \u201cI don\u2019t as governor have the ability to shut down flights,\u201d he says during his daily briefing. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s an issue when people who are in the hot zone, then leaving the hot zone, to come to different parts of the country.\u201d DeSantis says they have instituted a 14-day self-quarantine for all visitors from New York airports. All arrivals are met by National Guard and Department of Health personnel to be screened, provided information and given the instruction about self-isolation. The governor says he\u2019s signed an executive order to establish a checkpoint at the Louisiana state border on Interstate 10 to inspect people entering the state and his administration is looking to the same at the border on I-95, the point of entry for most New Yorkers. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida has soared to 3,763, more than five times the total of 706 from a week ago. Eight more deaths were reported overnight on Saturday, bringing the overall total to 54. The Associated Press reports that New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment: The donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields. \u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said. The Bayou State has emerged as one of the biggest hotspots of the pandemic with deaths from Covid-19 surging by more than 40% in a single day earlier this week. There were more than 3,300 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning\u2019s latest update with 549 new cases since Friday. The number of reported deaths is up to 137, up from 119 yesterday. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau says anyone showing symptoms of Covid-19 will not be allowed to board domestic flights or intercity trains. The directive will go into effect on Monday at noon. \u201cIt will be important for operators of airlines and trains to ensure that people who are exhibiting symptoms do not board those trains,\u201d Trudeau said during his daily address. \u201cIt will be a Transport Canada rule that will be enforced, but at the same time, we\u2019re telling people stay home if it\u2019s not absolutely essential for you to travel.\u201d The Public Health Agency of Canada will provide guidance to air operators and rail companies on conducting health checks on passengers boarding flights and trains within Canada or departing the country. Ohio governor Mike DeWine says Battelle labs has developed technology that would sterilize PPE masks and makes a public appeal for the FDA to give approval for its implementation, adding that it would help in current hotspots like Seattle and New York. The governor says the process could sterilize 80,000 masks per machine daily. \u201cPlease, please approve these. This would boost our capacity to be able to re-use these,\u201d DeWine says at his ongoing news conference at the state house in Columbus. \u201cPlease do this. It really is truly a matter of life and death.\u201d He follows with a second plea to Quest and LabCorps to ramp up their testing capacity, saying the state\u2019s confirmed total coronavirus cases climbed to 1,406, including 344 hospitalizations and 25 deaths, with the apex expected in mid-May. Trump is now speaking in front of the USNS Comfort hospital ship, which sets sail Saturday for coronavirus-stricken New York City. The USNS Comfort is due to arrive in Manhattan on Monday. Trump\u2019s travel to Norfolk, Virginia to bid the USNS Comfort bon voyage stands at odds with public health officials\u2019s advisories against non-essential travel due to coronavirus. \u201cThis great ship behind me is a 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York, a place I know very well, a place I love,\u201d Trump says. \u201cWe are with you all the way, and always will be.\u201d \u201cYou have the unwavering support of the entire nation, the entire government, and the entire American people,\u201d Trump says. Trump\u2019s message of unity toward New York came in the wake of comments that he was weighing the imposition of a quarantine on this state, as well as New Jersey and parts of Connecticut. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference that Trump hadn\u2019t mentioned a possible quarantine during a call with him earlier. \u201cWe will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers, and the health of people in our country,\u201d Trump also says in front of the USNS Comfort, insisting that people from the New York metro area self-quarantine if they travel elsewhere. \u201cI am now considering, and will make a decision very quickly, very shortly, a quarantine because it\u2019s such a hot area of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, we\u2019ll be announcing that one way or another fairly soon,\u201d he also said. \u201cThis does not apply to people such as truckers from outside the New York area \u2026 it won\u2019t affect trade in any way.\u201d Houston mayor Sylvester Turner says there are 232 positive Covid-19 cases (up from 69 yesterday) in Texas\u2019s biggest metropolis during a briefing at ISD\u2019s Butler Stadium, the city\u2019s first non-private testing site. \u201cThe numbers will rise as we continue testing,\u201d he says. The mayor says the second coronavirus death has been recorded today and three more Houston police officers have tested positive, bringing the total count to seven. \u201cIt is our intent collectively to blunt the progression of this virus,\u201d Turner says. \u201cTo slow down the growth, the spread, so that our healthcare delivery system is not overwhelmed. We see what\u2019s happening in New York and in Louisiana and in other places. We\u2019re trying to get ahead of that, to slow the progression, and so we need everyone to really take this situation seriously.\u201d He adds: \u201cPeople may just look at the numbers and say the numbers in New York are 25,000 and the state of New York are 45,000, but in the city of Houston the numbers are just 232. And there are 2.3 million people just in the city alone and over five million people in our surrounding region, so that\u2019s not a big deal. Well let me just say, the testing has been limited. We know that there are more cases. And the way I look at it is, I take 232 and I multiply it times 10. Because we just dont know. Don\u2019t get bogged down on the numbers. The more testing we do, the numbers are going to rise.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposal of an \u201cenforcable quarantine\u201d for parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut was the big news from his press gaggle before departing on Marine One for Norfolk, where he is scheduled to make remarks and bid bon voyage to the USNS Comfort, which is bound for New York to provide relief to hospitals overwhelmed with responding to the coronavirus. Moments ago, he made it Twitter official. Some of the toplines from New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing, which ended moments ago: Cuomo said the price of a ventilator has increased from $25,000 when the state began purchasing to about $45,000 today due to the spike in demand New York pharmacies have been asked to deliver medications free of charge President Trump has approved four additional temporary hospital sites with a total capacity of 4,000 additional beds Cuomo says 600 beds will be reserved for coronavirus patients only at three of the purpose-built sites The number of New York coronavirus cases increased to 52,318 and deaths to 728 \u2013 but hospitalizations dropped from 847 on Friday from 1,154 on Thursday Cuomo says he did not discuss a potential \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut in reference to Trump\u2019s comments on the North Lawn only moments earlier The New York police department saw its third coronavirus death on Saturday, with the passing of a detective, the New York Post reported. The detective, who worked at a precinct station house in Manhattan\u2019s Harlem neighborhood, was 48. An NYPD administrative aide, and a department janitor, died Thursday due to Covid-19. On Friday, the police department said Friday that 442 uniformed, and 70 civilian, members tested positive for coronavirus. There were 4,111 uniformed employees who called out sick, comprising 11.4% of NYPD\u2019s uniformed workforce. Cuomo says he believes the broad distribution of a home test for people, to ensure the state is on the downside of the apex, is the most direct route toward re-opening the economy. \u201cGet those home tests that other countries are starting to use and let people test themselves,\u201d he says. \u201cYou could get to a point where you say ... do the test, you\u2019re negative, go to work, period.\u201d The governor adds that he is against raising taxes to generate more revenue in the state budget: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you raise taxes on people who are out of work and their business has closed because the government needs more funding. I don\u2019t know how you do that now.\u201d Cuomo says he did not discuss a potential \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut when he spoke with President Trump earlier today. \u201cI haven\u2019t had those conversations,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means.\u201d His response to a follow-up question about Trump\u2019s proposed quarantine on the North Lawn: \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that means. I don\u2019t know how that could be legally enforceable. And from a medical point of view I don\u2019t know what you would be accomplishing. But I can tell you I don\u2019t even like the sound of it. Not even understanding what it is, I don\u2019t even like the sound of it.\u201d He adds: \u201cMandatory quarantine is a scary concept because it sounds like you\u2019re saying to people: \u2018You can\u2019t leave this district.\u2019\u201d In New York, Cuomo is now being asked about Trump\u2019s remarks. He spoke to the president \u201cabout the ship coming up and the four sites\u201d, he says, adding: \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to him about any quarantine.\u201d More from the White House pool about Trump\u2019s remarks during his trip to Norfolk, Virginia about a potential quarantine for New York and neighbouring states: President Trump touched down at Joint Base Andrews at 12.33pm. He answered questions on the possible quarantine. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it,\u201d he said on quarantine of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. \u201cNo we wouldn\u2019t do that,\u201d when asked about closing the New York City subway. He said he would talk to Governor Andrew Cuomo later today. Pool reporter Emily Goodin of the Daily Mail adds: \u201cPlease note there is a limited pool of seven traveling with [Trump] so we can employ safe social distancing practices with an empty seat in between each of us on the plane. Additionally, the pool underwent a temperature check \u2026 before boarding.\u201d Cuomo says they can\u2019t have a scenario where states are competing against each other for equipment like ventilators. He suggests the federal government could act as a single purchasing agent and distribute the equipment to the states \u2013 or the states could set up a consortium on their own. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a situation where 50 states are competing for the same essential equipment,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is not the way to do business. We need a nationwide buying consortium. ... This is something that needs to be worked out, not just for this but for the future.\u201d Here\u2019s the White House pool report on what Trump said just now: We\u2019d like to see NY quarantined because it\u2019s a hotspot \u2013 New York, New Jersey, maybe one or two other places, certain parts of Connecticut quarantined. I\u2019m thinking about that right now. We might not have to do it but there\u2019s a possibility that sometime today we\u2019ll do a quarantine \u2013 short-term two weeks for New York, probably New Jersey and parts of Connecticut.\u201d The report adds that Trump\u2019s helicopter departed for his trip to Norfolk, Virginia with new chief of staff Mark Meadows also on board. Cuomo says there are 7,328 people who have been hospitalized with 1,755 people in ICUs, but notes that daily hospitalizations and ICU admissions went down yesterday. The bad news: total deaths in New York are up to 728 from 519 yesterday. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much stock in any one number. The overall trend is still up,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cThe numbers drive the policy.\u201d He also says New York\u2019s department of health will begin a new test to see if individuals who were infected with coronavirus developed antibodies to the disease, saying: \u201cIt could be a big breakthrough\u201d While Andrew Cuomo speaks in New York, Donald Trump has been speaking about New York, in Washington: According to Idrees Ali of Reuters, the president also said \u201cquarantine would also be considered on New Jersey and Connecticut, would rather not do it but may need it\u201d. Cuomo hasn\u2019t mentioned possible quarantine of New York yet. The president is due in Norfolk, Virginia later, for the departure of the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship destined for New York harbour. Cuomo told his press conference he had spoken to the president today, and Trump had approved four more emergency hospital facilities like the one built at the Javits Center in Manhattan by the Army Corps of Engineers and the national guard, which Cuomo said will open on Monday. The new facilities will be built in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Cuomo says the federal government has authorized four more field hospitals with a total capacity of 4,000 additional beds. They will be located in the four outer boroughs of Brooklyn (the Cruise Ship Terminal), Queens (the Aqueduct Racetrack), Staten Island (CUNY Staten Island) and the Bronx (the NY Expo Center). He adds there will be a shift to coronavirus-only hospitals to further limit the risk of spread. \u201cThis is smart and we\u2019re going to isolate 600 beds for just this treatment,\u201d he says. Also, the New York state presidential primary scheduled for April 28 has been re-scheduled for 23 June. Cuomo says that local hospitals statewide must stop operating as individual institutions and start cooperating to help deal with the anticipated rush. \u201cWe need the local health systems to think more holistically,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can have a single hospital get overwhelmed within that system. ... The local health systems have to change their orientation where it\u2019s not hospital by hospital, which is the normal culture.\u201d If downstate hospitals become overwhelmed, those patients may be moved upstate. He adds: \u201cPatients can and should be moved among those local hospitals as the need requires. staff can and should be moved among those local hospitals as the circumstances require.\u201d Cuomo is showing off a bag-valve mask, a manual ventilator that helps people breathe. The National Guard is being trained to manually operate them, but it\u2019s anything but optimal. \u201cIf we have to turn to this device on any large-scale basis, that is not an acceptable situation,\u201d he says. \u201cShort answer: No, thank you.\u201d He says there are 4,000 ventilators from the federal government are in the stockpile, meaning a big shortfall must be made up in the 14 to 21 days before the apex. He says the ventilators were $25,000 apiece when the state began buying, but they\u2019re up to $45,000 today due to the demand. And because the state is approximately $15bn in debt, there is \u201cno interest in inflating the number of ventilators than we actually need\u201d. New York governor Andrew Cuomo starts off his daily briefing saying he only knew it was Saturday because it said so on his alarm clock: \u201cIt\u2019s literally like one day blending into the other.\u201d He points out that China\u2019s first Covid-19 case was 12 weeks ago, New York\u2019s first case was on 1 March, and that city schools closed only 10 days ago. \u201cKeep it all in perspective in this disorienting time,\u201d he says. From police roadblocks in the Florida Keys, national guard troops knocking on doors in Rhode Island in attempt to \u201chunt down\u201d New Yorkers, and city leaders nationwide threatening fines for residents found out in the open, the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on personal freedoms was becoming clearer on Saturday, as the death toll continued to rise. Measures in Rhode Island attracted harsh words from the American Civil Liberties Union, which criticized what it saw as the \u201cblunderbuss approach\u201d of state troopers stopping vehicles from New York and ordering occupants into quarantine. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, New York state led the nation with more than 46,000 confirmed cases by Saturday morning, compared to Rhode Island\u2019s 203. \u201cUnder the Fourth Amendment, having a New York state license plate simply does not, and cannot, constitute probable cause to allow police to stop a car and interrogate the driver, no matter how laudable the goal of the stop may be,\u201d Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island\u2019s ACLU chapter, said in a statement. \u201cThe ACLU recognizes that strong measures are needed to address the public health crisis but giving the state police the power to stop \u2026 cars that are merely traveling through the state is a blunderbuss approach that cannot be justified in light of its substantial impact on civil liberties.\u201d Gina Raimondo, the Rhode Island governor, implemented the policy in a two-pronged attempt to keep out or contain visitors from New York. Another controversial measure saw the national guard, in the words of the New York Post, \u201chunting down\u201d New Yorkers by going door to door, beginning on Saturday. Any found would be ordered into a 14-day quarantine and face fines or jail time for refusing to comply. \u201cRight now we have a pinpointed risk. That risk is New York City,\u201d Raidondo said in a press conference on Friday. New Yorkers are personae non gratae in other areas of the country, too, with governors in Florida, Maryland, South Carolina and Texas imposing quarantine restrictions. They are also not wanted out of doors in their own city, Mayor Bill De Blasio threatening fines of $500 for groups congregating in parks or places of worship. Meanwhile in the Florida Keys, state law enforcement officials set up roadblocks this weekend at the top of the 125-mile island chain, to stop non-residents getting in. \u201cAs much as we love our visitors, we\u2019d like them to stay away until we can get this thing under control. These are extraordinary times, not just here but globally,\u201d Heather Carruthers, the Monroe county mayor, told reporters. Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan following his public back-and-forth with state governor Gretchen Whitmer over the federal government\u2019s response to the pandemic. More than 3,600 people in Michigan have been confirmed to have Covid-19 with at least 92 dead, mostly from the three counties in the Detroit metro area. A Huffington Post feature published Friday took a hard look at how America\u2019s poorest big city is uniquely unprepared for what\u2019s ahead. Detroit\u2019s deep poverty makes it especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak and the economic damage it has already inflicted, presenting the city\u2019s public health system with a daunting challenge in slowing the pandemic. \u201cWhere you have generations of concentrated poverty and social determinants of health, when you have pandemics like this, it is going to hit those places harder,\u201d Michigan\u2019s Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said at a Thursday press conference. The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has increased faster here than they did earlier in epicenters like New York City and Seattle. And Wayne County, which encompasses Detroit and nearby suburbs, has the seventh-highest total of confirmed cases in the country, just behind Seattle\u2019s King County. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) last week issued a shelter-in-place order through April 13 as the disease rapidly spread. In Detroit, a history of poor public policy decisions is behind the systemic poverty that has made folks in the city \u201cso much more susceptible,\u201d said former Detroit Health Department Director Abdul El-Sayed. \u201cWhen you talk about any epidemic, it\u2019s not enough to look at the virus or pathogen,\u201d he said. \u201cYou also have to look at the host and environment, and in Detroit you have hosts who are, for many reasons outside of their control, systematically less healthy, in general.\u201d We\u2019re awaiting New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing from Albany. As the US has surpassed Italy and China to become the country with the world\u2019s most known cases of coronavirus \u2013 104,713 as of this morning \u2013 nearly half of those (46,094) have been recorded in New York. And while the rate of new cases may be slowing, Cuomo said yesterday that he expects the demand for hospitalization to peak in 21 days and the state is creating a stockpile of medical equipment in preparation for that \u201capex\u201d accordingly. Former New York mayor and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani fired off a tweet on Friday that included misinformation about potential Covid-19 treatment and Michigan governor Gretcher Whitmer \u2013 and was subsequently deleted by the social media platform for violating its rules, Mediaite reports. Giuliani, a key player in an impeachment drama that ended in Trump\u2019s acquittal only last month but can now seem an event from the distant past, tweeted that \u201chydroxychloroquine has been shown to have a %100 effective rate treating Covid-19 Yet Democrat Gretchen Whitmer is threatening doctors who prescribe it.\u201d The tweet was comprised of \u201cdirect quotes\u201d from Charlie Kirk, an avowed Trump booster, Mediate noted, adding that the page which once held Giuliani\u2019s tweet now states: \u201cThis Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.\u201d Kirk\u2019s tweet was similarly axed. Giuliani and Kirk\u2019s promotion of hydroxychloroquine is not out of the blue: it\u2019s one of several drugs Trump has touted as possible coronavirus treatments, without support from public health officials. \u201cI sure as hell think we ought to give it a try,\u201d Trump has said of the common anti-malaria medication. He has also maintained that the drug, taken in combination with popular antibiotic azithromycin, could be \u201cone of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine\u201d. Dr Anthony Fauci, Trump\u2019s top infectious diseases adviser, was one of the public health experts who contradicted such claims, warning there was mere \u201canecdotal evidence\u201d of efficacy. In Arizona, a man died after he and his wife took chloroquine phosphate, a chemical used in the cleaning of fish tanks that is also in hydroxychloroquine. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the man\u2019s widow told NBC, advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d Donald Trump has not attacked New York governor Andrew Cuomo much recently, certainly in comparison to Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Jay Inslee of Washington, Democrats leading other states with severe coronavirus problems. But the New York governor\u2019s brother, Chris Cuomo, has attacked Trump. On Friday night the CNN host slammed the president\u2019s response to the coronavirus, saying Trump\u2019s personality traits \u201care literally making us sick\u201d: If the federal government and the states don\u2019t get it together better, you will see sickness and death in this country like you never have before. And while there are a growing number of mayors and governors in need, there is one persistent problem at the top: Trump. His two defining flaws are on flagrant display. They are literally making us sick.\u201d Cuomo said Trump\u2019s \u201cignorance\u201d and \u201carrogance\u201d \u2013 including his statement that \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators\u201d \u2013 stood at odds with communities needs in fighting this outbreak. He doesn\u2019t \u2018believe.\u2019 What about this. When you go to war, do you give troops what they need before they come under fire? Yes, right? Same with healthcare workers. They need the PPE [personal protective equipment] now. They need the ventilators in their localities now so when they run out of either, there are more at the ready. Either he doesn\u2019t get that, which speaks to a degree of ignorance that is more threatening anything Covid-19 can do, or it is just his second defining flaw on display, his arrogance.\u201d Cuomo also criticized Trump\u2019s comments about governors during his White House coronavirus briefing Friday, when Trump said: \u201cI want them to be appreciative \u2026 if they don\u2019t treat you right, I don\u2019t call.\u201d The younger Cuomo said: No, you treat them right. Our money, our government, our power. We gave it to you. We don\u2019t serve you. You serve us.\u201d One would expect Trump to hit back \u2013 he regularly criticises the CNN host and has employed \u201cFredo\u201d, after the ineffective and doomed younger Corleone brother played by John Cazale in the Godfather movies, as an abusive nickname. The former Republican senator Tom Coburn has died at 72, according to a newspaper in his native Oklahoma. The Oklahoman published a statement from the senator\u2019s family and said he died after \u201ca long fight with prostate cancer\u201d. Coburn, the paper said: Served in the Senate from 2005 to 2015 and in the US House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001. After leaving the Senate, he pushed for a constitutional convention and advocated for a range of conservative fiscal causes. Coburn was a doctor who resigned his Senate seat following his cancer diagnosis. \u201cThis decision isn\u2019t about my health, my prognosis or even my hopes and desires,\u201d he said then. \u201cAs a citizen, I am now convinced that I can best serve my own children and grandchildren by shifting my focus elsewhere.\u201d One such effort was in support of rightwing efforts to call a Constitutional Convention, in an attempt to dramatically restrict the powers of the US federal government. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for the future of our country,\u201d Coburn told the annual convention of the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec) in New Orleans in August 2018. \u201cWe\u2019re either going to become a socialist, Marxist country like western Europe, or we\u2019re going to be free. As far as me and my family and my guns, I\u2019m going to be free.\u201d Coburn died as Congress passed and Donald Trump signed the $2.2tn CARES Act, a huge stimulus bill aimed at bailing out US businesses and tax payers during the economic crash caused by the coronavirus outbreak. According to a friend quoted by the Oklahoman on Saturday, the former senator was \u201cfighting up to the very end. He was fighting for all of the things he still believed in.\u201d Among Trump\u2019s tweets on Friday night were retweets in support of Trish Regan, a TV host who left Fox Business after saying Democrats were using the coronavirus outbreak in their attempts to bring the president down. \u201cCan\u2019t say enough wonderful things about [Trish Regan],\u201d read one missive retweeted by Trump, calling her \u201cone of the few conservatives in cable television \u2026 a great patriot and great friend\u201d. Another, tweeting a story from the far-right site Gateway Pundit, was headlined: \u201cFOX Business Network Fires [Regan] for Telling the Truth About How Liberal Media Was Using Coronavirus to Take Down Trump.\u201d Here\u2019s how we reported Regan\u2019s original comments: According to CNN media reporter and host Brian Stelter, meanwhile, \u201cit should be noted that Regan\u2019s commentary, while reprehensible, wasn\u2019t much different than what Fox\u2019s main stars were saying. Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, as I previously reported, both downplayed the virus and suggested it was being used by the media to \u2018bludgeon\u2019 Trump.\u201d Trump himself regularly complains about Democrats allegedly politicising the coronavirus outbreak. Perhaps, then, Regan was more vulnerable simply because she was not so big a name in the Fox News and Business firmament. After all, Hannity has a direct line to the president: Good morning, and welcome to another day of Guardian coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Donald Trump was up early on Saturday, tweeting complaints about \u201cthe Lamestream media\u201d. Various stories have got the president\u2019s goat, including one which said he has consulted New York Yankees star, drugs cheat and partner of Jennifer Lopez Alex Rodriguez about how to tackle the crisis. ABC News put that one down to \u201cmultiple sources\u201d. The president said: \u201cWhen you see, \u2018five sources say\u2019, don\u2019t believe the story\u2026\u201d So that was fun. Trump has also been pursuing attacks on governors he doesn\u2019t like, particularly Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat he claimed with no discernible irony was \u201cway in over her head\u201d, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue\u201d and \u201clikes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude!\u201d Trump does have official business to attend to on Saturday, traveling to Norfolk, Virginia to deliver remarks as the USNS Comfort hospital ship sets sail for New York harbour. At the White House briefing on Friday, the 73-year-old president was asked: \u201cGiven that older Americans are advised to stay at home and avoid travel, is it absolutely necessary for you to go to Norfolk, Virginia tomorrow to wave goodbye to the ship?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d Trump answered, \u201cbut I have spirit for the country.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s great if I go to Virginia,\u201d he added. \u201c\u2026 It\u2019s a tiny trip. And I think it\u2019s a good thing when I go over there and I say thank you. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to be hugging people and it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m going to be shaking people\u2019s hands and everything, but I think it sends a signal when the president is able to go there and say thank you. So, we\u2019ll be careful.\u201d Trump is due to leave the White House at midday, perhaps a first chance to pass comment on new developments in the crisis. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, as of Saturday morning more than 100,000 US cases had been confirmed and 1,541 people had died. Nearly 45,000 of those cases and more than 500 of those deaths happened in New York state. Expect to hear more from Governor Andrew Cuomo, the Democrat widely said to be having a \u201cgood crisis\u201d as a leader, later. Bryan Armen Graham will be here soon to take you through the day.

      "bodyText": "Susie Ferguson wakes up a luxurious 12 minutes later than usual \u2013 at 4.15am \u2013 and begins the seven-second commute to work, down the hallway to her home broadcasting studio, also known as the family office. At 6am she goes live from New Zealand\u2019s capital, Wellington \u2013 her children asleep in rooms nearby \u2013 to host the flagship morning news programme on Radio New Zealand (RNZ), the country\u2019s national public radio broadcaster. A four-week lockdown began on Wednesday night in an effort to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, meaning that almost all New Zealanders are required to stay home at all times and completely self-isolate. Although news media is considered an \u201cessential service\u201d \u2013 meaning reporters can still go to the office to do their jobs if necessary \u2013 many are opting to work from home. Ferguson \u2013 who had a rarely used direct line to Radio New Zealand\u2019s studios installed in her office years ago, when she became co-host of the Morning Report programme \u2013 is among them. \u201cThere\u2019s a slight sense of panic all the time \u2013 are the children about to start screaming or is the dog about to start barking? What\u2019s going to do the broadcast in this morning?\u201d she says. \u201cSo far that hasn\u2019t happened, but you never know.\u201d With a desk covered in overlapping white towels \u2013 so that her voice does not bounce off the hard surface, giving listeners the warmer feel of a broadcast studio \u2013 and hand-made signs posted around the house reminding her children, seven and 10, to be quiet, she starts the three-hour programme with one child asleep in the next room, about six metres away. Her husband is on high alert to prevent Ferguson being interrupted for questions about toothbrushes or breakfast. After the broadcast finishes, the pair help the children with their schoolwork; New Zealand\u2019s schools closed for at least a month on Monday. \u201cI kind of read them the riot act on Sunday night and said \u2018look, this has got to be able to work\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey do understand this is really important, but I think as this becomes more normal, that\u2019s when there\u2019s going to be more danger of [interruptions] happening.\u201d \u2018Welcome to the beginning of a new normal\u2019 It is not her first unusual broadcast location. Ferguson has reported from Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan, where she frequently covered her head in towels, duvets, and sleeping bags while recording audio in order to achieve a \u201cclean\u201d sound. But even for the veteran presenter, the situation is \u201codd\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit strange doing it here, which is why I made a little RNZ sign, so it makes it feel a little bit more like I\u2019m at work,\u201d she says. Her desk is decorated with encouraging figures \u2013 including two Funko Pop dolls. While her co-host Corin Dann, who is based in Wellington, admitted hosting the show last week in his track pants, Ferguson can take herself seriously only in her regular work clothes. \u201cThe only thing is I\u2019ve put some shoes on now but I was wearing some alpaca socks,\u201d she says. She has even built herself an \u201cergonomic\u201d work stand for her laptop out of a stack of magazines (covered in a sound-muffling towel, of course). \u201cWelcome to the beginning of a new normal,\u201d Ferguson told listeners after the eight o\u2019clock news on Tuesday. She understands that they want reassurance from her in unprecedented times. \u201cWe\u2019re sort of making it up as we go along,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople, I think, do want that comfort and reassurance as well as up-to-the-minute news and the latest on whatever the developments might be.\u201d Ferguson knows her listeners badly want something else, too: for a child or dog to breach the purple washing basket positioned as a warning just outside the office door. Numerous people have sent her Gifs and images from the infamous \u201cBBC Dad\u201d video, in which Korea expert Professor Robert Kelly\u2019s preschooler burst into his office during a live TV interview, followed closely by his baby and his wife. \u201cI do get the sense that people are intently waiting for the children to burst in and the dog to burst in,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cI am the BBC Dad right now.
