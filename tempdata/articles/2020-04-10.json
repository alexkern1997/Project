Many Australian GP clinics depend on rental payments from co-located pathology centres to remain viable, and the revenue source has become increasingly important during the coronavirus crisis, which has cut their patient numbers, upended their business model and left many on the brink of collapse. But Guardian Australia and the Medical Republic, a specialist health publication, have learned that some of Australia\u2019s biggest pathology companies have begun writing to GP clinics requesting they accept a 50% reduction in rent. GPs say they feel pressured to accept or face an early termination of their lease. That pressure is compounded by a decision of the federal government to block new pathology services from opening to replace any that close down in the next six months. The situation has left GPs facing an invidious choice: accept the 50% rent reduction or risk losing an existing tenant and the entirety of their rent for the next six months. The Australian General Practitioners Alliance, the peak body for GP-owned clinics, says GPs depend on pathology rents to survive, particularly at a time of significant losses in revenue. \u201cIn some cases, this may make the difference between general practices remaining open or closing,\u201d said the alliance\u2019s executive officer, Richard Hart.

A federal Department of Health spokesperson confirmed it was pausing new pathology leases \u2013 making it all but impossible for GPs to find replacement tenants \u2013 as part of Australia\u2019s response to Covid-19. The moratorium on opening new pathology centres where an existing collection centre closes will operate between 27 March and 30 September 2020.

A quick glance at data provided by the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcovidtracking.com%2Fdata\">Covid Tracking Project</a>, a collaborative, volunteer-run project that collects data from local health departments, shows that about 28 states plus US Samoa meet that threshold.</p> <p>While that\u2019s still a slight majority of states, a handful are seeing much more dire statistics. Out of people tested in New York, about 40% have tested positive. Surrounding states also have grim stats: Thirty percent of those tested in Connecticut and 47% of those tested in New Jersey were positive. Presenting this number doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of the spread of the disease in the United States since testing has been limited until very recently. In certain states like New York, where tests have been limited and the spread has been massive, requirements to getting tested are strict.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump repeatedly played down the importance of widespread testing before reopening the country for business during the daily coronavirus briefing. Trump reportedly intends to form another task force that will work on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April. But White House health experts have cautioned against scaling back social distancing too quickly. Mike Pence said the treasury is on track to send Americans payments of up to $1,200 by the end of next week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Fact check: The majority of states have less than 10% positive cases Earlier, Dr Deborah Birx, a coordinator on the coronavirus response task force, said that 63% of the states (31 states) had less than 10% of total people tested for Covid-19 be positive. A quick glance at data provided by the Covid Tracking Project, a collaborative, volunteer-run project that collects data from local health departments, shows that about 28 states plus US Samoa meet that threshold. While that\u2019s still a slight majority of states, a handful are seeing much more dire statistics. Out of people tested in New York, about 40% have tested positive. Surrounding states also have grim stats: Thirty percent of those tested in Connecticut and 47% of those tested in New Jersey were positive. Presenting this number doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of the spread of the disease in the United States since testing has been limited until very recently. In certain states like New York, where tests have been limited and the spread has been massive, requirements to getting tested are strict. In states that have seen a less intense outbreak, testing has been more widely available. The CDC is now recommending that all Americans wear homemade, non-medical masks while in public. But experts from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine told the White House in a letter sent yesterday that \u201cthe available evidence is inconclusive about the degree to which homemade fabric masks may suppress spread of infection from the wearer to others\u201d. Although any sort of fabric mask will block at least some of the larger respiratory droplets, \u201cthere\u2019s little evidence regarding transmission of small aerosolized particulates,\u201d the researchers wrote. Further studies will reveal what sorts of masks, and fabrics, offer the most filtration. White House health officials like Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have warned that masks are meant to supplement, not replace, other safety measures such as handwashing and keeping a 6ft distance apart from others. The coronavirus briefing has ended. Fact check: flu comparisons Mike Pence said that \u201cwe\u2019ve known from the beginning that this at least three times more contagious than the flu. And, I believe that fact alone has informed our projections and the modeling.\u201d But the president has often compared coronavirus to the flu, from the beginning. In late March, Trump complained about distancing measures on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019ve never closed down the country for the flu,\u201d he said. On March 9, he tweeted, \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.\u201d On February 26, he said, \u201cI mean, view this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes \u2014 I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they\u2019re sneezing. \u201c A moment for fashion, and recognizing the importance of the world \u201cglobal\u201d in \u201cglobal health\u201d: Fact check: Oil market Trump repeatedly said that the oil market lost 40% of demand due to the Covid-19 crisis, but multiple reports say that the drop in demand worldwide is around 25% to 30%. The drop is still massive, largely due to the global halt in flights, and has put major oil-producing countries on edge. Today, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), excluding the United States, reportedly agreed on a cut in production to stop the steepening of oil prices. The US cannot force cuts on its oil manufacturers as easily as other countries, though countries like Russia are pressuring the US to consider taking measures to cut production. Dr Fauci, on what it could mean to \u201creopen\u201d the country: \u201cOften, people say re-open the government, like it\u2019s a light switch on-and-off for the entire country. We have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, it\u2019s not going to be a one size fits all.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting here that the federal government doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201cswitch on\u201d the economy all at once. States, counties and cities ultimately have a lot of authority to enforce distancing measures for as long as they deem necessary. Coronavirus testing by age: Dr Birx presented the following numbers on testing nationally. People younger than 25: 200,000 have been tested of which 11% tested positive Age 25-45: 500,000 were tested, 17% were positive Age 45-65: 500,000 were tested, 21% were positive Age 65-85: 200,000 were tested, 22% were positive People older than 85: 30,000 tested, 24% were positive Dr Anthony Fauci provided some good news with the bad. This has been a very bad week in terms of the number of deaths, he said. At the same time, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalization\u201d in New York, he said. \u201cThat means what we are doing is working, and therefore we need to continue.\u201d More women than men are getting tested for coronavirus, but more men test positive for the virus, said Dr Deborah Birx. That suggests that men may not report symptoms or get help until they\u2019re much sicker, she said. Once they finally do get to a health provider, they already have the virus. She asked men to seek help as soon as they think they needed it, rather than waiting. Pence said that White House officials are looking at whether health workers can wear reusable cloth gowns, instead of disposable ones, which are running out. Hospitals may have to \u201crecycle gowns\u201d to stretch their supplies, Pence said. More guidelines are forthcoming, he said. Mike Pence says the administration is \u201con the timetable\u201d to send out the first round of stimulus checks by the end of next week. Many Americans will receive up to $1,200. Fact check: Testing again More from Trump on testing: \u201cDo you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 325 million people and that\u2019s not going to happen, as you can imagine. And it would never happen with anyone else either.\u201d Politico recently reported on a plan developed by two former FDA commissioners, Mark McClellan and Scott Gottlieb, to reopen the economy that hinged on widespread testing and a vast expansion of the United States\u2019 public health system. Serology or antibody tests \u2013 which can help detect if a person\u2019s immune system has faced off against Covid-19 and recovered from it \u2014 could also help public health officials know when to ease back distancing and reopen businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told the Guardian, because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said. Fact check: US stockpile of hydroxychloroquine Trump said that the US has \u201cpurchased and stockpiled millions and millions of doses\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has been touting as a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. Medical experts, including the US National Institute of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci, has said there is no clinical evidence yet that the drug can effectively treat the disease. Clinical trials have only recently begun. The US does have a hefty stockpile of the drug thanks to a recent donation from drugmaker Novartis, who said early last week that Sandoz, its generic drug division, will donate 30m doses of the medicine to the federal government. Novartis said in a press release that the doses of the drug will be used for controlled clinical studies to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness against covid-19. Fact check: Ventilator shortages \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing of people needing ventilators much.\u201d It is true that some states have ended up with more ventilators than they think they need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said hospitals there would run out of the machines this week, and the number of cases continue to grow. Asked how the country could reopen without an effective national system for coronavirus testing, Trump responded that \u201cthere are certain sections of the country that are in phenomenal shape already.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify what those areas are. Public health experts have said that widespread testing is a key precursor to easing back social distancing measures. Trump also said that the US will soon be doing \u201cmassive testing\u201d, even though it\u2019s not necessary, wihout providing any further detail on what that entails. Fact check: Temporary hospitals Trump said that Army Corps of Engineers have built 21 temporary hospitals nationwide, making up an additional 17,000 beds. But according to a government press statement released yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers has so far constructed 17 facilities, totaling 14,579 beds. Another 23 facilities made up of 8,571 beds are pending. Donald Trump said he\u2019s going to take a few questions from reporters before returning to negotiations on oil and air travel. His conversation with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman was \u201cvery good,\u201d he said. They\u2019re \u201cgetting close to a deal\u201d and \u201cgetting along very well.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens, but it was a very good call,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: Testing \u201cOur tests are highly sophisticated,\u201d Trump said, once again repeating a line that the US has done more testing than other countries. While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 113 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 90 people. Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 1,951,044 tests, according to the Atlantic\u2019s Covid Tracking Project \u2014 so the US has tested about 1 in every 168 people. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine As usual, Trump is touting hydroxychloroquine, noting that drug companies are ramping up productions and that the US has stockpiled doses. In the week beginning March 30, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. Clinical trials to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works. So far, the evidence that it\u2019s an effective cure for coronavirus is thin. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with the dug has since been discredited. The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it\u2019s unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by.

The president said he\u2019s looking into whether some parts of the economy can be reinstated sooner. Trump has taken the podium after a few delays. The president is expected to speak within the next half hour. While the press and the public has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has pushed through his agenda, giving handouts to big business, appointing judges and rolling back regulations. My colleagues Emily Holden and David Smith report: The last time America was facing a possible economic depression, Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, observed: \u201cNever allow a good crisis go to waste. It\u2019s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible.\u201d It is advice Donald Trump and his Republican allies appear to have taken to heart. Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Obama\u2019s successor and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. CNN says that the vice president is not allowing top health officials to appear on the network, in order to pressure them to carry the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings. From CNN: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office reversed course on Thursday afternoon, after declining for days to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN and discuss the coronavirus pandemic, in what was an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. After this story was published, Pence\u2019s office allowed for the booking of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield for CNN\u2019s Thursday night coronavirus town hall. Dr. Anthony Fauci was also booked for Friday on \u201cNew Day.\u201dTrump makes 86 false claims over two weeks, including whoppers about Bloomberg, Pelosi and Social SecurityPreviously, Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it would only allow experts such as Fauci or Dr. Deborah Birx to appear on CNN if the network televised the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. Nine civil rights groups in the South have called for regional officials to issue protective measures for people who work at or are detained at correctional and juvenile facilities. \u201cGovernment officials to implement desperately needed protections against Covid-19 infection and deaths in correctional and juvenile facilities throughout the South, which disproportionately incarcerate Black individuals,\u201d the groups wrote in a statement. \u201cWith poor health outcomes, inadequate access to health care, and elevated poverty rates, the South, which incarcerates a larger portion of its population than any other region in the nation, is exceptionally vulnerable to a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in its facilities.\u201d Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, reporting from the West Coast. Joe Biden hold a wide lead over Donald Trump, according to a new CNN poll. The former vice president leads 53% to 42% among registered voters. The poll also found that voters trusted Biden more to handle the response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare and helping the middle class. Of those polled, 52% said they trusted Biden, compared to 43% tho trusted Trump to handle to the coronavirus crisis. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Trump reportedly intends to announce the formation of a second coronavirus task force. The task force will be working on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned of a potential resurgence in coronavirus cases if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the US economy may be reopened on a \u201crolling basis.\u201d \u201cThe next month or two, we should be able to restart at least on a rolling basis,\u201d Kudlowtold Fox Business. \u201cOur intent here was, is to try to relieve people of the enormous difficult hardships they are suffering through no fault of their own.\u201d Trump reportedly intends to form a second coronavirus task force with an eye on reopening the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned against easing social distancing restrictions too quickly. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: While cases in California continue to rise, data is revealing promising points. For the first time in his daily press conferences, governor Gavin Newsom said, he could report that the number of patients admitted to ICUs dropped by 1.9%. He cautioned, however, that a modest, one-day drop could be a statistical blip. Hospitalizations ticked up 4.1% over the past 24 hours, to 2,825 patients. The racial disparities in deaths and Covid-19 cases that have surfaced in other states like Louisiana have so far not played out in California. While the data remains incomplete, with just over half of cases broken down by race, the trends so far track roughly with the demographics of the state\u2019s population. While the governor offered optimism and hope, he warned that the worst may be yet to come. \u201cThe peak we projected is different from the one advertised by academics in other states,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin California, we believe the peak extends into May, not in the next week or two.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: In California, where coronavirus cases have topped 18,300, officials are offering relief to frontline workers in the form of hotel rooms for free or at \u201cdeep discount\u201d rates to provide lodging if they\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and don\u2019t want to return home, governor Gavin Newsom said at an afternoon press conference. United, Southwest, Alaska and Delta airlines have additionally promised to cover travel costs for healthcare professionals working on the front lines. \u201cThose are the four airlines that have met this moment\u201d, Newsom said. The governor also responded to fear expressed by Californians who said the state was giving away its precious stockpile of equipment to other states like New York and New Jersey. For the moment, there\u2019s enough to share, he said: California has 8,000 ventilators, about 32 percent of its stash, within its hospital system that aren\u2019t currently being used. \u201cWe thought it was the right thing to do, but also the responsible thing to do as American citizens to save lives\u201d, Newsom said of the effort to assist other states. After states use ventilators, they have agreed to send them back to California. Over the past month officials in California have cobbled together a healthy supply of ventilators, boosting its stash from 7,500 ventilators a month ago to the 11,750 it currently has. Trump lashed out against the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper published a critical editorial about his daily briefings on the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal always \u2018forgets\u2019 to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are \u2018through the roof,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet, dismissing the newspaper as \u201cFake News.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet came about an hour after Fox News ran a segment on the editorial, which expressed disappointment that the daily White House briefings had become \u201call about the President.\u201d \u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him. Perhaps they substitute in his mind for the campaign rallies he can no longer hold because of the risks. Perhaps he resented the media adulation that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been receiving for his daily show. Whatever the reason, the briefings are now all about the President.\u201d The White House distributed a fact sheet on coronavirus to reporters, who will now be tested for the virus before attending the daily briefing. The White House also said that it would only alert reporters of their results if a test came back positive. The White House press office announced today that it would start administering rapid coronavirus tests to reporters after one journalist, who was last at the White House on Tuesday, started developing symptoms. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign will continue providing health care coverage for its employees through the end of October, even though the Vermont senator suspended his presidential bid yesterday. In comparison, former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is facing two lawsuits after he dismissed staffers eight months earlier than promised. One lawsuit accused Bloomberg of having \u201cdeprived [staffers] of promised income and health care benefits, leaving them and their families potentially uninsured in the face of a global pandemic.\u201d Joe Biden has released a new plan to \u201chelp ease the economic burden on working people\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The presumptive Democratic nominee proposed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60 and forgive student debt from public universities for those making less than $125,000. \u201cI believe that as we are being plunged into what is likely to be one of the most volatile and difficult economic times in this country\u2019s recent history, we can take these critical steps to help make it easier for working people to make ends meet,\u201d Biden wrote in a Medium post detailing the plan. The former vice president specifically credited Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race yesterday, for helping to bring these proposals forward. \u201cSenator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I\u2019m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Biden wrote. After Sanders announced his decision to suspend his campaign yesterday, Biden made a pitch to his supporters, pledging to address their priorities in his campaign. The effort reflects Biden\u2019s need to unify the party and win over Sanders\u2019 supporters in order to defeat Trump in November. Trump celebrated the news that Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, wishing the British prime minister a speedy recovery. The White House said it would start administering coronavirus tests to reporters attending the daily briefing after one journalist who was recently at the White House started showing symptoms. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the affected reporter was last at the White House on Tuesday, and the person\u2019s test results are expected later today. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the White House Medical Unit is going to conduct a COVID-19 test on all members of the press who plan to participate in today\u2019s task force briefing, including correspondents, photographers, and technicians,\u201d the White House press office said in a statement. The White House announced last week that anyone seeing Trump or Vice President Mike Pence would take a rapid coronavirus test to prevent them from catching it. Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, as the British prime minister continues to recover from coronavirus. Downing Street said in a statement, \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits.\u201d For more updates, follow the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus blog: The Trump administration has carried out nearly 10,000 summary deportations or \u201cexpulsions\u201d since March 21, using emergency public health measures that have given US Customs and Border Protection broad authority to bypass immigration laws, CBP officials said Thursday, the Washington Post reports. The measures have allowed the agency to turn away most unauthorized migrants, sending them back across the Mexican border. The moves have dramatically slashed the number of detainees held in border stations, where they fear the coronavirus could spread, the officials said. CBP currently has fewer than 100 detainees in custody, down from nearly 20,000 at this time last year during last year\u2019s border crisis, officials said. Since the implementation of the rapid expulsions, unlawful border crossings have dropped 56 percent, said acting CBP commissioner Mark Morgan. Morgan also acknowledged that the United States has all but closed its borders to asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution, including those who attempt to enter legally at US ports of entry. \u201cThose who are undocumented or don\u2019t have documents or authorization are turned away,\u201d Morgan said. Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of defying U.S. laws and exceeding the authority of the coronavirus public health order, but Morgan defended the emergency measures as a necessary step to stop the spread of the disease. Congressman Neal Dunn has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to contract the virus. Dunn\u2019s office said in a statement that he was not feeling well on Monday and received a coronavirus test, which just came back positive. \u201cCongressman Dunn is feeling great and currently quarantining himself at home per CDC guidelines and working on Phase IV of the Administration\u2019s response to this pandemic,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cHe expects a full recovery soon.\u201d Dunn\u2019s diagnosis comes about a month after fellow Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart became one of the first two members of Congress to test positive for coronavirus. The first lady\u2019s office created a video urging Americans to wear face coverings in places where social distancing is difficult, such as grocery stores and pharmaries. \u201cRemember, this does not replace the importance of social distancing,\u201d Melania Trump says in the video. \u201cIt is another recommended guideline to keep us all safe.\u201d The CDC has recommended that Americans wear face coverings to help limit the spread of the virus, and some cities like Los Angeles have ordered residents to use them. The coronavirus pandemic has created some surreal scenes on Capitol Hill, reflected in these photos showing reporters questioning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell while practicing social distancing and wearing masks: Less than three months ago, reporters were crowding around senators to question them about the impeachment trial, but those frantic huddles have become dangerous in the age of coronavirus: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third day in a row. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died from the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the labor department\u2019s latest report. More than 16 million Americans have filed unemployment claims in the past three weeks. Mike Pence\u2019s office is blocking health experts from appearing on CNN in an effort to pressure the network to broadcast the daily White House briefing in full. CNN has only been carrying Trump\u2019s portion of the briefing live before cutting to analysis and fact-checking of the president\u2019s comments, which have frequently included falsehoods. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Nearly 50 emergency room doctors from New York City\u2019s public hospitals have written an open letter to residents, urging people not to \u201ccut corners,\u201d when physical distancing, hand-washing and self-isolating. \u201cEvery day, our emergency departments are overflowing with patients newly infected with COVID-19, many starving for oxygen and on the brink of death,\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cMany are older, but some are young. Many have pre-existing medical problems, but some do not. While we\u2019re constantly searching for new treatments and better ways to care for our patients, too many are dying despite our best efforts. These patients are also our friends, families, and colleagues,\u201d said the letter. The bullet point letter repeated many of the public health messages of recent days. The disease is more contagious than previously thought, mimics the flu, can be spread asymptomatically, for example. It urged people to wash their hands, to assume they have Covid-19 if they show any symptoms at all, however mild, and to isolate from family members. Millions of people are already taking these measures \u2013 but not diligently enough to stop the surge of patients coming to emergency rooms. \u201cMany of you have taken the steps above to protect yourself and others and we thank you. You are literally saving lives. But many of you have not \u2013 or continue to cut corners. This virus does not respect what we do \u2018most of the time,\u2019\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cFellow New Yorkers, we need to do more!\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for trying to pass a coronavirus relief bill without holding a vote. In consultation with the Trump administration, McConnell tried to get the bill, which would have allocated $250 billion in additional funds, approved by unanimous consent. But Democratic senators objected to the proposal, calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. The bill was not able to pass, and senators won\u2019t have a chance to take it up again until the pro forma session on Monday. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called the Democrats\u2019 objection \u201cdisgusting,\u201d but Pelosi said the fault lied with McConnell for not conferring with Democrats about the bill. Pelosi said treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had \u201casked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours with no data,\u201d and McConnell had honored that request. The House speaker dismissed McConnell\u2019s efforts today as a political \u201cstunt\u201d and called for more bipartisan deliberations over the timing and content of the bill. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his daily briefing, just said that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the New York economy are expected to be \u201cmore devastating\u201d than the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u201cby far\u201d. New York state is bracing for a hit to its revenues of between $10 billion and $15 billion, with the focus being on the business ghost town that currently is New York City - the city that never sleeps, the crossroads of the world, etc - which is eerily still with non-essential businesses closed and folks on \u2018stay home\u2019 orders. New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed cautious optimism about signs that the state is flattening the curve of coronavirus cases. However, the governor warned that the state\u2019s progress could be undone if social distancing practices are relaxed too quickly. \u201cRemember, the 1918 Spanish flu came in three waves,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the first wave. Everybody is assuming, well, once we get through this, we\u2019re done. I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume that. This virus has been ahead of us from day one.\u201d New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. Cuomo said the state would be bringing in additional funeral directors to help deal with the surge of deaths. As the state mourns the loss of several thousand New Yorkers, there are also signs that social distancing is flattening the curve. Yesterday, the state recorded the lowest number of new hospitalizations since the crisis started. The number of ICU admissions and intubations are also down. \u201cWe are saving lives by what we are doing today,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. The governor noted it has been 18 days since the state\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d order went into effect, even though it may feel like \u201ca lifetime\u201d ago. Cuomo also said hospitalizations in New York are currently lower than many projections initially predicted, applauding healthcare professionals and other first responders for their work. \u201cWe\u2019re flattening the curve so far,\u201d Cuomo said of social distancing measures, emphasizing that New Yorkers cannot get complacent now. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith and Emily Holden report: Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Trump and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. \u201cMost Americans are not tracking these at all,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe crisis has created a blizzard condition in which information and criticism is not breaking through. It\u2019s a perfect storm for Trump to push his agenda. You can hear ideologues saying: this is our moment, do not delay.\u201d Just as George W Bush\u2019s administration exploited 9/11 to expand government powers and threaten civil liberties such as freedom of speech and due process, Trump\u2019s White House scents political opportunity in a national crisis. The office of Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House coronavirus task force, has blocked CNN from access to health experts in an effort to pressure the network to carry the full daily White House briefing. CNN reports: Pence\u2019s office has declined to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN in recent days and discuss the coronavirus pandemic killing thousands of Americans, in an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it will only allow experts such as Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony Fauci to appear on CNN if the network televises the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. After Trump leaves the podium, CNN frequently cuts out of the White House briefing to discuss and fact-check what the President had said. A CNN executive said that the network usually returns to such programming because of the extensive length of the full briefing that includes Pence, which can run in excess of two hours. Many news organizations, including the Guardian, have taken to fact-checking the president\u2019s briefings in real time, after Trump repeatedly made misstatements about the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Georgia is moving its presidential primary for a second time. The state\u2019s presidential primary contest election, originally scheduled for March 24 is being pushed back from May 19 to June 9. All of the state\u2019s other statewide contests, which include partisan primaries and judicial races, are being moved to the June date, Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said in a statement. Raffensperger noted the decision came after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp extended a state of emergency in the state to May 13, which would cover almost every day of in-person voting allowed for the May 19 contest, Raffensperger noted. The secretary of state said, \u201cThis decision allows our office and county election officials to continue to put in place contingency plans to ensure that voting can be safe and secure when in-person voting begins and prioritizes the health and safety of voters, county election officials, and poll workers.\u201d Raffensperger previously began mailing applications for absentee ballots to 6.9 active registered voters in the state. He said Thursday that applications would continue to be accepted for the June 9 primary, even if the voter had requested it for the contest on May 19. Raffensperger faced criticism for his efforts to facilitate vote by mail from Georgia House Speaker David Ralston. He said efforts to make it easier to vote by mail \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.\u201d After the comments, Raffensperger announced he was setting up a task force to watch against voter fraud with mail-in ballots. The Senate failed to pass a bill allocating an additional $250 billion to the small business loan program created by last month\u2019s stimulus package. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tried to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but Senate Democrats objected because they are calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. McConnell objected to Democrats\u2019 proposed amendement to the bill, making it impossible to pass the bill by unanimous consent. The Senate has now adjourned until Monday, when McConnell will have another chance to push the bill through as businessowners fear the program will soon run out of funds. Joe Biden holds a 4-point lead over Trump in a new national poll, which comes a day after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign. According to the Monmouth University poll, Biden attracts the support of 48% of registered voters, while Trump stands at 44%. The result is similar to Biden\u2019s 3-point lead over Trump in a poll released last month. With Sanders dropping our of the race, such head-to-head polls between Trump and Biden have taken on a heightened level of significance as America looks ahead to the general election in November. However, national polls do not reflect the state-by-state nature of presidential elections. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost the electoral college, handing Trump a victory. Wisconsin continues to count ballots after its chaotic primary on Tuesday, which was disrupted by long lines and fears of spreading coronavirus at polling sites. More than a million absentee ballots have been returned, but the question remains whether turnout overall decreased due to people avoiding in-person voting. Some Wisconsin voters said they never received their absentee ballots, which left them with an undesirable choice between not voting at all and risking their health by voting in person. A Wisconsin state senator said yesterday that one post office found three large tubs of unsent absentee ballots the day after the primary. Senate Democrats are introducing their own coronavirus relief bill in an effort to get more funds for hospitals and state and local governments. In consultation with the Trump administration, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is trying to quickly pass a bill allocating an addition $250 billion to the small business loan program created by the stimulus package. The program was originally given $350 billion, but that money appears to be rapidly dwindling. Two Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, are now introducing their own bill to give additional funds to hospitals and state and local governments, as well as the small business loan program. But the conflict is unlikely to produce anything other than a messaging war, considering Republicans control the Senate and can push through their smaller bill, which Democrats are unlikely to oppose. When acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly traveled to Guam to criticize Captain Brett Crozier to his former crew members, it cost taxpayers approximately $243,000, according to a new report. Modly resigned earlier this week amid an uproar over his comments about Crozier, who raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Crozier was later removed from his post. Modly said that Crozier was either \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to command the ship if he did not think his letter expressing alarm would be made public. The acting secretary resigned a day after his comments came to light. USA Today reports: Modly flew aboard the C-37B, a Gulfstream business jet modified for military use. The per-hour cost of flying it is $6,946.19 per hour, according to the Navy official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Flight time for the Guam trip was about 35 hours for a cost of $243,116.65. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Michael Sainato report: More than 6.6 million Americans lost their jobs last week with 16 million jobs gone in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brought the US economy to a standstill, the US labor department confirmed on Thursday. Millions of Americans filed for unemployment benefits again last week as shutdowns across the US led employers to lay off workers in nearly every corner of the job market. Economists had expected 5.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 April. In the previous two weeks the shutdowns cost close to 10 million people their jobs. Layoffs that started in the restaurant and leisure industries have now spread to include manufacturing, construction and even healthcare. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, levels unseen since before the second world war. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171). But while the numbers are stark, economists cautioned it was too early to say what the long-term impact of Covid-19 will be on the economy. \u201cThese figures don\u2019t reflect a lack of demand,\u201d said Dean Baker, visiting professor and senior economist at the University of Utah. During the last recession in 2008 unemployment reached close to 10% as the economy fell into recession. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in our control. This is literally in our control,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe are deliberately shutting down the economy.\u201d Trump is reportedly planning to form a second coronavirus task force focused on reopening the US economy. The Washington Post reports: The taskforce will be made up of a mix of private-sector and top administration officials, including chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 whose first official day on the job was last week \u2013 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and national economic adviser Larry Kudlow, a senior administration official said. Meadows is likely to lead the taskforce, though no official decision has been made, two senior administration officials said ... The economic taskforce \u2014 which will be separate from the main coronavirus taskforce, despite having some overlapping members \u2013 will focus on how to reopen the country, as well as what businesses need to rebound amid catastrophic conditions. The goal is to get as much of the country as possible open by 30 April, the current deadline Trump set for stringent social distancing measures. News of the second taskforce \u2013 and the late April deadline \u2013 comes as health experts like Dr Anthony Fauci urge caution in declaring the virus to be defeated as encouraging signs indicate the US is starting to flatten the curve of cases. Good morning, live blog readers. There have been some promising signs in recent days that the US is starting to flatten the curve of its number of coronavirus cases, even as the death toll continues to climb. New York, the state with the most coronavirus cases, is seeing a decline in the rate of hospitalizations, and a frequently cited model decreased its projected number of overall deaths in the country to 60,000. At the daily White House briefing yesterday, Donald Trump sounded bullish on the perspective of soon reopening the economy, as reports indicate that he hopes to be able to relax physical distancing restrictions by the end of April. \u201cAspirationally, I said let\u2019s see if we can do it at Easter, but I said it would be very tough, and I was criticised for that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be very far behind and some of these models are looking like Easter\u2019s going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. It\u2019s hitting the top and it\u2019s starting to come down.\u201d But this morning, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, was hesitant to say that New York has flattened the curve, emphasizing that several days\u2019 data will be needed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to junmp the gun on that,\u201d Fauci said when asked whether New York had flattened the curve. \u201cBut I think that is the case.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m always very cautious about jumping the gun and saying, \u2018Well, we have turned the corner.\u2019 But I think we are really looking at the beginning of that, which would really be very encouraging. We need that right now.\u201d",

The company, which pays no tax in Australia, faces a multitude of potential legal suits and potential criminal charges as lawyers and police investigate the events that led to its final cruise from Sydney. The company is in deep financial distress due to the coronavirus pandemic, and even before the outbreak was laden with $10bn of debt that needs to be repaid or renegotiated within the year. The Ruby Princess left Sydney on 8 March and returned early on 19 March after a cruise to New Zealand. Since then there have been more than 660 Covid-19 cases and at least 13 deaths associated with Ruby Princess passengers. But lawyers are now focusing on what happened on the previous cruise, which disembarked on 8 March in Sydney. The two cruises The Australian has reported that 158 cases of sickness had been logged by the ship in a government portal used to monitor the condition of cruise ship passengers arriving in Australia, leading the Department of Health to classify the ship as \u201cmedium risk\u201d. But it has been widely reported that an email from the ship\u2019s master to the Port Authority of New South Wales on 8 March stated there were \u201cno ill passengers or crew on board\u201d and the ship was permitted to dock, and then load a further 2,700 passengers within a matter of hours. This was a month after the Ruby Princess\u2019s sister ship, the Diamond Princess, had been quarantined at Yokohama, Japan, and the world had watched horrified as Covid-19 spread like wildfire through the passengers and crew. Yet the illness on the Ruby Princess does not appear to have triggered additional safeguards or second thoughts about the next cruise. There is also heightened interest in what the Ruby Princess told the Port Authority and the ambulance service when it docked in the early hours of 19 March. According to a report in the Sunday Telegraph, there was a series of exchanges at midnight between the Port Authority, executives of Carnival Cruises and ambulance staff, which raise serious questions about whether Carnival was candid about the health of the two passengers transferred and the overall health of the passengers aboard. More than 110 passengers were ill, with 17 showing influenza-like symptoms.

A.C.N. 098 290 834 is also not listed on a tax office list of large and foreign-owned corporations that paid tax that year.

At the least, the claim is likely to seek the return of the ticket price to passengers \u2013 estimated by Shine to be an average of $3,000 a person \u2013 and damages for loss of enjoyment. Generally a person cannot sue for disappointment or distress after a breach of contract, but contracts to provide leisure services are different. The issue of damages for disappointment is now before the high court, which has heard argument in a case about Scenic Cruise in Europe in 2013. Because of high water levels, passengers were forced to take buses, rather than cruising Europe\u2019s rivers, prompting a class action by passengers against the cruise company. The passengers on the Ruby Princess potentially have much more to complain about but the high court decision will be an important precedent. The key question In the meantime, Shine will be seeking information on why Carnival chose to run the cruise in the first place, given that the previous cruise had 158 instances of sickness. \u201cThe ship was turned around in a matter of hours,\u201d Antzoulatos said. \u201cIt beggars belief that they could have sanitised the ship from top to bottom. \u201cThere is a massive issue about disclosure. If passengers had been told that the previous passengers were displaying symptoms consistent with coronavirus, would they have got on? \u201cThere are some very serious questions that have to be asked of the operators. They appear to have put profits before the safety of passengers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey also had the experience of the ship off the coast of Japan, so they would have been well aware of the risks.\u201d Shine will be keeping a close eye on the outcome of the criminal investigation, which is likely to yield information and facts to inform the class action. The case is expected to be lodged in the federal court in coming weeks. Jones, Carnival\u2019s spokesman, told Guardian Australia the company was \u201cnot going to respond to commentary by class action lawyers\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the United Nations has called the coronavirus pandemic the \u201cfight of a generation\u201d and a threat to world peace and security. The secretary general, Antonio Guterres, warned the UN security council that the pandemic had the potential to increase social unrest and violence, which would greatly undermine the world\u2019s ability to fight the disease. It was, he said, the UN\u2019s most grave test since it was founded 75 years ago and had already hindered efforts to resolve international, regional and national conflicts. \u201cThis is the fight of a generation and the raison d\u00eatre [reason for being] of the United Nations itself,\u201d he said. More than 95,000 people had died by Friday morning after contracting Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the figures. More than 1.6 million had been diagnosed as the economic impact continued to grow. One in 10 Americans had lost their job as a result of the virus and the IMF chief said the world was on track for the biggest downturn since the Great Depression. Guterres said the world was already seeing the \u201cruinous social and economic impacts. But the pandemic also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security.\u201d He warned the pandemic could lead to opportunistic terror attacks, the erosion of trust in public institutions, economic instability, political tensions from postponing elections or referendums, and Covid-19 \u201ctriggering or exacerbating various human rights challenges\u201d. He said security council involvement would be \u201ccritical to mitigate the peace and security implications\u201d and \u201ca signal of unity and resolve from the council would count for a lot at this anxious time\u201d. After its Thursday meeting with Guterres, which was held via closed video link, the security council issued its first statement since the outbreak began. It expressed \u201csupport for all efforts of the secretary general concerning the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected.\u201d Amid the call for unity, China weighed in on a growing row between the World Health Organisation and Taiwan. Late on Thursday China\u2019s Taiwan affairs office accused Taiwan\u2019s government of \u201cunscrupulously using the virus to seek independence, venomously attacking the WHO and its responsible people, conniving with the green internet army to wantonly spread racist comments \u2026 We strongly condemn this.\u201d It followed the trading of accusations between the WHO and Taiwan over recent days, largely stemming from Taiwan\u2019s continued exclusion from WHO membership and activities because of lobbying by China\u2019s Communist party government, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory. Taiwan has been successful in preventing a mass outbreak but has repeatedly complained of being left out of the coordinated global response, risking Taiwanese lives. The WHO has been accused of being too deferential to China and praising its virus response despite the government initially suppressing information about the outbreak. The WHO denies the charge and on Wednesday its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he had been subjected to months of attacks including racist ones against him and black communities, and accused Taiwan of condoning the \u201ccampaign\u201d. In response Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry demanded a clarification and apology for the \u201cgroundless\u201d accusation and an \u201cextremely irresponsible act of slander\u201d. The Trump administration has joined in criticism of the WHO, accusing it of putting politics first by ignoring early warnings sounded by Taiwan. The state department on Thursday said the WHO left it too late and \u201cchose politics over public health\u201d. This week Donald Trump threatened to withhold funding from the WHO, but was accused of seeking to make it a scapegoat in order to distract from his own failings in preparing the US for its own outbreak, which had infected more than 465,000 people and killed almost 15,000 by Friday morning. In other developments: EU countries agreed to a \u20ac500bn relief deal for members hit hardest by the pandemic. Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, was moved out of intensive care after being admitted three days earlier suffering from coronavirus. Around the world people have been told to stay home over the Easter holiday. Authorities in several countries have warned of roadblocks to enforce social distancing. China has stepped up monitoring and reporting requirements for asymptomatic \u201csilent\u201d carriers. President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday that new challenges to China\u2019s economic and social recovery were emerging. The New York governor said a record 799 people died from Covid-19 on Wednesday, bringing the state\u2019s total loss to 7,067 people. Cuomo warned the economic impact on the state was expected to be worse than 9/11. There were signs of hope, with New York recording its lowest number of new hospitalisations since the outbreak began. The South Korean city of Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, on Friday reported zero new cases for the first time since late February, as new infections across the country dropped to record lows. There have been calls for high-level inquiries into allegations of inhumane treatment in some aged care facilities. Around the world appalling stories have emerged from residential care homes for older people, including in Spain where the army has reported finding dead and abandoned people in their beds. The death toll in UK care homes is likely to be far higher than reported, the Guardian has learned, with hundreds of people dying from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted. Bangladesh imposed a \u201ccomplete lockdown\u201d in its Cox\u2019s Bazaar district, which is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar, and South Africa extended its lockdown by a further fortnight, enforced by police and the army. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Iran passed 4,000, the country\u2019s health ministry reported on Thursday, after 117 more people were confirmed to have died from the disease in the previous 24 hours.",

After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/20/film.usa\">jail sentence</a>). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know About Me</a> \u2013 a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship.

And now we have landed at British royalty. \u201cI played <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsFuZ4Lap4Q\">Does Your Mama Know</a> for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers\u2019 house. We went there for a wedding two years ago.\u201d Did he get high with Harry? \u201cHe was busy with the wedding,\u201d Chong says, discreetly. \u201cHe took a liking to Shelby because she had read all about him and knew his life story.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>England is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He may have a lot of time for Harry and Meghan, but not for the royal family as a whole. \u201cEngland itself is probably the most racist country in the world with its royalty and its caste system.\u201d Chong does not like to hold back. \u201cYou still have the system that colonised the world. Meghan wasn\u2019t white enough. She would never be white enough. I can see why they left. Megan could never be accepted into the royal family. She knew that and the whole family did. The whole English system is set up that way.\u201d</p> <p>From the royals he turns to Donald Trump. He doesn\u2019t know Trump personally, but he says he remembers coming across his type as a young man in British Columbia. \u201cI knew people like Trump all my life in Canada \u2013 we called them gangsters.

I was uninvited \u2019cos the girl\u2019s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.\u201d</p> <p>By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. \u201cMy first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I\u2019ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.\u201d</p> <p>How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. \u201cIt affects everybody\u2019s life. We can\u2019t do our family reunions. It\u2019s lonely. Even though you\u2019ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.\u201d But, he stresses, he\u2019s lucky \u2013 he\u2019s got Shelby\u2019s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies.<br><br>It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df09c878567d4aac311df06c4640a275404cac55/711_304_4993_2995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marin and Chong pose, in 2018, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Up in Smoke.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Eshel/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes \u2013 spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up).</p> <p>He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret \u2013 about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a \u201cgod-damned coloured guy\u201d and the husband turns away sickened.

Simple, he says. \u201cWe communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we\u2019d act crazy and make them laugh.\u201d</p> <p>Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. \u201cOh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.\u201d</p> <p>Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. \u201cIt was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.\u201d What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. \u201cA little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.\u201d</p> <p>Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. \u201cWe had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I\u2019d be left alone to write the movies. Then he\u2019d come back and I\u2019d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.\u201d Did he have a point? \u201c Well, I maintain that if he\u2019d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>The only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his memoir, Marin called Chong \u201cthe world\u2019s humblest megalomaniac\u201d. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. \u201cThe only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? \u201cWell, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.\u201d</p> <p>Chong calls Marin a genius \u2013 not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person \u2013 whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years.</p> <p>At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. \u201cWe clicked from the off. And I soon realised I\u2019ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy\u2019s lasted longer than anything.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. \u201cI always say we broke up \u2019cos we got rich. My joke is you can\u2019t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.\u201d Did wealth change them? \u201cYea. You make the wrong decision. You\u2019d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.\u201d Chong says if you\u2019re in the entertainment business and you\u2019re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6c90bbf10dd9839c67e6d30b096be0053177bfc/0_0_3000_1646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"549\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tommy and Shelby Chong and Cheech Marin perform at the Cheech &amp; Chong show in New Jersey in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bobby Bank/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my wife at home. She\u2019s too beautiful to leave alone.\u201d (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be funny, so I quit phoning him.\u201d And they fell out some more.</p> <p>In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c777c301989bd86d39ebffbfbd590194bc8c9c37/0_0_2000_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"615\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chong leaves the federal court in Pittsburgh in 2003 after pleading guilty to conspiring to sell drug paraphernalia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keith Srakocic/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually.

His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road.</p> <p>Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.\u201cI see today as the best time to be alive because we weren\u2019t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.\u201d</p> <p>In his 80s, he has never been more occupied \u2013 gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (<a href=\"https://tommychong.com/\">Chong\u2019s Choice</a>) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong\u2019s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences \u2013 Paris didn\u2019t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply.</p> <p>Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. \u201cWell I can\u2019t really tell you that now,\u201d he says coyly. So there might be one? \u201cI\u2019ve got to wait till it\u2019s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I\u2019ll turn it into a reality and then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p> <p>And with that he\u2019s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LDRLY.cheechandchong&amp;fbclid=IwAR2xj-ydYBefXm3qRn6tpBvJ0JYhS2qnk4lZ8I0GbJXiTdjvngUo8NVkAA8\">The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game</a> is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cheech-and-chong-bud-farm/id1498492128?fbclid=IwAR3fwQskLbdqsiRSmoMLw40rlhyXd0zv5Fb4lAAEddpoFq6Aj-Z36pH93F4\">available for download on 20 April</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It\u2019s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. \u201cMy wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them \u2013 oatmeal and maple syrup.\u201d He stops to correct himself. \u201cI put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.\u201d Chong is 82 next month. He sounds about four decades younger \u2013 his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.

In their frequent spats with the police, they invariably won \u2013 even if they didn\u2019t have a clue how or indeed even notice that they had. But there is more to Chong than Cheech, as he is quick to point out today. After they split up he enjoyed success as a solo comic and businessman (though that ended up in a jail sentence). Before Cheech and Chong, he was a guitarist with Bobby Taylor and the Vancouvers, co-writing their hit single Does Your Mama Know About Me \u2013 a gorgeous song about a mixed-race relationship. Although they only had the one hit, the band were influential \u2013 something Chong is again quick to point out. A young Jimi Hendrix played with them, and they were partly responsible for the Jackson Five (who opened for them in 1968) signing to Motown. Or rather Chong was. \u201cI was the lawyer who signed the contract for them,\u201d he says. Hold on, I say, you\u2019re not a lawyer. Chong laughs. \u201cWell, I was the whitest guy they knew. I looked like a Jewish guy, a lawyer. So literally Bobby Taylor took the contract and gave it to me and said what d\u2019you think?\u201d Chong gave it the OK and the rest is history. Chong segues from one celebrity anecdote to another, all of them connected by one degree of separation \u2013 himself. And now we have landed at British royalty. \u201cI played Does Your Mama Know for Prince Harry. We were in the Spencers\u2019 house.

He grew up in Calgary, a conservative Canadian city, the son of a Chinese father and a Canadian mother with Celtic roots. He still sounds shocked by the attitudes he experienced there as a child. \u201cYou know, they would sell brazil nuts in the grocery store and they\u2019d call them nigger toes. And they had little black liquorice beans called nigger babies. \u2018Can I have five cents worth of nigger babies?\u2019 Again he laughs \u2013 this time appalled. \u201cThat\u2019s where I grew up.\u201d As a young boy he remembers his whole class apart from him being invited to a birthday party. \u201cI just looked out of the window of the second storey and could see my friends gathering around the fire. I was uninvited \u2019cos the girl\u2019s father was worried she might end up with a coloured guy or Chinese guy.\u201d By then, he was already used to being isolated. When he was a baby, his mother contracted TB and he developed pleurisy. \u201cMy first memories are hospital and my mom was quarantined in a sanitarium. I never saw her for the first three or four years of my life. So I feel I\u2019ve been through this pandemic before with my mother.\u201d How is he coping? He says he is missing his five children and the grandchildren. \u201cIt affects everybody\u2019s life. We can\u2019t do our family reunions. It\u2019s lonely. Even though you\u2019ve got your kids a phone call away, you still want to hold them and hug them and be part of their life.\u201d But, he stresses, he\u2019s lucky \u2013 he\u2019s got Shelby\u2019s company, her gourmet cooking and the pot cookies. It was in the late 60s that he teamed up with Richard Marin, a Mexican-American whose nickname was Cheech. They played music and did comedy sketches in a Vancouver strip club. The funny stuff soon took over, and the strip club became a comedy club. Cheech and Chong prided themselves on taking things to extremes \u2013 spliffs the size of tubas (famously smoking labarador poo in their first film, Up in Smoke), idiocy off the IQ ratings and staggeringly incorrect sexual politics (in Cheech and Chong\u2019s Next Movie, Cheech only desists from having sex with a woman who seems to have died on him because she wakes up). He says his favourite Cheech and Chong sketch is Hey, Margaret \u2013 about a husband describing a porn film to his wife. First, an elderly woman has sex with the pizza delivery man, then she has sex with a dog, and the husband reports it all back to Margaret with relish. Finally, she has sex with a \u201cgod-damned coloured guy\u201d and the husband turns away sickened. It was bad-taste comedy with bigotry as the butt of the joke. Why does he think they were so popular? Simple, he says. \u201cWe communicated with people. They would get high to come and see us and then we\u2019d act crazy and make them laugh.\u201d Could they really be such dedicated stoners and still be so prolific, or was it an act? Chong sounds slightly offended by the question. \u201cOh no, for the most part we were always high. We always smoked a little before we went out there. That was part of the job.\u201d Drugs, he says, were essential to the creative process. \u201cIt was my job as a writer and performer to deliver the goods. So if that meant being stoned, I gladly did it. I found that the more stoned I was, the more crazy the movie was, and the more successful we were.\u201d What was his drug of choice when writing? Oh, he says, there were a few. \u201cA little bit of cocaine and the acid and then the weed.\u201d Cheech and Chong appeared to be having the time of their lives. But by the mid-80s they had fallen out. \u201cWe had some pretty heated arguments. Cheech would go on vacation and I\u2019d be left alone to write the movies. Then he\u2019d come back and I\u2019d direct them, and he got tired of it. He was thinking I got too much credit.\u201d Did he have a point? \u201c Well, I maintain that if he\u2019d listened to me it would have been better all the way around.\u201d In his memoir, Marin called Chong \u201cthe world\u2019s humblest megalomaniac\u201d. Talking to Chong today, I get a sense of what he means. Alongside the hippy-dippy mellowness, there is a man who clearly likes doing things his way. \u201cThe only way people listen to you is if you\u2019re the director. If you\u2019re not the director, people don\u2019t give a shit what you\u2019ve got to say.\u201d So it was a power struggle between him and Marin? \u201cWell, yeah, for sure. Because what Cheech wanted was the part where you got the power.\u201d Chong calls Marin a genius \u2013 not just for his comedic skills, but for his photographic memory and the sharpness of his brain. As for himself, he says his great gift has always been for teaming up with the right person \u2013 whether it be Marin or Shelby, his second wife, to whom he has been married for 45 years. At times, he sounds calculated when he talks about what Marin brought to the table. \u201cWe clicked from the off. And I soon realised I\u2019ve got a goldmine with this guy because LA is made up mostly of Mexicans. So I realised, oh man, we can own this place with comedy. And we do. I mean our comedy\u2019s lasted longer than anything.\u201d In the end, he says, it was money that did for them. \u201cI always say we broke up \u2019cos we got rich. My joke is you can\u2019t make a rich Mexican do shit! Hehehe! That still makes me laugh.\u201d Did wealth change them? \u201cYea. You make the wrong decision. You\u2019d rather do your summer house than go on the road again.\u201d Chong says if you\u2019re in the entertainment business and you\u2019re not 100% dedicated to entertaining, you might as well give up. And they did. After the split, Chong developed his solo standup. But he hated being away from Shelby. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave my wife at home. She\u2019s too beautiful to leave alone.\u201d (He tells me three times how beautiful she is and how much he loves her.) So Shelby learned how to do standup and went on the road with him. Occasionally, in his live act he would phone Cheech, but Cheech refused to play along. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be funny, so I quit phoning him.\u201d And they fell out some more. In 2003, at the age of 65, Chong was jailed for nine months for selling glass pipes on the internet that could be used for smoking cannabis (though they were produced as collectible works of art): each bong had his name and a picture of his face on it. It was a family business, and Chong agreed to plead guilty in exchange for the non-prosecution of Shelby and his son Paris. He says jail changed him, physically and spiritually. He spent his time reading the I Ching and became more at peace with himself. His hair and beard turned white, and he emerged from incarceration looking rather professorial. Since then he has seen off two cancers, and returned to the road. Despite the rise of rightwing populists, impending environmental catastrophe and the Covid-19 pandemic, he says life has never been better.\u201cI see today as the best time to be alive because we weren\u2019t content with what we had. We were always looking for that better club, the better audience to play in front of.\u201d In his 80s, he has never been more occupied \u2013 gigging with Shelby, launching his own brand of marijuana (Chong\u2019s Choice) in 2016 when the drug was legalised for recreational use in California, and spending time with his kids. He even made up with Cheech, thanks to Paris. A decade ago his son found an email from Marin on Chong\u2019s computer asking if he wanted to try to put aside differences \u2013 Paris didn\u2019t bother to tell his dad, wrote yes and hit reply. Since then Cheech and Chong have been gigging again, with Shelby as their opening act. On the day we speak, he is supposed to be promoting a Cheech and Chong video game, but he is too excited about new opportunities to mention it. Doe he think the duo might make another film? Silence. But I can sense his boyish excitement at the other end of the line. \u201cWell I can\u2019t really tell you that now,\u201d he says coyly. So there might be one? \u201cI\u2019ve got to wait till it\u2019s a reality as opposed to telling you dreams. I\u2019ll turn it into a reality and then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d And with that he\u2019s off to satisfy those munchies and realise his dreams. \u2022 The Cheech &amp; Chong Bud Farm video game is available for download on 20 April",

      "body": "<p>On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being \u201cmore influential right now than any politician\u201d. Ferguson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/neil-ferguson-coronavirus-expert-who-is-working-on-despite-symptoms\">leads a team of modellers</a> at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population.</p> \n<p>The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful \u2013 but experience and sound judgment are crucial.</p> \n<p>This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn\u2019t. And in Canada, <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-ontario-quebec-covid-19-1.5524056\">the success of British Columbia</a> in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment.</p> \n<p>There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown.</p> \n<p>Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 \u201cdoes not discriminate\u201d, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-inequality-managers-zoom-cleaners-offices\">disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised</a> segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn\u2019t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations.</p> \n<p>It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/uk-coronavirus-policy-scientific-dominic-cummings\">the science</a>\u201d and evidence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ba9786c6-c779-4063-8bf9-1d3009eb7c70\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qV7R2iYVXg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>While Marr\u2019s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK\u2019s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK.</p> \n<p>It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while \u2013 a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy.</p> \n<p>There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility.</p> \n<p>Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will.</p> \n<p>Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission \u2013 and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage.</p> \n<p>Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment.</p> \n<p>\u2022 David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the Andrew Marr Show last Sunday, speaking about Covid-19, Prof Neil Ferguson was described as being \u201cmore influential right now than any politician\u201d. Ferguson leads a team of modellers at Imperial College London whose mission has been to predict the pattern and health impact of coronavirus transmission in the UK under different scenarios, and thereby help government make the right decisions about how best to protect the population. The UK has some of the best infectious disease modellers in the world, and the government has been wise to draw upon their expertise. But all models have their limitations, and none can avoid the fact that decision-making must also be informed by people with relevant expertise and experience, and by the facts on the ground. In the case of Covid-19, where so much about the disease and its transmission dynamics is still unknown or unclear, models are useful \u2013 but experience and sound judgment are crucial. This is becoming apparent across the world. Countries that lived through the experience of Sars and Mers appear to have been better prepared to deal with Covid-19 than those that didn\u2019t. And in Canada, the success of British Columbia in controlling Covid-19 compared with other provinces has been partly attributable to the combined ingredients of political experience and good judgment. There is also a non-scientific element to decision-making which involves choosing between competing demands and needs in society, determining what is ethical and moral, and balancing challenges that are current and immediate with those that will only emerge in the future. For example, a model that incorporates value judgments is needed to balance the direct, visible and dramatic harms of Covid-19 with the more indirect, chronic and hidden social and economic harms of lockdown. Furthermore, while it is often said that Covid-19 \u201cdoes not discriminate\u201d, this statement is only partially true. The virus disproportionately affects older people and men; and we can be sure that the effects of both the virus and the collateral damage of control measures will disproportionately affect the poorer and more marginalised segments of society. How we manage this differentiated vulnerability is all about ethics and politics. It may be informed by a scientific model, but it shouldn\u2019t be disguised as a technocratic problem that can be resolved by mathematical equations. It is easy to be entranced by the cleverness of models that map, measure and predict the complex interactions of multiple natural and social variables. There is something impressive about the ability to produce answers in the form of precisely calculated numbers, and professionally crafted charts and graphs. And for politicians, nothing is more convenient than being able to say that they are merely following \u201cthe science\u201d and evidence. While Marr\u2019s comment about Ferguson being the most influential person in the country was rhetorical, it hints at the perception that epidemiological modelling has played a disproportionately influential role in shaping the UK\u2019s strategy and plans. Others have pointed out that some of the earlier modelling work had gaps that have adversely affected policy decisions. These include not accounting for the potential role of testing and contact tracing in mitigating the epidemic; not modelling the impact of sick patients on intensive care beds and other parts of the health system; and not modelling the epidemic across different regions of the UK. It is not clear what caused these omissions. Perhaps they were the result of blindspots that persisted due to the lack of external scrutiny and challenge. In the case of the sidelining of testing and contact tracing, perhaps it was because the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had concluded that these measures were not worth while \u2013 a view that is understandable if Sage also saw the building up of herd immunity through natural infection as part of its strategy. There has been lots of speculation as to why the UK delayed lockdown compared with other countries; why it was slow to increase viral testing capacity; and why the NHS was left so poorly prepared. Now is not the time to look backwards. Neither would I want to place any criticism on modellers. Rigorous modelling is done by clever modellers; but the design and testing of models, including the assumptions built into models and the questions that modellers have been asked to help answer, is a collective responsibility. Modelling is vital and could assist greatly in going forward. In particular, two things should be urgently modelled. The first is to model the impact of different strategies that will help us avoid the harms of draconian, population-wide lockdown. This should include modelling the costs and benefits of weekly viral testing of the whole population (not 100,000 tests a day, but 10 million tests a day), or a more modest but greatly expanded testing regime, combined with aggressive case detection and contact tracing, coupled with continued physical distancing and improved hygiene. The former idea may sound radical and extreme, but is a serious proposal that could be implemented if there was sufficient political will. Second, we must model (and then keep monitoring) the health and socioeconomic impacts of both the virus and the control measures, with short-, medium- and long-term timeframes, and with a social lens to look at how the virus has impacted differentially across society. For some reason, there was no modelling of the socioeconomic impact of lockdown. This was an omission \u2013 and as we enter the beginning of what could be a global economic recession, we could see thousands of lives cut short from this collateral damage. Finally, from a policymaking perspective, there are two things needed. First, we need greater transparency and participation to allow effective scrutiny and challenge from scientists and public health specialists who are more independent of government. This will avoid the danger of groupthink and blindspots. Second, we must better acknowledge the limitations of evidence-based policy and recognise the importance of expertise, experience and sound judgment. \u2022 David McCoy is a professor of Global Public Health and director of the Centre for Public Health at Queen Mary University of London.",

It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/06/coronavirus-french-protective-mask-manufacturer-scraps-nhs-order-to-keep-masks-in-france\" title=\"\">ordered</a> millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\" title=\"\">accused the US</a> of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously <a href=\"https://www.rheinische-anzeigenblaetter.de/region/bonn/beim-us-konzern-3m-zoll-kontrollierte-schutzmasken-und-schutzkleidung-36443358\" title=\"\">sent inspectors</a> to the factory of an American company in J\u00fcchen to ensure their medical masks weren\u2019t being exported against government orders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. \u201cGovernments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,\u201d said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn\u2019t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it \u2013 quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.</p> <p>Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline \u2013 a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. \u201cAs it\u2019s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,\u201d said Wenham. \u201cNo one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own.

      "bodyText": "If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this. Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO\u2019s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need. That is not the world we live in. \u201cThe W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO. Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s emergency committee. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d. There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say. The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d * * * The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d. One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it. If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption. Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business. * * * Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day. Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann. In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann. Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d \u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new. But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do. * * * If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down. First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010. To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?) Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response. When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d. Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia. The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d. * * * Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China. Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.) Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out. John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.) Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late. Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953. While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades. Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d * * * While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice. Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.) Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney. The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d. But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open. Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand; while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in J\u00fcchen to ensure their medical masks weren\u2019t being exported against government orders. The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. \u201cGovernments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,\u201d said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn\u2019t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it \u2013 quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it. Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline \u2013 a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. \u201cAs it\u2019s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,\u201d said Wenham. \u201cNo one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren\u2019t thinking globally.\u201d \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

      "body": "<p>For politicians in the US and western Europe seeking to distract from their own disastrous mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idea of \u201cChina\u201d has become a convenient scapegoat. The beauty of blaming \u201cChina\u201d lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/house-resolution-china-coronavirus-origin-trump-racism_n_5e7a2a80c5b6f5b7c54baf93?ri18n=true&amp;ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000098&amp;guccounter=1\">liberals</a> and conservatives in the US, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242202291718979587\">Donald Trump</a>, have used this defence.</p> <p>Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the \u201cChinese people\u201d and their <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/19/coronavirus-china-cornyn-blame/\">exotic culture and habits</a>? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/nigel-farage-china-coronavirus-west-rethink-1493085\">claiming</a> both that he held \u201cno ill-will against the Chinese people\u201d but that the problem lay with \u201cappalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets\u201d and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of \u201cChina\u201d have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the<a href=\"https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/490373-attacks-on-asian-americans-at-about-100-per-day-due-to\"> US</a>,<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/meghara/coronavirus-racism-europe-covid-19\"> western Europe</a> and<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8178421/Man-armed-WHIP-goes-racist-tirade-outside-Chinese-Consulate.html\"> Oceania</a>.</p> <p>I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-23/coronavirus-devastation-immigrants\">xenophobic</a>, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for \u201cChinese people\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes.

      "bodyText": "For politicians in the US and western Europe seeking to distract from their own disastrous mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, the idea of \u201cChina\u201d has become a convenient scapegoat. The beauty of blaming \u201cChina\u201d lies in its ambiguity. Are critics merely condemning the way the Communist party concealed information during those crucial January weeks? Both liberals and conservatives in the US, including Donald Trump, have used this defence. Or, is the clear subtext that the real culprits are the \u201cChinese people\u201d and their exotic culture and habits? Leave it to Nigel Farage to clumsily play both sides, claiming both that he held \u201cno ill-will against the Chinese people\u201d but that the problem lay with \u201cappalling hygiene conditions in Chinese wildlife markets\u201d and the customary diet of bats and pangolins. Whatever the intentions, we now see how criticisms of \u201cChina\u201d have translated into an upsurge of racist violence aimed at the Chinese and Asian diaspora living in the US, western Europe and Oceania. I applaud the liberal condemnation of these attacks as xenophobic, but also worry that vague cries of tolerance for \u201cChinese people\u201d and \u201cculture\u201d play into the racist framing of the right, in which we wind up debating identity and difference at the expense of dynamic historical processes. Any serious attempt to grapple with China\u2019s role in this pandemic must also consider the specific political-economic conditions of China\u2019s ascent within the global market in recent years, which facilitated the virus\u2019s spread as well as planting the seeds for an Euro-American backlash.

      "body": "<p>Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March \u2013 exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt felt like a 1960s-style birth,\u201d she jokes.</p> <p>She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.</p> <p>For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d</p> <p>After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says.</p> <p>As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2765a9f42c32ea2fce86cee0a835aac70f785180/0_19_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Edmondson after the birth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Edmondson after the birth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Naomi Edmondson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March.

Her ward was noisy, and she couldn\u2019t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. \u201cI started shouting at the midwives and crying,\u201d San says. \u201cI said that I wasn\u2019t meant to be there, this hadn\u2019t been the plan, I shouldn\u2019t be left alone with the baby and I wasn\u2019t coping.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83df0cf3ce87d3793000cf3f3bb0662124a60507/0_0_1296_778/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martha San with husband, Jamie, and baby River.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Provided by Martha San</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. \u201cIt just felt really wrong,\u201d San says. \u201cAfter the birth, I needed someone there and I didn\u2019t have anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas\u2019s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. \u201cWhen they told me I couldn\u2019t have my water birth, I joked that I\u2019d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t actually expect that to happen.\u201d</p> <p>When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. \u201cI thought I could be like that for days.\u201d A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. \u201cI thought: it can\u2019t be the baby \u2013 it\u2019s too early,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t even called the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn\u2019t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. \u201cI know that home births can be dangerous,\u201d Collier-Thomas says. \u201cBut maybe, subconsciously, I thought: \u2018I really don\u2019t want to have my baby on the labour ward.\u2019\u201d Collier-Thomas is not alone: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/05/expectant-mothers-turn-to-freebirthing-after-home-births-cancelled\">as a result of the coronavirus lockdown</a>, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital; others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.</p> <p>All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under \u2013 and are not bitter that their births didn\u2019t go as planned. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be upset,\u201d says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan \u201cbecause there\u2019s so much going on. I totally get it.\u201d Even though San\u2019s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. \u201cThey were doing an incredible job,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they can\u2019t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.\u201d</p> <p>The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn\u2019t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won\u2019t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. \u201cThe staff were brilliant,\u201d she says. \u201cCalm and supportive.\u201d But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. \u201cWe\u2019re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful and overwhelming.\u201d</p> <p>For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. \u201cIt\u2019s really tainted everything,\u201d says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as \u201cbrilliant\u201d. But she feels upset Clara won\u2019t meet her grandparents for months. \u201cThey\u2019re only tiny for such a short period of time,\u201d Goodman says. \u201cThey change so quickly.\u201d Helena is also finding things strange. \u201cI should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I\u2019m sitting at home, feeling scared.\u201d</p> <p>Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. \u201cI\u2019d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,\u201d says Edmondson. \u201cBut actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.\u201d</p> <p>Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. \u201cIn the hospital, it\u2019s not as bad as everyone says,\u201d she adds. \u201cFor me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you\u2019re in this lovely bubble. You\u2019re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Helen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March \u2013 exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. \u201cIt felt like a 1960s-style birth,\u201d she jokes. She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. \u201cWe were hoping for the best,\u201d Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry \u2013 she hadn\u2019t brought enough food with her \u2013 so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again. For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. \u201cThe hardest bit of labour isn\u2019t the pushing,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cIt\u2019s the contractions. And doing that alone \u2026 you don\u2019t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can\u2019t have that person there with you.\u201d After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn\u2019t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn\u2019t known she had. \u201cIt gave me a newfound respect for women through history,\u201d she says. As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. \u201cIt\u2019s an anxious time for pregnant women,\u201d says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. \u201cThey are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.\u201d At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. \u201cVisiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,\u201d says NHS England, \u201cbut our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.\u201d The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: \u201cAt the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.\u201d Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth. But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary\u2019s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section. What may be noticeable to mothers giving birth, however, is that hospitals seem emptier. A recent survey by the RCM found that 20% of midwife roles are currently unfilled because of self-isolation, coronavirus or existing staff shortages.

It opened on Broadway in March 2018 and was nominated for a Tony award for best musical. \u201cFrozen tells the story of two extraordinary women,\u201d said Grandage. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to have found Samantha and Stephanie who will bring their incredible talent to the roles of Elsa and Anna, allowing us to create a production of Frozen especially for London.\u201d As Elsa, Barks will sing the musical\u2019s showstopper, Let It Go. Her previous musical credits include Les Mis\u00e9rables in the West End (as \u00c9ponine), a UK tour of Oliver! (as Nancy) and Pretty Woman on Broadway (in the Julia Roberts role). McKeon, as Anna, will sing a solo, True Love, as well as the duet Love Is an Open Door from the film. McKeon starred as Aisling in the long-running Irish TV soap Fair City and made her West End debut as Natalie in the original cast of The Commitments, directed by Jamie Lloyd. She also appeared in Beautiful: The Carole King Musical at the Aldwych theatre. The Theatre Royal Drury Lane, which is undergoing a \u00a360m restoration, is owned and managed by Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s group LW Theatres.",

      "body": "<p>Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Friday 10 April.</p> <h2>NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order</h2> <p>Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/nsw-minister-don-harwin-fined-1000-for-breaching-coronavirus-public-health-order\">breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order</a>. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The minister resigned on Friday night, after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had earlier said she wanted to establish the facts.</p> <h2>Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return</h2> <p>A day after the NRL <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/09/nrl-2020-season-restart-decision\">revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May,</a> the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. First, Brad Hazzard, NSW\u2019s health minister, said he had not been consulted on league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time.</p> <p>But while Hazzard said he was willing to discuss the matter with the NRL, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/10/nrl-restart-date-paul-kelly-brad-hazzard\">expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon</a>.</p> <h2>Australians warned not to travel over Easter</h2> <p>State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/09/australians-warned-to-avoid-all-non-essential-travel-over-easter-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">over the Easter holidays</a>, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those flouting social distancing laws. On Friday, Tasmanian police confirmed they had already ordered a number of people to turn their cars around after they were intercepted travelling from their home to a holiday house. Police have the powers to issue fines to people who breach social distancing rules.</p> <h2>Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW</h2> <p>Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/10/queensland-orders-anyone-returning-from-covid-19-hot-spots-in-nsw-to-quarantine-for-14-days\">state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW</a>. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling for a specific part of the country.</p> <h2>Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned</h2> <p>The Australian Medical Association dismissed as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/chef-pete-evans-criticised-for-trying-to-sell-15000-light-device-to-fight-coronavirus\">a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d</a> a device that Pete Evans has suggested could be used to treat coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, and welcome to our daily roundup of the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. These are the main stories on Friday 10 April. NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The minister resigned on Friday night, after the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had earlier said she wanted to establish the facts. Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return A day after the NRL revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May, the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. First, Brad Hazzard, NSW\u2019s health minister, said he had not been consulted on league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time. But while Hazzard said he was willing to discuss the matter with the NRL, the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon. Australians warned not to travel over Easter State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel over the Easter holidays, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those flouting social distancing laws. On Friday, Tasmanian police confirmed they had already ordered a number of people to turn their cars around after they were intercepted travelling from their home to a holiday house. Police have the powers to issue fines to people who breach social distancing rules. Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling for a specific part of the country. Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned The Australian Medical Association dismissed as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d a device that Pete Evans has suggested could be used to treat coronavirus. Evans, a celebrity chef and television host, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform on his website. He said on a livestream that the machine had \u201ca thousand different recipes and a couple on there for coronavirus. The AMA and Royal Australian College of General Practitioners condemned Evans on Friday. Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants GPs practices are under pressure to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19. Doctors said they felt pressured to accept the lease reduction request or face an early termination of their lease.

Last week, MSI warned that up 9.5 million women and girls would not access family planning services this year because of the pandemic, which could result in as many as 3m unintended pregnancies and 2.7m unsafe abortions. \u201cIt\u2019s clear the majority of abortions are done in the first trimester, which makes them extremely safe. As countries go into lockdown or mobility is reduced, women will have to wait longer and the procedure becomes more complex,\u201d said Cooke. \u201cIn the UK that\u2019s one thing, where we have the infrastructure to deal with late terminations, but in many countries we operate in that\u2019s not an option. Therefore it becomes critical and there\u2019s a risk of unsafe abortion and complications.\u201d He said abortion was \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d to save lives. Unsafe abortionsaccount for between 4% and 13% of maternal deaths. Dr Jeanne Conry, president elect of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, said \u201cAbortion access is critical. Women need access or we will see more unintended pregnancies, more maternal mortality and more unsafe abortion,\u201d said Conry. \u201cAbortion is not an elective procedure, it\u2019s an essential part of women\u2019s healthcare. It\u2019s absolutely time dependent.\u201d She said telemedicine, where women can speak to doctors over the internet, was \u201ccritical right now\u201d . On Thursday, the International Planned Parenthood Federation said 23 of its member associations have had to reduce their abortion services because of Covid-19, with 5,600 clinics across 64 countries already closed. There were also reports of shortages of contraceptives and HIV medicines. \u201cThese figures show that millions of women and girls across the world now face an even greater challenge in trying to take care of their own health and bodies,\u201d said the IPPF\u2019s director general, Dr Alvaro Bermejo.",

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can\u2019t think of many instances from my own life where it isn\u2019t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost \u2013 they all led to better things.</p> <p>The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. \u201cMadame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,\u201d he replied.</p> <p>And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history.</p> <p>And so to the present.

Like all the best epigrams, it is deeply wise, even if it overgeneralises. I can\u2019t think of many instances from my own life where it isn\u2019t true. A breakdown, a miscarriage, a job lost \u2013 they all led to better things. The phrase reminds me of something Winston Churchill supposedly said on losing the 1945 election. His wife apparently told him that defeat may well have been a blessing in disguise. \u201cMadame, if this is a blessing, it is indeed well disguised,\u201d he replied. And yet a blessing it was. Britain got Attlee, the welfare state, the NHS. Churchill got a rest, and then his swansong six years later. The rest is history. And so to the present.

It is the second one that has come out of there in a space of about a week. </p> \n   <p>We have circumstances in Uruguay that we are working through, in South African and the Philippines. These are incredibly complex arrangements given the travel restrictions that other countries have imposed and the collapse in international aviation.

      "bodyText": "We will close the blog for this evening. Thank you for your company and contributions. A summary follows of Australia\u2019s Covid-19 situation on the evening of Good Friday 2020. This long weekend, stay home, stay well, save lives. Australia\u2019s new infection rate continues to slow The commonwealth deputy chief health officer, Paul Kelly, says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d, the result of the border closures of a little over a fortnight ago and the social distancing measures enacted. I would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. A total of 6,203 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Australia, and there have been 54 deaths. New South Wales remains the state hardest hit, and Sydney in particular. NSW minister resigns after fine for breaching public health order Don Harwin, the NSW arts minister, was fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s coronavirus public health order. It emerged on Thursday that Harwin had been living at his million-dollar Central Coast holiday home, which is more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, accepted his resignation. Doubt cast over NRL\u2019s return A day after the NRL revealed it intended to restart the competition on 28 May, the league\u2019s plans showed signs of unravelling. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said he had not been consulted on the league\u2019s plan to resume play in seven weeks\u2019 time, while the commonwealth deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warned the league would need permission from authorities and expressed his concern over the risks of returning to action too soon. Australians warned not to travel over Easter State governments are taking a hard line against people looking to travel over the Easter holidays, with police patrolling routes to popular getaways, and employing helicopters and number plate technology to catch those breaching social distancing laws by travelling. Queensland highlights \u2018Covid-19 hot spots\u2019 in NSW Authorities in Queensland have stepped up border measures to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the sunshine state. The state\u2019s chief medical officer posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW. Anyone who returns to the state from those locations will be forced to quarantine for 14 days. It marks the first time Australians have been required to quarantine for travelling from a specific part of the country. Chef Pete Evans\u2019 recipe to treat Covid condemned Peak medical groups have criticised the Australian celebrity chef Pete Evans for suggesting that a $15,000 \u201csubtle energy platform\u201d could be used to treat coronavirus, saying such claims are baseless, ill-informed and dangerous. Evans, a television host and paleo diet enthusiast who has previously promoted anti-vaccination ideas, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u2013 dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d \u2013 for $14,990 on his website. Evans\u2019 ad said the machine was a \u201csubtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d. Covid-19 has so far infected more than 1.6 million people globally and killed 95,000. It has ground economies to a halt all over the world and has the potential to force hundreds of millions into poverty. There is no evidence that it can be treated or cured by coloured lights. Hard-pressed GPs face rent reduction requests from pathology giants GP practices are under pressure to accept a 50% reduction in rental payments from major pathology corporations. It follows news that doctor-owned general practices are on the brink of financial collapse due to revenue losses from Covid-19. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has accepted the resignation of her arts minister, Don Harwin, after he was fined $1,000 for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. While Harwin maintained he had sought, and followed, official advice on whether he was allowed to relocate to his holiday home, he accepted the controversy surrounding his move \u2013 as the government was urging people to stay home over Easter \u2013 was a \u201cdistraction\u201d. Berejiklian accepted Harwin\u2019s resignation, issuing a statement: During this health crisis my government has asked the community to make greater sacrifices than all of us have ever had to make before. These sacrifices are saving lives, and I am proud of the people of NSW for continuing to uphold the law in the interest of public health. Late last night I was advised minister Don Harwin had been fined $1,000 for breaching a public health order. The police, who have been tasked by my government with enforcing these health orders, came to the conclusion that minister Harwin breached the order. Whilst minister Harwin has served the people of NSW well, and he continues to assure me that he did not break the rules, the orders in place apply equally to everybody. Accordingly, minister Harwin has appropriately resigned from cabinet. Internationally now ... aerial footage shows a mass grave being dug on New York\u2019s Hart Island to deal with the surge in deaths caused by the coronavirus. A warning: this video contains sensitive material. As New York deals with a mounting coronavirus death toll and dwindling morgue space, the city has shortened the length of time it will hold unclaimed remains before they are buried in its public cemetery on Hart Island. Aerial video captured workers digging graves on the island, a one-mile, limited-access strip near the Bronx. Normally, about 25 bodies a week are interred on the island, mostly for people whose families can\u2019t afford a funeral, or who go unclaimed by relatives. Operations have now increased from one day a week to five days a week, with around 24 burials each day. NSW arts minister Don Harwin has resigned from the government after he was fined $1,000 by police for staying at his Central Coast holiday home, breaching a Covid-19 public health order. As governments around Australia were urging their citizens to stay home over Easter, Harwin was spotted earlier in the week at his Pearl Beach house, more than an hour\u2019s drive from his east Sydney primary residence. Harwin maintained he sought formal advice that his living arrangements complied with the direction for people to stay at home, and that he acted in accordance with those orders. But he says the controversy over his getaway was a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the government at a critical time. He has offered his resignation to the premier. His statement in full: Today I have offered my resignation to the premier as a minister in her government. There is nothing more important than the work of the government in fighting the coronavirus crisis. I will not allow my circumstances to be a distraction from that work and I very much regret that my residential arrangements have become an issue during this time. At all times I have sought to act in accordance with public health orders and I sought advice that my living arrangements complied with those orders. I remain confident that I have acted in accordance with those orders. I know however that perception is just as important during these times. The premier and her team are doing an outstanding job during the biggest crisis our state and nation have faced during our lifetimes. It is absolutely vital they should be able to focus entirely on the health and economic issues facing our community. It\u2019s had a very good run today, but worthy of repeating. Game of Bones: And while the focus has been on Sydney, the NSW government is seeking to roll out rapid testing for Covid-19 in regional areas to reduce waiting times. So far, 70% of tests in NSW have been in Sydney, which has identified clusters in the capital. But if you don\u2019t test, you don\u2019t find \u2026 Again, our beloved friends at AAP: Regional NSW towns will soon have access to rapid coronavirus testing, meaning samples won\u2019t have to be sent to Sydney for analysis. Broken Hill health workers will over Easter repurpose a machine used to rapidly test flu samples so it can detect the novel coronavirus. It should be operational by Monday and more regional areas will follow as specific hardware is imported. \u201cThat is really important, particularly for the more distant sites,\u201d the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said on Friday. \u201cHaving that point-of-care testing, or testing that comes back in about an hour, is very useful because it gives us more rapid identification of cases.\u201d St Vincent\u2019s hospital is already using its repurposed GeneXpert machine in its emergency department and will also begin trialling another molecular test in the coming days. Of the 137,000 people tested for coronavirus in NSW since January, 70% have been in Sydney or on the Central Coast. Just 322 people in far western NSW have been tested while northern NSW and the Murrumbidgee are the two regions were there have been fewer than one test per 1,000 residents. Those three regions account for 100 positive cases. Chant defended the current turnaround time for testing \u2013 which can see results for Sydney-based cases returned within 24 hours. \u201cThe issue for rural and remote areas is the time it takes for specimens to come down to Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cAs we get more [novel coronavirus] cartridges for our GeneXperts, we will be looking at deploying this test across various sites. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a mind to supporting rural and regional communities so we can give them access to the testing that is much more prompt in the metropolitan area.\u201d NSW is the state with the most Covid-19 infections in the country. (It should be noted that, by international standards, Australia and NZ have very low numbers of cases, low rates of community transmission, and low death rates. See here from Eleanor Ainge Roy in Dunedin and some other reporter: But there is an interesting breakdown of cases in NSW, provided by NSW Health. In the 24 hours to 8pm Thursday, an additional 49 cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in NSW. The total number of cases is 2,822 Deaths: 22 Cases tested and excluded: 134,619 Total people tested: 137,441 A total of 543 of NSW\u2019s cases - nearly one-fifth - have originated from a cruise ship (in particular the Ruby Princess, which was controversially allowed to dock at Circular Quay in March). Of NSW\u2019s 2,822 cases; Overseas acquired: 1,677 Locally acquired (contact of confirmed case and/or known cluster): 682 Locally acquired (contact not identified): 427 Under investigation: 36 The largest number of infections, by age group, is among people aged 20 to 29, with 611 confirmed cases. This is interesting, from AAP: A group of 18 Queensland drivers has been hit with fines for disobeying coronavirus regulations after police stopped a noisy burnout gathering. Officers were called to an industrial area in Loganholme, south of Brisbane, where they cordoned off a street about 11pm on Thursday. More than 10 vehicles were intercepted and 18 infringement notices of $1,334 issued for failing to comply with a Covid-19 direction, police said on Friday. It seems the burn-outs were fine \u2013 if needless, noisy and self-defeating (they\u2019re your tyres after all) \u2013 you just can\u2019t do burn-outs in a group. I\u2019m reminded of that age-old philosophical question: if you do a massive burn-out, but none of your mates are around to watch, have you really burnt out at all? In case you missed this earlier, it\u2019s very good. Do try this at home. Stay home. Save Lives. Take the Bins Out*. *only on bin night The Western Australia minister for health and deputy premier Roger Cook has reported seven new cases of Covid-19 in the state, as well as four new cases linked to the cruise ship Artania. The 11 new cases are in people aged between 25 and 78, and bring the state\u2019s total to 506. The total number of cases linked to cruise ships is 191, more than one-third of the total. Six people have died in WA. Also in Western Australia, several hundred passengers who had been on board the Vasco da Gama cruise ship are due to end their quarantine today. The West Australian passengers have been held on Rottnest Island, they will be ferried back to Perth this afternoon. But hundreds of others from the east coast and other parts of Australia are coming out of quarantine, today and in coming days, without a way home because of mass cancellation of flights across the country. Cook said the state government would continue to accommodate those passengers, while finding a way to get them home. The state government is aware that there are limited flights available for people returning home following their 14-day isolation in Western Australia. The department of health is liaising with other agencies and airlines to determine viable solutions to get these people home as soon as practicable. While flights are being arranged to transport people home, they will continue to be accommodated by the state. We want to reassure people who have been in isolation that we will be working to make the transition home as smooth as possible so they can return to their homes and families as quickly as they can. We understand those in isolation and quarantine have enjoyed difficulty and stress and appreciate the sacrifice they and their family and friends are making to keep our communities safe. The state\u2019s deputy chief health officer Robin Lawrence said those who had completed their quarantine, but who were still waiting to fly home, would be allowed out of their hotels. For the passengers from the Vasco da Gama, that would be in a few hours. As of 4:30pm they will have some increased freedom to move around the local area and the city as long as they maintain social distancing, as required. We are very grateful for their patience and consideration during the 14 days they have been undertaking quarantine. For all other future passengers, we will be in contact to work out where they have come from and how they can get home and we thank them for their patience in keeping the state of Western Australia, themselves and their families safe this time. Queensland\u2019s chief medical officer has posted a list of \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d in NSW and ordered anyone returning to the state from those locations to quarantine for 14 days. It has been one week since Queensland closed its border to New South Wales for the first time since the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919. Police have been enforcing the \u201chard closure\u201d at three checkpoints between the towns of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads on either side of the border. The gates have also been shut on the state\u2019s two other shared borders between the Northern Territory and South Australia. Queensland residents are exempt from the ban, but from Saturday those returning home from a list of designated inter-state \u201cCovid-19 hot spots\u201d will be forced to undergo two weeks quarantine. Good afternoon, Ben Doherty here, my thanks to my colleagues for their work today. And thank you for your company this afternoon. Please feel free to get in touch via twitter @BenDohertyCorro or email ben.doherty@theguardian.com . Social distancing, how important is it? This, from the Ohio department of health in the US, is excellent. They\u2019ve wrapped up the press conference in Adelaide. And I\u2019m going to wrap up here, too. I\u2019ll leave you with my excellent colleague Ben Doherty who will take over from here. Cusack says at this stage there is no case to close the state\u2019s beaches. Marshall is asked about photographs local media published apparently showing groups of people. Marshall says: \u201cI have spent time down at the beach myself today and I can tell you that there were a lot of people enjoying their time but the most important thing is we are trying to guard against large numbers of people congregating in close vicinity, but not people walking the dog, going for a jog. \u201cWe do not want to see reporters, with all due respect, or members of the public try to separate people. They could be people of the same family, people living together.\u201d Cusack says there are 15 people in South Australian hospital. Six are in ICU and four are in a critical condition. Michael Cusack, the SA Health executive director of medical service, says that the state has recorded seven new cases overnight. There are 428 in the state. The cases range in age from 23 to a person in their 80s. He says: \u201cAt this point in time there is no link we have found between any of the cases in schools or any residential aged care facility, and importantly there are no additional cases where we think that there has been local transmission. In terms of good news, the number of people that are known to have recovered has increased ...\u201d The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, is addressing the media as we speak. Marshall says the former Wakefield hospital is now ready to take patients. It has been transformed into a Covid-19 facility. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will address the children of Australia in a special broadcast on the ABC, the network has announced. The ABC says in a statement that Morrison will answer questions from children on the Monday bulletin of its flagship children\u2019s news program, Behind The News. An ABC statement said the broadcast would include questions such as: \u201cMy question is, what\u2019s your advice to the population who have lost their jobs as their workplaces have shut down?\u201d \u201cHow long do you think it will take to find a cure for the coronavirus?\u201d The program will air 6.25pm on Monday. Advocates for the unemployed have called on the government to extend the $550 per fortnight coronavirus supplements to disability support pensioners and carers. The Guardian reported last month that people on these payments would now receive a lower base rate of income support than a jobseeker or a person receiving parenting payment who did not have a disability. \u201c[The Australian Unemployed Workers Union] has been flooded with calls and messages from our members who have been unfairly excluded from the $550 supplement, and thousands of people have signed our petition to #RaiseTheDSP,\u201d a statement read. \u201cThe minister has been granted extraordinary new powers that mean she can do this without going back to parliament. No legislation is required.\u201d A Greens motion to include these welfare recipients in the coronavirus supplement failed to win the support of the government or Labor this week. However, the minister, Anne Ruston, can extend the supplement without legislation. \u201cI\u2019m on DSP, not parenting payment but I\u2019m the only person raising my children, why is it I\u2019m not seen to have extra costs/needs,\u201d said Emma, a respondent to an AUWU survey. Of the outbreak at the Northwest hospital, Courtney says: \u201cAll staff who worked at the Northwest regional hospital in the medical or surgical wards will be asked to quarantine for 14 days. We will be providing accommodation for those staff who are unable to quarantine in their own homes.\u201d Courtney says that staff will be tested, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. A fourth person has died in Tasmania, the state\u2019s health minister has just announced. Sarah Courtney says the man was elderly and died at Northwest hospital. She extends her condolences to his family. Courtney says there were four more Covid-19 cases confirmed overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 111. Northern Territory police have issued a statement outlining the fines issued yesterday for social distancing rules. Police said they fined a 32-year-old woman who \u201cabsconded from mandatory quarantine in Darwin\u201d. \u201cThe woman arrived in the NT on 7 April 2020, travelling from Adelaide and was required to remain in a hotel for 14 days,\u201d a police statement said. \u201cPolice located the woman and issued her a fine before returning her to her hotel.\u201d Police also said a 22-year-old man in Araluen also \u201cbreached quarantine by leaving his house to register his new vehicle at the MVR\u201d. \u201cThe man had returned to the NT by road from South Australia on 29 March 2020.\u201d A further six people were issued with infringement notices relating to mass gatherings. Police said 3,630 compliance checks had now been completed with 17 fines issued. Just to recap deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly\u2019s comments on the NRL\u2019s decision to restart. Kelly said emphasised that we all have a responsibility to continue with social distancing measures. He said that although the league\u2019s players were not at high risk, others who are involved in the game would be. Kelly specifically named two coaches, Wayne Bennett and Ricky Stuart, as being vulnerable to Covid-19. \u201cTo be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track,\u201d he said. He added that it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether May is the right time to restart the league, but that the NRL would \u201cdefinitely need to get some permission to do that\u201d. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed today that he hadn\u2019t been consulted prior to the league\u2019s announcement of a planned restart date. Kelly reiterates that the health advices on schools remains the same. That is that the schools can remain open. But he notes that \u201cwe\u2019ll be having more to say about schools in the coming weeks.\u201d And with that, the press conference has concluded. Kelly is asked by a journalist, and we are thankful to her: what about about NRL Island? He says: \u201cIt sounds like a reality show they might continue it on, not just the playing, but what happens for the rest of the week, the mind boggles. If they\u2019re by themselves and they\u2019re away from the rest of society, then that is a thing. \u201cBut I just reiterate the young men and women who play the game won\u2019t be the only ones there. They need to think carefully about their coaching staff and other supporters. And think about their social responsibility, even on the island.\u201d Is the NRL risking the community by saying they will return to the game? Kelly says: \u201cThe other part I say about the NRL, they\u2019re general very fit young men and women, so they \u2013 they themselves are not at high risk and if they were just part of the \u2013 I understand the proposal is to play -continue to play in empty stadium, so they could be their own microcosm. \u201cFor them, it may not be a big problem. There\u2019s other people around the teams, Wayne Bennett is in his 70s, he would be in a vulnerable group, Ricky Stuart with the mighty Raiders, he would potentially be in a vulnerable group, so thinking about the team, not just the players, but those \u2013 the support staff around them, is important. And, look, they\u2019re making their plans for the road out I encourage them to do so in other sports. But whether May is the time will remain to be seen and definitely they\u2019ll need to get some permission to do that.\u201d Kelly is asked about the NRL\u2019s plans to restart the game next month. He is asked whether the NRL would need permission from state government or whether they are, for want of a better word, \u201ca law unto unto themselves in this regard\u201d? He says: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re a law unto themselves. Some of the players and coaches may think so, but they\u2019re part of society and they have a part \u2013 as we have all done, to support not only safety for themselves but for all of us. To be really frank about this, we all have a place in this and if we loosen the social distancing measures at the moment it can have an implication down the track. \u201cI\u2019ve said here before on average, what we know about this virus, if we don\u2019t have these social distancing measures, one person can lead to 400 other cases within a month. And so, that is the sort of explosive epidemic we\u2019ve seen in other countries. And we just cannot afford at this stage to be considering that happening.\u201d Kelly says border closures will be a component of what happens into the future. \u201cBut we also do need to our trade both back and forth, to continue in the society that we love. So these are all elements that will be part of the road out, as the Prime Minister said. It\u2019s too early to talk about that road out for the time being.\u201d Kelly says that \u201cthe curve is definitely decreasing\u201d. \u201cI would really urge caution there. Most of the cases we\u2019ve seen so far have and still remain related to overseas travel and so our local epidemic is very early. There\u2019s only a couple of thousand of those 6,000 cases are actual local transmission. \u201cSo, we need to see what happens with those and to learn from other countries that have going through a much more difficult time with much larger epidemics to see what happens as they pass that peak and see what happens from there, about being guided, what to do to get back to some sort of normality, a new normality, I would suggest, at least in the shorter term.\u201d Kelly said that it would be a great \u201cachievement\u201d if the virus began to die out in parts of Australia. But he adds: \u201cIt does bring with it a challenge, of course, it would mean the most of us would not have been exposed yet. So we would remain susceptible to the virus if it was re-introduced.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has started speaking in Canberra. He is asked if about the possibility that people can became immune to the virus. \u201cYes, that would be a very important thing to know. At this stage, we\u2019re only - I calculated this week - 14weeks into the virus. Only the first cases in Australia were in mid-to-late January. So it\u2019s only very early. So at this stage, if we were able to look at people that might have been exposed at that time or indeed were diagnosed with the virus and see if they can immune now, it would be very short-term immunity still. \u201cIt remains to be seen what happens in the longer term. There\u2019s studies done in China, there will be studies here in Australia as well, looking at that immune element. But at this time we can\u2019t tell.\u201d Let\u2019s wrap up some of today\u2019s developments. NSW recorded its 22nd death and Victoria its 13th. It takes Australia\u2019s death toll to 53. Embattled NSW minister Don Harwin was fined $1,000 for breaching social distancing laws. Authorities are urging people to stay home for Easter, and police are turning people around who are heading to holiday spots. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is yet to discuss the NRL\u2019s restart date 28 May with the league. Tasmanian police have told 15 people on their way to holiday spots to go home during Covid-19 patrols over the past 24 hours. AAP reports that the force intercepted more than 35 people in cars - including some towing caravans and boats - and turned them back as needed. Three people have been arrested or summoned to appear in court over Covid-19 related offences, the force confirmed on Friday. \u201cThis Easter, if you are away from your primary residence and try to go to your shack and you don\u2019t have a valid excuse, you will not only be turned around, but you could be charged and face a substantial fine,\u201d Acting Assistant Commissioner Jo Stolp said. Premier Peter Gutwein told residents on Thursday not to leave their homes unnecessarily, with fines of up to $16,800 or six months\u2019 jail. Helicopters are monitoring people\u2019s movements, hovering over regional communities including Bicheno, Friendly Beaches, Coles Bay, Dunalley and Primrose Sands. Officers are also patrolling on foot in Bridport, St Helens, Longford, Great Lake, Port Sorell, Somerset and Smithton among the areas. Tasmania had recorded 111 cases of the virus as of Thursday night, with 48 of those people recovering. The NSW government has announced that healthcare workers would now benefit from free parking at public hospital carparks during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cOur healthcare workers are on the frontline of our battle with Covid-19 and we need to do whatever we can to support them during this difficult time,\u201d the premier, Gladys Berejiklian said. \u201cWe hope this new measure makes life a little easier for our doctors, nurses and other hospital staff who are working hard to keep us all safe.\u201d The free parking begins from today. Some good news for the more than 100 Australian and New Zealand residents who were aboard the Antartica cruise that was anchored of the coast of Uruguay. AAP reports that the group are expected to land in Melbourne over Easter after Aurora Expeditions, the operator of the Greg Mortimer ship, chartered a flight from Montevideo. The news was confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Friday. Of the more than 200 people on the vessel, 96 are Australian passengers and crew, along with roughly 16 New Zealand citizens. Five Australians have already been taken off the Greg Mortimer and admitted to hospital in Montevideo, DFAT said. Thanks to Michael for his efforts this morning. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for today. Thanks for your company. I\u2019ll hand over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will take you through the afternoon. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has issued a statement slamming celebrity chef Pete Evans, after the Channel Seven star and reality television host posted a video falsely suggesting a $15,000 light machine could be used treat Covid-19. In a live video posted to his Facebook page, the My Kitchen Rules judge said the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u201cis a pretty amazing tool\u201d and claims there are \u201ca thousand different recipes\u201d including \u201ca couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. Evans is selling the product on his own website for $14,990. It states the product is \u201ca hybrid subtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d with \u201cfour transmitted energies\u201d which \u201cstimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness and athletic performance\u201d. The post has been condemned by RACGP president Harry Nespolon, who said Evans, who has in the past promoted anti-vaccination views, \u201cneeds to stop\u201d. Nespolon said he had suggested several months ago Evans should \u201cleave vaccinations alone\u201d. \u201cWell, he should also steer well clear of peddling devices which he claims use \u2018subtle energy\u2019 to counter Covid-19. He just needs to stop it right now. \u201cIt is a reality that many people look up to Mr Evans in his roles as a popular chef and television host. I once again urge him to book an appointment with his local GP to learn about the damage he is doing on social media.\u201d Quickly to the ACT, where three new cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours. The ACT\u2019s total is now 103. The new confirmed cases are two women and one man, aged between 26 and 51. One is a close contact of a previous confirmed case and the other two are under investigation. Kerry Chant says the 69-year-old man who died in Newcastle overnight likely contracted the virus \u201cduring a recent trip interstate\u201d. The man had travelled to Queensland. Obviously, we are watching locally acquired cases, and I think from the beginning I\u2019ve explained that they raise the major concern for me, because they reflect areas where we might need to have that focused testing to establish there\u2019s not broader transmission in the community. So, earlier this week, I called upon the community to increase testing in some of those areas, where we had identified cases. We will continue to update and call on the community to come forward to have increased testing in areas where we identify local transmission. Asked about the $1,000 fine levelled against arts minister Don Harwin last night for breaching public health orders, he says: Look, as I said yesterday in relation to Mr Harwin, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are, there are very strict rules to try and keep us all safe. And the imposition of a fine, if that\u2019s what the police consider appropriate, is a matter for them. I can\u2019t comment beyond that. That\u2019s not my purview. Hazzard is asked about the NRL\u2019s announcement yesterday that they will restart the competition on 28 May. He says he has only had one meeting with the game, which was about four weeks ago before it was shutdown. If the NRL want to go ahead, happy to have the chat and make sure, with medical advice, as to whether or not it\u2019s appropriate. The only meeting I\u2019ve had that I can tell you about is around about a month ago, with [chief executive] Todd Greenberg and [chairman] Peter V\u2019landys to talk about the issue. But that was before they actually made a decision to shut the game down. So, I haven\u2019t had any discussions with them at this stage. Hazzard has recovered from his coughing fit and is back taking questions. He\u2019s asked about new $5,000 on-the-spot fines in NSW for people who cough or spit on health workers. If I had my choice, I would be locking them up pretty quick-smart. But the police will hand them, in the first instance, a $5,000 fine. There is another option. And that is that if the police choose to they can actually enforce a court attendance notice and a charge, which would allow an $11,000 fine and $6,000. But this is an on-the-spot $5,000 fine. I can\u2019t remember any fine like this in the past history, where a police officer could hand over a $5,000 fine on the spot. It\u2019s quite unprecedented. He\u2019s asked about a McDonald\u2019s worker who was allegedly spat on yesterday, and whether the fines should be extended. Says they will look at it. The NSW police have issued almost 50 new fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. Chant thanks the people of NSW for helping to slow the spread, and urges people not to neglect their normal medical needs. Yesterday we reported that GP clinics across the country are reporting a major drop in patient numbers due to the pandemic, either because of Covid-19 fears or problems transitioning to telehealth services. It\u2019s been pleasing to see that we\u2019ve continued to see an increase in testing numbers. And my message to the community is to please, our services are open over the Easter period and I would urge you to continue to access those services. I\u2019d also like to [send a message] to the community that our services are safe and available, so it\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t neglect any other underlying chronic diseases, or if you develop symptoms that need - that you need to access urgent care, please continue to do so. Hazzard has had to hand over mid-sentence to the NSW chief medical officer Kerry Chant because he\u2019s having a coughing fit. New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking in Sydney. He\u2019s announced that a 69-year-old man has died at the John Hunter Hospital in Newcastle overnight, bringing the total number of deaths in NSW to 22. He says NSW has 49 new cases of Covid-19. That\u2019s very slightly more than the day before, when there was a three week low of 39 new cases. 211 cases are in NSW hospitals. 29 of those are in ICU. Of those 29, 23 are ventilated. If you haven\u2019t already watched Scottish sports broadcaster Andrew Cotter\u2019s commentary of his two labradors, Olive and Mabel, and their quiet battle over an orange rubber bone, I need to strongly insist you do so right now. It is, I assure you, an absolute tonic. My colleague Steph Harmon has written about it: The Gold Coast Airport has closed its terminal because there are no regular scheduled commercial flights to the tourism hotspot for the foreseeable future. AAP reports the terminal closed on Friday after the last Qantas and Virgin flights departed on Thursday. The operation of the runway and airfield operations will continue for general aviation and other activities. Gold Coast Airport boss Marion Charlton says the terminal will open when regular passenger flights resume. \u201cThe aviation industry is at the front line of this crisis, with passenger numbers falling steadily since the beginning of March,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to work closely with our partners throughout this challenging time.\u201d A few scenes of the Easter long weekend in Australia. Victoria has recorded another Covid-19 death, taking Australia\u2019s national death toll to 52. The latest death is a man in his 80s who died in hospital, the state government confirmed on Friday. It marks the 13th person to die from the virus in the state. Victoria also recorded 13 new cases in the past 24 hours. Forty-three people remain in hospital, with 13 of those in intensive care. Seven people have been released in the last 24 hours. Queensland\u2019s health minister, Stephen Miles, is speaking in Brisbane. The state has recorded 13 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours. He\u2019s also confirmed that the state has issued 289 fines for breaches of public health orders. The fines begin at $1,300. Miles also revealed that one person in the state has been charged for allegedly spitting at a nurse. I was of course disgusted to hear that report [and] concerned for the wellbeing of that particular nurse, but nobody should treat our health workers like that. Everyone should know that the police will enforce the law and I understand charges have been laid. Hard to fathom, really. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, appeared on one of the commercial breakfast TV networks and admitted to feeling \u201ca degree of frustration\u201d with Australians stranded overseas. Thousands of Australians remain scattered overseas, and on Thursday the foreign affais minister outlined plans for charter flights for people trying to get home from various parts of the world. A special Qantas flight from Peru landed in Australia overnight. Birmingham said: There are frustrations, no doubt about that. We were one of the early countries in the world to urge Australians reconsider their need to travel, and to urge them to come home and to ultimately to urge them to or to tell them that travel was not to be undertaken and to enforce quite strict arrangements in place. There is a degree of frustration there. But our diplomats have been working day and night around the world to come up with solutions to help Australians be able to safely get home. That is why we have stepped in to make sure there are some regular flights available over the next few weeks. We can\u2019t guarantee that it will go on beyond that. But you can get home from places if you can connect in to London or Hong Kong or Singapore or San Francisco because we put in place those regular flights. We are also looking at exceptional circumstances where we do need to work to get aviation capacity into places such as Peru, where there is a flight that has come in overnight. It is the second one that has come out of there in a space of about a week. We have circumstances in Uruguay that we are working through, in South African and the Philippines. These are incredibly complex arrangements given the travel restrictions that other countries have imposed and the collapse in international aviation. It is not unreasonable that Australians who are overseas, some of whom will have ignored the travel warnings, will have to make a contribution to their return. Police in Victoria have issued 98 fines for breaches of public health orders in the past 24 hours. The fines include nine children who were fined \u201cfor gathering in a private residence\u201d and a man who received four warnings before he was fined. Unlike in NSW, police in Victoria have refused to release data about the locations of the fines. We also don\u2019t know any demographic indicators about the people who have been fined. So, for example, their housing status or ethnicity. Victoria police say they conducted 754 spot checks at homes, businesses and non-essential services in the past 24 hours. Since 21 March they have conducted a total of 18,386 spot checks. Once upon a time, when I was a journalist at a regional newspaper, my colleagues and I used to joke about the carbon-copy stories we\u2019d be forced to write on an annual basis. People working on Christmas Day, police warnings about double demerits and, of course, lines at the fish co-op on Good Friday. Well, Covid-19 has at least added a bit of spice to the latter yarn. AAP reports that the Sydney Fish Market will still open its doors for what is usually one its busiest days but this year strict social distancing measures and temperature checks will be in place. More than 40,000 people usually flock to the market on Good Friday to snap up seafood for the Easter weekend but this year only 400 people will be allowed on the site at one time. People will have their temperature checked on arrival, be given hand sanitiser and be asked to follow social distancing rules to limit the spread of Covid-19. \u201cObviously it\u2019s going to be a very different Easter down at the fish market this weekend,\u201d a spokeswoman, Stephanie Margrain, told AAP. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no oysters on the boardwalk ... Come down, shop quickly and get home.\u201d The market has been working with NSW police and NSW Health to develop a plan that ensures people who have made a tradition out of going to the fish market on Good Friday can continue to do so safely. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to encourage lots of people to come down like we normally would, but we\u2019re conscious for many it is a tradition,\u201d she said. A 31-year-old man Palm Beach will face drug charges after Queensland police allegedly found 93kg of cannabis during a stop at a state border checkpoint on Wednesday. In a statement this morning Queensland police said officers at the checkpoint intercepted a Ford Ranger utility with a trailer trying to enter Queensland about 5.30pm on Wednesday. It will be alleged that during a search of the vehicle police found 93kg of cannabis and $4,300 in cash. Police say the drugs have a street value of about $450,000. A 31-year-old Palm Beach man was arrested and charged with the possession of dangerous drugs and the possession of property suspected of be used in connection with a drug offence. He has been bailed to appear at the Coolangatta magistrates court on 6 July. The man was also issued a $1,334 infringement notice for breaching the state\u2019s public health orders. Detective Inspector Chris Ahearn from the Gold Coast criminal investigation branch said \u201cany person attempting to enter our state, even if they are a Queensland resident, should expect a heightened level of scrutiny\u201d. \u201cIn addition to the current biosecurity risks, police will remain vigilant to disrupt any criminal activity,\u201d Ahearn said. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has released his own Easter message. Like the prime minister he\u2019s urged people to stay home during the \u201conce-in-a-generation health crisis\u201d caused by Covid-19. Easter is traditionally a time when Australians gather together. For Christians, they go to church services. For other Australians, they spend time together with family, with friends, and with other members of their local community. But this Easter is different. We need people to stay home. To stay home in the interest of their own health. But also, the health of others. The COVID-19 crisis is a once in a generation health crisis. And we need to take it seriously. Whilst overwhelmingly we want Australians to stay home, some people will be working. Our health workers, our police and emergency services, our transport workers. Some who work in industries like our supermarkets who will continue to work over the Easter break. We need to give them our thanks. They are keeping us safe and doing an extraordinary job in difficult times. This age of social distancing and self-isolation means that we are all keeping 1.5 metres apart. But in so many ways, we as Australians have never been as together as we are now. So, I wish all Australians a peaceful Easter at home. The good news for kids is that the Easter bunny is allowed to visit your home this Sunday. I wish you and your family all the best this Easter. The New South Wales Labor opposition has, perhaps unsurprisingly, seized on the $1,000 fine issued to the arts minister, Don Harwin, overnight. The shadow arts minister, Walt Secord, has issued a statement calling for Gladys Berejiklian to sack Harwin: The premier has no choice but to sack the arts minister. Yesterday, she defended him. An apology is not enough. Mr Harwin is a personal friend of the premier and a factional ally, but he is not above the law. He has been travelling back and forth to Sydney from Pearl Beach. Pearl Beach is an elderly community. These health orders are there to protect the most vulnerable. A man wearing an Akubra and brandishing a whip has been charged after allegedly threatening people outside the Chinese consulate in Sydney. After footage of the alleged incident was shared widely on social media, police said a 55-year-old was arrested at Dee Why on Thursday and charged after allegedly cracking the whip outside the consulate on 31 March. \u201cPolice will allege in court that the man threatened several members of the public while cracking the whip,\u201d they said. Let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s in the other papers today. The Sydney Morning Herald leads on Covid-19 clusters inside New South Wales hospitals after the state\u2019s health department revealed on Thursday that 12 new cases have been discovered at Gosford hospital. Two were hospital patients, six staff and four family members or friends. The paper is also reporting the concerns of retail workers, who say they are \u201cscared and desperate\u201d about catching Covid-19 and are begging for businesses to stop in-store trading. The Age in Melbourne lead on the education minister Dan Tehan\u2019s threat to cut funding to independent schools if they close during the pandemic. The Australian reports that the University of Melbourne will take a $500m revenue hit this year because of Covid-19, as the vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, and his executive team take a 20% pay cut. The Oz also says more than 600,000 Australians have registered their interest in drawing down as much as $20,000 from their superannuation funds. In Sydney the News Limited tabloid Daily Telegraph leads on Don Harwin, in Melbourne the Herald Sun goes coronavirus-free on the front page, instead reporting on the Good Friday cancer fundraising appeal, and the Hobart Mercury splashes on the Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein\u2019s message that \u201cthe gloves are off\u201d in police enforcement of public health orders over the Easter long weekend. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been moved out of intensive care. In a statement a few hours ago a spokesman said: The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits. You can follow our UK live blog here: As the rate of infection in Australia continues to fall, authorities are nervous about the potential for the Easter long weekend \u2013 when many people usually travel \u2013 could seet off a new wave of Covid-19 cases. They\u2019ve been urging people to stay at home over the break, and state premiers have warned police will be out in large numbers enforcing lockdown rules. Drawing on his faith, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, used his Easter message to drive home the importance of social distancing: I hope it is a time as you come together in your homes, together with your immediate family, that it will be a strong reminder about what\u2019s most important. For Christians, not being able to gather does not diminish the hope that we have through this important Easter period. This year, we will live out our faith by doing the right thing. That means staying at home, making sure we\u2019re checking on our neighbours and supporting our communities and families, our friends. First up, a little bit more on that Don Harwin news. Late last night the New South Wales police issued a statement saying they had issued a fine after being \u201calerted\u201d that a 55-year-old man had \u201crelocated to a holiday home at Pearl Beach, in contravention of current Ministerial Direction under the Public Health Act\u201d. \u201cAs part of inquiries, investigators from Central Metropolitan Region attended the Elizabeth Bay home unit and spoke with the man,\u201d NSW police said. \u201cFollowing further inquiries, the man was issued a $1000 PIN via email just before 9pm.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has resisted calls to sack Harwin, saying he didn\u2019t break the rules because he moved to his Central Coast home on 13 March, before the state lockdown came into effect. But multiple reports on Thursday indicated Harwin had travelled back to Sydney for appointments while staying at the Central Coast property. \u201cNo one individual or corporation is above these laws \u2013 anyone suspected of breaching the orders will be investigated and if a breach is detected, they will be dealt with in accordance with the Act,\u201d said the police commissioner, Mick Fuller. \u201cOn behalf of the community, I strongly urge those with information about breaches to contact police.\u201d Good morning. It\u2019s Friday, 10 April. Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the Covid-19 pandemic in Australia. I\u2019m Michael McGowan. I\u2019ll be bringing you all of today\u2019s Good Friday news, but first here\u2019s how we left things last night: Australia reported its lowest number of new cases in three weeks on Thursday, with 96 people diagnosed since the last update, nationally. It was the first time in three weeks Australia\u2019s new cases have dropped below 100. One 76-year-old South Australian man died, bringing the country\u2019s death toll to 51. The New South Wales minister for arts, Don Harwin, has been fined $1,000 for breaching the state\u2019s strict public health orders. Harwin got himself in strife after it emerged he had left Sydney for his property on the Central Coast, despite the Berejiklian government urging the public to delay non-essential travel. The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, ordered independent schools to reopen and provide in-person education to children whose parents want it in term two. Tehan said he would make independent schools\u2019 funding contingent on complying with the order. The Block star Scott Cam has agreed to forgo his $345,000 salary as Australia\u2019s \u201cnational careers ambassador\u201d. The employment minister, Michaelia Cash, said Cam had agreed to give up his salary given his \u201crole has fundamentally changed\u201d due to Covid-19.",

      "body": "<p>Much has been made of the Football Association\u2019s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women\u2019s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows \u2013 the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus \u2013 into its Sport Hall of Fame.</p> <p>The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women\u2019s football \u2013 which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women\u2019s Football Association \u2013 happened by chance.

And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,\u201d she adds with a chuckle.</p> <p>Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals \u2013 World Cup Willie \u2013 and separated the tournament\u2019s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.</p> <p>\u201cDad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,\u201d recalls Ferris. \u201cAnd then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3e1d19b70e1feb53b15b462724e1a28b99f0b78/0_0_1931_2506/771.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.\" width=\"771\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Denis Follows outside the FA headquarters with World Cup Willie, the 1966 World Cup mascot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I\u2019ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.\u201d</p> <p>When Nobby Stiles\u2019 contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris\u2019s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.</p> <p>Follows\u2019 journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.</p> <p>In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/28/coe-and-ovetts-olympic-debt-to-bureaucrat-who-defied-thatcher\">Coe and Ovett's Olympic debt to bureaucrat who defied Thatcher | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.</p> <p>His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. \u201cWhen there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,\u201d explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. \u201cInitially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,\u201d says Ferris.</p> <p>Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women\u2019s football. \u201cI knew about it being reversed,\u201d says Ferris, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn\u2019t any women\u2019s football and accepted that as the status quo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/84_877_4490_3887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Southampton Women line up in 1971, one year after the club was founded.

It was traumatic.

      "bodyText": "Much has been made of the Football Association\u2019s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women\u2019s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows \u2013 the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus \u2013 into its Sport Hall of Fame. The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women\u2019s football \u2013 which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women\u2019s Football Association \u2013 happened by chance. Follows\u2019s daughter, Maggie Ferris \u2013 another Nottingham alumnus \u2013 mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university. The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person\u2019s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. \u201cHe was always campaigning about things,\u201d explains Ferris. \u201cThat was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,\u201d she adds with a chuckle. Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals \u2013 World Cup Willie \u2013 and separated the tournament\u2019s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery. \u201cDad brought it home [after it had been recovered] and he actually slept with it under the bed until we won it,\u201d recalls Ferris. \u201cAnd then it went to a special place to be displayed. When it was due to be taken to Mexico for the 1970 World Cup there was a real issue of how they were going to get it there. \u201cThe Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I\u2019ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.\u201d When Nobby Stiles\u2019 contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris\u2019s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles. Follows\u2019 journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students. In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. \u201cIn a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,\u201d says Ferris. \u201cHe could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.\u201d Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962. His dual career paths gave him a unique role in the Munich air disaster in 1958. \u201cWhen there was the the crash with the Busby Babes in it Dad was the general secretary of Balpa, but he was also treasurer of the FA,\u201d explains Ferris. Follows became the union representative of the pilot, Captain James Thain, who was initially blamed for the crash, and spent more than a decade working on the case to clear his name. \u201cInitially he was a scapegoat, guilty [of failing] to clear the ice on the wings despite witnesses saying there was no ice, but Dad got him cleared in 1968,\u201d says Ferris. Three years later Follows drafted the letter that would lift the ban on women\u2019s football. \u201cI knew about it being reversed,\u201d says Ferris, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t know about the ban [coming into force] in the 20s. I just knew that there wasn\u2019t any women\u2019s football and accepted that as the status quo.\u201d It would be one of his last big acts at the FA \u2013 he left less than two years later and became chairman of the British Olympics Association in 1977. He saw off intense pressure from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, defending the right of British athletes to compete at the Games. \u201cThat was so stressful,\u201d remembers Ferris. \u201cI think that led to him having his first heart attack. It was traumatic. But he seemed pretty calm at the time, he just dealt with the complaints and just quietly said that, in his opinion, it was an individual decision and that the opportunity should be there for the athletes to participate. It was Lord Carrington [the foreign secretary] and Michael Heseltine [head of the Department for the Environment, which included sport] that were ringing him and putting the heavy screws on but he just stuck by his guns. \u201cOf course it was Seb Coe\u2019s gold medal that year,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn\u2019t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.\u201d Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country \u201ctrying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all.

Tilley says: \u201cIt feels only right that we celebrate him.

First Thing: your new-look US morning briefing Next week this briefing will look a little bit different, and be called First Thing. You don\u2019t need to do anything: it will still contain everything you need to know as you wake up, and be delivered every weekday morning. But now spring is here, we thought it was a good time to freshen it up, and we hope you like the new changes as much as we do. Global coronavirus cases pass 1.6m amid fears of second wave Confirmed coronavirus deaths around the world have exceeded 95,000 and there are at least 1.6m cases. Countries including Spain and Italy report their rates of infection are beginning to plateau while others, such as Russia, announce record 24-hour rises. Many countries now enter the Easter and Passover holidays, or look towards the Ramadan month of fasting, as citizens are told to continue to abide by physical distancing measures. Warnings. Despite Trump\u2019s claims, the World Health Organization warned of the human-to-human transmission risk as early as 10 January and urged precautions, though it did tweet days later appearing to contradict itself. Ignored. Many of the WHO\u2019s most powerful members snubbed its advice and are now playing catch-up or suffering consequences, while the organisation, whose budget is smaller than many hospitals, is caught in US-China rivalry. Record NY Covid-19 deaths as state hires burial laborers New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus toll for the third consecutive day on Wednesday as 799 deaths were announced. City officials have contracted laborers to bury the rising number of victims in an area long used to bury those with no known next of kin. The state governor, Andrew Cuomo, warned the effect of the outbreak on the state\u2019s economy was expected to be more devastating than 9/11 and pointed to the 1918 Spanish flu, which came in three waves. Tribute. Frank Gabrin, 60, America\u2019s first ER doctor to die treating Covid-19 patients, had voiced concerns over the lack of protective equipment at New York hospitals and had worn the same mask for several shifts. Death toll. The infectious diseases chief, Anthony Fauci, has dismissed baseless \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d that the official number of US deaths from Covid-19 has been overstated after claims on rightwing media. Bolthole. A businessman from Manhattan rented a mansion with a bowling alley in Long Island \u2013 now one of the worst-hit areas of New York state \u2013 for almost $2m until the end of September in an attempt to flee the pandemic. US unemployment rises 6.6m in a week as shutdowns reverberate More people have been put out of work in the last three weeks than in the two years of the last recession, with 16m jobs gone in the past three weeks, including more than 6.6m in the past seven days. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, unprecedented in the postwar era. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171). Depression, not recession. Economists have warned that unemployment in Britain and the US could surpass the levels reached during the 1930s Great Depression within months, following a never-seen-before business collapse. In other news\u2026 LGBTQ rights pioneer Phyllis Lyon, who was among the first to marry another woman in California, has died at her home aged 95. Tributes have said her courage changed the course of history.

      "body": "<h2><strong>Monday</strong></h2> <p>In the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, each NHS trust would send out individual emails of the number of people who had died. Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease. Just so that he and thousands of others like him don\u2019t get forgotten.</p> <p>Pete wasn\u2019t a close friend: more of a friend of a friend and someone my wife would join on long weekend walks. But he was a lovely man. He was at Exeter University several years before me \u2013 he took his studies so seriously, it took him four years to complete a three-year degree \u2013 but photos from that time show him as a dead ringer for Steely Dan\u2019s Jeff \u201cSkunk\u201d Baxter. He was also known for driving his motorbike far too fast and for crashing cars. On leaving Exeter, he went on to establish his own communications business in Brighton and was heavily involved in several charities working in India and Africa. He is survived by his wife, Heidi, and his two children. My heart goes out to them. It\u2019s still not clear what the rules are for funerals in the time of the coronavirus but it will undoubtedly be a scaled back affair. Sometime, when this horror is all over, we will have a party to remember him properly. And for all the many others whose deaths were merely reported as a grim number at the daily Downing Street press conference.</p> <h2><strong>Tuesday</strong></h2> <p>I found myself totally unsettled by the news that Boris Johnson had been moved to the intensive care unit at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. So much so, that I had to switch off Twitter and stop watching the news: even though it is literally my job to watch the news. Part of the shock was that less than three hours earlier, Dominic Raab had insisted at the Downing Street press conference that Boris had only gone to hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/boris-johnson-admitted-to-hospital-with-coronavirus\">as a precaution</a> and was basically still in charge of the country. So the only possible conclusion was that Raab had lied about the gravity of Boris\u2019s condition or that, even as de facto deputy prime minister, he had not been kept in the loop. Neither of which inspired much confidence in the government. If we couldn\u2019t trust the government to tell the truth about something so critical as the prime minister\u2019s health, why should we trust it to tell the truth about anything else? The No 10 communications team really needs to start upping its game: we\u2019re long past the point where serious news can be withheld for a few hours. But mostly my shock at the deterioration of Boris\u2019s condition was on a more existential level. You can dislike his politics and think little of of his suitability as prime minister, but he is still the country\u2019s leader. At a very basic, psychoanalytical level Boris is the country\u2019s daddy. And no one ever wants to lose their dad, no matter how crap a dad he has been. We want our parents to be strong. Invincible, even. The last thing we want is proof that the coronavirus really is totally indiscriminate.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Finding ways of filling up the days \u2013 other than with work \u2013 is proving to be more and more of a challenge. I have had two more goes at Hilary Mantel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/the-mirror-and-the-light-hilary-mantel-review-thomas-cromwell\">The Mirror and the Light</a> but still haven\u2019t got the concentration to get past the first four pages. That makes it six attempts at the book so far, but it\u2019s testament to the power of the writing that I have been gripped on each occasion. By this time next week, I am determined to make it to at least page six. My wife is rather more inventive than me and had found on Twitter the #GettyMuseumChallenge, which encouraged everyone to recreate works of art using objects they had lying around the house. After a great deal of passive resistance from me \u2013 \u201cWhy on earth would I want to do that?\u201d \u2013 Jill persuaded me to join her as Piero della Francesca\u2019s Duke and Duchess of Urbino.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c57c461dcc0875e37df49931242a491d9ef76b48/0_693_5200_3120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portraits of Duke and Duchess of Urbino, by Piero della Francesca, circa 1475, in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Barritt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her costume was constructed using some lace bought from a French market some years ago, along with a pair of headphones covered with tin foil and a paper flower. Mine was made from some red felt, left over from making one of the children\u2019s Christmas stockings, rounded off with a heavy Le Creuset saucepan for the head gear. It certainly had the necessary gravitas. Once the pictures were taken against the kitchen wall, our son Photoshopped them into the appropriate frame and we posted the diptych on Twitter and got a wonderful response from many people. Apart from the bloke who suggested I should have gone the whole hog and broken my nose like the original duke. Now our fame is to be extended further. Yesterday I got an email from a producer working on a TV film Grayson Perry is making about creativity in lockdown, requesting permission to use our photo. A Bafta surely must be in the offing.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I have spent most of the football season wishing Spurs could play rather more like Liverpool and less like a bunch of bored, non-league players. And much to my surprise, I have found that I have missed the final two months of the season far less than I expected. It turns out that there are limits to my masochism and were the Premier League to announce that the final placings for this year\u2019s season were as of the beginning of March, I\u2019d be quite happy. If we can\u2019t make the Champions League we can at least avoid the Europa League. Best of all, though, would be for the entire season to be considered null and void so that Spurs would automatically qualify for the Champions league on last season\u2019s performances. </p> <p>But now I find myself not just wishing Spurs would play like Liverpool but behave like them too. Earlier this week, Liverpool announced it had made an error in laying off and furloughing many of its non-playing staff and were going to retain them all. Just a week after announcing profits in excess of \u00a370m, the Tottenham board \u2013 despite much pressure from the supporters\u2019 trust and other interested parties \u2013 came to an entirely different decision and is laying off and furloughing non-playing staff. At White Hart Lane, the directors seem to care more about the bottom line than basic human decency. To make things even worse, the club has broken physical-distancing guidelines by holding training sessions in the park. I\u2019ve sometimes been ashamed of Spurs\u2019 on-field performances; now I am ashamed of their off-field ones. It\u2019s not too late to reverse the decision. The club may be surprised at just how many fans won\u2019t forget or forgive if they don\u2019t.</p> <h2><strong>Friday</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4774071928b826df4ec0dfda95606ed2e2f4ccd7/0_70_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image on a hoarding in London of the Queen broadcasting her message\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Queen: Next, they\u2019ll be having me sing Vera Lynn</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no getting away from it.

      "body": "<p>The pizza place was the first to react.</p> <p>Within hours of the announcement that schools in my small Ohio community would close for at least three weeks, the restaurant began making baguette sandwiches, free for all children. Next, the inn announced they would distribute peanut butter and jelly every day, no purchase necessary and no questions asked.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/06/what-youre-getting-wrong-about-appalachia\">Passive, poor and white? What people keep getting wrong about Appalachia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These announcements of local aid were the first, but by no means the last, but what is remarkable is that they come from a part of the country that has struggled with extreme poverty for generations: central Appalachia. We are a place either forgotten about or disparaged by much of America. Despite what the rest of the county thinks of us, in a pandemic, there is no place I would rather be than in Appalachia.</p> <p>I live in the poorest county in my state and one of the poorest communities in the nation, a remote town 90 minutes from an airport. My town is boosted by the presence of a state university, an economic benefit the nearby villages do not have, yet in the face of the pandemic, the university switched to online instruction. The college students were ordered to vacate, leaving many businesses un-patronized and even unstaffed. Under mandates from the governor, bars, restaurants, barbershops and hair salons have closed, and gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden.</p> <p>These new mandates, combined with social distancing, make it difficult for traditional businesses to operate. But small local businesses, such as the ones that exist in my town, have more flexibility. Without corporate policies and with less liability, they have adapted \u2013and fast. The town breweries offer carryout beer in growlers. The local ciderhouse, my personal favorite, is making a carryout cocktail. Restaurants switched to delivery, with one place quickly whipping up a new walk-in menu, and reorganizing the inside of the restaurant to minimize contact between patrons.</p> <p>Business changes like these cannot operate successfully without changes coming from the municipal level as well, something we\u2019re able to do easier and faster in a small town. So, many parking meters have been changed to free, 10-minute parking for food pickup. The local distillery has shifted to making hand sanitizer, working with the FDA for official approval.</p> <p>Remote education has yet to begin for the thousands of children home from school in my county, primarily because living in a remote place, many children still do not have internet at home. But the school district is bringing mobile hotspots to the houses without access, and loaning Chromebooks to kids without computers.</p> <p>Certainly, the pandemic will be horrific to places already <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2020-03-19/coronavirus-could-crush-the-poor-and-homeless-advocates-warn\">devastated by poverty</a>. Many people in my town do not have primary care physicians \u2013 there are simply not enough doctors \u2013 and use the ER for care. Many others do not have insurance. Though the coronavirus is revealing the many, many cracks in our fractured country, uncovering the dirty truth about who gets care and <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2020/03/21/coronavirus-comes-terrible-time-reeling-appalachian-kentucky/2878214001/\">who does not,</a> I hope it is also unveiling how small communities like my own make it work, and have for years, even under unbearable conditions: through local networks, neighbors helping neighbors, even strangers.</p> <p>My small community is rising up together. A large mutual aid group quickly formed, with posts ranging from the bulk food store offering to take orders on notes outside their door and deliver, to posts from individuals, like a man who wrote he has a lot of condoms and can deliver to anyone in the county in need of birth control.</p> <p>Resilience and practicality are hallmarks of Appalachia.

      "bodyText": "The pizza place was the first to react. Within hours of the announcement that schools in my small Ohio community would close for at least three weeks, the restaurant began making baguette sandwiches, free for all children. Next, the inn announced they would distribute peanut butter and jelly every day, no purchase necessary and no questions asked. These announcements of local aid were the first, but by no means the last, but what is remarkable is that they come from a part of the country that has struggled with extreme poverty for generations: central Appalachia. We are a place either forgotten about or disparaged by much of America. Despite what the rest of the county thinks of us, in a pandemic, there is no place I would rather be than in Appalachia. I live in the poorest county in my state and one of the poorest communities in the nation, a remote town 90 minutes from an airport. My town is boosted by the presence of a state university, an economic benefit the nearby villages do not have, yet in the face of the pandemic, the university switched to online instruction. The college students were ordered to vacate, leaving many businesses un-patronized and even unstaffed. Under mandates from the governor, bars, restaurants, barbershops and hair salons have closed, and gatherings of more than 10 people are forbidden. These new mandates, combined with social distancing, make it difficult for traditional businesses to operate. But small local businesses, such as the ones that exist in my town, have more flexibility. Without corporate policies and with less liability, they have adapted \u2013and fast. The town breweries offer carryout beer in growlers. The local ciderhouse, my personal favorite, is making a carryout cocktail. Restaurants switched to delivery, with one place quickly whipping up a new walk-in menu, and reorganizing the inside of the restaurant to minimize contact between patrons. Business changes like these cannot operate successfully without changes coming from the municipal level as well, something we\u2019re able to do easier and faster in a small town. So, many parking meters have been changed to free, 10-minute parking for food pickup. The local distillery has shifted to making hand sanitizer, working with the FDA for official approval. Remote education has yet to begin for the thousands of children home from school in my county, primarily because living in a remote place, many children still do not have internet at home. But the school district is bringing mobile hotspots to the houses without access, and loaning Chromebooks to kids without computers. Certainly, the pandemic will be horrific to places already devastated by poverty. Many people in my town do not have primary care physicians \u2013 there are simply not enough doctors \u2013 and use the ER for care. Many others do not have insurance. Though the coronavirus is revealing the many, many cracks in our fractured country, uncovering the dirty truth about who gets care and who does not, I hope it is also unveiling how small communities like my own make it work, and have for years, even under unbearable conditions: through local networks, neighbors helping neighbors, even strangers. My small community is rising up together. A large mutual aid group quickly formed, with posts ranging from the bulk food store offering to take orders on notes outside their door and deliver, to posts from individuals, like a man who wrote he has a lot of condoms and can deliver to anyone in the county in need of birth control. Resilience and practicality are hallmarks of Appalachia. I spent a lot of time in a house without indoor plumbing, so the toilet paper shortage doesn\u2019t alarm me that much. One of my friends is sewing medical masks, using the loops from a child\u2019s potholder weaving kit for the earpieces. It\u2019s spring, and I plan a big garden this year, growing enough to share. When it comes to the pandemic in America, no one is coming to save us. And no one knows more what that\u2019s like than Appalachia. We are used to doing it alone and under the extreme pressure of poverty and all that it entails: low incomes, lack of sleep, lack of access to care. How to get through now?

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Huanan seafood wholesale market in central Wuhan was the kind of place where people often caught colds. Vendors started setting up as early as 3am, plunging their hands into buckets of cold water as they cleaned and prepared produce for the customers that arrived every morning.</p> \n<p>The sprawling market of more than 20 streets spanned two sides of a main road in an upscale neighbourhood of the commercial district of Hankou. Racks of meat were hung on hooks or spilled out on plastic mats. Workers walked around in welly boots. Drains lined the kerb alongside stores selling everything from live poultry to seafood and cooking ingredients. It was crowded but clean.</p> \n<p>So, in mid-December when Lan, who sold dried seafood at one of more than 1,000 stalls in Huanan, felt unwell, he thought little of it.</p> \n<p>He stayed home to rest but after losing 3kg in just a few days, he decided to go to his regular hospital for a check up.</p> \n<p>From there he was sent to a hospital that specialises in infectious diseases and was admitted on 19 December. He remembers how the staff praised his positive attitude. \u201cI was just a little bit sick. I wasn\u2019t scared in the slightest,\u201d said Lan, who asked not to disclose his full name.</p> \n<p>Lan could not have known then that he was among the first cases of a new, highly contagious coronavirus that would kill more than 2,500 people in his city and engulf the world, infecting more than 1.6 million people so far and killing more than 95,000. The World Health Organization has described the outbreak of Covid-19 as the worst global crisis since the second world war. \u201cI thought I had a cold. I had no idea,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Coronavirus infections began cropping up in Wuhan in December \u2013 and reportedly as early as November \u2013 but the Chinese authorities did not inform the public that the virus could pass between humans until late January.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4fd795549d1b5491e10309e81a06529ed201b241/0_364_5461_3277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A makeshift Intensive care unit in February at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan where many patients were in critical condition.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, as China celebrates what it claims is victory over the disease, the number of infections and deaths is increasing around the world.

Face masks! Gloves!\u201d the medic wrote.</p> \n<p>That same day an ophthalmologist at Wuhan central hospital named Li Wenliang told a WeChat group of former medical school classmates that seven people at his hospital had contracted what he believed to be Sars, the outbreak that killed more than 600 people in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4b9a4d99440e0245e3f84c80701a4751bfea7b1/0_24_5745_3447/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A makeshift intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An intensive care unit at the Red Cross hospital in Wuhan in mid-February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>An \u201curgent notice\u201d from the Wuhan health commission warning of \u201csuccessive cases of unknown pneumonia\u201d was also leaked and posted online on 30 December. The statement ordered hospitals to \u201cstrengthen responsible leadership\u201d and ensure that no one \u201cdisclose information to the public without authorisation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Under growing pressure, the following day the health commission said researchers were investigating 27 cases of viral pneumonia, its first official notice about the virus. There was no \u201cobvious evidence of human-to-human transmission,\u201d the statement said, describing the outbreak as linked to the seafood market and assuring the public that all patients had been quarantined and their contacts placed under observation. \u201cThe disease is preventable and controllable,\u201d it added.</p> \n<p>A day later, on 1 January, the Huanan seafood market was closed and Wuhan\u2019s public security bureau announced that eight people had been \u201cpunished\u201d for spreading rumours. Authorities also tasked hospitals to screen for pneumonia cases linked to the market. It wasn\u2019t until 20 January that vendors in the market were asked to submit to temperature checks and blood tests.</p> \n<p>But across the Yangtze River, some 6 miles (10km) away, people who had never been to the market were falling sick. In the second week of January, Coco Han, 22, developed a cough she couldn\u2019t shake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3deca7accfd51e95a50b8060a9ac7def9d4abf4b/0_340_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coco Han, 22, in Wuhan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After a week, she went to see her local clinic on 20 January and had a CT scan done. The results showed an infection on her lungs. A medic in a full hazmat suit escorted her to another hospital for more tests.</p> \n<p>Han\u2019s mother joined her in a crowded waiting room where those waiting began to panic. Han had a mask but her mother had not thought to wear one, given the government\u2019s assurance. A young woman in line in front of them fainted and Han\u2019s mother hugged her, telling Han not to look.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe all knew we might have the virus. Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d</p> \n<p>While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south.</p> \n<p>By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission.</p> \n<p>Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Things felt out of control\u2019</h2> \n<p>By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt was so busy. We couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0898893b6f12be2eca08bde792271cd834fecec/0_284_5301_3181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 28 March 28 the subway in Wuhan resumed operation after two months of being closed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. \u201cThis was all full,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day people were dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>On 23 January, the city of 11 million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than 50 million people under de-facto home quarantine.</p> \n<p>Facing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By 19 February, the death toll from the virus had passed 2,000.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn\u2019t know what would happen,\u201d said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media.</p> \n<p>It is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan\u2019s almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China\u2019s responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0e9d4a87c1b650d7c95769860343e77038227e3/0_81_5473_3284/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 8 April the Wuhan Gongjialing toll station reopens as authorities lift traffic restrictions after 76 days of lockdown in which residents were not allowed to leave the city.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gerry Yin/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wuhan is slowly coming back to life.

Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>And not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters<em> bu neng, bu mingbai</em> (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">was forced to sign</a> before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about.

They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,\u201d Han says. \u201cI want to know why this happened.

Everyone was scared,\u201d Han said. \u201cI think the doctors knew it was transmissible between humans or they wouldn\u2019t have sat so far from us and kept the windows open.\u201d While Han was told that she probably had \u201cthat pneumonia\u201d, she was not able to confirm the diagnosis because the hospital was not authorised to do so, an issue many early patients faced. She was told to go home and self-quarantine but the doctors prescribed her medicine that she had to renew every three days at the hospital, waiting in line with others. \u201cI was extremely worried I was passing it to others, but I couldn\u2019t let my parents go somewhere so dangerous,\u201d she said. Daron Hu, 35, who also had never been to the Huanan seafood market, began to feel feverish and dizzy on 16 January. He thought he was just hungover after a few drinks the previous night. Three days later, still unwell, he took a train to Jiangsu province for a work trip. He travelled back to Wuhan and from there returned to his hometown a few hours to the south. By the time Hu was admitted into his local hospital, a team of researchers sent by the central government had arrived in Wuhan. Zhong Nanshan, a top respiratory expert famous for countering the government narrative on Sars, said on the evening of 20 January that there had already been cases of human-to-human transmission. Hu, who at his worst point suffered diarrhoea and breathing troubles in addition to a fever and a cough, told his family that he was fine. But over the next 24 days in the hospital, at least three other patients died. He considered writing a will. \u201cI saw some people give up. It is very lonely,\u201d Hu said. \u2018Things felt out of control\u2019 By the time officials revealed the infectiousness of the virus, hospitals in Wuhan were already overwhelmed and the numbers increased after the announcement. Video taken on 22 and 23 January showed crowds of patients at Wuhan No 6 hospital in Wuchang, another district of Wuhan. \u201cIt was so busy. We couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d said a nurse who slept in the hospital dormitory and rotated every four hours in a team of six people to keep up. Another medic gestured to the sidewalk outside the hospital. \u201cThis was all full,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day people were dying.\u201d On 23 January, the city of 11 million people was placed under lockdown. Surrounding areas followed suit, putting a total of more than 50 million people under de-facto home quarantine. Facing severe shortages of supplies, staff and space, the next few weeks were desperate. Hospitals turned away patients, sending them home where they often infected their families. Footage showed medics weeping and people collapsed in the streets. Dead bodies were left in hospitals where staff were too busy to collect them. Internet forums filled with pages of pleas for help by residents trying to save loved ones. By 19 February, the death toll from the virus had passed 2,000. \u201cThe virus was very quick. At the beginning, things felt out of control. We didn\u2019t know what would happen,\u201d said one doctor treating coronavirus patients at Wuhan central hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not given permission to speak to media. It is a time authorities are quick to gloss over as they celebrate the lifting of Wuhan\u2019s almost three-month lockdown, an event marked with light shows and banners hailing the success of the \u201cpeople\u2019s war\u201d. \u201cBeijing has been working very hard to fight the negative domestic and international fallout,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cBut this is far from adequate in stopping people from discussing China\u2019s responsibility in covering up the outbreak in the beginning,\u201d he said. Wuhan is slowly coming back to life. Neighbourhoods have erected flags and signs declaring them \u201cvirus free\u201d. Cars are starting to fill the streets again as people return to work. Yet, visible reminders of the epidemic remain. Rows of tall metal fencing surround the still-shuttered Huanan seafood market, its former entrances manned by security while police cars patrol nearby. And not everyone is willing to forget. On a wall near her home, Han recently spray-painted the Chinese characters bu neng, bu mingbai (I cannot, I do not understand), a reference to a declaration Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor, was forced to sign before eventually succumbing to the virus he tried to warn others about. Underneath the words, some residents have burned piles of paper money, a way to honour the dead, drawing small white circles around the ashes. \u201cThey said stay. I stayed. They said everything was fine. I believed. I believed it all,\u201d Han says. \u201cI want to know why this happened. Who said not to tell people?\u201d \u201cI will remember this for the rest of my life \u2013 I understand now that we are not important.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and Jiahui Huang",

Instead, they\u2019re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. \u201cWe reckon the tent just about fits,\u201d says Sterken. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.\u201d On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. \u201cThe kids are really excited, although we haven\u2019t told them yet they\u2019ll be sleeping on camping mats,\u201d he says. And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours. \u201cWe know they can\u2019t see their families so thought we\u2019d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,\u201d says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. \u201cIt\u2019s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.\u201d",

The organisation conceded that people without symptoms can spread the virus, but only recommended healthy people wear face masks when they were caring for a coronavirus patient and in the same room. The masks can help prevent infections by catching large virus-laden droplets that are expelled from patients when they cough and sneeze, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/face-masks-coronavirus-scientists-evidence-covid-19-public\">David Heymann</a>, who chairs the WHO\u2019s risk committee, said face masks can give people a false sense of security if they do not combine an effective one with eye protection and adopt strict hand hygiene measures.</p> \n<p>The UK has a similar stance to the WHO and does not recommend healthy people wear masks in public. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover.html\">advises people to wear face masks</a> outside, but offers guidance on how to make \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d too.

On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again.

In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/09/lifting-lockdown-uk-options-graded-return-normality\">\u201cyouth first\u201d</a> policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/09/uk-lockdown-could-end-with-sector-by-sector-plan-for-firms\">sector-by-sector approach</a>.

President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. \u201cThe majority is clearly European,\u201d Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html\">New York Times</a>. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.30.015008v1\">infected bats</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/09/how-coronavirus-spread-across-the-globe-visualised\">How coronavirus spread across the globe - visualised</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>And finally\u2026</strong></h2> \n<p>As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much.

But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) not only advises people to wear face masks outside, but offers guidance on how to make \u201ccloth face coverings\u201d too. On Tuesday, US government scientists argued the case for face coverings after preliminary research showed people spray out thousands of tiny saliva droplets when they speak simple sentences such as \u201cstay healthy\u201d. Adriaan Bax at the US National Institutes of Health, who led the work, found a damp homemade cloth face mask \u201cdramatically reduced droplet excretion\u201d. Some countries look towards easing lockdowns Following in the footsteps of China, a number of countries announced plans to relax restrictions they had put in place to stop the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, China, lifted its 11-week lockdown in Wuhan where the outbreak began. The following day, the Czech Republic allowed bicycle shops and DIY, hobby and hardware stores to reopen. After the Easter break, Austria will let small shops, DIY stores and garden centres return to business, while Denmark plans to reopen kindergartens and primary schools. But with the virus still present and large numbers of people still vulnerable to infection, health officials are watching closely for cases to surge again. As Denmark\u2019s prime minister, Metter Frederiksen, commented: \u201cIt\u2019s like walking a tightrope.\u201d The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, was admitted to intensive care for several days but returned to a ward on Thursday after he improved without needing mechanical ventilation. In his absence, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, scotched hopes for an early end to the UK lockdown and refused to be drawn on exit strategies until the country was beyond the peak of the epidemic. But discussions are underway in Whitehall where options range from a \u201cyouth first\u201d policy that would allow young workers to return to their jobs, to a staggered sector-by-sector approach. To find out more about how to lift the lockdowns, listen to Adam Kucharski, associate professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and author of The Rules of Contagion on the latest episode of our Science Weekly podcast. New York\u2019s epidemic was fuelled by travel back from Europe Scientists have found that the coronavirus outbreak in New York was largely fuelled by US citizens bringing the infection back from Europe. President Trump imposed restrictions on travellers from China at the end of January but only blocked travel from most European countries in mid-March. Separate teams at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City and New York University reached similar conclusions after studying the genetic code of viruses obtained from patients in the region. The scientists traced the origins of the outbreak by analysing patterns of mutations that accumulate in viruses as they spread. \u201cThe majority is clearly European,\u201d Harm van Bakel, a geneticist from one of the teams, told the New York Times. The same approach was used last month to trace the coronavirus back to infected bats. And finally\u2026 As streets emptied out and factories closed their doors, scientists at the British Geological Survey noticed their sensitive earthquake-detecting seismometers had stopped twitching as much. Closer inspection of the charts revealed that the lockdown has changed how the Earth moves beneath our feet: there are fewer vibrations from human noise passing through the planet. The fall in background noise, particularly around urban seismometers, has left scientists wondering if they might detect earthquakes that are smaller than normal, or at distances that are normally beyond their range. With lockdowns easing around the world, they do not have long to look. As Brian Baptie at the BGS conceded: \u201cWe may not get anything in the short term.\u201d",

Fortunately, if you\u2019re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/25/fifa-20-review-not-your-typical-annual-update\">Fifa 20</a> enable fans to create their own tournaments \u2013 providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-20\">Fifa 20</a> (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a329.99)</h2> <p>One of Fifa\u2019s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.</p> <p>Best of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20\u2019s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.</p> <p>There\u2019s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although <a href=\"https://www.fifplay.com/fifa-20-co-op-seasons/\">Co-op Seasons</a> is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you\u2019re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">MLB </a><a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mlb-the-show-20-ps4/\">The Show 20</a> (PS4; \u00a344.99)</h2> <p>The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.</p> <p>The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e201485e476abc638ff84e565ce1140fc1f4008/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MLB The Show 20\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Best living-room baseball ...

In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren\u2019t officially licensed, the game\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d stadium and the \u201cLarge Gold 4\u201d and \u201cMedium Silver 17\u201d trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. <br> It\u2019s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there\u2019s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You\u2019re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more.</p> <p>If you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it\u2019s portable so you can take it out into the garden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9045f3f7e47f09b7ca1705736ac7881708c50adc/501_79_3339_2003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"AO Tennis 2\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Play out your favourite tournament ...

That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence.

      "bodyText": "Euro 2020 postponed, Wimbledon cancelled, baseball\u2019s opening day delayed: the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the sporting calendar. Fortunately, if you\u2019re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as Fifa 20 enable fans to create their own tournaments \u2013 providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition. Fifa 20 (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a329.99) One of Fifa\u2019s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled. Best of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20\u2019s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final. There\u2019s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although Co-op Seasons is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you\u2019re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard. MLB The Show 20 (PS4; \u00a344.99) The best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress. The Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus. AO Tennis 2 (PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One; \u00a347.99) For the first time since 1945, there will be no Wimbledon champion. In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren\u2019t officially licensed, the game\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d stadium and the \u201cLarge Gold 4\u201d and \u201cMedium Silver 17\u201d trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. It\u2019s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there\u2019s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You\u2019re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more. If you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it\u2019s portable so you can take it out into the garden. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour Golf (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a370+) Five years after release, EA\u2019s most recent golfing effort enjoys a cult following \u2013 to the point that secondhand copies start at \u00a370. That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA\u2019s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series\u2019 Mega Drive roots. Up to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred. If you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try The Golf Club 2019, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite Everybody\u2019s Golf (PS4) or the incredibly hectic Party Golf (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just \u00a32 on Switch. NBA 2K20 (PS4, Xbox One; \u00a345.99) Visual Concepts\u2019s basketball veteran goes one step beyond the other games listed. In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones.

Again, set-up options are plentiful, including a fantasy draft option in case you\u2019re desperate to make Giannis Antetokounmpo a Brooklyn Net. Got your own favourite multiplayer sports games?

There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit.</p> \n<p>As the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains.</p> \n<p>\u201cCoronavirus has exposed New York\u2019s two societies,\u201d Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door; the other society was deemed \u2018essential workers\u2019 and made to go out to work with no protection.\u201d</p> \n<p>Different boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty; parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We have almost 100% people of color in our emergency room.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sean Petty</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In places like the Bronx \u2013 which is 84% black, Latino or mixed race \u2013 the sidewalks are still bustling with people making their way into work. There is still a rush hour. \u201cWe used to call them \u2018service workers\u2019,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow they are \u2018essential workers\u2019 and we have left them to fend for themselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>The public advocate pointed out that 79% of New York\u2019s frontline workers \u2013 nurses, subway staff, sanitation workers, van drivers, grocery cashiers \u2013 are African American or Latino. While those city dwellers who have the luxury to do so are in lockdown in their homes, these communities have no choice but to put themselves in harm\u2019s way every day.</p> \n<p>If you superimpose <a href=\"https://comptroller.nyc.gov/reports/new-york-citys-frontline-workers/\">a map</a> of where frontline workers live within New York over <a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/covid-nyc\">a map</a> of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical.

      "bodyText": "When Sean Petty walked into the emergency room of Jacobi medical center in the Bronx, at the start of his nursing shift on Monday, he was assailed by a catastrophic scene. About 60 people, almost all of them African Americans or Latinos from the surrounding area of New York City, all displaying classic symptoms of Covid-19, were gasping on stretchers everywhere he looked. \u201cEvery nook and cranny of the emergency department was full of patients attached to portable oxygen tanks, people so sick they needed beds. The stretchers filled the room and spilled down the corridors, 10 patients in just one hallway,\u201d he said. The dreadful sounds of sickness filled the room. \u201cIt\u2019s like a chorus, a cacophony of coughing.\u201d Petty, a pediatric emergency nurse who now spends much of his time caring for adults with coronavirus, could not help envisaging the thousands of contagious micro-droplets being expelled into the air with all that coughing. \u201cI felt like I was walking into a cloud of poison,\u201d he said. Petty is on the frontline of the frontline: New York City. The metropolis has become the focus of the worldwide coronavirus pandemic, just as in 2001 it became the focus of the worldwide al-Qaida terrorist threat on 9/11. Day by day, the statistics tell their own grim story. On Tuesday, the New York City death toll overtook that of 9/11 and now stands at 3,602 (2,753 died in the city in the 2001 terrorist attacks). On Wednesday, it was announced that New York had suffered its highest number of fatalities in a 24-hour period \u2013 806 lives snuffed out in just one day. Even that was almost certainly an undercount, as those New Yorkers who die at home are not being included in the figures. The attack is coming in waves \u2013 not just on one sunny morning in September as when the Twin Towers came down, but over days and relentless weeks. There are Ground Zeros dotted throughout the city, like Jacobi, one of 11 major public hospitals that are all now pushed to, and beyond, the limit. As the crisis thickens, a picture of how the virus is ravaging the city has come into view carrying with it a sobering realization. Coronavirus may not in itself discriminate, but its outcomes certainly do. It has inflicted its terrible toll not so much on New York City, but on the two cities it contains. \u201cCoronavirus has exposed New York\u2019s two societies,\u201d Jumaane Williams, the public advocate who acts as the official watchdog for New Yorkers, told the Guardian. \u201cOne society was able to run away to the Hamptons or work from home and have food delivered to their door; the other society was deemed \u2018essential workers\u2019 and made to go out to work with no protection.\u201d Different boroughs, even different neighborhoods within each borough, are experiencing coronavirus almost as though it were two different contagions. In wealthier white areas the residential streets are empty; parking spots that are fought over in normal times now stand vacant following an exodus to out-of-town weekend homes or Airbnbs. In places like the Bronx \u2013 which is 84% black, Latino or mixed race \u2013 the sidewalks are still bustling with people making their way into work. There is still a rush hour. \u201cWe used to call them \u2018service workers\u2019,\u201d Williams said. \u201cNow they are \u2018essential workers\u2019 and we have left them to fend for themselves.\u201d The public advocate pointed out that 79% of New York\u2019s frontline workers \u2013 nurses, subway staff, sanitation workers, van drivers, grocery cashiers \u2013 are African American or Latino. While those city dwellers who have the luxury to do so are in lockdown in their homes, these communities have no choice but to put themselves in harm\u2019s way every day. If you superimpose a map of where frontline workers live within New York over a map of the 76,876 confirmed cases in the city, the two are virtually identical. In Queens, the most intense concentration of Covid-19 infections are in precisely those neighborhoods with large numbers of essential workers. One telling detail: at least 41 subway and bus workers have died from coronavirus. A diversity review by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 2016 found that 55% of its 72,000 employees were black or Latino, and 82% were male \u2013 which is also telling as more men than women are dying from the virus. \u201cWe put people out there and said you got to go to work, but we didn\u2019t give them protective gear or additional testing to keep them safe. It was almost as though these groups were expendable to keep the city moving,\u201d Williams said. This week a tiger tested positive at Bronx Zoo. It generated plenty of headlines, but few media articles made the point that Williams highlighted. \u201cA tiger tests positive \u2013 that\u2019s good to know. If we have enough diagnostic test kits for tigers, shouldn\u2019t we have enough for our own frontline humans?\u201d Two miles away from Bronx Zoo, back in the ER of the Jacobi medical center, Sean Petty sees the impact of New York\u2019s two societies every day. \u201cWe have almost 100% people of color in our emergency room,\u201d Petty said. Most of the adult Covid patients he cares for are also wrestling with underlying health conditions that make them far more vulnerable to the disease. \u201cOur patients are coming in with all of the comorbidities associated with poverty and racism \u2013 diabetes, asthma, hypertension. We have patients who are sicker and more likely to die because their lives have been conditioned by these chronic illnesses.\u201d Reliable data has been hard to come by, as both city and state authorities resisted for several weeks releasing official figures on the grounds that the subject of disparities was less important than keeping hospitals afloat. Journalists at the independent not-for-profit news site THE CITY were driven to do their own analysis of NYC department of health data and found that in the Bronx people are dying at twice the rate of New Yorkers as a whole. On Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio finally caved to pressure and posted preliminary findings that unambiguously underline the racial breakdown of coronavirus\u2019s deadly toll. Black and Latino New Yorkers are dying at double the rate of white and Asian New Yorkers, following precisely the public advocate\u2019s narrative of two societies. \u201cThere are clear inequalities, clear disparities in how this disease is affecting the people of our city,\u201d De Blasio said. In recent days Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, has tentatively suggested that the crisis may already have reached its apex and could be plateauing as the curves for new cases, hospitalizations and ICU admissions all show signs of flattening. If there are indications that the city may be starting to prevail against the disease, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like that to Sean Petty. When he looks out of the window of the staff room during shift breaks he sees the refrigerated truck lined up to receive the bodies of Covid victims \u2013 one of 80 parked outside hospitals around the city. \u201cThere is no good news story here,\u201d he said. Already Jacobi has lost two frontline health workers, an educator in the psychiatric department and a nurse\u2019s aide. On top of what he sees as preventable tragedies, Petty said what rattled him most was when a Jacobi emergency room resident aged 27 was admitted into intensive care. \u201cThat was a huge wake-up call for me. To see a 27-year-old person sent to ICU who was working a hundred yards from me, that shook me.\u201d Petty said he has never felt as angry towards the US healthcare system and towards government \u2013 the Trump administration as well as city and state leaders \u2013 for failing to protect the city\u2019s frontline workers. Through his union, the New York State Nurses Association, he has had to fight every step of the way to secure basic personal protective equipment (PPE) to keep him and his colleagues safe. As the virus claims more victims, the city is having to think the unthinkable. Rikers Island, the notorious New York jail complex that is fighting its own Covid-19 outbreak and saw the first death of a detainee on Sunday, has been paying prisoners $6 an hour to dig mass graves on a nearby island in the Bronx though recently they switched to contract labourers. This week a New York city council member revealed in a tweet that has since been deleted that mass burials were being considered in local parks, 10 caskets per grave. He later backtracked and said it was a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d. Political leaders, from De Blasio locally, to Cuomo regionally and Donald Trump nationally, have all tried to calm emotions by pointing to high-profile initiatives intended to provide some relief for hospitals pushed to the edge. The Javits Convention Center has been turned into a military-run hospital; the USNS Comfort, a naval hospital ship, is also now docked in the Hudson River. But so far these headline-grabbing schemes have been full of sound and fury, delivering very little. Between them, the Javits and Comfort have treated just over 100 patients. A far less glamorous but much more substantial pattern of events is unfolding in the outer boroughs where most Covid victims live, away from the cameras and the political grandstanding. Here doctors and nurses are working far longer hours, at greater pace, than ever before, and with less protective equipment.

A physician at Elmhurst hospital, which like Jacobi is in the thick of the crisis, and treats many low-income and immigrant populations, said he is now having conversations with patients and their families about end-of-life care six or seven times a day, instead of once every two weeks. \u201cThese discussions are intensely personal and very emotional,\u201d he said. And now that he can\u2019t invite the family into the patient room, or hold the patient\u2019s hand, \u201cthere\u2019s a degree of detachment and depersonalization\u201d.

Seven men and three women arrived on the chartered aircraft to Marseille-Provence airport, where helicopters were waiting to fly them on to Cannes, where they had rented a luxury villa. The men, aged 40-50, and women, aged 23-25, were refused permission to enter France and ordered by police to fly back to the UK. \u201cThey were coming for a holiday in Cannes and three helicopters were waiting on the tarmac,\u201d a border police spokesperson told Agence France-Presse. \u201cWe notified them they were not allowed to enter the national territory and they left four hours later.\u201d Once the Embraer Legacy jet had landed at Marseille-Provence, the group, made up of several nationalities including Croatian, German, French, Romanian and Ukrainian, reportedly tried to get help from contacts to continue their journey. \u201cThey tried to make use of their connections and made a few phone calls,\u201d the source said. The helicopter pilots were told to return to their base and were fined for breaking the French lockdown rules. The jet, chartered by a Croatian businessman reportedly in \u201cfinance and property\u201d, arrived last Saturday, but details were only released on Thursday. French police said they would be carrying out strict checks on private aircraft arriving in France over the Easter period. All non-essential travel inside France has been banned since 17 March and a recent tightening of the restrictions means anyone entering the country should hold an international travel certificate showing the journey is essential. The authorities in France and Britain have made it clear that travelling to a second home in either country does not qualify as essential. \u201cCrossing borders needs a legitimate or urgent reason,\u201d a police spokesperson said. BFMTV reported that nine of the jet passengers returned to the UK and the 10th chartered a private jet to Berlin.",

Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: \u201cI think there\u2019s an awareness by them that parents think it\u2019s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.\u201d Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: \u201cNick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.\u201d However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: \u201cWe do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.\u201d",

But health workers on the frontline of the outbreak fear authorities are overestimating hospitals\u2019 capacity to care for critically ill patients. The country\u2019s health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, has praised Chile\u2019s health system as \u201cone of the best on the planet\u201d and insisted that enough beds have been available for critical patients. So far, Chile\u2019s Covid-19 mortality rate is 0.95% \u2013 well below the global average of 4.7% \u2013 but medics warn that this figure is giving authorities a false sense of security. \u201cIt\u2019s far too soon to say whether Chile is tackling this successfully,\u201d warned Dr Claudia Cort\u00e9s, an infectious disease specialist in the capital, Santiago. Despite increases in the numbers of Covid cases in Chile\u2019s capital, the majority of the city is not under quarantine. Several districts have been on lockdown for the past two weeks, but these measures will be lifted next week in six affected neighbourhoods. Early Covid-19 cases were concentrated in Santiago\u2019s rich neighbourhoods, imported by wealthy families returning from their summer holidays in Europe. Most of those cases were treated in private hospitals. But Cort\u00e9s works between private and public hospitals attending Covid-19 patients \u2013 and she fears death rates will rocket as the virus spreads to poorer areas. \u201cPeople in public hospitals get sick differently from ones in private hospitals \u2014 they are like two different worlds,\u201d she said. Dr Gabriel de la Fuente Tessler, who works with critically ill Covid-19 patients in a Santiago public hospital, also believes the statistics are misleading. He identified the lack of ventilators as a key problem: his hospital has only 18 machines, 14 of which are already in use. Each day, more patients are coming in, and no one is leaving. \u201cThe bus is filling up, and soon there won\u2019t be any seats,\u201d Fuente said. Temuco, 845km south of the capital, has seen Chile\u2019s highest coronavirus death rates. Located in Chile\u2019s poorest region, Araucania, the city is plagued by high pollution levels, contributing to respiratory sickness in locals. Temuco\u2019s central hospital has dedicated three floors to critical Covid-19 patients. Videos from the overrun hospital have circulated on social media, with staff resorting to wearing bin bags and adhesive tape as forms of protection. Family of deceased coronavirus patients told local media the hospital was turning away critical patients due to lack of resources. Dr Carolina Chahin, an infectious disease specialist at the hospital, predicted the upcoming winter months would hit Chile\u2019s colder, southern regions hard. \u201cWe do not feel prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cThe public health system in Chile is impoverished,\u201d she said, adding that Temuco\u2019s hospital was the only one in the region with equipment to care for critical Covid-19 cases.

The French company, which is one of the government\u2019s biggest call centre operators, said more than half of its nearly 7,000 call handlers were working from home and that the health, safety and security of its staff \u201chas always been our top priority\u201d.

One outsourcing firm <a href=\"https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/home/view/40183565\">said</a> in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: \u201cYour personality is far more important than your previous experience.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from \u201cdozens\u201d of staff employed at the firm\u2019s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working \u201cdesk to desk\u201d, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus.</p> <p>The company, which is owned by one of the world\u2019s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: \u201cIf you\u2019re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.\u201d</p> <p>Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian.

Concerns about health and safety have been raised by call handlers at at least three call centres where thousands of people are employed by outsourcing firms to field calls to the 111 service.

Gary Slade, the company\u2019s UK chief executive, said it was \u201cfully compliant\u201d with the government\u2019s sick pay guidelines and that anyone who displayed Covid-19 symptoms was being sent home to self-isolate. \u201cThis is not about making money [or] treating people badly \u2013 we\u2019ve never been that way,\u201d he added. \u201cBut this is definitely without doubt our number one priority: do what\u2019s right for our people and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. \u201cAre we perfect? Probably not. There\u2019s always room for improvement. But we\u2019re doing everything we can, working as hard and as fast as we can.\u201d The Guardian found several outsourcing firms recruiting NHS 111 operators for as little as \u00a39.09 an hour \u2013 barely above the UK minimum wage \u2013 despite their role as the first point of contact for people who think they have the coronavirus. One outsourcing firm said in its job advertisement that no previous customer service experience was needed, adding: \u201cYour personality is far more important than your previous experience.\u201d Concerns have been raised by NHS 111 operators at another firm, Sitel. The Labour MP Luke Pollard said he had received complaints from \u201cdozens\u201d of staff employed at the firm\u2019s call centre in Plymouth, which is handling 111 calls. Staff told him they were working \u201cdesk to desk\u201d, in breach of the coronavirus physical distancing rules, and that workplaces were not being deep-cleaned, leaving many afraid to go to work for fear of catching the virus. The company, which is owned by one of the world\u2019s richest families, is said to have instructed call handlers not to speak to the media about their concerns. Pollard said: \u201cIf you\u2019re scared of going to work, that is as real as it can get and that needs to be addressed.\u201d Sitel declined to answer a series of questions when contacted by the Guardian. A spokeswoman confirmed that the company was in dialogue with Pollard and that it was following the safety measures outlined on its website.",

      "bodyText": "The global design community has collaborated to launch the first virtual design festival in response to the coronavirus lockdown. Products and talks from the schedules of Design Indaba and Stockholm, San Francisco and Vienna Design Weeks will appear alongside performances and exhibitions from the Serpentine Gallery, the London Festival of Architecture and New York architecture conference The World Around. All have been closed or cancelled due to Covid-19. The Virtual Design Festival (VDF) \u2013 which runs from 15 April to 30 June \u2013 was conceived by the team at interiors and architecture digital magazine Dezeen. \u201cThe architecture and design world has been affected by the pandemic, with key trade events and festivals cancelled and practitioners having to find new ways to sustain their business,\u201d says Marcus Fairs, editor-in-chief of Dezeen. \u201cIt felt natural to come up with an online platform to showcase projects and connect architects, designers, and creatives across the globe.\u201d Planned events include gigs by award-winning experimental singer-songwriter Beatie Wolfe and pianist and sound designer Rosey Chan, a programme of interviews organised by New York\u2019s The Metropolitan Museum of Arts architecture and design curator Beatrice Galilee for Earth Day (22 April) and a digital exhibition of work created by architect and artist Ron Arad, who calls the VDF \u201ca great initiative to bring us together at this extraordinary time\u201d. Arad\u2019s pieces are from his DFWTM series of artworks (a set of 20 fibreglass seat-like structures). \u201cThere\u2019s a piece I made on 31 January \u2013 the day we left the EU. I bought the newspapers of the day \u2013 all screaming Brexit \u2013 on the way to the studio. They were cut, torn and embedded in unset polyester. We thought we were \u2018freezing\u2019 the most life-changing day in the UK. Little did we know.\u201d \u2022 The Virtual Design Festival runs from 15 April to 30 June.",

      "body": "<p>The European Union has scraped through its latest crisis by the skin of its teeth. The past week has been a disgrace. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">ministerial talks</a> collapsed on Thursday over the plan for a \u201ccoronabond\u201d, the reaction seemed terminal. Germans and Dutch insulted Italians and Spaniards. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52224838\">said his country faced</a> an \u201ceconomic and social emergency\u201d, and the EU appeared not to care. The Danes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52221259\">spoke of</a> \u201ca financial crisis on steroids\u201d. The European commission\u2019s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52211650\">predicted</a> \u201cthe EU as we know it will not survive this\u201d.</p> <p>Finally a last-minute package was agreed, for \u20ac500bn of emergency loan finance. This was little more than an extension of the existing European stability mechanism, designed to help individual countries in short-term emergencies. Even then, it was a mere third of what the European Central Bank had <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-eurozone/ecb-urges-measures-worth-1-5-trillion-euros-this-year-to-tackle-virus-crisis-sources-idUKKBN21Q0U9\">said was needed</a>, \u20ac1.5tn euros. What was specifically not agreed was any sharing of the economic burden of the pandemic across European treasuries in general.

      "bodyText": "The European Union has scraped through its latest crisis by the skin of its teeth. The past week has been a disgrace. When ministerial talks collapsed on Thursday over the plan for a \u201ccoronabond\u201d, the reaction seemed terminal. Germans and Dutch insulted Italians and Spaniards. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said his country faced an \u201ceconomic and social emergency\u201d, and the EU appeared not to care. The Danes spoke of \u201ca financial crisis on steroids\u201d. The European commission\u2019s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, predicted \u201cthe EU as we know it will not survive this\u201d. Finally a last-minute package was agreed, for \u20ac500bn of emergency loan finance. This was little more than an extension of the existing European stability mechanism, designed to help individual countries in short-term emergencies. Even then, it was a mere third of what the European Central Bank had said was needed, \u20ac1.5tn euros. What was specifically not agreed was any sharing of the economic burden of the pandemic across European treasuries in general. It was mostly more loans. The reason was glaringly obvious, and as old as the EU itself. The northern European nations within the eurozone still do not trust the hard-pressed southern ones to spend money wisely and pay back their debts. It was the same reticence that governed the slow reaction to the 2008 financial crisis.

      "bodyText": "Two former senior executives at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s 21st Century Fox pleaded not guilty to wire fraud and money laundering charges on Thursday as the US government continued its sprawling investigation into bribery and corruption in world football. A South American sports company, Full Play group, also pleaded not guilty to an additional racketeering conspiracy charge. During a hearing in federal court, held via teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic, Hernan Lopez, former CEO of Fox International Channels, and Carlos Martinez, former president of Fox Latin America, were arraigned for their alleged involvement in bribery schemes for lucrative broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups as well as the Copa Libertadores, South America\u2019s biggest club competition. Both were granted bail set at $15m, with an evening curfew and international travel bans also imposed. Lopez left Murdoch\u2019s Fox in January 2016 to set up the podcast company Wondery, which received financial support from Fox when it was founded. At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers for the media executive persuaded the US district judge Pamela Chen to exempt Lopez\u2019s shares in the company from the bail package. Lopez\u2019s attorney Matthew Umhofer had argued that Lopez\u2019s bond amount should be significantly reduced to $500,000 with no curfew or prior permission for domestic travel. But Chen ultimately rejected the arguments. In arguing against Lopez\u2019s travel restrictions, Umhofer told the court that FBI agents had \u201cto come to Mr Lopez\u2019s door\u201d in July of 2016 with regards to the justice department\u2019s sprawling investigation of football corruption, indicating the former executive had known of his interest to prosecutors for over three years. Martinez, who left Fox in May 2019, according to his professional social networking page, was also forced by the government to hand over a number firearms to local police in Doral, Florida, as part of his bond. Prosecutors allege that Lopez and Martinez had \u201crelied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes\u201d to South American football officials in order to \u201cadvance the business interest of Fox\u201d and obtain \u201cconfidential bidding information\u201d to win American broadcast rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The alleged scheme occurred during Rupert Murdoch\u2019s ownership of 21st Century Fox. He sold the company to Disney for $71bn in March 2019. Fox and Disney have declined to comment on the indictments. The US justice department\u2019s investigation into corruption in world football\u2019s governing body, Fifa, was announced at dawn raid in July 2015. Twenty-six individuals have pleaded guilty as part of the investigation, with two former South American administrators found guilty at trial in 2017.",

This is good news; it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R<sub>0</sub> down across much of the country.</p> <p>But the problem still remains of how to prevent a second surge. The Hong Kong researchers worry that as economic activity restarts, local and imported cases of coronavirus could lead to new outbreaks. And the R<sub>0</sub> rate varies across different regions: case fatality rates were just below 1% in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou compared with 5.9% in Wuhan. We will likely also see a higher rate of infection and death rate in London than the rest of the UK.</p> <p>Moreover there\u2019s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, \u201conly residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down\u201d. Health authorities also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/the-new-normal-chinas-excessive-coronavirus-public-monitoring-could-be-here-to-stay\">found cases</a>, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.</p> <p>So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R<sub>0</sub> number in China, but the country\u2019s community surveillance approach.

Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">total lockdown</a>, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.</p> <p>Data seems to show that this approach is the right one. Death rates in Asian countries have been lower than in the US and Europe (South Korea\u2019s death rate, for example, is four per million and stable; the UK\u2019s is 105 per million \u2013 and rising). In addition to helping reduce the R<sub>0</sub> number, a community shield may also allow governments to lift national lockdowns more quickly. Rather than maintaining a prolonged lockdown, governments can target measures at people who actually have coronavirus.

The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new <a href=\"https://www.digitalhealth.net/2020/03/nhsx-coronavirus-contact-tracking-app/\">NHSX app</a> and the popular <a href=\"https://covid.joinzoe.com/\">Zoe Covid symptom tracker</a>.</p> <p>We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown.

The government-commissioned study, reportedly the first of its kind in continental Europe, was led by the polling company Sora, which is known for projecting election results, in cooperation with the Red Cross, the Medical University of Vienna, and other institutions. The study made it possible to estimate the prevalence of acute coronavirus infections in Austria among those not in hospital at the beginning of April, and was designed to provide a clearer picture of the total number of infections, given gaps in testing.

The study stands in contrast to controversial modelling by researchers at Oxford University who, in one scenario they examined, suggested most people in the UK might already have been infected with Covid-19.

The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views.</p> <p>Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-white-house-01306286-0bbc-4042-9bfe-890413c6220d.html\">showdown</a> in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug.</p> <p>When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/politics/peter-navarro-social-scientist-cnntv/index.html\">Navarro replied</a>: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic.</p> <p>Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego.</p> <p>His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics.</p> <p>\u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant.</p> <p>Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics.

      "bodyText": "The rise of Peter Navarro \u2013 the man put in charge of marshalling emergency US production of medical equipment in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 is in many ways a classic story of the Trump era. The 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called Death by China \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language. Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views. Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a showdown in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug. When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, Navarro replied: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic. Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego. His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics. \u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant. Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics. He had started out as a registered Republican but became an anti-growth, environmentalist independent, then a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1996, promoted energetically but unsuccessfully by Hillary Clinton. Navarro came closest to victory in 1992 when he emerged as the surprise contender to be San Diego mayor, taking on the city\u2019s entrenched Republican establishment. He stood as an independent, with a working-class background, determined to stand up for the little guy in the face of rampant development. He called his movement Plan (Prevent Los Angelization Now) and he appeared to have a good chance of winning going into a final television debate a couple of days before the vote. Towards the end of the debate the Republican candidate, Susan Golding, became emotional as she regretted the bruising nature of the campaign, in which the candidates had exchanged multiple slurs. Navarro misjudged the moment, accusing Golding of acting. He came across as cynical and unfeeling, and lost the race at the final hurdle. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the process that really brings out your essence,\u201d Remer said. \u201cAnd in this case it brought out Peter\u2019s essence, which is that he has no people skills at all, and he has no empathy for other people.\u201d The personality problem got worse with each defeat, according to Navarro\u2019s former spokeswoman, Lisa Ross, who worked with him on four campaigns. \u201cAs the years went on and as he kept losing campaign after campaign, he became more and more brittle, more and more confrontational, and ended up \u2026 alienating just about everyone,\u201d Ross said. \u201cPeter was not a nice person at the end of the day \u2026 He can really get in your face.\u201d Ross said she watched Navarro\u2019s extraordinary rise in Trump\u2019s world with open-mouthed astonishment. \u201cHe was the guy who was waving his arms in front of the bulldozer, so it was surprising when he went to work for the biggest bulldozer in the country,\u201d she said, speculating it was his personality that drew Navarro into such close orbit of the president. \u201cIt occurred to me that really Peter and Trump are the same kind of animal.

He wanted a bully to do the job.\u201d Navarro\u2019s rollicking 1998 memoir, San Diego Confidential, displays some of the bravado that appears to have attracted Trump, who is said to refer to him as \u201cmy Peter\u201d. In the book Navarro acknowledged his reputation as \u201cthe cruelest and meanest son-of-a-bitch that ever ran for office in San Diego\u201d, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have any concern at all about making stuff up about my opponent that isn\u2019t exactly true \u2013 I know that bastard running against me doesn\u2019t have any scruples either.\u201d As well as echoing some of Trump\u2019s own traits, Navarro has also shown, on occasion, the gift of prescience.

When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/woman-let-off-cruise-ship-in-cambodia-tests-positive-for-coronavirus\">hugging passengers as they disembarked</a>.</p> <p>The country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus.

The government does not have the ability to help.\u201d The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen\u2019s words were intended as a joke.</p> <p>Griffiths said: \u201cThe idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.\u201d</p> <p>Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics. </p> <p>This includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency.</p> <p>Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, \u201chave both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power\u201d, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. \u201cWe need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.\u201d</p>",

While human rights experts agreed some restrictions were needed to slow the spread of coronavirus, it is feared that many leaders are using the emergency to grab power. In Cambodia, the new legislation contains sweeping provisions allowing the government to carry out unlimited surveillance of telecommunications and to control the press and social media. The government would also gain the ability to restrict freedom of movement and assembly, seize private property and enforce quarantines. In addition, a catch-all clause would authorise \u201cother measures that are deemed appropriate and necessary in response to the state of emergency\u201d. Hun Sen initially downplayed the threat of coronavirus, and at one point threatened to throw journalists out of press conferences if they wore masks. When the Westerdam cruise ship was turned away by several other countries concerned about the outbreak, Hun Sen not only allowed the ship to dock but attracted international attention by hugging passengers as they disembarked. The country, where a lack of media freedom means scrutiny is limited, has since recorded 115 cases of the virus. Schools and entertainment venues have been shut, and wider travel restrictions announced. The state of emergency could be invoked whenever the country is considered to be facing a great risk, such as in a pandemic, war or disruption to public order, according to the law. Anyone found guilty of disobeying emergency measures, which are vaguely worded and could be used to target government critics, faces 10 years in prison. David Griffiths, director of the office of the secretary-general at Amnesty International, described the legislation as indefensible. \u201cThis is a blatant exploitation of public panic around Covid-19 and threatens to eviscerate the human rights protections which are guaranteed by the Cambodian constitution and international human rights law,\u201d he said. Independent journalists, government critics and people speaking about Covid-19 online are being arrested on a daily basis, he added. This week, Sovann Rithy, a journalist working for broadcaster TVFB, was arrested for quoting a recent speech by Hun Sen in which the prime minister said: \u201cIf motorbike-taxi drivers go bankrupt, sell your motorbikes for spending money. The government does not have the ability to help.\u201d The police arrested Rithy, stating that Hun Sen\u2019s words were intended as a joke. Griffiths said: \u201cThe idea of concentrating even more unchecked power into the hands of this government is worrying in the extreme.\u201d Asean Parliamentarians for Human Rights (APHR), an association of members of parliament from south-east Asian countries, said similar laws are being used across the region to crack down on critics. This includes the Philippines, where individuals can be jailed for spreading false information about Covid-19, and Thailand, where an emergency decree allows the prime minister to censor publications for a broad range of reasons. Officials in Thailand also have additional powers to arrest and hold people without charge if they are suspected of having a role in causing an emergency. Thailand\u2019s prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, and Hun Sen, \u201chave both shown in the past already creative ways to hang on to power\u201d, said Teddy Baguilat, a former Philippines MP and board member of APHR. \u201cWe need to make sure that the Covid-19 pandemic does not become their new tool to further legitimise and secure their authoritarian leadership.\u201d",

I truly salute the staff for adapting to the exhausting demands of our new reality, as well as relaxing their rules on letting in single men. Plus it\u2019s a novelty to meet a breed of doorman who isn\u2019t going to end up in a news report concluding with the words \u201cthe trial continues\u201d. That said, we must as always make a distinction between the supermarket workers and the supermarket bosses. Tesco took \u00a3585m bailout tax relief, and promptly paid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/08/tesco-sales-up-30-per-cent-because-of-pre-lockdown-stockpiling-coronavirus\">\u00a3635m dividends</a> to its biggest investors, some of which are the richest institutions on Earth.</p> <p>In other business news, despite more than 300,000 inquiries, just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/afd2deb3-cc47-4d57-b5c2-8959d53b4774\">2,500 government-backed loans have been granted</a> . You might have been surprised to learn the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was surprised to learn banks weren\u2019t lending, despite the fact he\u2019d told them to. Alas, the thing about the banks is that you can\u2019t bank on them. The Conservative party\u2019s relationship with the banks is basically Dot Cotton\u2019s relationship with her son, Nick. Maybe he\u2019s changed this time, you know?</p> <p>Labour news continues to have all the reach of a secret diary. Newly elected leader Keir Starmer has brought back Ed Miliband, the man famously identified as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/david_cameron/status/595112367358406656?lang=en\">chaos harbinger by David Cameron</a>. Which has turned out to be rather like being identified as slightly creepy by Jimmy Savile.</p> <p>But for better or worse, Miliband\u2019s highest-profile outings in recent years have been as pixels in the notorious Cameron tweet. In the madly accelerated times in which we live, Ed already seems like a relic from a different geological age. If only there was some sort of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdStone\">Rosetta-type stone</a> that might be discovered to help us decipher the ancient times from whence he hails.</p> <p>At least celebrities are leading the lives of anonymity they have always claimed to crave, a piece of wish fulfilment that has forced them to emerge only hourly to invade their own privacy with Instagram videos of them failing winsomely at basic household tasks. If you\u2019ve caught any of these, you\u2019ll be enjoying what amounts to an emergent \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m cleaning!\u201d genre, though will likely side with the washing machine in any content labelled #mywashingmachinehatesme.</p> <p>The question on much of the media\u2019s lips this week has been: how long will the lockdown last? You wonder what\u2019s behind the government\u2019s refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of \u201cmany weeks more\u201d. An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had \u201cmade us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives\u201d. Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmdfoster/status/1248253551689773057\">points-based immigration planning</a>, which ranks many of the same \u201cessential workers\u201d somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry \u201cHave you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?\u201d. Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: \u201cThere will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.\u201d Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness.</p> <p>One of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we\u2019ve committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they\u2019re the generals. So let me be clear that I\u2019m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service.</p> <p>But when we\u2019re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act \u2013 and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it\u2019s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government\u2019s advisers reportedly surmised the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-path-speci/special-report-johnson-listened-to-his-scientists-about-coronavirus-but-they-were-slow-to-sound-the-alarm-idUSKBN21P1VF\">British people would never accept a lockdown</a>. It\u2019s \u2013 how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? \u2013 OK to wonder if we might have expected better.</p> <p>Instead, though, there\u2019s a sort of meth-assisted Boys\u2019 Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \u201cletters of last resort\u201d, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It\u2019s an interesting question, isn\u2019t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain.</p> <p>Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it\u2019s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event.</p> <p>Maybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn\u2019t happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It\u2019s funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alain_Tolhurst/status/1248261411303759872\">Thursday\u2019s clip of the Northants police chief</a> threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people\u2019s shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential. What can you say? In the spirit of national togetherness, my main takeout from this is that we should really commit to a Eurovision entry next year.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

We all have newfound respect for supermarkets, though, not simply because visiting one is now the going-out equivalent of hitting a nightclub. I truly salute the staff for adapting to the exhausting demands of our new reality, as well as relaxing their rules on letting in single men. Plus it\u2019s a novelty to meet a breed of doorman who isn\u2019t going to end up in a news report concluding with the words \u201cthe trial continues\u201d. That said, we must as always make a distinction between the supermarket workers and the supermarket bosses. Tesco took \u00a3585m bailout tax relief, and promptly paid \u00a3635m dividends to its biggest investors, some of which are the richest institutions on Earth. In other business news, despite more than 300,000 inquiries, just 2,500 government-backed loans have been granted . You might have been surprised to learn the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was surprised to learn banks weren\u2019t lending, despite the fact he\u2019d told them to. Alas, the thing about the banks is that you can\u2019t bank on them. The Conservative party\u2019s relationship with the banks is basically Dot Cotton\u2019s relationship with her son, Nick. Maybe he\u2019s changed this time, you know? Labour news continues to have all the reach of a secret diary. Newly elected leader Keir Starmer has brought back Ed Miliband, the man famously identified as a chaos harbinger by David Cameron. Which has turned out to be rather like being identified as slightly creepy by Jimmy Savile. But for better or worse, Miliband\u2019s highest-profile outings in recent years have been as pixels in the notorious Cameron tweet. In the madly accelerated times in which we live, Ed already seems like a relic from a different geological age. If only there was some sort of Rosetta-type stone that might be discovered to help us decipher the ancient times from whence he hails. At least celebrities are leading the lives of anonymity they have always claimed to crave, a piece of wish fulfilment that has forced them to emerge only hourly to invade their own privacy with Instagram videos of them failing winsomely at basic household tasks. If you\u2019ve caught any of these, you\u2019ll be enjoying what amounts to an emergent \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m cleaning!\u201d genre, though will likely side with the washing machine in any content labelled #mywashingmachinehatesme. The question on much of the media\u2019s lips this week has been: how long will the lockdown last? You wonder what\u2019s behind the government\u2019s refusal to give a straight answer along the lines of \u201cmany weeks more\u201d. An aversion to spoilers? Maybe it welcomes the distraction. On Thursday, Dominic Raab intoned that this crisis had \u201cmade us think long and hard about who the key workers are in our lives\u201d. Not that hard, as it turned out. Also on Thursday, the government sneaked out its points-based immigration planning, which ranks many of the same \u201cessential workers\u201d somewhere between convicted foreign sex killers and people who tick yes to the visa inquiry \u201cHave you ever been involved in preparing an act of terrorism?\u201d. Or to put it the way the official Home Office guidance prefers: \u201cThere will not be an immigration route specifically for those who do not meet the skills or salary threshold for the skilled worker route.\u201d Forgive me if even mentioning the people getting us through it constitutes some kind of crisis faux pas. For some, ignoring the realities low-paid nurses or delivery workers face is key to the spirit of national togetherness. One of the unwritten conventions of British public life is that no matter how ill-advised or ill-prepared any military action we\u2019ve committed to is, once it starts, you get behind the troops. The government keeps telling us this current crisis is a war, so in the spirit of speaking their preferred language, I guess the troops are us. Not them: they\u2019re the generals. So let me be clear that I\u2019m very much getting behind us, and thank us for our service. But when we\u2019re seeing 1,000 casualties a day - just as we did in Italy while our generals were still deciding not to act \u2013 and grave problems with testing, and NHS staff are crying out daily for the right kit, it\u2019s certainly worth considering whether the troops were led into an ambush. The people dying right now are likely to have caught the disease in the middle of last month (between 11 and 21 March), when the government\u2019s advisers reportedly surmised the British people would never accept a lockdown. It\u2019s \u2013 how to put this blandly enough not to offend the free-speech snowflakes out there? \u2013 OK to wonder if we might have expected better. Instead, though, there\u2019s a sort of meth-assisted Boys\u2019 Own quality to some of the more obsessive lines of inquiry. This week, there was some focus on whether Dominic Raab had written the so-called \u201cletters of last resort\u201d, replacing the versions of them Boris Johnson wrote when he took office, which contain instructions for who takes military charge in the event of the nuclear obliteration of the government. It\u2019s an interesting question, isn\u2019t it? A thousand people are dying every day and some members of the lobby would very much like to know if Mr Raab has written to a submarine captain. Then again, given the seismic collapse in ad revenues, it looks like all of us journalists are going to need to retrain into different careers after this, so it\u2019s probably good to showcase alternative skill sets. On this evidence, a few would make excellent submarine crew, because they seem pretty relaxed about waiting to find out what the fuck happened until six months after the event. Maybe at some subconscious level, people thought this level of fatality was something that just couldn\u2019t happen in the UK, like winning the Eurovision song contest or becoming a police state. It\u2019s funny how quickly you go from the old certainties to mildly watching Thursday\u2019s clip of the Northants police chief threatening to get his officers to search the contents of people\u2019s shopping baskets for items he deems non-essential. What can you say? In the spirit of national togetherness, my main takeout from this is that we should really commit to a Eurovision entry next year. \u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist",

I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.\u201d</p> <p>Crocombe was the real cook at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jul/19/ghost-stories-british-authors-imaginations-sarah-perry-mark-haddon\">Audley End House in Essex</a> between 1880 and 1884, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way.</p> <p>Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. \u201cShe was a real person, working in the kitchen, and people can relate to her \u2026 she\u2019s not a monarch.</p> <p>\u201cI make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.\u201d</p> <p>The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance.</p> <p>For example, <em>turbot \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise</em> sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery maid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water.</p> <p>Once that\u2019s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve.</p> <p>Hipperson admitted US audiences \u201creally did not like\u201d the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get much further away from mac and cheese.\u201d</p> <p>Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRI9LHBOpk0\">queen drop biscuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKPTUxoBw88\">cheese seftons</a> and, this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. \u201cSome of them are trickier, like the apple dumplings, but they are just divine.\u201d</p> <p>Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger <a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/history-at-home/\">History at Home</a><a href=\"https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/history-at-home/\"> hub launched this week </a>by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets.</p> <p>All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. \u201cFor me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is all in one place and we are planning new content.

Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours).</p> <p>Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, butter, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more.</p> <p>Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again.</p> <p>Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c/350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzhQO46suYw\">A YouTube video of Mrs Crocombe making the saffron buns is available.</a></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2020 because an earlier version omitted a reference to when to add the butter in the method for the saffron buns recipe. It was further amended on 15 April to note that there is a video demonstration of the recipe available.</p>",

I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.\u201d Crocombe was the real cook at Audley End House in Essex between 1880 and 1884, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way. Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. \u201cShe was a real person, working in the kitchen, and people can relate to her \u2026 she\u2019s not a monarch. \u201cI make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.\u201d The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance. For example, turbot \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery maid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water. Once that\u2019s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve. Hipperson admitted US audiences \u201creally did not like\u201d the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t get much further away from mac and cheese.\u201d Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the queen drop biscuits, cheese seftons and, this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. \u201cSome of them are trickier, like the apple dumplings, but they are just divine.\u201d Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger History at Home hub launched this week by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets. All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. \u201cFor me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is all in one place and we are planning new content. It really helps, I think, to remember that there is so much more outside our own four walls, it is all still there.\u201d How to make saffron buns \u2013 the Victorian way Ingredients: Makes 10-12 buns Flour \u2013 250g/9 oz/2 cups Sugar \u2013 55g/2 oz /1\u20443 cup Salt \u2013 a pinch Yeast \u2013 4g dried or 10g fresh Milk \u2013 90ml/3 fl oz/\u00bd cup, slightly warmed Eggs \u2013 1 egg, lightly beaten Currants \u2013 55g Spices/cinnamon, cloves and mace \u2013 a pinch of each Lemon \u2013 the zest of \u00bd lemon Caraway seeds \u2013 (optional) \u00bc tsp Butter \u2013 30g/1 oz/\u00bc stick Lard \u2013 30g/1 oz/1 tbsp Saffron \u2013 pinch, soaked for 2 hours in 2 tsp warm milk To glaze: 1 egg Pinch of salt 1 tbsp milk Method: First, make a basic bread dough. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours). Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, butter, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more. Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again. Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c/350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter. A YouTube video of Mrs Crocombe making the saffron buns is available. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 April 2020 because an earlier version omitted a reference to when to add the butter in the method for the saffron buns recipe. It was further amended on 15 April to note that there is a video demonstration of the recipe available.",

Worse, the US supreme court will have their back.</p> <p>Make no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday \u2013 Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote \u2013 wasn\u2019t just a warning sign for November\u2019s elections. It was Republicans\u2019 dress rehearsal.</p> <p>It\u2019s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It\u2019s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well.</p> <p>That\u2019s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn\u2019t favor either party \u2013 just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It\u2019s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/23/17383400/vote-by-mail-home-california-alaska-nebraska\">a study</a> of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing about the Wisconsin election was normal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Republicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">recently told</a> Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates \u201ctremendous potential\u201d for voter fraud and mused that \u201cfor whatever reason, [it] doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans\u201d. Georgia\u2019s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it \u201cwill certainly drive up turnout\u201d and \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d.</p> <p>But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party\u2019s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president\u2019s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2020/03/24/senate-section/article/S1976-3\">insisted</a> they \u201chave no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people\u201d. Election assistance funding, <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/voting-2020-election-republicans-977435/\">sniffed</a> his colleague Marsha Blackburn, \u201chas nothing to do with Covid-19\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/wisconsin-republicans-primary-democracy\">Yes, Wisconsin Republicans used the pandemic to stop people from voting | Lawrence Douglas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday, however, the connection between voting and the virus should have been clear enough for even a Republican senator to see. When Robin Vos, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/people-are-going-to-die-in-this-election-wisconsin-votes-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-1\">Nothing</a> about the Wisconsin election was normal. Not voters in homemade masks, not the immunocompromised woman whose requested absentee ballot never arrived voting in full bubble wrap, not the plaintive signs that read \u201cthis is ridiculous\u201d. But the five conservative Republican appointees to the US supreme court, <a href=\"\u201cfundamentally%20alter%20the%20nature%20of%20the%20election\u201d\">concerned</a>, ruefully and almost comically, that something might \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the election\u201d, stepped in \u2026 on the side of forcing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to brave the pandemic and vote in person.</p> <p>Along a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.)</p> <p>That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba346222d338b382cb9711af8f23a217b6996860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba346222d338b382cb9711af8f23a217b6996860/0_0_4413_2648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities.</p> <p>The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018\u2019s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the \u201cpresumption of good faith\u201d \u2013 even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018\u2019s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision \u2013 Common Cause v Rucho \u2013 which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elected Republican officials have proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">Wisconsin can purge</a> about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November \u2013 keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state\u2019s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes.</p> <p>Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November\u2019s election doesn\u2019t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there\u2019s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it\u2019s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/wisconsin-coronavirus-black-communities-inequality\">Wisconsin's primary subjected people of color to yet another Covid-19 disadvantage | David Bowen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it\u2019s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail. Mislead the public with fictional claims of voter fraud that get amplified on Fox News and by Russian bots on Twitter. Finally, count on John Roberts and the court\u2019s partisan 5-4 majority to backstop any efforts to make free, fair and safe voting more difficult.</p> <p>If this plays out according to the Republican plan, it will plunge this nation from an unprecedented public health crisis into a dark constitutional emergency that threatens the legitimacy of the White House, the courts and American democracy itself. That\u2019s a frightening sentence to write. But it\u2019s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power. They have used a pandemic to suppress votes.</p> <p>The warning sirens are real. The dress rehearsal is over.

The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It\u2019s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well. That\u2019s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn\u2019t favor either party \u2013 just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It\u2019s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: a study of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade. Republicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump recently told Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates \u201ctremendous potential\u201d for voter fraud and mused that \u201cfor whatever reason, [it] doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans\u201d. Georgia\u2019s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it \u201cwill certainly drive up turnout\u201d and \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d. But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party\u2019s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president\u2019s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso insisted they \u201chave no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people\u201d. Election assistance funding, sniffed his colleague Marsha Blackburn, \u201chas nothing to do with Covid-19\u201d. On Tuesday, however, the connection between voting and the virus should have been clear enough for even a Republican senator to see. When Robin Vos, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear. Nothing about the Wisconsin election was normal. Not voters in homemade masks, not the immunocompromised woman whose requested absentee ballot never arrived voting in full bubble wrap, not the plaintive signs that read \u201cthis is ridiculous\u201d. But the five conservative Republican appointees to the US supreme court, concerned, ruefully and almost comically, that something might \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the election\u201d, stepped in \u2026 on the side of forcing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to brave the pandemic and vote in person. Along a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.) That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto. The Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities. The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018\u2019s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the \u201cpresumption of good faith\u201d \u2013 even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018\u2019s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision \u2013 Common Cause v Rucho \u2013 which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary. Gerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether Wisconsin can purge about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November \u2013 keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state\u2019s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes. Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November\u2019s election doesn\u2019t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there\u2019s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it\u2019s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November. The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it\u2019s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail. Mislead the public with fictional claims of voter fraud that get amplified on Fox News and by Russian bots on Twitter. Finally, count on John Roberts and the court\u2019s partisan 5-4 majority to backstop any efforts to make free, fair and safe voting more difficult. If this plays out according to the Republican plan, it will plunge this nation from an unprecedented public health crisis into a dark constitutional emergency that threatens the legitimacy of the White House, the courts and American democracy itself. That\u2019s a frightening sentence to write. But it\u2019s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power. They have used a pandemic to suppress votes. The warning sirens are real. The dress rehearsal is over. There are barely 200 days until election day.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown is facing its biggest test yet amid rising temperatures at the start of the Easter bank holiday weekend as police mobilised to stop getaways to second homes and a government \u201cStay Home Save Lives\u201d message was targeted at younger men in particular. A multi-pronged policing response included stopping caravans and those suspected of going to second homes, patrols of urban parks and rural beauty spots, as well as Ministry of Defence police boats engaging with people on beaches through loudspeakers. Celebrities including the England rugby head coach, Eddie Jones, the TV presenter Emma Willis and the former boxer David Haye have been deployed as part of a government-sponsored social media campaign. Men aged 18 to 35, who are among the most likely to be in breach of social distancing guidelines, are understood to be a particular focus of the campaign, which also targets the broader population. As well as warning that people face being fined \u00a360 on the spot by the police if they fail to follow social distancing from strangers, the appeal strongly focuses on saving lives by reducing the impact on the NHS. There was an early indication that an Easter getaway might not materialise as images released by the location technology firm TomTom showed a dramatic fall in traffic levels for London, Manchester and Birmingham on Thursday compared with the equivalent day last year. But concerns about the coming days were heightened by new data, based on people who consented to having their movements tracked by Google, showing that visits to parks increased last weekend compared with two weeks ago. Chief nursing officer Ruth May spoke at Friday\u2019s Covid 19 Downing Street briefing of her \u201cenormous frustration\u201d at how some people were clearly not respecting social distancing or coming out in large numbers and said she had seen a \u201chorde\u201d of cyclists crossing Westminster Bridge as she made her way to the event. She added: \u201cThe reason it\u2019s also frustrating is that there are still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work.\u201d It came amid warnings that some police forces could move to an \u201cenforcement phase\u201d from a current approach of just issuing advice to people breaking rules, and the first minister of Wales said restrictions could get worse if people flout social distancing rules. Dr Paul Cosford, medical director for Public Health England, called for people to stay at home over Easter because social distancing measures are working. \u201cPeople are complying [with the measures] in a very large majority and the impact that is having is that transmission is much, much less than it would otherwise be,\u201d he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain. A picture was meanwhile emerging of differing police responses, sometimes guided by their demographics and relationships with local communities. In London, where the Metropolitan police is understood to be taking a less hands-on approach, in contrast to forces in other parts of the country, action nevertheless included the closure by local authorities of a pitch and putt course in Queen\u2019s Park due to people sunbathing and gathering in groups of more than two. In Wales, where police had said that some visitors were travelling along B-roads at night to evade them - officers were investigating reports that second homeowners have been sending ahead their luggage using courier services so that if they were stopped in their car on the way they could plead innocence. Police were stopping drivers on their way south through Conway on Friday to check they were not holidaymakers heading for the Llyn Peninsula, Anglesey or any other popular tourist destination. Some English incomers still managed to get through. S4C Welsh television featured a stand-off between an angry local resident and a couple staying at an Airbnb property in Snowdonia. \u201cHow dare you come to this village and dare spread this, there\u2019s a lot of old people here and sick people. How stupid are you?\u201d shouted the local resident at the couple, who had travelled 182 miles from Oxford in the south of England to Penmachno, near Betws-y-Coed in Conwy. At lunchtime on Friday, Lancashire road police reported a \u201cnoticeable increase\u201d in traffic. \u201cPlease ask yourself if your journey is essential. We\u2019ve engaged and educated a number of you today but the message remains @stayhomesavelives\u201d the force tweeted. They also reported stopping a driver who had travelled more than 20 miles to Lytham, near Blackpool, \u201cto buy Easter eggs\u201d. Cumbria roads police said it had also only used \u201cwords of advice\u201d by midday on Friday, tweeting \u201cthe fells and lakes will be here when this is over\u201d. In North Yorkshire, police in Scarborough tweeted photos of a deserted seafront as well as the near-deserted A64 to Malton. In Merseyside, local officers reported New Brighton promenade was also empty. But social media also underlined the problems of policing. Cambridgeshire police deleted a tweet saying they were patrolling around supermarkets, insisting it was not monitoring what people were buying, while South Yorkshire police apologised after a video circulating on social media appeared to show an officer reprimanding a man for using his own front lawn. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK? \u2022 This article was amended on 10 April 2020.

      "bodyText": "A Yanomami teenager has reportedly died after contracting Covid-19, further fuelling fears over the disease\u2019s potential to decimate indigenous communities in the Amazon. The victim \u2013 who health authorities named as 15-year-old Alvanei Xirixana \u2013 died on Thursday night after spending almost a week in intensive care in Boa Vista, a Brazilian city near the Yanomami\u2019s Portugal-sized reserve. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper reported that Xirixana was from Rehebe, a village along the Uraricoera River which wildcat goldminers use to illegally access the mineral-rich territory. The website Amaz\u00f4nia Real said the village\u2019s 70 or so members had been isolated, as well as the victim\u2019s parents, five health workers and a local pilot. It was not clear how or where the teenager, who reportedly lived outside the reserve, had become infected, although reports have suggested Yanomami leaders suspect illegal gold prospectors could be responsible for bringing coronavirus into their 26,000-strong community. The teenager\u2019s death has rekindled painful memories for the Yanomami as well as fears over the coronavirus\u2019s potential to wreak havoc on indigenous communities across South America. Carlo Zaquini, an Italian missionary who has worked with the Yanomami in Brazil for more than half a century, watched Yanomami communities brought to their knees during the 1970s and 1980s by epidemics caused by an influx of roadbuilders and gold miners. \u201cIt was like driving a bulldozer into a glass factory. Everything was shattered. It was one epidemic after another,\u201d Zaquini, 82, remembered of that period. \u201cIn some of the villages I knew measles killed 50% of the population. If Covid does the same thing it would be a massacre,\u201d he added. Brazilian health authorities have so far detected 24 suspected coronavirus cases among the country\u2019s 850,000-strong indigenous population, according to the official news agency, Ag\u00eancia Brasil. \u201cIndigenous people have lived with epidemics brought by the white man since the 16th century,\u201d columnist Bernardo Mello Franco wrote in Brazil\u2019s O Globo newspaper this week. \u201cNow, with the arrival of coronavirus, the threat is back.\u201d Up to 20,000 illegal goldminers called garimpeiros are believed to be working in the area inhabited by the Yanomami along Brazil\u2019s border with Venezuela. Sofia Mendon\u00e7a, a Brazilian public health physician who works with indigenous communities, said their eviction was essential if indigenous lives were to be saved. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get these people out of the [indigenous] areas the chance of contagion is much greater,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a warned. Zaquini said he hoped health authorities were better prepared to protect the Yanomami than during past epidemics, with dozens of health posts now existing within their reserve. \u201cThere are some things in the past that left me traumatized and I hope these things don\u2019t repeat themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I view the current situation with real, real pessimism.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The most deprived Londoners would be disproportionately affected by park closures if lockdown measures on public green spaces were increased, Guardian analysis has found. Londoners living in deprived areas and those from BAME backgrounds share less space and have less access to private gardens and public parks, according to an examination of mapping data. A third of all land in the wealthiest 10% of London wards was taken up by private gardens, while in the poorest 10%, just over a fifth was found to be taken up by garden space. That suggests people in the most deprived areas would be disproportionately affected by further park closures if lockdown restrictions became more severe. At least three boroughs have imposed partial park closures, in addition to shutting outdoor gyms and playgrounds, at some point during the UK\u2019s lockdown period. A further 17 have issued warnings to residents that parks will be closed if government guidelines are not followed. Current government guidelines say people should only leave their house for exercise once a day, and keep 2 metres apart from others at all times. London is the UK\u2019s most densely populated region and the lockdown has led to pressure on public green space. Scenes of sunbathers in Brockwell Park in south London on 4 April led to a temporary closure of the park and police also reported moving more than 100 people from Primrose Hill. The analysis is based on data which categorises the total land area of a ward into its uses, including domestic garden space. It shows that the most affluent decile of wards had the highest proportion of private garden space, and the most deprived decile had the lowest. Population density was also greatest in the poorest deciles meaning more people share less space. Meredith Whitten, a postdoctoral fellow at the LSE\u2019s school of geography and environment, said access to green space was vital for public health. \u201cEven before the pandemic, there was an increasing focus on research on the physical and mental health benefits of green space. \u201cBeing near green space makes us move more and that has benefits. Having access to nature gives us a sense of calmness and tranquility ... that helps with reducing the stress that comes especially from urban living.\u201d In the poorest decile, around half the residents were BAME on average, more than double the proportion in the richest decile, where 20% were non-white. A similar trend is apparent when looking at access to public parks and green space. Again, the wealthiest wards had the greatest proportion of public space on average at 35% compared to 25% in the most deprived. Whitten said there were similar trends during the 19th century. \u201cIn the Victorian era, the wealthier classes had their squares and gardens but the working class didn\u2019t have any because they lived in very crowded, often slumlike conditions.\u201d \u201cThe Victorians recognised they needed to provide some access to nature and that\u2019s really how the public parks movement in Britain started.\u201d Tower Hamlets council closed Victoria Park for a period but has now reopened it with limited hours. On 27 March, Hammersmith &amp; Fulham council reversed its decision to close parks following a government announcement of new emergency laws. As of 8 April, the vast majority of London councils were advising residents that parks remained open. However, more than half of the 33 councils had issued warnings, stating that if people did not follow government guidelines, the situation would be reviewed. Figures released by Google last week show that footfall in London parks on 29 March was down by approximately 59% compared to activity in January and February 2020.. Methodology Data on the percentage of gardens for each ward area was taken from the 2005 Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government report, Land Use by Borough and Ward, the most up-to-date measure available publicly. A 2018 report published by the Mayor of London\u2019s office states broad land usage categories have stayed roughly the same since 2002. Data on the percentage of parks for each ward area was taken from the 2015 Greater London Authority report, Ward Profiles and Atlas as were the percentage of BAME residents and population density folr each ward area, which date to 2011 and 2013 respectively. All deprivation comparisons are based on the 2015 deprivation data at ward level for 2015 as published by Public Health England. (The 2015 data does not give a London region deprivation score, therefore the median deprivation score has been used for comparison). Because of differences in ward boundaries between 2005 and 2015, the analysis is based on 483 of 659 areas (or 73%) of London boroughs.",

Clearly it\u2019s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,\u201d she added.<br></p> <p>Meanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights.</p> <p>It says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights.</p> <p>However, in a conference call between the government\u2019s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country.</p> <p>Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: \u201cI know the British high commission has been working very hard on this.

      "bodyText": "The shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, is demanding an immediate meeting with the head of the Foreign Office as thousands of British nationals remain stranded abroad two weeks after Dominic Raab unveiled his \u00a375m coronavirus rescue mission. Nandy\u2019s office has let the foreign secretary know they are seeking a meeting with the permanent secretary \u201cas an absolute matter of urgency\u201d, a spokesman said after a conference call with 70 MPs and staff to discuss the continuing repatriation crisis. MPs expressed concern about Britons stranded in India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, which closed its borders two weeks ago. They also expressed frustration that 11 new rescue flights were being laid on for India while none were being planned for Pakistan, where it emerged there could be as many as 20,000 stranded Britons. During the call there were also complaints that the Foreign Office was fobbing off politicians who were making representations about their constituents with stock emails and an \u201cauto-response\u201d saying emails were not being monitored. Planes organised by the government have already been organised for Peru, Ghana, Algeria, India, Nepal and South Africa, with Ecuador and Bolivia also on the list. There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina. A retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in C\u00f3rdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires. After protesting on Twitter that there were no connections to the capital because of the lockdown, the embassy tweeted details of a transport company \u201cthat has worked with other embassies, good luck!\u201d, she said. \u201cIf other countries are contracting companies to transport its nationals to airports for flights home, why isn\u2019t ours? Clearly it\u2019s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,\u201d she added. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights. It says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights. However, in a conference call between the government\u2019s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country. Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: \u201cI know the British high commission has been working very hard on this. They said that there\u2019s going to be a series of more flights. They\u2019re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.\u201d He added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the \u201clack of faith\u201d in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. \u201cThey felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place. So they were saying essentially the only option is PIA.\u201d Afzal Khan, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said that British nationals in Pakistan were \u201cstill having to pay for the chaotic mismanagement of PIA and the British repatriation effort\u201d, in a letter to Raab. A spokesperson for the FCO said Lord Ahmad and the high commission were \u201cin close contact with their Pakistani counterparts as well as PIA, the national carrier, to ensure that commercial flight routes are kept open between our two countries.\u201d It added that there had been 17 flights between Pakistan for the UK since 4 April, \u201creturning in excess of 6000 people to the UK\u201d. It said it was working hard with the local authorities to keep flights \u201coperational in the coming days.\u201d",

And it really did strike me then, that crime was an issue that progressives had to be serious about.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cResponsibility is the word that I would use,\u201d he said. \u201cResponsibility to others, to society: there is such a thing as society, there\u2019s no doubt about that.

      "body": "<p>Shall we check in with the Guardian\u2019s setters? How are they doing, and how is the lockdown affecting their puzzles?</p> <p>Looking at the first question first, you will be happy to hear that, on the whole, everyone seems largely well. As with the nation at large, we see the Great Time Availability Disparity. Some setters, with day jobs or volunteering cancelled, have far more time than usual to ponder crosswords. And many of the younger ones are having to schedule slots for setting where allowed by their new jobs as home-based teaching assistants.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">Mask</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2013/jul/11/crossword-blog-meet-setter-otterden\">arade</a>, for example, had a very busy 2019 doing double the usual amount of work in his other capacity as proof-reader for puzzle magazines in an effort to have six months\u2019 worth of crosswords ready for Brexit (\u201cwhere is that now, news-wise!?\u201d, he adds) and now has \u201ca lovely hiatus\u201d offering puzzle time. Not so, though, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2014/nov/03/crossword-blog-meet-the-setter-picaroon\">Picaroon</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>With a seven-year-old to look after and educate full-time while simultaneously keeping up the day job from home, I\u2019m definitely not one of those people who suddenly have more time on their hands \u2013 quite the opposite!</p> </blockquote> <p>What about the puzzles themselves?

      "bodyText": "Shall we check in with the Guardian\u2019s setters? How are they doing, and how is the lockdown affecting their puzzles? Looking at the first question first, you will be happy to hear that, on the whole, everyone seems largely well. As with the nation at large, we see the Great Time Availability Disparity. Some setters, with day jobs or volunteering cancelled, have far more time than usual to ponder crosswords. And many of the younger ones are having to schedule slots for setting where allowed by their new jobs as home-based teaching assistants. Maskarade, for example, had a very busy 2019 doing double the usual amount of work in his other capacity as proof-reader for puzzle magazines in an effort to have six months\u2019 worth of crosswords ready for Brexit (\u201cwhere is that now, news-wise!?\u201d, he adds) and now has \u201ca lovely hiatus\u201d offering puzzle time. Not so, though, for Picaroon: With a seven-year-old to look after and educate full-time while simultaneously keeping up the day job from home, I\u2019m definitely not one of those people who suddenly have more time on their hands \u2013 quite the opposite! What about the puzzles themselves? A big national event usually appears in puzzle form, if not in full-on themed crosswords, then via amusing references in clues. But it\u2019s a long time since we wryly noted that coronavirus is an anagram of carnivorous (a fact that, Paul tells us, his vegan neighbour is keen on). At any rate, many papers avoid references to illness in their puzzles whether there\u2019s a pandemic or not; for some it\u2019s a \u201cmust not\u201d and for others a \u201cshould not\u201d, a mixture a little like government advice. Nutmeg recently reworked a grid to remove an unfortunate \u201cendemic\u201d in a corner: an example of a word which can have a completely non-medical meaning but which nobody wants to come across when trying to relax with a crossword during a lockdown. As Puck says: I was toying with a related theme just recently, but decided that solvers probably need cheering up rather than being reminded of the very thing that crossword solving might provide some relief from. On which subject, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear that Tramp is getting into a Columbo box set and keeping an eye on whether it offers up any themes. But, apart from the time factor, is setting more difficult? The answer seems to be that it\u2019s not as easy \u2013 but still possible \u2013 to get into an playful frame of mind. Here\u2019s Boatman \u2026 While I\u2019m busy with the mechanics, I can forget about the situation for a while, and I can find my way into whatever part of my brain it is that creates the fun. \u2026 Puck \u2026 Creativity and, in my case, Puckishness are essential to the process in order to stay fresh and witty, and those are inevitably a little harder to come by at present. \u2026 and Pasquale: I set to entertain, whatever people\u2019s circumstances. So the supply keeps coming: trickier challenges for those who want a crossword to take up a chunk of their day and more straightforward puzzles for brand-new solvers (if you\u2019re one, we prepared a starter pack last month). The links above, by the way, are to the interviews we\u2019ve done with setters from all the broadsheets. We\u2019ll sign off with a message from Paul: Sending love and virtual hugs to all solvers.",

      "bodyText": "The UK has recorded its worst daily fatality rate yet during the coronavirus crisis, a higher number in a single day than any experienced by Italy or Spain. A record 980 people were announced to have died in UK hospitals in the preceding 24 hours, taking the total to 8,958. That number is exceeded in Europe only by France, where 1,417 died in a single day \u2013 a figure that unlike the UK included deaths in care homes not recorded on previous days. Italy announced its record daily death toll of 971 almost two weeks ago, against Spain\u2019s worst day of 950 coronavirus deaths. While Europe\u2019s worst-hit countries are now past the peak of the outbreak, the UK\u2019s figures are expected to continue to rise for at least two more weeks. Announcing the fatalities, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cWe never forget that behind this number, behind each one is a name, a loss, and a family that will never be the same again.\u201d He added: \u201cThis Easter will be another test of the nation\u2019s resolve. It\u2019s a time of year when people normally come together. But however warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home.\u201d The figures come on the day the global death toll from coronavirus approached 100,000. The UK\u2019s official daily death toll, which is calculated on a different timescale from separate figures announced in all four countries, exceeds Thursday\u2019s daily total of 881 and the previous record tally of 938 announced on Wednesday. Earlier on Friday, NHS England confirmed a further 866 hospital deaths, taking England\u2019s total to 8,114. In Scotland, which also counts deaths outside hospitals, there were 48 more deaths making a total of 495. Wales recorded 29 more hospital deaths, taking its total to 315, and there were 10 more deaths in Northern Ireland, bringing its total to 92. The figures in England showed a particularly sharp rise in fatalities in the Midlands, where the number of victims rose by more than 84% from 124 to 229 in 24 hours. London remains the worst-hit region with 249 deaths. The patients who died in England were aged between 27 and 100. All but 56 of them had underlying health conditions. The latest data came after it was confirmed that coronavirus had claimed the life of a 10th NHS doctor. Dr Fayez Ayache had retired as a Suffolk GP but had been working part-time in North Clacton, Essex, until three weeks ago. He had also volunteered to help refugees from his native Syria. He died on Wednesday after being diagnosed with pneumonia and Covid-19. Dr Sharif K Al-Ghazal, a consultant plastic surgeon at Bradford Royal Infirmary, paid tribute on behalf of the Syrian British Medical Society. He said: \u201cDr Fayez was a kind-hearted man who always went out of his way to assist his patients, even at great personal cost.\u201d His daughters Layla and Katie said: \u201cHe was an incredible and amazing doctor having worked as a GP, ENT consultant and surgeon in the NHS and private sector for over 40 years. We are truly devastated and will miss him dearly. He was a true foundation in our lives.\u201d Asked how many healthcare workers had died during the crisis at the daily Downing Street press briefing, Hancock passed the question to chief nursing officer Ruth May who said that internal numbers were available for nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants and doctors but that it would be \u201cinappropriate for me to go into numbering them\u201d without family permission. Like Ayache, all the other nine doctors to have been named as victims of coronavirus have been from BAME backgrounds. They are: Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, a consultant urologist at Homerton hospital in Hackney, east London, who had pleaded with the prime minister for more PPE. Sami Shousha, a British-Egyptian doctor who specialised in histopathology, and had worked for more than 40 years at Charing Cross hospital in west London. Dr Edmond Adedeji, an A&amp;E doctor at the Great Western hospital in Swindon. Syed Haider, a British Pakistani retired GP, who had worked at the Valence medical centre in Dagenham, east London. Anton Sebastianpillai, a consultant geriatrician who trained in Sri Lanka and died in Kingston hospital, south-west London, just over two weeks after completing his last shift there. Dr Alfa Saadu, a retired medical director born in Nigeria, who had been volunteering at his local hospital in Welwyn, Hertfordshire. Amged el-Hawrani, an ear, nose and throat consultant of Sudanese descent who was working at Burton hospital near Derby. Adil El Tayar, a surgeon from Sudan, who died after volunteering in A&amp;E departments in the Midlands. Habib Zaidi, 76, a GP with Pakistani origins, who died after showing \u201ctextbook symptoms\u201d of the virus.",

      "bodyText": "In tough times, people with money show their true colors. For Rihanna, that meant donating $2.1m to domestic violence charities in a crisis that has threatened to keep victims trapped inside with abusive partners. Cardi B\u2019s donations came in the form of a giveaway: she promised to donate $1,000 every hour for the next 42 days, a total of about $1m, to people badly affected by the pandemic. She came up with the idea after getting messaged by fans in need, but, she warned: \u201cI\u2019m going to make sure you really do need it, so don\u2019t be lying so you can lend your fucking boyfriend some money!\u201d Taylor Swift has similarly, although more quietly, been donating $3,000 packages to fans in need. As thousands across the US struggle to sign up for unemployment cheques, it is no wonder that celebrities feel obligated to step up.

      "bodyText": "The UK experienced its deadliest day of the pandemic yet with a record 980 more deaths \u2013 exceeding that of Italy at its peak of 969 deaths on 27 March \u2013 and bringing the total number of deaths in hospital of patients who had tested positive for Covid-19 to 8,958. The public has been told the country remains \u201cin a dangerous phase\u201d of the outbreak and has not yet reached its peak \u2013 so physical distancing this Easter bank holiday weekend remains crucial and people must stay at home. Boris Johnson is now \u201cable to do short walks\u201d as his condition during his coronavirus recovery \u201ccontinues to improve\u201d. The prime minister is back on a ward at St Thomas\u2019 hospital after being discharged from the intensive care unit. The health secretary Matt Hancock said that from next week every NHS hospital will receive a supply of PPE on a daily basis. Over the next three weeks, he said an online portal will be rolled out allowing primary care and social care to request PPE from a central inventory, so demand can be tracked and deliveries made according to need. Downing Street said it was \u201cconfident\u201d the housing secretary Robert Jenrick had complied with physical distancing rules after he came under fire for driving 40 miles to drop off food and medicine to his elderly parents. Nicola Sturgeon pledged a bailout for Scottish universities, a day after St Andrews revealed it had lost \u00a325m and faced its worst financial crisis in recent history. And in a difficult day for police forces, Cambridgeshire police caused a stir online after a now-deleted tweet appeared to suggest that officers were checking \u201cnon-essential aisles\u201d in a local supermarket, while South Yorkshire police apologised after a man was reprimanded for using his own front lawn. This came a day after comments by a chief constable from another force \u2013 in which suggested officers could search shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules \u2013 were deemed \u201cnot appropriate\u201d by Priti Patel, the home secretary. A huge thank you to everybody who got in touch today with a story and to all of you for reading along. That\u2019s it from us here on the UK side, but you can head over to our global live blog where our worldwide coverage of the coronavirus pandemic continues. The latest episode of Anywhere but Westminster went up today and it\u2019s an especially eye-opening one. John and John speak to families who are on the brink, grappling with the everyday experience of living in confinement, dealing with everything from autism to living in small houses and properties without outdoor space. You can watch the full episode here. The NHS coronavirus volunteer scheme is taking longer than expected to implement, according to officials. The extraordinary willingness of the British public to help out has been considered one of the few bright points of the crisis, but only a few thousand tasks are being carried out around the country so far. Neil Churchill, an NHS England administrator working on the volunteer team, posted on a Facebook group for volunteer helpers on Friday morning, explaining \u201cwhy it\u2019s taking time for you to get your first tasks\u201d. The official said there were \u201ca lot more [identities] to check\u201d than initially expected \u2013 and it was only after that that \u201cwe ask people in the NHS to make referrals\u201d. But NHS staff have also been slow to call for the volunteers to assist. Churchill said: It just takes time for info to get through to every GP practice, every pharmacist and every discharge team. Referrals are in the thousands right now and we expect they will be in the tens of thousands soon. Volunteers are registered on the Good SAM app and when signed in wait for an alert indicating a job needs doing. But Facebook groups for volunteers are full of people expressing disappointment that they had waited hours without being tasked. Melanie Westell, 41, from Kent, said she had signed up to volunteer two and a half weeks ago and last Friday she was told she had been accepted. She added: I have been on duty for 87 hours over the last week and have not had anything come through. The only thing I can put it down to is that when doctors or pharmacies, for example, refer vulnerable people to the service they have to fill out a form for all the services they may need. Hancock said there is still a \u201clot of work\u201d needed to reach the target he set of 100,000 daily Covid-19 tests by the end of April. Asked how he expects to achieve this, he said: We have had a huge number of offers from people who have come to us and said: \u2018We can turn this facility, which hasn\u2019t been a coronavirus testing facility, into a coronavirus testing facility\u2019. Hancock said some of the centres that had been offered included ones the government did not know about. We are working 24/7 to hit it [the target]. Everyone can see the daily trajectory, which has almost doubled since I set it, and we\u2019ve clearly got a lot of work to get to our 100,000, but we are on track. Asked about reports that he has been holding meetings of between 10 and 20 people in person, Hancock said he works from home when he can and is making use of video-conferencing. He said that when he does come into the office he follows social distancing guidelines. Van-Tam was asked about oxygen supplies and he said: This disease is unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in my almost three decades in medicine. It is really, really unusual in that the requirement for patients who are hospitalised to have oxygen is very high. And sorry to go back to the hosepipe analogy, but if everyone in a certain area turns on their sprinkler in the garden at the same time, the water pressure will go down for a while. He said it is a \u201clogistic and engineering challenge\u201d to create thousands of extra intensive care beds with ventilators, and also secure the oxygen supply that goes behind them. Now, I do know that there has been absolutely enormous logistic work 24/7 behind the scenes to keep hospitals supplied with oxygen. But you\u2019re right, we have seen one or two reports of where something has gone slightly wrong with an oxygen supply. And that\u2019s partly about the stress on the whole engineering system of a hospital, that is required to produce the oxygen demands for double the number of ventilators, and we have to learn as we go along, and our engineers have to adapt. And you are going to see these isolated incidents and we\u2019ll learn from them. But oxygen supply \u2013 you\u2019re right to flag it, it\u2019s an unprecedented demand with this virus. May called it \u201cfrustrating\u201d that people were continuing to flout physical distancing rules. She said: The reason that is frustrating is because there\u2019s also still occasions where my colleagues are getting abuse from their neighbours for driving off to work. Sam, a nurse in a mental health organisation in the east of England, had grief from her neighbours because she was travelling to work. Our nurses, our healthcare staff, need to be able to get to work, it\u2019s right and proper they do, but I ask of everybody: please stay at home, save lives and protect my staff. Van-Tam said scientists had been clear that closing borders \u201cwould not work\u201d as a measure to prevent the ingress of coronavirus into the UK. I understand the point you\u2019re making and I see where you\u2019re coming from, in terms of when we get this under control, doesn\u2019t that change the situation? But [it] won\u2019t go from a position of widespread community transmission amongst our own people to a position of zero transmission amongst our own people, which of course was the case back in December 2019. We will likely go back to low levels of transmission and the virus will continue to be here, in and around us in our communities, I suspect, for a very long time, even if we can keep the levels right down. They are taking questions from the media now. On the issue of face masks, Hancock said the government will \u201cfollow the science\u201d, which he says states they \u201cdon\u2019t have a material impact outside of those settings which Public Health England have set out\u201d. He added: But also here we are following the international evidence too. The World Health Organization have themselves looked into this very recently, and came to the conclusion that face masks should be saved for those in health and care who really need them. So it is not a risk-free option to have face masks, for everybody to wear face masks, because that means that it\u2019s harder to get hold of face masks for the people where the science says that they\u2019re needed. The number of deaths is broadly in line with what is happening in other countries, Van-Tam says. With the number of people in critical care, the overall trend has remained the same, says Van-Tam. There may be some signs that the curve is beginning to bend but it\u2019s premature, absolutely, to say that we\u2019re at a peak. The push that we\u2019re making with social distancing has to continue. With the number of people occupying hospital beds who have been diagnosed with Covid-19, the curve is \u201cbending\u201d, says Van-Tam. It\u2019s impossible to say that we have peaked. London has gone down in the last day, but the north-east and Yorkshire have gone up. The curve is beginning to bend and your hard work is beginning to pay off, but this needs to continue. The number of new cases is at a high level and the number is varying day by day, says Van-Tam. We are in a dangerous phase still and I must reinforce to you that this is not over. Van-Tam is speaking now. Transport use has stayed at low levels in all forms. This must keep going \u2013 \u201cthis is not over\u201d, he said. We need to take the pain now to make the gain in a few weeks\u2019 time. Alongside the new NHS hospitals in London, Birmingham, Manchester, Harrogate and Bristol; Sunderland and Exeter will soon have Nightingale hospitals too. May is speaking now. She says staying at home is saving lives. The actions that you take this weekend will have consequences. Remember the sacrifices that others are making. Countless others will not be home this weekend because they are working in a hospital or in a social care setting saving patients\u2019 lives. She also thanks key workers for the work they are doing that allows health and social care staff to keep working. Hancock has once again urged people to stay at home this bank holiday weekend. Stay at home, because spreading the virus today risks lives tomorrow. Do it for the NHS, do it for the people you love. The third strand is future supply \u2013 ensuring there is enough PPE to see us through the crisis, Hancock says. New supply lines are being established from across the world, buying directly from manufacturers according to standards. Domestic production will also be ramped up. Many businesses have come forward to repurpose their production lines to meet needs. In particular, Hancock has thanked Burberry, Rolls-Royce and McLaren, Ineos and Diageo for their efforts. He invites other businesses to contact the government if they can do the same. The second strand is distribution \u2013 making sure that anyone who needs PPE can get it at the right time. Hancock called this a \u201cherculean logistical effort\u201d bringing together the NHS, private industry and the armed forces to create a \u201cgiant\u201d PPE network on an \u201cunprecedented\u201d scale. That network is now delivering daily to the frontline. So far more than 752m pieces of PPE have been delivered. Every NHS hospital has received a supply of PPE once every 72 hours \u2013 from next week this will be daily. In the coming weeks, PPE delivery systems will be scaled up further. Over the next three weeks an online portal will be rolled out allowing primary care and social care to request PPE from a central inventory, so demand can be tracked and deliveries made according to need. Today the government has published its PPE plan, which has three strands, Hancock said. Strand one is on guidance \u2013 who needs PPE, when they need it, and who does not. That means only using it when there is a clinical need and not using more than is needed. The new guidance included the clinical advice that many items of PPE can be used for a whole session, not be changed after treating each individual patient. Outside of health and social care, the best way to protect yourself and others is regularly hand-washing and keeping 2 metres apart \u2013 and to stay at home. Hancock has set a goal that everyone working in a critical role will get the PPE they need to protect themselves. He noted the huge international demand on global supplies of PPE. There is also high demand for PPE within the UK, so everyone should use \u201cno more and no less\u201d than what they clinically need. In normal times the NHS supply chain for PPE provides equipment to 233 hospital trusts. Right now, 58,000 separate health and care providers need PPE. Yesterday, Hancock said he opened a mega-lab in Milton Keynes. Two more are on track, one in Cheshire and Glasgow. AstraZeneca and GSK are opening another in Cambridge. There are now 15 drive-through testing centres for NHS staff including in Glasgow, London and Plymouth. Hancock said there is now capacity for \u201call key social care staff and NHS staff\u201d who need to be tested to get tested. The health secretary said that yesterday, 19,116 tests were carried out across the UK, from which 5,706 people tested positive. The number of people currently in hospital with symptoms is 19,304. 8,958 people who tested positive have died in hospital, an increase of 980 since yesterday. This is more than the worst daily rise recorded by Italy, which was 969. The prime minister\u2019s condition \u201ccontinues to improve\u201d and he wants to thank the entire clinical team who have treated him. Hancock is speaking now. This Easter will be another test of the nation\u2019s resolve, he said. However warm the weather, however tempting your local beach or park, we need everyone to stay at home. The government\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefing is due to begin shortly and will be fronted by the health secretary Matt Hancock. He will be joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam and the chief nursing officer for England, Ruth May. Boris Johnson has \u201cbeen able to do short walks\u201d as part of his recovery and has spoken to his doctors and medical team to thank them for \u201cthe incredible care\u201d he has received, Downing Street has said. The prime minister is back on a ward at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital after being discharged from the intensive care unit where he was being treated for Covid-19. A No 10 spokesman said: The Prime Minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery. He has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease. United Private Hire Drivers, the representative body for UK private hire drivers, has initiated a legal challenge against what it has deemed central and local government failure to protect licensed private hire drivers and their passengers from Covid-19 infection. Launching an emergency Crowdjustice campaign to raise the funds necessary to apply for a judicial review at the high court, the organisation has called on the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to urge the government to introduce safety standards for private operators. UPHD said the action comes after one member died after contracting coronavirus and another two have become seriously ill. Ayub Akthar passed away last week due to complications relating to Covid-19. Abdurzak Hadi became seriously ill but is now recovering. Transport for London and other licensing authorities have not insisted upon separation distance requirements, PPE, detailed safety protocols and driver training. In contrast, UPHD highlights how the Dutch authorities have introduced emergency regulations to control the risk of Covid-19 infection in cabs by enforcing a 1.5 metre separation, mandatory use of personal protection equipment, sanitation routines and limiting service to one passenger at a time. Private hire operators such as Uber and Addison Lee have targeted NHS staff with free and discounted journeys during this time of pandemic. UPHD said although this is welcome, it presents significant mutual risk for passengers and drivers and, as a result, regulatory action is needed to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus in licensed private hire vehicles. James Farrar, chair of UPHD, said: In an industry rife with worker rights abuse, the government must act quickly to put appropriate controls in place and if they do not, we will take legal action. We are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure no driver dies because of corporate greed and regulatory inaction. Simon Cox, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers, said: Key workers and members of the public making necessary journeys need private hire drivers. The health secretary has made draconian regulations against shops and members of the public, to protect the right to life. But no regulations have been made against private hire operators like Uber. They operate without any laws requiring them to protect their passengers and drivers from Covid-19. The government must urgently use its powers to regulate private hire operators. Experts in the US have warned of a potential rise in suicides as a result of public health measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Writing in the journal JAMA psychiatry, the team said their warning does not mean such measures should not be used, but it is important suicide prevention is enhanced. Among their concerns, the trio of researchers from the University of Washington and Florida State University note the impact of the coronavirus on businesses, writing: Economic downturns are usually associated with higher suicide rates compared with periods of relative prosperity. Experts have already warned that mass unemployment in the US could result in widespread mental health problems. The new article also reports that physical distancing could be problematic. \u201cSuicidal thoughts and behaviours are associated with social isolation and loneliness,\u201d they write, adding that approaches to staying connected through technology should be promoted. Among other concerns, the trio suggest measures such as school closures may make it harder for people to keep appointments for mental health treatment \u2013 with the team arguing for interventions including better screening of Covid-19 patients for mental health problems, and remote suicide prevention schemes. Additionally the team say healthcare professionals have an elevated risk of suicide, and call for greater support for those on the frontline of the pandemic. It is not the first time such concerns have been raised. In the UK it was announced this week that NHS staff will be offered free mental health support to help them cope with the situation. Responding to the article, an NHS England spokesperson said: The NHS is pulling out all the stops to respond to the biggest global health threat in a century, while also ensuring people can still access the mental health services they need. There is capacity across the country to treat all those needing mental health support and 24/7 NHS crisis lines are ramping up across the country so we urge everyone to continue to come forward for essential and urgent care. Prof Rory O\u2019Connor of the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory at the University of Glasgow welcomed the study, saying it chimed with ongoing work in the UK. But, he said, mental health consequences of the pandemic will not affect everyone equally: Those who are already vulnerable, including those who are socially disadvantaged and those with pre-existing mental health conditions are most at risk of suicide. We need to prioritise and shield the most vulnerable. O\u2019Connor added that his own team has launched a study to identify who is most at risk of suicide and how to mitigate such risks. Rises in suicide and self-harm are not inevitable, especially if we act urgently. I urge the government to ensure that protecting the mental health of the nation is central to the Covid-19 response. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted 24 hours a day on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.org, while they have also put together information regarding mental health during the coronavirus outbreak here. Following a degree of backlash after The Times reported (paywall) that our elected representatives are being offered \u00a310,000 for additional office costs incurred as a result of the pandemic by parliament\u2019s expenses authority, several MPs have taken to social media to clarify that this money is not \u201cextra pay\u201d for politicians. Rather than being to help MPs work from home \u2013 as it has been framed in some reports \u2013 the money is available to be claimed in order to buy additional equipment such as laptops and printers for staff who are now having to work from home during the lockdown. This is on top of the \u00a326,000 MPs can claim to cover office costs. The extra funds will be available until March 2021 and come with a relaxation of the rules on evidence of purchases. In guidance, published last month, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) said it was \u201ccommitted to supporting MPs and their staff to carry on with their work as far as possible\u201d during this \u201cuncertain and challenging time for the country\u201d. This thread is from the Labour MP Nadia Whittome: This is from the Conservative MP Julie Marson: This is from the Labour MP Wes Streeting: And this is from the Conservative MP George Freeman: For added context on how parliament works, the Spectator\u2019s Isabel Hardman has also written this: Another 29 people are reported to have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total there to 315. There have been 502 new cases of the virus, bringing the total number of confirmed positive tests to 4,591, Public Health Wales said. In other very British news, South Yorkshire police have apologised after a video circulating on social media appeared to show an officer reprimanding a man for using his own front lawn. The force said on Twitter, where the video has so far been viewed more than 340,000 times, that the officer in the video had good intentions but was \u201cill-informed\u201d. It comes on the same day Cambridgeshire police had to clarify that their force was \u201cnot monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets\u201d after an earlier now-deleted tweet attracted backlash for appearing to suggest officers had checked \u201cnon essential aisles\u201d in a local Tesco. This is all just a day after the chief constable of Northamptonshire police, Nick Adderley, was criticised for the controversial suggestion that officers could start searching shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. Adderley has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary Priti Patel, who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. Afternoon! This is Lucy Campbell again, bringing you up to speed with all the latest UK coronavirus developments for the rest of the day. I\u2019m extremely grateful to everyone who has already been in touch with tips and suggestions. If you\u2019d like to contact me please feel free to email me at lucy.campbell@guadian.co.uk or via Twitter @lucy_campbell_. Police Scotland has issued more than 500 fines to people ignoring the lockdown since the emergency powers came into force two weeks ago, and arrested others who refused to follow instructions, the chief constable, Iain Livingstone has said. Taking part for the first time in Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference, Livingstone said the fines and arrests came after police had to break up house parties or large groups of people gathering outside. In the first week, the force issued just over 140 fixed penalty notices, implying non-compliance has increased nearly three-fold in the last week. The fines cost \u00a360 or \u00a330 if paid within 28 days. \u201cWith the continued support and cooperation of our fellow citizens, Police Scotland will explain the legal instructions, encourage compliance and when necessary, enforce the law,\u201d he said. Policing of this would be \u201cfair, reasonable and proportionate,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cDo not make personal exemptions bespoke to your own circumstances.\u201d Asked by the BBC if she was worried people were growing fatigued by the lockdown, Sturgeon said: \u201cOf course I worry about people tiring of this. I think we all find it more difficult to comply with these rules as every day passes. \u201cThat will get more difficult as we go into spring and the weather gets better, the nights get lighter. Nobody is under any illusion about that. But that is why it remains important for all us in government to be very clear with people: we will not ask you to do this for a minute longer than necessary.\u201d Asked why the former chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, was not fined for twice breaching the lockdown and only given a verbal warning, Livingstone said the police rightly accepted her immediate acknowledgement she had broken the law and would not do so again. NHS England has announced 866 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 8,114. Of the 866 new deaths announced today, 117 occurred on 9 April while 720 took place between 1 April and 8 April. The remaining 29 deaths occurred in March, including one on March 5. A further 10 people with coronavirus have died in Northern Ireland, taking the total number of deaths to 92. There are 112 newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland - now a total of 1,589. The first minister of Wales said the coronavirus lockdown could be \u201ctightened\u201d in Wales, including people not being allowed outside to exercise, if there was \u201clarge-scale flouting\u201d of the guidelines. Speaking at a press briefing in Cardiff, Mark Drakeford added fines could be increased but said he did not want to toughen measures because the rules are \u201can enormous burden\u201d already. We check every weekend with the police whether they think they have the powers they need and it\u2019s important they are satisfied because they have to administer them. The position last weekend was that their powers are sufficient, but if they come to me to say they need more powers, they will get more powers. He added: \u201cThe small minority [who flout rules] need to get the message and get into line.\u201d The first minister also said he would only relax physical distancing measures \u201cwhen the evidence shows it is safe\u201d, and that such a decision would not be based on any similar actions in England. We will do the right thing for Wales at the time that it is right for Wales and we won\u2019t be doing that by looking over our shoulders at what others are doing. Drakeford also denied announcing an extension of the lockdown in Wales on Wednesday to \u201cget in ahead of Westminster\u201d. He said: \u201cI wanted to be honest with people here in Wales and did not want them going into Easter believing they were on the final stretch and come next week the restrictions would be all over.\u201d This is Jessica Murray, taking over the blog while my colleague Lucy has a short break. A 30-year-old man has been charged with fraud after allegedly spending six free nights at a hotel by claiming to be an NHS worker. Ben Quince checked into the Casa hotel, in Chesterfield, at the end of March on a floor reserved for NHS staff, Derbyshire police said. He stayed there for six nights and allegedly told staff he worked in the A&amp;E department at Chesterfield Royal hospital. The hotel is offering complimentary lodgings for health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the force said. Quince, of no fixed address, has been charged with fraud by false representation. He appeared at Southern Derbyshire magistrates court on Monday and was bailed to appear again at a later date, police said. Nicola Sturgeon has pledged her government will pass on the full Scottish share of any Treasury bailout for universities but said they had to have further discussions on changing the way the Scottish Funding Council, which finances the sector, funds teaching costs for students and research. The first minister was asked about the Guardian\u2019s report that Prof Sally Mapstone, the principal of the University of St Andrews, had warned her university was facing its worst financial crisis in recent history and had already lost \u00a325m. She said the urgent priorities were confronting the public health challenge and the preservation of life, but added: The scale of the financial crisis facing universities is well understood by ministers. We clearly want our universities to remain where they are right now, which is at the very forefront of global education in the quality of the education and research that they\u2019re renowned for. Unlike in England and Wales, Scottish universities do not charge Scottish students tuition fees but instead get a per capita sum from the SFC to cover teaching costs; universities say that figure is less than the costs of teaching Scottish students. They use fees paid by foreign students to balance the books. University principals say they could lose between 50% and 100% of their income from foreign students, if they refuse to come to the UK because of the pandemic. Universities are now planning to put their staff on furlough; some predict smaller universities will be merged or shut down. They are pressing the Scottish government to consider higher per capita payments for teaching and an increase in research and postgraduate funding to protect their finances. Sturgeon said: There are some very complex discussions we need to have. We know exactly what the universities have been asking for and will continue to have those discussions. Here are all the main points from this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing from my colleague Frances Perraudin, including an update on the prime minister\u2019s health and the wider government response to the pandemic. On Boris Johnson\u2019s condition, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The prime minister is back on a ward and continuing his recovery, which is at an early stage. He continues to be in very good spirits. There will be just one daily update about his condition now he is out of intensive care. Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, the spokesman said: The PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team. The PM is enormously grateful for the care he is receiving from NHS staff. I am told that he was waving his thanks at all of the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit to the ward. Asked about criticism of the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick for travelling more than an hour to visit his parents at the weekend, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said: The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys that he made. We are confident that he complied with the social distancing rules. Like everybody else ministers have been told to work from home wherever possible and not make unnecessary journeys. As part of the coronavirus response there will be occasions where ministers have no option but to work from Whitehall. In the event this is required and the rest of the household is living elsewhere, it\u2019s not an \u2018unnecessary journey\u2019 for them to travel to rejoin their family. Asked to comment on Cambridge police saying they would monitor \u201cnon-essential\u201d supermarket aisles, he said: We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock, obviously providing its legal to do so. The Foreign Office announced this morning that it had chartered 12 more flights to bring more than 3,000 stranded UK nationals back from India. Asked if the government accepted that it had been too slow to get UK citizens home from India, the spokesman said: We are facing an unprecedented situation. The FCO has been working hard to bring British nationals back from countries around the world. The spokesman said that in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday, 15,194 coronavirus tests were carried out in NHS and PHE labs, including on 2,970 NHS staff. Also on Thursday, 29m PPE items were delivered to 268 trusts and organisations. 10,000 mechanical ventilators are currently available and another 1,500 on order, due to arrive shortly. The NHS has \u201csufficient spare capacity\u201d in terms of intensive care units and ventilators, he said. Firefighters are to fit face masks for frontline NHS and clinical care staff and deliver medical supplies to hospitals and care facilities during the coronavirus outbreak. Firefighters have been wearing respiratory masks for decades and the specialist trainers are certified to undertake the face-fit testing. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) recently warned that the incorrect fitting of a protective face mask can increase the risk of Covid-19 infection and \u201clead to immediate or long-term ill-health or can even put the ...wearer\u2019s life in danger.\u201d Under the agreement, firefighters could also assist in the delivery of PPE to the social care sector which has reported critical shortages of essential equipment. Matt Wrack, Fire Brigades Union (FBU) General Secretary, said: This public health crisis will require all of us to do our bit to get through it, and firefighters rightly want to play as much of a part as they can. Under a previous agreement, fire and rescue personnel were already able to assist in delivery of essential items like food and medicines to vulnerable people, drive ambulances, assist ambulance staff and move dead bodies, should the outbreak cause mass casualties. Firefighters will maintain their core responsibilities while providing the services specifically related to the pandemic. The agreement made by the FBU with fire chiefs provides for the arrangements to be in place for an initial two months but the time period can be altered if all parties agree. Downing Street said shops that are allowed to remain open during the lockdown are free to sell whatever items they have in stock. Asked about the idea of police patrolling particular supermarket aisles to see what people are buying, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We set out a list of shops which could remain open and if the shops are on that list then they are free to sell whatever they have in stock. Obviously provided it\u2019s legal to do so. Commenting on the news that the housing secretary Robert Jenrick visited his elderly parents, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said they were \u201cconfident\u201d he had complied with physical distancing rules: The secretary of state has set out in two different statements the reasons for the journeys which he made. We\u2019re confident that he complied with the social distancing rules. The spokesman added Jenrick has said himself that his wife and children consider their home in Herefordshire to be their family home. Asked about cabinet ministers commuting to and from London, the spokesman said: Like everybody else, ministers have been told to work from home wherever possible, and not make unnecessary journeys. As part of the coronavirus response there will be occasions when ministers have no option but to work from Whitehall. Boris Johnson is in \u201cvery good spirits\u201d after being discharged from intensive care, Downing Street said at the daily lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said he was \u201cenormously grateful\u201d for the care he had received from NHS staff at St Thomas\u2019 Hospital. He said: I am told he was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward. Hopefully it was clear to the staff that he was waving his gratitude. The spokesman said he was not aware of any contact between Johnson and No 10 and that it was too early to say how long he would need to remain in hospital. He added: The prime minister is back on a ward and continuing his recovery which is at an early stage. He continues to be in very good spirits. Decisions such as this will be on the advice of his medical team. They have given him brilliant care. A man has been arrested in Greater Manchester after biting a female police constable and punching two other officers as they enforced lockdown. Police were called on Thursday evening to reports a man was causing a disturbance on Drake Street in Rochdale. Attending officers had attempted to explain to the man that in line with government guidelines around Covid-19, people shouldn\u2019t be going around to other people\u2019s homes, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. While trying to engage with the man, two officers were both punched. One of those officers - a 21-year-old female police constable - was then seriously bitten and had to attend hospital, before being discharged to recover at home. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage, domestic violence assault, section 18 assault with intent to resist arrest and regulation 8 of the Health Protection Regulation 2020 (Coronavirus). He remains in police custody for questioning by officers. Superintendent Richard Hunt, of GMP\u2019s Rochdale district, said: No police officer should have to come to work \u2013 doing a job to serve and protect our communities \u2013 and be assaulted. It is absolutely disgusting that my officer was faced with this last night and all of our thoughts are with her as she rests at home. This is a particularly challenging time for everybody at the moment, made worse by something so mindless like this. Having spoken to the officer earlier this morning, she said that last night\u2019s incident was a stark contrast to the support she has felt over the past few days, whilst she has been delivering Easter eggs to local children whilst out on patrol. This just goes to show that thankfully, incidents like this are not a reflection of the vast majority of the public, who are showing great support to us. A further 48 people have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the total there to 495, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced. Sturgeon said there are now 5,275 confirmed positive cases in Scotland, up by 318 from 4,957 the day before. There are 207 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of five on Thursday. Sturgeon added that 1,832 people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Two-thirds (67%) of nurses do not feel they have access to sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE), a survey has found. Almost 3,500 nurses responded to the survey by the Nursing Standard, with just under a third (31%) saying they have used their own money to buy PPE, and one in 10 (11%) saying they resorted to making their own. One nurse described the PPE provision as shocking, inadequate and unsafe. She added: I feel I am risking my life to care for these patients. And I feel I will be the next victim of Covid-19 if it carries on. There were also complaints that masks, when available, are frequently poorly fitting and out of date, some by years. Almost all staff said they have access to disposable gowns (96%) and gloves (98%) but only 27% reported access to fluid-resistant surgical masks and 42% reported they had eye protection through a visor or goggles. Public Health England has different advice for the level of PPE staff should wear in different settings but some healthcare workers have suggested the guidelines do not offer them sufficient protection. Additionally, NHS staff have been complaining for weeks about low specification PPE and shortages of protective equipment. NHS England and ministers have insisted that shortages of PPE are due to distribution issues rather than inadequate supplies and that they have scaled up deliveries over the past three weeks. The leaders of the UK\u2019s headteachers\u2019 unions have told the Department for Education they hope schools in England can reopen even for as little as two weeks before the summer holidays, if scientific advice allows. The leaders of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) told Schools Week that the DfE had shown interest in the idea of pupils having a limited return before the end of July, rather than waiting until the new school year starts in September. Geoff Barton, general secretary of ASCL, said it would be \u201cincredibly cathartic\u201d if schools could reopen, and helpful for pupils preparing to move from primary to secondary school. But he cautioned: What we don\u2019t want to do is spook people into thinking schools will be opening in a week\u2019s time, but we do need to start thinking about what it would look like if we get children back for a few weeks in the summer term. Of course, it won\u2019t happen if the public health experts say the timing isn\u2019t right, but it\u2019s something to start thinking about. Paul Whiteman of the NAHT said: Once the scientific advice is that schools can return safely, they should do so, even if it\u2019s for a very limited period before the summer break, as this will allow young people to reacquaint themselves with the educational environment. The DfE\u2019s position is that schools in England remain closed \u201cuntil further notice\u201d except for defined groups, and the governments in Wales and Scotland have explicitly ruled out schools reopening in the near term. A boutique hotel in Edinburgh run by one of the world\u2019s oldest medical bodies says it has now donated more than 1,000 nights of free accommodation to health workers involved in combating the coronavirus. The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd), which traces its origins to 1505 and now trains and accredits surgeons from across the world, opened its hotel Ten Hill Place next to its headquarters, Surgeons\u2019 Hall, in 2005 to raise funds. It said the hotel has made 129 bedrooms available for hospital staff, with packed continental breakfasts and free evening meals, to reduce their need to commute and help medical staff avoid other vulnerable family members in isolation. It is also in talks with Scotland\u2019s interim chief medical officer, Dr Gregor Smith, about converting the hotel into temporary hospital accommodation if the city\u2019s hospitals overflow. Prof Michael Griffin, the president of the RSCEd, said: We\u2019ve heard and seen directly from our colleagues how severe the impact Covid-19 is on our health service. Having accommodation near hospitals to rest and recover allows our colleagues to be looked after, at a time when they need the most support. Fewer than one in five healthcare workers who suspected they had coronavirus actually tested positive for the disease, according to one of the first published UK studies of mass testing on NHS workers. Scientists from Sheffield, which started testing all symptomatic healthcare workers a fortnight before much of the rest of the UK, have published research showing that 81% of staff reporting symptoms tested negative. Some 1,533 staff were tested over the two weeks from 17 March. Of these, just 282 (18%) tested positive. Five (&lt; 1%) had an indeterminate result. More than a third of staff had completed at least one shift while symptomatic. Twenty-five were nursing staff, eight were doctors, nine were other patient-facing clinical staff, nine were laboratory or secretarial staff and one worked in cleaning services. On 17 March, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (STH) started testing any staff who were complaining of an \u201cinfluenza-like illness\u201d. This was defined as anyone with a reported fever and one of: cough, sore throat, runny nose, myalgia, headache. They were directed to self-swab in the on-site assessment pods and given written and pictorial instructions to show how to do it correctly. Four times a day the swabs were transported to the laboratory at the Northern General hospital, where they were tested. The majority of test results were communicated to staff on the same or the next day. Staff with a negative test were able to return to work if they felt well enough to do so. Concluding their study, the Sheffield scientists said: In a time where healthcare systems are particularly stretched, it is important to be able to maximise the available workforce. Facilitating testing may substantially decrease absence in staff when [coronavirus] can be excluded. They added: While it is important that the provision of testing is carefully balanced with consideration of laboratory capacity, increasing laboratory capacity to allow widespread testing of NHS staff could be a vital tool in achieving adequate staffing during the Covid-19 outbreak, and reducing the risk of transmission to vulnerable patients. Earlier on in the UK\u2019s coronavirus crisis, Sheffield was one of the local authorities with the highest number of cases \u2013 a fact local virologists attributed to Sheffield testing more people, earlier, than almost anywhere else. On 1 April, a consultant virologist in the city claimed Sheffield was carrying out 10% of all tests in the UK. The public have been warned they are more likely to see police officers in masks and gloves in certain situations during the pandemic where there is considered to be a risk of transmission. Police chiefs said officers can wear fluid-resistant masks and gloves when sat in cars or vans with colleagues or when they can not keep 2 metres away from members of the public. The guidance said: It is recommended that PPE (minimum of a fluid resistant surgical mask and gloves (non-latex)) should be readily available for officers where it is necessary to deploy double-crewed patrols or in personnel carriers. They have also be told at all times they should have PPE \u2018readily available\u2019 capable of being donned quickly. John Apter, chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said the public should not be concerned if they, on occasions, see police officers wearing PPE: This is not only about protecting colleagues, it\u2019s also about protecting the public. Policing is dangerous and unpredictable but every measure must be taken to keep officers as safe as possible. Face masks, gloves and hand sanitisers are the absolute basic we would expect our colleagues to be provided with in this current crisis. The guidance was issued by the National Police Chiefs Council and College of Policing. Officers are told they should fully protect themselves if dealing with someone infected with the virus and to maintain social distancing. Chief constable Andy Rhodes, the NPCC wellbeing lead, said: We have sufficient stocks of personal protective equipment for all forces and have established a reliable supply chain to ensure it is available to forces in the quantities needed. There are \u201cheartbreaking\u201d cases of employees being made redundant after being denied help from the government\u2019s job retention scheme, Citizens Advice has said, fearing the government\u2019s \u201cbold\u201d action to protect workers during the pandemic could be undermined by confusion and \u201cpatchy use\u201d of the scheme by some employers. The charity said advisers are seeing daily cases of people who are at risk of slipping through the safety net despite potentially being entitled to support. New research by the charity shows around six million people in the UK (18% of the workforce) have had their hours cut, been laid off or made redundant. Almost four out of 10 (38%) have lost household income because of the crisis, with nearly one in 12 (8%) losing 80% of household income. Demand for its redundancy advice has doubled, with its web page titled \u201cwhat to do if your employer has told you not to work\u201d being the most-read page this month with more than 175,000 views. The charity highlighted the case of a father-of-four called Mark who returned to work as an HGV driver in February, after spending eight months caring for his daughter who is undergoing treatment for a rare cancer. In March, the family were told they needed to self-isolate as his daughter is one of the 1.5m who must be shielded. Mark was made redundant the next day as he could not return to work. He said: I spoke to my manager and explained that if someone in my home caught coronavirus and passed it on to my daughter the chances are she would die. They said that as a driver I would not be in contact with many people and could I not just self-isolate in my cabin. I said that wouldn\u2019t be possible. My family and their wellbeing comes first, so I have to accept that I no longer have a job. It\u2019s just really insensitive and feels wrong that they can let me go for following the government guidelines to shield my daughter as she is high risk. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: The government has unveiled a remarkable package of support to help people keep their heads above water during this crisis. It must now ensure employers are using this to protect their workers, as well as opening it up to cover even more people. We\u2019re already starting to see heartbreaking cases where employees have been denied help from the scheme and have instead been made redundant. While it\u2019s not clear how much of this is due to confusion, cash flow fears, or the need to downsize, we think the Government needs a clear plan to protect people if the support is not filtering through. That is the only way to reduce the burden on the benefits system, and retain the link between an employer and their staff. Costume staff from the English National Opera have turned their skills to making scrubs for medics on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic. On their GoFundMe page, organiser Sarah Bowern explains: We are a team of costume staff from the English National Opera raising money to make scrubs for our amazing NHS. The costume team for the BBC drama His Dark Materials have also so far raised more than \u00a341,000 to help dress medics and released their first scrubs this week. The team behind the campaign also worked on Downton Abbey and have been backed by actor Hugh Bonneville who tweeted: The original costume team from Downton Abbey are putting their talents to about the most important use imaginable right now. The legendary Manchester nightclub, the Hacienda, which closed down in 1997, is hosting a stay at home rave tomorrow to help keep people entertained and encourage them not to venture out over the Easter weekend. The line-up includes former Hacienda resident DJs Graeme Park, Jon DaSilva and Tom Wainwright, as well as US house music legends Todd Terry, David Morales and Roger Sanchez. The event, which begins at noon and finishes at midnight, can be watched online here. Morrisons Foundation, the charitable arm of Morrisons supermarket, has set aside a fund of \u00a3500,000 over the next three months to help charities offer additional protection, services and support to the homeless as a result of Covid-19. Rough sleepers have been identified as one of the most at-risk groups, as they are more likely to have underlying health conditions and are less able to access basic sanitation. Charities can apply online for grants of up to \u00a310,000. Charities will be able to apply for financial help to support rough sleepers, which includes supplying food and healthcare essentials. It also covers the delivery of services in hostels and shelters, including the payment for additional staff, purchase of PPE equipment and the provision of emergency accommodation. The fund will also allow charities to provide information and advice regarding health and wellbeing services and helplines. David Potts, the chief executive of Morrisons, said: Morrisons is committed to helping the most vulnerable in our society. We know that the coronavirus outbreak presents a particular risk to the homeless and we want to do our bit to help. This new fund will help charities doing vital work to care for the homeless at this critical time. Nick Connolly, the managing director of End Youth Homelessness, said: Our member charities need cash to pay for staff, personal protective equipment, food and other essentials to a level they could not possibly have envisaged a few months ago. We are so pleased this is being recognised. Further to our earlier post, Cambridgeshire police have posted another statement on Twitter to clarify that officers \u201care not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets\u201d. It said an earlier tweet (now deleted) had been made by an \u201cover exuberant officer\u201d. It caused a stir online after it seemed to suggest officers had checked \u201cthe non essential aisles were empty\u201d in a local Tesco. The force tweeted: For clarification, the force position, in line with national guidance, is that we are not monitoring what people are buying from supermarkets. This message was sent with good intentions by an over exuberant officer who has been spoken to since this tweet was published. Whilst the majority of people in our communities are abiding by the social distancing measures we have had to issue a small number of fines to those who are flouting the rules. None of these have been in relation to shopping or supermarket visits. The initial tweet had come just a day after the chief constable of Northamptonshire Police, Nick Adderley, was criticised for the controversial suggestion that officers could start searching shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. Adderley has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary Priti Patel who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. The shadow home secretary has urged the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick to fully explain himself after the Guardian revealed he had travelled more than an hour away to visit his parents at the weekend \u2013 despite warning others to stay at home during the coronavirus lockdown. The communities secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. It also emerged that Jenrick travelled 150 miles from his London property, where he stayed at the start of the lockdown, to his \u00a31.2m Herefordshire home from where he travelled to his parents. His website says he lives with his family near Newark, his constituency in Nottingham, and London. Asked whether he thought Jenrick was ignoring the government\u2019s stay at home advice, Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think that\u2019s for him to explain. As you know, the delivery of essential supplies like food and medicine to vulnerable people, vulnerable family members, would be permissible in the exceptions that there are for people to go outside. But I think it\u2019s very important now for public confidence that Robert Jenrick fully explains himself and why exactly that journey was necessary. The full story is here. A doctors\u2019 leader has insisted that GPs will visit elderly residents of care homes during the coronavirus outbreak after complaints that doctors were refusing to attend sick patients in residential care. Dozens of elderly residents, many of whom have underlying health problems and dementia, have died in Scottish care homes or fallen ill with Corvid-19, including several large clusters. Care England, the industry body, estimates up to 1,000 people have died in English care homes but have not been officially counted. The older\u2019s people\u2019s charity Age Scotland, said earlier this week it knew of cases where GPs were failing to visit care homes and insisting on doing telephone consultations or referring people to an NHS helpline. The Royal College of GPs issued a joint statement with Scottish Care, the umbrella body for care homes, on Friday to insist GPs would visit patients where necessary but confirmed the pandemic had led to a significant shift towards telephone and video consultations. Dr Carey Lunan, the chair of RCGP Scotland, and Prof Donald Macaskill of Scottish Care said the situation was worsened by a shortage of personal protective equipment; they and the Royal College of Nursing had written to the Scottish government last week to complain. Lunan and Macaskill said they knew it was \u201can incredibly worrying time\u201d for residents and their families. GPs will continue to deliver the same high level of care and support that they have always provided to their patients in care homes. GPs have had to rapidly adapt the way that they deliver clinical care in the last few weeks, with much more advice and assessment being done over the telephone or by video consulting, where it is safe and appropriate to do so. The safety of care home residents is very important to GPs, and for that reason, they would only visit in person where there is a clinical need to do so, to reduce the potential risk of bringing any infection into the home. If a face to face visit is needed, they will wear the appropriate PPE to protect staff and residents. It seems Cambridgeshire police have raised some eyebrows on social media with the news that officers attended Tesco in the village of Bar Hill this morning and checked \u201cnon-essential aisles\u201d. Judging by comments on the post on Twitter, this has left many confused over what constitutes (and who determines what constitutes) a \u201cnon-essential\u201d aisle or item. Officers have been patrolling supermarkets this morning, just a day after a chief constable was criticised for suggesting officers could search shopping trolleys if people kept flouting social distancing rules. The Northamptonshire police chief constable, Nick Adderley, has since said his use of language was \u201cclumsy\u201d after being criticised for his remarks, including by the home secretary, Priti Patel, who said they were \u201cnot appropriate\u201d. The tweet by the force\u2019s Cambridge team said: Officers visited Tesco Barhill this morning as part of their patrols around supermarkets and green spaces this weekend. Good to see everyone was abiding by social distancing measures and the non essential aisles were empty. Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, Cambridgeshire police issued thanks to a local chocolatier for an essential (?) delivery... A 460-bed Nightingale hospital for the north-east is to be built in Washington, Tyne and Wear, the Conservative MP Richard Holden has said. It is being built with the help of the army at the International Advanced Manufacturing Park in a unit that is bigger than a football pitch, and will be divided into 16 wards, which will take coronavirus patients if units in the region cannot cope with demand. The MP for North West Durham tweeted: A similar development for the south-west is being created at the Westpoint Arena in Exeter, according to reports. The NHS has already set up temporary hospitals in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Harrogate. In a separate interview this morning as he did the early broadcast round, Dr Paul Cosford said it was \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d to expect the lockdown to continue for several weeks. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: I think several weeks isn\u2019t unreasonable. Let\u2019s hope its sooner than that. All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country. He added there was the possibility the restrictions could be lifted in stages. He said: I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lifted sooner and some are lifted later. Just for now, we are getting on top of this but we have got an awfully long way to go and it is absolutely critical that we continue with all the actions that are required of us. The O2 arena in Greenwich is being turned into a training facility for NHS staff, in a bid to support the rapidly constructed NHS Nightingale hospital at ExCel London. At present, the centre is expected to operate from 12 April until 29 June \u2013 with the facility available without a hire fee. While no patients will be treated at the O2, the facility is expected to support staff training. \u201cWhile this will result in further rescheduling of events booked to take place during this period, the priority for us all at this time is to help save lives and we know our customers and partners will understand our desire to support the NHS in this way,\u201d the O2 said on its website. Dr Paul Cosford, the medical director for Public Health England, has called for people to stay at home over the Easter weekend because physical distancing measures are working. Reiterating the \u201cgood news\u201d issued by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, at the daily news briefing on Thursday, Cosford said the number of new cases looked to be starting to flatten and the number of deaths was not accelerating as fast as it would if there was \u201cuncontrolled transmission\u201d across communities. With \u201csome time yet\u201d still to go before the UK gets through the peak, Cosford said \u201cwe must carry on\u201d with physical distancing. He told Good Morning Britain: People are complying [with the measures] in a very large majority and the impact that is having is that transmission is much, much less than it would otherwise be. The most important thing now is we continue [to stay at home] so we can get through the peak and come down the other side. Good morning! This is Lucy Campbell, I\u2019ll be taking over the blog for the rest of the day. We\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK developments on coronavirus. As always, any tips, comments, advice or suggestions are most welcome. Please feel free to email me at lucy.campbell@guardian.co.uk or get in touch via Twitter, I\u2019m on @lucy_campbell_. The TV presenter Kate Garraway says her husband, who is being treated in hospital for Covid-19, is still in intensive care and \u201cvery ill\u201d. In a message read out on air by her Good Morning Britain co-presenter Ben Shephard, Garraway said it \u201cremains an excruciatingly worrying time\u201d. Her husband, Derek Draper, 52, a former lobbyist and political adviser, was admitted to hospital last Monday. Garraway praised the NHS team treating him as \u201cextraordinary\u201d, saying: \u201cI know that it\u2019s only their professionalism, dedication and bravery that has kept Derek with us so far. I also know that they are working just as hard on all the patients in their care.\u201d She added: It is hard to find the right words because thank you alone just doesn\u2019t seem enough but I do thank them with all my heart as I know Derek would also want to if he could. I also want to say thank you so much to everyone who has sent messages of support. I\u2019m sorry that I haven\u2019t been able to respond to them but I hope you understand I\u2019m focusing on Derek and my family right now. However, in quieter moments, I am seeing them and they are so comforting and wonderful to read. I am very aware that I\u2019m not the only one going through this torture, there are thousands of families everywhere worried about their loved ones and hundreds more every day too that are having to deal with the worst news that their loved ones have been taken by this horrific virus. I want to send a message of love and support to all of you going through this. You are not alone, we must all stand together and support each other. And I\u2019m praying to be able to be talking with you soon with some positive news. Love, Kate.\u201d She and Draper, who have been married since 2005, have a daughter and a son. Boris Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, has spoken of his relief after the prime minister was moved from intensive care where he was being treated for Covid-19. Stanley Johnson said he was \u201camazingly thankful\u201d for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative for the outpouring of support. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said his son must now rest to continue recovering from coronavirus. The prime minister is still being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. \u201cThis is pretty straightforward now. He must rest up. As I understand it, he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don\u2019t think you can say this is out of the wood now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d He added: \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now.\u201d My colleague, Robert Booth, also brings readers an exclusive story on today\u2019s Guardian front page detailing how hundreds of people are dying in care homes from confirmed or suspected coronavirus without yet being officially counted. He reports that more than 120 residents of the UK\u2019s largest charitable provider of care homes are thought to have died from the virus in the last three weeks, while another network of care homes is reported to have recorded 88 deaths. Care England, the industry body, estimated the death toll was likely to be close to 1,000, despite the only available official figure for care home fatalities being dramatically lower. He has also written a harrowing accompanying piece shining a light on the struggle going on inside UK care homes as they battle rising Covid-19 deaths. In one Buckinghamshire care home, in which eight patients with dementia have died in quick succession in just three weeks, he writes: Now relatives of the dying must say goodbye by phone or through bedroom windows, the solace of touch made impossible by fear of contagion.\u201d Morning folks, Simon Murphy here to steer you through this morning\u2019s UK coronavirus news. To recap, the nation was given a dose of good news when it emerged last night that prime minister Boris Johnson had been moved from intensive care where he was being treated for coronavirus. He remains at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London. Separately, the Guardian revealed that the cabinet minister Robert Jenrick travelled to visit his parents at the weekend, despite repeatedly urging the public to stay at home during the lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus. The Guardian established that the housing, communities and local government secretary \u2013 who has made media appearances urging people to save lives by remaining in their properties even if tempted to see loved ones \u2013 went to see his parents at their Shropshire home, 40 miles by road from his own. Jenrick defended himself on Twitter after a source close to him had earlier admitted that he had made the journey during lockdown conditions, but said he dropped off food and medication, and did not enter the house. The Guardian understands that the local community has been supporting Jenrick\u2019s parents by delivering groceries in recent weeks. This was not denied, though the source said Jenrick had collected and delivered medication for his parents, too. The story was followed up widely across Fleet Street, including on the front page of the Daily Telegraph: It was also taken up by the Daily Mail on its front page, focusing on Jenrick also staying at his second home. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has chartered 12 more flights to bring more than 3,000 stranded UK nationals back from India. It follows seven flights that have already been arranged between April 8 and April 12 and will bring the total number of Britons repatriated from India to around 5,000. The new flights will leave from Goa, Amritsar, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Thiruvananthapuram between April 13 and April 20 with bookings opened on Friday.",

A list of street closures will be published by Oakland\u2019s department of transportation. \u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said on Thursday. Like many Californians, Bay Area residents have flooded parks and local beaches since a shelter-in-place order took effect in mid-March, prompting officials to close parks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. City officials hope the slow streets initiative \u2013 which they are calling an emergency measure \u2013 will give residents a safe way to get outdoors for Easter weekend while area parks are restricted, but Schaaf cautioned residents on Friday that the initiative does not mean public health guidance should be ignored. \u201cSocial distancing is the only vaccine we have to fight this deadly virus,\u201d Schaff said on Friday. The news was met with resounding applause from local transportation advocates. Schaaf asked motorists to adhere to the restrictions and be extra mindful of children on the streets, reminding residents streets will still be open to local traffic. But Schaaf stopped short of enlisting police to enforce the restrictions. \u201cWe will not be giving out, at this time, citations,\u201d said the mayor, adding that people have enough to worry about amid a pandemic. Roughly 11% of the city\u2019s land is made up of 6,000 acres of parks \u2013 streets and sidewalks make up an additional 20% to 30%, said a city official, adding that the city wanted to take advantage of its space for the expected sunny, holiday weekend. The news was especially welcomein East Oakland, a neighborhood historically overlooked and impoverished, residents said at a press conference about the initiative on Friday. Many East Oakland residents continue to work, despite the shelter-in-place orders, said one community advocate, often walking to their jobs to do so. Any effort to make streets safer is good news for the community, he said. \u201cSome of us have to survive and we survive by working,\u201d he said at a Friday press conference. \u201cLiving in East Oakland, every day is an emergency.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Erienne Lette wrote to her real estate agents asking for her rent to be reduced, she wasn\u2019t expecting what came back. After her income was reduced by 35% until at least 30 June, Lette hoped she might be able to pay less than $360 a week for her studio apartment in Camperdown, in Sydney\u2019s inner west. Instead, she was warned that only a deferral of the rent, not a reduction would be considered at all. And she was also asked to fill out a form asking, among other things, whether she planned to dip into her superannuation. Lette provided proof of her reduced income and reiterated that she needed the rent reduced to make ends meet. She received a one line response from the agent: \u201cBut very much able to meet the weekly rent.\u201d \u201cThe power that they have, and the lack of power that we have, is really apparent right now,\u201d Lette tells the Guardian. Lette, 27, is among millions of renters in Australia who have seen their incomes decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. Like all of us, they are stuck in their homes \u2013 but even that is no longer set in stone. Despite the prime minister\u2019s declaration on 29 March that national cabinet had agreed to a six-month moratorium on evictions, only Tasmania has passed legislation to enact these protections. It means that tenants in the private market who are unable to afford their rent are, according to tenants groups at least, at the mercy of individual landlords. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has urged landlords \u2013 and by implication the property managers who represent them \u2013 to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Yet not all appear to be doing so. Asic last week warned agents they face up to five years jail if they ask tenants to withdraw super in order to pay the rent. Tenants Victoria\u2019s advice line, now an email service during the Covid-19 crisis, is receiving dozens of messages a day from renters worried about losing their home. Among the record of complaints, seen by the Guardian, is correspondence from a single mother who said she was threatened with eviction after losing her job. \u201cInitially they demanded full rent regardless and threatened eviction,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the eviction moratorium in place they are now offering a $10 per week rent reduction for six months. This is not sustainable especially given how difficult it is to access Centrelink at this time. I have no savings, no family, no support.\u201d A separate letter to a tenant from an agent in Melbourne\u2019s north states: \u201cDo not ask for a rent reduction or a rent freeze as we will not put these requests forward. Saving for that rainy day? You may need to dip into any savings you have.\u201d Another, to a tenant who is in rental arrears, provided some unsolicited budgeting advice: \u201cI hope that you are also doing your part in cancelling unnecessary subscriptions such as Spotify, Foxtel or Netflix or any other service that is not considered necessary at this time.\u201d The industry has condemned unusual and heavy-handed tactics, including the references to superannuation that drew Asic\u2019s attention, and has broadly warned against tarring all property managers with the same brush. But it is clear the lack of legislative certainty is having an impact. In a letter to landlords, obtained by Guardian Australia, one real estate agent, Andrew Pennisi, said they should give struggling tenants \u201ca rent rebate or food shopping voucher\u201d instead of a rent discount or forgiving rent payments. Pennisi said that \u201cgiving a discount or forgiving rent payments will void your landlord insurance\u201d. Insurance sources say this is incorrect. Pennisi told Guardian Australia agents are \u201crunning without any real guidance from government, except keep tenants in place\u201d. \u201cWe are looking forward to some guidance,\u201d he says. If the real estate industry and tenants groups agree on one thing, it is that the lack of action at national cabinet on residential tenancies has been damaging. Last month, Morrison had insisted \u201cthere is a lot of work being done together to try and get a consistent approach when it comes to residential tenancies\u201d. The states and territories had worked towards a plan of incentivising landlords to offer rent reductions by offering them cuts or waivers of land tax. But progress stalled, as states differed on the extent to which landlords should wear the losses from rent reductions, the duration of land tax reductions and practical difficulties for states where land tax is levied predominantly by local councils. The announcement of the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy program helped take the heat out of demands for support. This week, the national cabinet agreed to a mandatory code of conduct to negotiate commercial rent reductions but gave up on achieving national consistency on residential rents. Morrison declared residential tenancies were now a matter for each state and territory, and there would be no baseline beyond the moratorium on evictions. Only the ACT has announced its own scheme to offer rent reductions of up to $200 a week, funded through land tax reductions for landlords. States now say announcements will be made in due course \u2013 leaving open the prospect renters in some parts of the country will get shorter three-month rent reductions. The Real Estate Institute of NSW says the absence of clear advice from governments, aside from the need to \u201cwork it out between themselves\u201d, has led tenants to believe they do not need to pay their rent. Leanne Pilkington, the REINSW\u2019s president, acknowledges that there are tenants \u201cfor whom rent relief will be necessary, should they lose their jobs or have their work scaled back\u201d. \u201cEqually, there are landlords, typically mum-and-dad investors, who depend on the rental income to repay loans or fund their living expenses in retirement,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe plan of transferring the financial burden being experienced by the tenant to the landlord is utterly unjust.\u201d Dr Heather Holst, Victoria\u2019s residential tenancies commissioner, says the states need to implement a retrospective evictions moratorium as soon a possible. \u201cThere is a bit of a wait and see attitude, which is very hard for tenants who know that they are spending every last cent of their savings and just wondering if they are going to be able to stay or not,\u201d she told the Guardian. Holst notes, too, that the boosted welfare payments and the jobkeeper wage subsidy do not begin until late April and May respectively. \u201cThe financial clock is ticking,\u201d Holst says. \u201cSomething needs to be done very quickly.\u201d Holst acknowledges that the lack of policy certainty has also created confusion for landlords, who are also facing the prospect of a battle with their insurer. Landlords would like to claim unpaid rent under their insurance, but cannot because the insurance policies require landlords to issue an eviction notice before they can be compensated for lost rent. Nor are landlords covered for any reduction in rent they agree with tenants. \u201cObviously that\u2019s just not going to work in the current circumstances,\u201d Holst says. The real estate and insurance industries are at war over who will bear the cost of unpaid rent, which industry sources estimate could top $10bn. Insurance companies fear the states and territories might change the law to allow landlords to claim without issuing an eviction notice. \u201cThe state governments are designing the schemes and are really surprised insurers won\u2019t come to the party,\u201d an industry source says. \u201cWhy should insurers bend over?\u201d One large Victorian real estate agency, Nelson Alexander, has asked tenants to lobby their local MP to change the law to allow claims for unpaid rent without issuing an eviction notice. As the stoush escalated on Thursday, EBM Rentcover, which insures about 160,000 properties, announced it would not be taking on any new business, including from existing customers, after next Tuesday and blamed \u201ca lack information and guidance from the federal government\u201d. Some insurers are considering quitting the Australian market entirely, an industry source says. An Insurance Council of Australia spokesman says the industry supports measures to assist landlords and tenants \u201cnegotiate outcomes that help them through Covid-19\u201d. People like Lette are caught in the crossfire. Back at her studio apartment in Camperdown, she considers herself lucky to still have a job at all. Lette is also realistic. She says that if her rent is not reduced, she will be forced to consider her options. Holst, the tenancies commissioner, argues that governments should ensure that a tenant\u2019s debt from rent deferrals does not exceed their bond. \u201cOtherwise all we\u2019re doing there is deferring eviction,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople will know if they\u2019re racking up debts that there\u2019s got to be a day of reckoning too.\u201d When she spoke to the Guardian, Lette was yet to hear back from her agent. But she\u2019s cognisant of the reckoning. \u201cIn terms of wage loss, we\u2019re not going to be back paid for that,\u201d she says. \u201cHow are we expected to back pay rent that we couldn\u2019t afford then? It\u2019s only going to become rent we can\u2019t afford in the future.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re starting to find a strange new rhythm. For those of us still working, it might be a day at the desk, a walk and a family meal. There are children to supervise or entertain, calls to check on loved ones, some virtual socialising, streaming, reading and an occasional trip to the supermarket with a carefully drawn list, after calculating how best to avoid crowds. The one thing we can\u2019t do is plan. Work diaries, usually blocked out with colour-coded meetings and commitments, are bare. There\u2019s no need to consult the family calendars pinned to the fridge either, because no one is going to those birthday parties or school dates or weekends away. Having spent years downloading mindfulness apps as an antidote to our busyness, we\u2019re all trying to live in the present because the future feels even scarier than this strange closed-in life. The possibility that it could last six months or more doesn\u2019t bear too much consideration. There\u2019s plenty to worry about, of course, but without detailed, personal calculations about tomorrow, next week or next school holidays running through our heads, it really is easier to pay full attention to sunlit leaves or birdsong or cooking smells. It\u2019s unsettling, to be drifting like this, untethered from the future, but for many of us it\u2019s bearable, for now. But as \u201cthe curve\u201d flattens and fears of replicating the horror scenarios that are playing out internationally subside, we are realising that our future plans are contingent on the Big Plan, a national \u201cexit strategy\u201d that will require diabolical decisions trading off public health, social cohesion and economic disaster. And we all do need to think about that. Restrictions will continue to be necessary until a vaccine is found, but they might be dialled up or down depending on infection rates, according to a study in the Lancet, based on the experience of China. Considering this option is not accepting the stupidly brutal advocacy of an immediate end to lockdowns in the service of free market ideology, nor the horrifying social Darwinist argument that a rapid lifting of restrictions would still see the fittest survive. It\u2019s based on an assessment that we might not be able to live like this, or be able to afford to live like this, for the year to 18 months, or even longer, that it might take for a vaccine to be developed. Governments have started to talk about the trade-offs involved in various exit plan options. Understandably, they are approaching the topic tentatively, because most of us will stay housebound for months, and because of the serious potential consequences of even a small relaxation of the rules. The national cabinet has asked health experts for advice, and Australia-specific modelling. But these are not judgments that can be made solely on the basis of economic calculations or epidemiological forecasting. They are moral and ethical questions that require not just our heads but also our hearts. As Ben Doherty wrote for Guardian Australia this week there\u2019s no room for complacency in these calculations, as overseas experience shows, lifting restrictions carries a real risk of another infection wave. \u201cSingapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison \u2026 has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions \u2026 Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases,\u201d he wrote. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has started flagging the idea of trials: some states cautiously easing restrictions earlier than others, standing vigilant to reapply them if the virus spread gets out of hand. \u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things,\u201d he said this week The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, promised her state\u2019s restrictions would be reviewed regularly, but she was clearer about the trade-off; \u201cevery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die\u201d. All around the world attention is turning to these exit plan options, and the fraught questions they raise. Exactly how do we calibrate the inevitable increase in infection rate with health system capacity and how do we avoid a devastating second and third wave of disease? What preparations need to be made so we have the capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts? How many test kits and ICU beds do we need? What levels of surveillance, and what sacrifices of privacy could be involved in test-and-trace? These are high-stakes decisions for us all, and as epidemiologist Tony Blakely argued this week they need to be made with public understanding and consent. \u201cI am strongly advocating that Australia uses the next few weeks to deliberate on what we do next.

      "bodyText": "As Australia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak continues, a lot of important news has slipped under the radar. Here are the most important stories you may have missed over the past week. From the statement of George Pell\u2019s accuser to the worst coral bleaching the Great Barrier Reef has ever seen. You can find last week\u2019s list here. Revelation to be re-uploaded The ABC\u2019s major documentary series Revelation aired its final episode last Thursday, focusing on Cardinal George Pell. The reporter Sarah Ferguson obtained multiple on-camera interviews with the men who accused Pell of assault in the so-called \u201cswimming pool trial\u201d, which was discontinued by Victoria Police before it went to trial. It contained previously unpublished details of further child sexual abuse allegations against Pell. The original version was beamed out days before Pell\u2019s appeal \u2013 against a separate allegation of assault \u2013 was decided by the high court. After the verdict, it was taken offline from iView. But the ABC has stated that it stands by its reporting and the episode will be uploaded again shortly. Ferguson tweeted: \u201cWe are updating yesterday\u2019s events. Nothing has been pulled.\u201d Read the full story here. Pell accuser releases statement After Tuesday\u2019s high court decision, the man who accused Pell of sexually abusing him and another boy, released a statement urging victims of child sexual abuse to continue coming forward and to not be discouraged by the high court\u2019s decision. \u201cThere are a lot of checks and balances in the criminal justice system and the appeal process is one of them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI respect that. But the price we pay for weighting the system in favour of the accused is that many sexual offences against children go unpunished. \u201cI would like to reassure child sexual abuse survivors that most people recognise the truth when they hear it. They know the truth when they look it in the face. I am content with that. \u201cThis case does not define me. I am a man who came forward for my friend who, sadly, is no longer with us. I am a man doing my best to be a loving dad, partner, son, brother and friend.\u201d You can read his full comments here. Great Barrier Reef suffers most widespread bleaching seen yet On Tuesday marine scientists confirmed that the Great Barrier Reef had experienced its third mass bleaching in five years. And this summer\u2019s was the most widespread yet. A quarter of the reef suffered \u201csevere bleaching\u201d. And all three sections (north, central and south) experienced severe bleaching for the first time since 1998. Read the full story here. \u2018Urgent action must be taken\u2019 On that news, Guardian Australia\u2019s environment editor, Adam Morton, wrote beautifully on what this means and what we need to do to stop it happening again: The news is overwhelming and exhausting in a way it has rarely been in most of our lifetimes, but if you have five minutes of energy left this is worth your attention. Read his piece here. The surreal scenes of George Pell\u2019s final verdict And finally on Tuesday\u2019s major news from the high court, read Queensland correspondent Ben Smee\u2019s feature on how the verdict was delivered. In a Covid-19 world, the courtroom for the case of the decade was nearly empty. How did the chief justice, Susan Kiefel, even deliver the verdict, when physical distancing rules meant only three journalists and two lawyers were allowed to sit inside? Read the full story here. William Tyrrell detective found guilty of illegal recording The former detective Gary Jubelin, who led the investigation into the disappearance of William Tyrrell, was found guilty on Monday of illegally recording during the investigation. Jubelin had recorded four conversations he had with the Tyrrell family\u2019s neighbour, Paul Savage, and defended them as being made to protect himself in the event that Savage made a complaint or self-harmed. Read the full story here. Asic sues investment fund Mayfair 101 The corporate watchdog has started legal proceedings against the high-profile Queensland investment fund, Mayfair 101, who are behind the redevelopment of the resort on Dunk Island. Asic is accusing the company of misleading and deceptive advertising and wants the court to impose a fine of up to $10.5m for each breach. Read the full story here.",

      "bodyText": "Not-for-profit aged care providers say corporate suppliers of personal protective equipment are gouging them on prices, in one case doubling the cost of masks and gowns. The aged care sector, like many healthcare services, has struggled to access PPE due to global shortages caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The federal government has made it a clear priority to get government-held PPE reserves to residential aged care facilities where confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been recorded, given the vulnerability of older Australians. Other providers, where an outbreak has not yet been recorded, are being warned of significant delays in accessing the government stockpile. Now, aged care providers are also reporting price-gouging by their normal commercial suppliers. Aged and Community Services Australia (ACSA), the peak body for not-for-profit aged care providers, says it is aware of corporate suppliers making significant \u201cprice hikes\u201d on PPE. In one case, a supplier had more than doubled the cost of a box of masks from $9.60 to $22.50, and hiked the price of a box of gowns from $90 to $175, ACSA said. \u201cAt a time when we need to ensure the safety and wellness of the vulnerable older people we care for, and the staff who are caring for them, we find price-gouging for essential products unacceptable,\u201d ACSA chief executive Patricia Sparrow said. The federal government has been attempting to boost stocks of PPE in Australia by procuring more from abroad, ramping up domestic production at existing supplier Med-Con, and releasing additional supplies from the national medical stockpile. A wide range of businesses are also pivoting into PPE production, including 3D printers, distilleries, and food packaging companies. Health minister Greg Hunt this week announced 11m new masks would be allocated to health workers, including 1.7m for aged care workers. Masks were particularly urgent for parts of the aged care sector that had experienced an outbreak, Hunt said. Initial difficulties in PPE access for the sector were addressed by giving providers a direct line to the federal health department to request supplies from the national medical stockpile. Within two weeks of that direct line opening, 80 aged care providers that either had confirmed Covid-19 cases or were facing \u201csevere risk\u201d to their ability to function asked for access to supplies from the emergency stockpile. The Council on the Ageing (Cota) has reported that those receiving home care have been turning away support workers due to Covid-19-related fears. Cota Australia chief executive Ian Yates said carers were being turned away even in circumstances where they didn\u2019t need to be wearing PPE. Yates said the consequences of not receiving care were serious in many cases. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t over-exaggerate it, but it\u2019s not uncommon, because there\u2019s so much fear,\u201d he told the Guardian last week. The federal government has since issued guidelines on when home care workers need to wear PPE.",

Weighing lives against livelihoods, the financial imperative to restart shattered economies against the medical necessity to stay home and save lives. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has promised her state\u2019s restrictions on work, gathering and movement would be assessed regularly, and flagged they could start to be eased as soon as next month. But it came with this blunt caveat: \u201cEvery time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick, more people will die.\u201d All over the world there is far to go, but restrictions are easing in China, where this Covid-19 outbreak began, and elsewhere planning is under way for a world beyond the pandemic. There will be \u2013 and have been already \u2013 massive economic, societal, environmental and ideological changes wrought by the virus. But right now, the medical questions remain fundamental: when do we know Covid-19 is sufficiently suppressed, how should the restrictions and the lockdowns be eased, and what does a post-Covid world look like? The risk of relaxing too early There is danger in complacency. Singapore, for weeks the darling of international comparison, the exemplar of how best to suppress the Covid-19 pandemic, has since seen a dramatic spike in the number of infections \u2013 a 60% jump in new daily infections \u2013 and has announced a further tightening of restrictions. It will now close all schools and most workplaces \u2013 only essential services such as supermarkets and banks will stay open \u2013 for a full month. It has instituted jail terms for breaching stay-at-home orders, and banned visitors and transits through the country. Comparisons between countries are always flawed, too great are the differences in size, development, governance and demographics. Singapore, an island city-state ruled by a single party since independence, with a high-quality public health system and a population broadly adherent to government diktat, was always inherently advantaged. Japan, similarly, having kept infections low for two months, has now declared a month-long state of emergency in response to a jump in new cases. But the risk of lifting restrictions too early and unleashing a devastating \u201csecond wave\u201d applies to countries all over the world, and the international community itself. \u201cIf Australia comes out of our isolation too early, we risk an even bigger peak,\u201d Associate Prof Ian Mackay from the University of Queensland told the Guardian this week. \u201cThis could take six months or more. We cannot lose focus. It\u2019s annoying, it\u2019s hard, it\u2019s very tough for a lot of people, there is real pain and economic hardship in the community. But we have to stick it out, because if we relax too soon, and allow the virus to re-emerge and spread widely, all the pain we have suffered will have been for nothing.\u201d There is historical precedent in Australia too. In the immediate aftermath of world war one, Australia was spared the very worst of the Spanish flu outbreak, aided by geography and the delay the steam-ship age afforded a distant continent to implement a strict quarantine regime. But when the flu did break in Australia, it killed an estimated 17,000 people, and it did so in three waves, the first in February, the second in April. The third wave, in July, was by far the most deadly. \u2018What\u2019, not \u2018when\u2019 There is an argument that asking \u201cwhen\u201d the restrictions will be lifted is the wrong question. The question that needs to be asked is \u201cwhat?\u201d. What needs to be in place, what needs to have been achieved, before restrictions can be lifted? Scott Gottlieb, a former US Food and Drug Administration commissioner, co-authored a paper with the American Enterprise Institute, proposing a four-phase \u201croad map to re-opening\u201d. The first phase \u2013 in which Australia firmly remains \u2013 is to suppress the spread of the virus as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, to stop the \u201ccurve\u201d from rising to an unmanageable peak that overwhelms public health systems. If there are more critically ill people than there are hospital beds, people who could have been saved will die. This suppression involves physical distancing measures, banning gatherings, closing public spaces and potentially schools, having people work from home, and limiting all travel. In the second phase, individual states, or even cities, would be able to gradually ease certain restrictions, but only when they have built up their capacity to identify, test and isolate most confirmed Covid-19 contacts and their close contacts. The third phase would allow for remaining restrictions to be lifted when a vaccine is developed, an effective therapy is widely available, or when testing data shows widespread immunity. But there is a fourth stage too. When this pandemic is over \u2013 and it will end \u2013 governments must learn its lessons, and invest heavily in medical research and public health systems. They must prepare for the next one. A phased recovery Dr Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales\u2019s Kirby Institute, has argued for Australia to impose a \u201cshort, sharp lockdown \u2026 followed by a phased lifting of restrictions\u201d. \u201cA short, sharp lockdown of four to eight weeks will improve control of the epidemic in Australia, reduce case numbers more rapidly and bring us to a more manageable baseline from which phased lifting of restrictions and economic recovery can occur. If we fail to do this, we face continued epidemic growth, potential failure of the health system, and a far longer road to recovery.\u201d Michael J Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s health emergencies program, told policymakers each country needs to determine an individual \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d to easing restrictions on movement, travel and work. He said countries need to have come off the \u201cpeak\u201d of infections and have capacity in their healthcare systems \u2013 spare beds in hospitals \u2013 as well as good data on infections, and a low positivity rate, which is the proportion of all samples tested that return positive. \u201cYou\u2019ll see in somewhere like [South] Korea, they\u2019re testing, and 2% to 6% of their samples are positive. Last week in New York 37% of tested samples were positive. So you need to carefully look at what proportion of people that are tested are positive.\u201d But Ryan stressed that \u201cthere are no absolutes here, there are no answers\u201d. A phased lifting of restrictions appears to be Australia\u2019s likely strategy \u2013 \u201csteps and stages that we can test and reverse\u201d, the health minister, Greg Hunt, says. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, led by the country\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is working on an \u2018exit strategy\u2019 to be presented to government. But Morrison has already forecast a staggered recovery \u2013 a gradual easing of particular restrictions, in certain places, always with the caveat that they may need to be re-imposed if infections again start to rise. \u201cYou will have some jurisdictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move when others are not, then we will learn from the experience of those states that may have trialled things.\u201d Tasmania, with fewer cases, and the geographic advantage of being a small island with firmly established biosecurity laws, may be able to move sooner than other states. Those areas hardest hit by Covid-19 cases \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and south-east Queensland \u2013 are likely to be the last to be able to move. South Australia, with a relatively low number of infections, few hospitalisations, and the highest per capita testing rate in the country, could also be an early mover. Prof Lyn Gilbert, the chair of the Infection Prevention and Control Expert Advisory Group that reports to the nation\u2019s chief health officers, has warned restrictions could wax and wane with the rate of infections. \u201cEveryone wants to know when it will end, and I know the politicians are desperate to be able to say when it will end, but I think we\u2019ve got to be cautious,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the only way to do it properly is to watch what\u2019s happening and calibrate the response according to what\u2019s happening. And if restrictions were lifted, at least partly, and the numbers started to go up again, they\u2019d probably have to be reimposed.\u201d Governments across the country are bracing their populations for a \u201cmarathon not a sprint\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you when this is going to end,\u201d the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said this week. \u201cIt is not going to be over in weeks, it is going to be months and months.\u201d There is shrewd political positioning that overlays the medical advice informing this position: better to tell a population to prepare for six months of pain and proscription, and be able to lift it early, than to promise a rapid solution and find yourself apologising, and explaining why it must be extended again. And Morrison has repeatedly stressed there is no plan yet to ease restrictions anywhere. \u201cThere is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory.\u201d The Chinese experience Wuhan, the original centre of the virus, has begun to lift the restrictions on movement after 76 days of near-total lockdown. Movement is now allowed out of the city to the wider Hubei province and beyond. At its peak, Wuhan\u2019s lockdown was extreme: images of doors being welded shut to lock people in their homes shocked the world. Authoritarian regimes are less concerned about curtailing their citizens\u2019 civil liberties and human rights. Liberal democracies find such measures harder to implement: their populations will not tolerate such extreme impositions. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go and cut and paste measures from other places, which have completely different societies. I mean, in China they were welding people\u2019s doors shut,\u201d Morrison told reporters bluntly. \u201cThat might be OK with them, but \u2026 we have different ways of doing things in Australia.\u201d China has been condemned, queried and praised for its response to Covid-19: lauded for its swift and effective lockdown measures; questioned over the veracity of its infection reporting and suppression of information; and excoriated for its failure to adequately warn the world in the initial stages of outbreak and silencing doctors who tried to raise the alarm. But, even as restrictions ease across the world\u2019s most populous nation, freedom there post-Covid is scarcely unrestrained. China\u2019s Health Code app has been downloaded by 700 million people. It is mandatory in some Covid-19-affected areas, such as Wuhan, for even the most fundamental freedoms \u2013 to enter a supermarket, catch a taxi, ride the subway or see a doctor. Users must first fill in their personal details, including their national ID number, where they live and whether they have been in contact with confirmed cases of the virus. The app then gives them a colour-coded rating: green means they are free to travel; yellow mandates seven days quarantine, and red requires 14 days. The app also quietly collects \u2013 and shares with police \u2013 a user\u2019s location and travel data. The \u201cfreedom\u201d provided by this technological development has not been universally welcomed. \u201cI thought the days when humans are ruled by machines and algorithms won\u2019t happen for at least another 50 years, one blogger on Zhihu wrote. \u201cThis coronavirus epidemic has suddenly brought it on early.\u201d Human Rights Watch described the Health Code app as \u201cautomated tyranny\u201d. Digital contact tracing Singapore has also used technology to surveil its citizens, pulling together a database of personal details to allow health authorities to track potential Covid-19 carriers. The TraceTogether app sends bluetooth signals to other users, and sends messages to phones warning that a person may have come into contact with a known or suspected case. South Korea\u2019s mass testing regime and radical transparency have suppressed Covid-19 infections, but at the price of civil liberties. Granular details of new infections and their whereabouts are routinely made public, leading to doxxing of suspected cases \u2013 even speculation of alleged illicit affairs \u2013 and leading the country\u2019s National Human Rights Commission to warn that people infected by the coronavirus face a potential second trauma of harassment, ridicule and social stigma. Israel, Taiwan and Iran have also used mobile phone data to trace potential Covid-19 contacts and monitor its citizens\u2019 movements. The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has called for a pan-European mobile app to track the spread of Covid-19 instead of the current miscellany of apps used across the EU that risk breaching people\u2019s privacy. Immunity certificates In Britain, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the UK would consider \u201cimmunity certificates\u201d for its population \u2013 medical recognition that a person has had Covid-19 and recovered, and can\u2019t catch it again or spread it. Determined through a serology test for coronavirus antibodies in an individual\u2019s blood, an immunity certificate would authorise a person to return to work and re-enter the community. \u201cWe are looking at an immunity certificate,\u201d Hancock said, \u201chow people who have had the disease, have got the antibodies and therefore have immunity can ... get back as much as possible to normal life.\u201d In Germany too, one of the first countries in Europe to begin to ease restrictions, researchers are preparing a large-scale study into immunity to Covid-19, with a hope it could allow authorities to issue passes to exempt workers from restrictive lockdown measures. Such a certificate could be particularly effective in getting healthcare workers \u2013 disproportionately affected by the virus \u2013 back to work more quickly when they are no longer sick, and no longer at risk of spreading the virus. Denmark has also flagged lifting some of its restrictions, forecasting \u201ca gradual and controlled opening of society starting mid-April\u201d. Part of Denmark\u2019s plan is to offer widespread testing, not only for the virus, but also for antibodies \u2013 to determine who has immunity, and how widespread immunity is across the community. There are questions, however, over the reliability of serology testing, and whether the presence of antibodies provides long-term immunity. And there are potential risks. Immunity certificates could create a two-tiered society of those with antibodies and a measure of immunity who are allowed out, and those without who must remain isolated. They could also create a perverse incentive to catch the virus, particularly among demographics for whom the illness is likely \u2013 though not certain \u2013 to be mild. The certificates, too, have the potential to act as a reward to people who have not adhered to physical distancing and who have developed immunity but at the risk to others\u2019 health. We are not alone In the chaos of the coronavirus, the nation-state has reasserted its dominance in the global order. Country is king. The virus has spread quickly because of the modern world\u2019s breath-taking interconnectivity. But the reaction to this rapid global spread has been its antithesis: national governments and their people have turned inwards, closed borders, told foreign nationals to leave, and relied on national leaders and institutions for guidance through the crisis. Countries have formulated and run their responses on strictly national lines. Each country\u2019s \u201ccurve\u201d is compared with others as to whose measures are best (despite the inherent flaws in such comparisons). The national fight is all that most people have the energy for, the looming global calamity is almost beyond contemplation. But the international pandemic must be Australia\u2019s, must be every country\u2019s, concern. Covid-19 is no respecter of national borders. Its virulent spread across the world is evidence that the problem is a global one, and so its solutions must be too. It can only be defeated collectively. \u201cFortress Australia\u201d might work temporarily \u2013 and Australia has the inherent advantage of being a large island nation-state with borders it can lock down \u2013 but it is not sustainable for a country so dependent upon exports and imports, and a people who travel. Other countries, many in Australia\u2019s region, face a far more challenging battle than Australia does. The virus carries the potential of immense suffering. Many nations in the Asia-Pacific are densely populated, with developing economies and healthcare systems ill-prepared for the Covid-19 wave to wash over them. The physical distancing enforced by countries around the world, in reality, is a privilege of the rich. Developing nations face the far grimmer choices in choosing to lock its populations down to keep them alive or allowing them to work in order to survive. Hundreds of millions of daily wage labourers in India \u2013 a country under total lockdown \u2013 don\u2019t eat if they don\u2019t work. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has warned his country cannot enact the distancing measures it needs to without people starving. There are other challenges too. Indonesia, late to the fight against Covid-19, now finds itself battling the virus blind, because it doesn\u2019t have adequate testing. And Pacific nations are braced for the potential devastation of a virus sweeping through small close-knit communities, isolated from tertiary health care. Vanuatu, already on high alert for a Covid-19 outbreak, bore the brunt of yet another category 5 cyclone this week, a reminder that climate-influenced catastrophes remain ever-present in Australia\u2019s region. Humanity\u2019s other grave challenges have not been eradicated, only momentarily obscured, by the Covid-19 crisis. Even if Australia succeeds in bending its Covid-19 infection curve to its will \u2013 which is at this point unusual for an Anglophone country \u2013 there will be more to do internationally before restrictions such as travel bans can be lifted. Australia\u2019s success in defeating Covid-19 will depend on its willingness to help other countries less able to defeat it too. You can never be safe from a virus if you are surrounded by it.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of volunteers have come forward to help funeral homes and hospital mortuaries in New York City that have been overwhelmed by the number of deaths during the coronavirus pandemic. One funeral director had described the situation as a \u201cstate of emergency,\u201d with some forced to ask families to try to keep their loved ones\u2019 bodies in hospitals for as long as possible to allow funeral services to cope. Some cemeteries and crematoriums have reported being booked up for weeks. According to Johns Hopkins, 5,150 people had died in hospital in New York City after contracting coronavirus as of Friday, though the death toll is believed to be higher. The New York Times reported that New York fire department data showed 1,125 people were pronounced dead in their homes or on the street in the first five days of April, more than eight times the 131 deaths recorded during the same period in 2019. \u201cThe last couple of weeks have been totally out of control,\u201d Matthew Pinto, director of the Provenzano Lanza funeral home in Manhattan, told the New York Post. \u201cOn a normal day, our funeral home will do between one and two calls. Now we\u2019re doing eight or nine. Honestly, we\u2019re not equipped for it.\u201d Funeral directors have been running out of storage for remains, with some trying to rent refrigerated vehicles to expand their facilities. Hospitals in New York have already been using refrigerated trucks to store the dead, and the city set up 45 mobile morgues earlier this month. Joe Neufeld, director of the Gerard J Neufeld funeral home in Queens, told the paper he went from holding about 14 funerals a week to more than 50. He said he was was no longer able to offer full services because his viewing room was filled with people\u2019s remains. \u201cWe had no choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had families call me telling me they can\u2019t find anyone to take their loved one.\u201d At the Daniel J Schaefer funeral home in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, Pat Marmo recently told the Associated Press his company was equipped to handle 40 to 60 cases at a time, but was taking care of 185 a day. \u201cEvery person there, they\u2019re not a body,\u201d he said as he walked among 20 or so deceased people in the home. \u201cThey\u2019re a father, they\u2019re a mother, they\u2019re a grandmother. They\u2019re not bodies. They\u2019re people. \u201cThis is a state of emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need help.\u201d Marmo said he had been begging families to insist hospitals hold their dead loved ones as long as possible to help funeral services to cope, and because cemeteries and crematoriums were booked up weeks in advance Drone footage showed how dozens of New Yorkers who have died without next of kin are being buried in pits in the potter\u2019s field on Hart Island, where millions of the city\u2019s poorest residents have been laid to rest. New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, this week signed an executive order allowing out-of-state funeral directors to come into the state to help relieve pressure on funeral services. The move came after the National Funeral Directors Association wrote an open letter letter to the governor, saying hundreds of people were willing to help. Announcing the move, Cuomo said: \u201cIf you ever told me that as governor I would have to take these actions, I couldn\u2019t even contemplate where we are now.\u201d The NFDA said it had been approached by more than 500 volunteers looking to help funeral homes and hospitals. It said it had this week sent the names of 115 students and apprentices to the New York City office of emergency management, who could help ensure the deceased were \u201ctreated respectfully\u201d in hospitals, and \u201cdocumentation is complete while awaiting transfer to a local funeral home\u201d. It said it had also sent on names of licensed funeral directors to the New York State Funeral Directors Association, and would continue to try and recruit more volunteers. Funeral directors have said in addition to the surge in deaths, the physical distancing measures in place to help stop the spread of the coronavirus have transformed the grieving process. Those who die in hospital or other care facilities are not allowed to have visitors by their bedsides, and gatherings for funerals are limited to immediate family, if that. Jackie McQuade, a funeral director at Schuyler Hill funeral home in the Bronx, told the AP that at one cemetery she worked with, only she and a priest were allowed at the site of a burial. She photographed the casket being lowered, hoping it could bring some closure to the family. \u201cWe would be going crazy if it were one of our loved ones,\u201d she said.

I remember playing with Agassi after Andre had 18 months out, for very different reasons, but he came back fresh and invigorated to play. He kept going until he was 36.</p> <p>\u201cIn those days that was old for a top tennis player. I stopped when I was 33 and that was pretty old at the time. But with training techniques and injury prevention, players are certainly playing longer. So you would like to think that if Andy\u2019s body permits and he still has the motivation that I think he does there can still definitely be a few Wimbledons left in him yet.\u201d</p> <p>Henman said he had spoken to Roger Federer, who had planned to make his comeback at Wimbledon after knee surgery, and reckoned the eight-times champion, at 38, would be similarly frustrated, with dwindling opportunities left to add to his 20 majors. \u201cSomeone like Federer, coming to the end of his career, is devastated but understands the decision. It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.\u201d</p> <p>Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. \u201cFurther down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.\u201d</p> <p>He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. \u201cYou have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren\u2019t, I don\u2019t think anyone would be greatly surprised,\u201d Henman said.</p> <p>The game\u2019s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/australia-edge-great-britain-in-atp-cup-quarter-final-thriller\" title=\"\">leading them to the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/australia-edge-great-britain-in-atp-cup-quarter-final-thriller\" title=\"\">quarter-finals</a>. \u201cIf I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIf you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely. But the world is a very, very different place right now.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray, whose comeback has stalled in tempo with his sport, has \u201ca few Wimbledons left in him yet\u201d, according to Tim Henman. Henman, who reached four semi-finals there and is an influential board member at the All England Club, which cancelled the 134th championships because of coronavirus, said Murray, 33 next month, may benefit from a rest. \u201cI saw him practise a few weeks ago when it looked as if there might be a chance to go to Miami [on 25 March, after the cancellation of Indian Wells],\u201d Henman said. \u201cAfter being out of the game as long as he has, and now with the progress he has made, he will be pretty frustrated because he is getting close to getting back out on the court. \u201cHe has missed so much tennis but perhaps [the break] will give him the opportunity \u2013 if his body and his hip enable him \u2013 to play longer, in age terms. I remember playing with Agassi after Andre had 18 months out, for very different reasons, but he came back fresh and invigorated to play. He kept going until he was 36. \u201cIn those days that was old for a top tennis player. I stopped when I was 33 and that was pretty old at the time. But with training techniques and injury prevention, players are certainly playing longer. So you would like to think that if Andy\u2019s body permits and he still has the motivation that I think he does there can still definitely be a few Wimbledons left in him yet.\u201d Henman said he had spoken to Roger Federer, who had planned to make his comeback at Wimbledon after knee surgery, and reckoned the eight-times champion, at 38, would be similarly frustrated, with dwindling opportunities left to add to his 20 majors. \u201cSomeone like Federer, coming to the end of his career, is devastated but understands the decision. It will affect a lot of people in a lot of different ways.\u201d Henman is particularly concerned the disruption will hit low-ranked players hardest. \u201cFurther down the pecking order this will have huge implications where people are not going to have an income.\u201d He also added his voice to those of the outgoing All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, and the relatively new ATP chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, who fear there is a possibility the 2020 calendar may be wiped out entirely. \u201cYou have got to be positive and optimistic that [the US Open in August] can be played but, if it weren\u2019t, I don\u2019t think anyone would be greatly surprised,\u201d Henman said. The game\u2019s next big event may be the second ATP Cup, where Henman made a confident debut as the Great Britain coach at the start of the year, leading them to the quarter-finals. \u201cIf I were asked to do it again, schedule permitting, I would definitely do it because it was a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had said a month ago the next event was going to be the ATP Cup in Australia in January, I think people would have looked at you a bit strangely. But the world is a very, very different place right now.\u201d",

But some non-essential workers will begin returning to their jobs on Monday at the end of a two-week freeze on all non-vital economic activity, despite warnings that the relaxation of the strict confinement policy could drive a rise in contagion. In other developments: The first confirmed case was announced in war-torn Yemen, stoking fears of an outbreak that could devastate its already crippled healthcare system. In the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, there was a crush as people desperate for food because the coronavirus restrictions have kept them from making a living pushed through a gate at a district office in the Kibera slum. Fifty crew aboard France\u2019s only aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, tested positive and parts of the ship have been put in lockdown.
