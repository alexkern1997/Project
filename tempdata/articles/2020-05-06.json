      "bodyText": "The Sydney Opera House has been approached to consult on the long-term viability of multi-arts precinct Carriageworks as reports emerge that the Berejiklian government is considering a proposal for the famous landmark\u2019s trust to take over Carriageworks\u2019 operations. Carriageworks announced on Monday night that it was going into voluntary administration as a consequence of the \u201cirreparable\u201d effects of the coronavirus crisis and the widespread shutdown on its income stream. The move has been described as \u201cdevastating\u201d by artistic directors, individual arts practitioners and state and federal politicians alike. The appointed administrators, Phil Quinlan and Morgan Kelly from KPMG, have remained tight-lipped on the size of the organisation\u2019s debts and who its primary creditors are. But their public statement, which notes they will be \u201cexploring the possibility of a deed of company arrangement to stabilise Carriageworks\u2019 financial position and allow it to continue its important role for Australian arts and culture\u201d, suggests that they will be looking for a bailout. Reports emerged on Tuesday night that the NSW government was considering a proposal to pass management of the space to the Opera House Trust. In a statement, an Opera House spokesperson said the trust \u201chas been approached by the government to consult on the long-term sustainability of Carriageworks as an important cultural venue, particularly at this most difficult time\u201d. But there have been widespread calls for the bailout to come from the NSW government itself, as pressure grows on state and federal governments to do more to assist the arts sector in recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic. Labor\u2019s Walt Secord, the shadow arts minister for NSW, called for an emergency rescue package for arts organisations from the state government at a press conference on Tuesday, saying there was \u201ca role for the state government\u201d in assisting Carriageworks\u2019 recovery. Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, in an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, also called for a state government bailout using the funds for the \u201cincredibly unpopular and shortsighted\u201d $1.5bn plan to relocate the Powerhouse Museum from its current home in Ultimo to the western Sydney suburb of Parramatta. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond time the state and federal governments ended their abandonment of artists, performers and those administering the arts organisations. They are left with the impression their jobs are not \u2018real\u2019 jobs, not important to our country like, say, mining or professional football,\u201d Moore said. The piece follows similar calls on Tuesday for a bailout using the Powerhouse relocation fund from Greens MP Cate Faehrmann. A complex of performance and gallery spaces in repurposed 1880s locomotive workshops in Sydney\u2019s inner west, Carriageworks has been a mainstay of Sydney\u2019s cultural life since it opened in 2007, pivoting in recent years from a venue for hire towards a more fully rounded artistic organisation with its own commissioning program. The options for the organisation now depend to a certain extent on what it owes, and to whom. Carriageworks\u2019 most recent financial statements, filed to the charities regulator, show an income stream heavily reliant on a combination of events and government support. In 2018, the company made $3.95m of its $11.6m reported income from events and venue hire, not including its regular farmers markets, which brought in an additional $1.1m. Support from grant programs totalled $3.16m in the same year, the vast majority of which was core funding from Create NSW, to the tune of $2.53m. The vast majority of expenditure \u2013 $7.05m of $12.2m that year \u2013 went towards staff salaries and wages, and the costs of putting on an artistic program. Many of Carriageworks\u2019 staff were stood down in early April and hours for core staff were substantially reduced as the Covid-19 lockdowns and restrictions on mass gatherings rolled out and public programs shut down. The arts sector has been calling on state and federal governments for weeks to commit to greater support for the sector, which was one of the first to feel the effects of the ban on mass gatherings and lockdowns of non-essential businesses. Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association for Visual Arts and a staunch advocate for the arts industry, said the sector had been \u201cunited and clear\u201d on its needs and demands. \u201cWe need to make sure that eligibility for support measures changes immediately, so that creative practitioners and businesses can access what they need.

      "body": "<p>National Basketball League commissioner Jeremy Loeliger had an early indication that not all was well in the world. With Australia\u2019s domestic basketball teams due to contest off-season matches in China in June, he had been in close contact with his Chinese counterparts at the end of last year. As the spread of Covid-19 escalated beyond Wuhan, it became clear those games would not take place.</p> <p>From his Melbourne office, Loeliger watched on as the coronavirus derailed global basketball: first in China, then across Asia and Europe, before eventually impacting Australia. The NBL was one of the first Australian sports to be hit, with the finals ended mid-series on 17 March. It would be another week before the AFL was suspended, and even longer for the NRL to grind to a halt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/australian-sport-prepares-to-restart-how-and-when-major-competitions-will-resume\">Australian sport prepares to restart: how and when major competitions will resume</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were very lucky to get through as much of our season as we did,\u201d Loeliger tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was a very stressful period during that grand final series \u2013 we had to make some tough decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Covid-19\u2019s interruption to the domestic and international sporting landscape comes at an interesting time for the NBL. Since businessman Larry Kestelman acquired the league in 2015, elite basketball in Australia has boomed. In the five subsequent seasons, attendances have increased by 54% to almost one million people in 2019-20. Domestic viewing figures, on SBS Viceland and ESPN, are up nearly half.</p> <p>Australian basketball icon Andrew Gaze played during the NBL\u2019s glory years in the 1990s. \u201cI think it is arguable we are ahead of those so-called halcyon days,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now we are seeing a real peak in the sport.\u201d</p> <p>The on-court product has improved dramatically, with Australian players returning home from overseas leagues and young Americans using the NBL as a pathway to the NBA. Boomers veteran Andrew Bogut joined the Sydney Kings, while LaMelo Ball \u2013 expected to be in the No 1 pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft \u2013 spent the past season with the Illawarra Hawks.</p> <p>\u201cThe last few years have been very promising,\u201d says Loeliger. Mitch Creek, a marquee signing in 2019 for newly-established team South East Melbourne Phoenix, is more emphatic. \u201cThis is the second best league in the world \u2013 second only to the NBA,\u201d he says.</p> <p>The pandemic threatens to dash that momentum.

      "bodyText": "National Basketball League commissioner Jeremy Loeliger had an early indication that not all was well in the world. With Australia\u2019s domestic basketball teams due to contest off-season matches in China in June, he had been in close contact with his Chinese counterparts at the end of last year. As the spread of Covid-19 escalated beyond Wuhan, it became clear those games would not take place. From his Melbourne office, Loeliger watched on as the coronavirus derailed global basketball: first in China, then across Asia and Europe, before eventually impacting Australia. The NBL was one of the first Australian sports to be hit, with the finals ended mid-series on 17 March. It would be another week before the AFL was suspended, and even longer for the NRL to grind to a halt. \u201cWe were very lucky to get through as much of our season as we did,\u201d Loeliger tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was a very stressful period during that grand final series \u2013 we had to make some tough decisions.\u201d Covid-19\u2019s interruption to the domestic and international sporting landscape comes at an interesting time for the NBL. Since businessman Larry Kestelman acquired the league in 2015, elite basketball in Australia has boomed. In the five subsequent seasons, attendances have increased by 54% to almost one million people in 2019-20. Domestic viewing figures, on SBS Viceland and ESPN, are up nearly half. Australian basketball icon Andrew Gaze played during the NBL\u2019s glory years in the 1990s. \u201cI think it is arguable we are ahead of those so-called halcyon days,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now we are seeing a real peak in the sport.\u201d The on-court product has improved dramatically, with Australian players returning home from overseas leagues and young Americans using the NBL as a pathway to the NBA. Boomers veteran Andrew Bogut joined the Sydney Kings, while LaMelo Ball \u2013 expected to be in the No 1 pick in this year\u2019s NBA draft \u2013 spent the past season with the Illawarra Hawks. \u201cThe last few years have been very promising,\u201d says Loeliger. Mitch Creek, a marquee signing in 2019 for newly-established team South East Melbourne Phoenix, is more emphatic. \u201cThis is the second best league in the world \u2013 second only to the NBA,\u201d he says. The pandemic threatens to dash that momentum. The 2020-21 season is not scheduled to begin until October, but the league has pre-empted the expected financial pain by agreeing a major pay cut with the Australian Basketball Players\u2019 Association. Some players have seen their salaries slashed by 50%. In response, some of the league\u2019s stars \u2013 including Perth\u2019s Bryce Cotton and Sydney Kings pair Casper Ware and Xavier Cooks \u2013 opted out of their contracts. \u201cWe have to play with the cards we are dealt, and we don\u2019t yet know what they will be,\u201d says Loeliger.

Even if professional sports are able to resume in the months ahead, a behind-closed-doors return would be costly for the NBL \u2013 more so than other domestic codes. \u201cWe\u2019re not showered in cash by our broadcast deals,\u201d Loeliger says. \u201cOur clubs and the league are very reliant on playing games in front of full stadiums.\u201d One player staying put is national team regular Creek, who committed to the second year of his Phoenix contract. \u201cWe have to repay the time, effort and money that the fans have invested in us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have been phenomenal.\u201d While the small forward\u2019s decision will see him lose half his pay, he remains philosophical: \u201c50% of something is better than 100% of nothing.\u201d Creek has seen the pandemic\u2019s impact first-hand. \u201cMy sister and my mother lost their jobs pretty quick \u2013 it\u2019s a hard time for everyone,\u201d he says.

We can and we will do better.\u201d McPhee also rejected the suggestion the bank had an ulterior motive for cutting redraws and said it was in a strong financial position. However, he stopped short of reversing the move, which is estimated to have affected about 20,000 home loan borrowers. The apology follows intense pressure on ME Bank from some of its industry super fund owners and the union movement, which is an important marketing channel for the bank. Redraw facilities allow home loan customers who have made extra payments on their mortgage to borrow additional money. Outraged customers flooded ME Bank\u2019s Facebook page last week, saying the bank had without notice reduced the amount they could redraw from their home loans by as much as $20,000. Over the weekend industry funds, the prudential regulator and the Australian Council of Trade Unions all demanded the bank explain what had happened. In his statement, McPhee said ME Bank cut redraw amounts \u201cwith the best of intentions \u2013 to protect some customers from the risk of redrawing too much money, which could have inadvertently put them behind their repayment schedule\u201d. \u201cBut we messed up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should have worked harder to explain a complex product and process simply so that redraw limits were better understood.\u201d He said affected customers were eligible for an assistance package that included extending the length of the loan to reduce the size of repayments, refinancing the loan and a six-month deferment of repayments. Victorian Liberal MP Tim Wilson has linked the move to ME Bank\u2019s industry fund ownership, asking if the bank was bailing out funds whose members have rushed to redeem their savings due to the coronavirus crisis. But McPhee said that the bank\u2019s \u201conly intention was to stop customers getting into financial difficulty\u201d. \u201cThe bank never benefited from this decision,\u201d he said. \u201cRumours about other motives are simply untrue.

We could end poverty for many, but prime minister Scott Morrison insists we will \u201csnap back\u201d to the unliveable rates after the pandemic.</p> <p>At first glance, the government response appears to protect renters, but landlords win at every step. State governments opted for a trickle-down approach, with New South Wales <a href=\"https://www.sbs.com.au/news/nsw-announces-440-million-coronavirus-rent-relief-package\">gifting landlords $440m</a> in further tax breaks. Victoria followed suit with a <a href=\"https://www.anglicare.asn.au/news-and-media/latest-news/2018/03/25/landmark-report-on-the-cost-of-privilege-shows-our-tax-system-is-unfair\">$420m</a><a href=\"https://www.anglicare.asn.au/news-and-media/latest-news/2018/03/25/landmark-report-on-the-cost-of-privilege-shows-our-tax-system-is-unfair\"> discount on land tax</a>, setting aside a mere $80m for renters themselves.</p> <p>Even then, state government rent relief goes straight to landlords, making the whole scheme a scandalous transfer of public money to private investors. The states\u2019 strategy has been to protect the interests of property owners and pray they pass on the benefits to tenants.</p> <p>Queensland bowed to pressure from the real estate lobby, backing down from pro-tenant reforms. NSW banned evictions for only two months instead of six. The Northern Territory, with 12 times the average homelessness rate, backtracked on the commitment entirely.</p> <p>Banning evictions is a step in the right direction. Still, it is only half a strategy. If you can\u2019t pay rent this month, you won\u2019t be able to afford arrears next month. Without further support, moratoriums create a debt trap which will drag down thousands during an economic downturn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/11/utterly-unjust-why-australian-renters-and-their-landlords-need-certainty-on-residential-tenancies\">'Utterly unjust': why Australian renters and their landlords need certainty on residential tenancies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ours is a society with more empty residences than homeless people. Wealthy households have never been more prosperous, while millions remain impoverished. The solutions are simple. If someone is homeless, give them a home. If they are hungry, then provide them with food.</p> <p>The discussion we should have is not whether we should do this, but how? We should increase welfare payments, ban no-cause evictions, invest in social housing and legislate stronger rights for renters. We could also establish rent controls, nationalise housing and push for a <a href=\"https://overland.org.au/2020/04/housing-is-a-right-homelessness-is-a-weapon/\">national housing guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Returning to \u201cnormal life\u201d means turning our backs on the crises which we ignored before the pandemic: housing costs, stagnant wages and starvation payments weigh poor people down. These problems are easy for well-off Australians to ignore.</p> <p>People living pay day to pay day know that poverty is only ever a few bad weeks away. For those at the bottom, Morrison\u2019s \u201csnap back\u201d is a dangerous fever dream. If we preserve an unfair status quo, we risk thousands more falling into hardship and destitution.</p> <p>After weeks of negotiation, my partner and I secured a modest reduction on our rent. Landlords hold all the power, and any compromise is a small miracle. Like millions of Australians, we have little security going forward.

      "bodyText": "A few days after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, I ran out of money for food. I had no savings, no job and credit debt. If it weren\u2019t for my partner, I would have been homeless. His employer stood him down a week later, alongside 800,000 people who lost their job in the first week of the outbreak. At the same time, retail giants refused to pay their rent. We reasoned that what\u2019s good enough for billionaires is good enough for everyone. When we asked for a rent pause, our property agent demanded to know much we spent on food and pressured us to raid our super. While Asic took a dim view of this practice, renters generally have to fend for themselves. As the global crisis unfolded, landlords and realtors threatened tenants with debts, evictions and lawsuits. The former want to recoup on their investment; the latter want their cut. Renters want somewhere to live. Poverty levels haven\u2019t improved in decades despite uninterrupted economic growth. Newstart didn\u2019t keep pace with inflation, social housing collapsed and homelessness spiked. This crisis was years in the making. The coronavirus has merely exposed how broken our system is. Around 1 in 3 Australians rent, most of them under 30. They\u2019re more likely to be in low-paid or precarious work, meaning they earn less and are more at risk of losing their income. As if to underscore this point, the jobkeeper payment excludes almost a million casuals, the majority of them women. Close to half of LGBTI people have experienced or are at risk of homelessness, and they are twice as likely to become homeless than straight people. Aboriginal people are 10 times more at risk of homelessness than white people. Migrants, single mothers and over 65s are overrepresented. Over half of low-income earners experience rental stress, which is where someone pays more than 30% of their income on rent. More than 140,000 households were on wait lists for public housing in 2018. Housing costs alone push over a million people into hardship, and low welfare rates keep millions more in poverty. A national survey found that virtually no rental listings are affordable for people on the regular jobseeker and youth allowance rates. Even with the temporary supplement, not even 2% of listings are reasonably priced. It\u2019s no wonder that 1 in 3 young recipients skip six or more meals a week \u2013 rents are astronomically high. The budget office estimates that keeping the jobseeker supplement would cost around $8bn, as compared to $14.5bn in tax breaks that landlords receive each year. We could end poverty for many, but prime minister Scott Morrison insists we will \u201csnap back\u201d to the unliveable rates after the pandemic. At first glance, the government response appears to protect renters, but landlords win at every step. State governments opted for a trickle-down approach, with New South Wales gifting landlords $440m in further tax breaks. Victoria followed suit with a $420m discount on land tax, setting aside a mere $80m for renters themselves. Even then, state government rent relief goes straight to landlords, making the whole scheme a scandalous transfer of public money to private investors. The states\u2019 strategy has been to protect the interests of property owners and pray they pass on the benefits to tenants. Queensland bowed to pressure from the real estate lobby, backing down from pro-tenant reforms. NSW banned evictions for only two months instead of six. The Northern Territory, with 12 times the average homelessness rate, backtracked on the commitment entirely. Banning evictions is a step in the right direction. Still, it is only half a strategy. If you can\u2019t pay rent this month, you won\u2019t be able to afford arrears next month. Without further support, moratoriums create a debt trap which will drag down thousands during an economic downturn. Ours is a society with more empty residences than homeless people. Wealthy households have never been more prosperous, while millions remain impoverished. The solutions are simple. If someone is homeless, give them a home. If they are hungry, then provide them with food. The discussion we should have is not whether we should do this, but how? We should increase welfare payments, ban no-cause evictions, invest in social housing and legislate stronger rights for renters. We could also establish rent controls, nationalise housing and push for a national housing guarantee. Returning to \u201cnormal life\u201d means turning our backs on the crises which we ignored before the pandemic: housing costs, stagnant wages and starvation payments weigh poor people down. These problems are easy for well-off Australians to ignore. People living pay day to pay day know that poverty is only ever a few bad weeks away. For those at the bottom, Morrison\u2019s \u201csnap back\u201d is a dangerous fever dream. If we preserve an unfair status quo, we risk thousands more falling into hardship and destitution. After weeks of negotiation, my partner and I secured a modest reduction on our rent. Landlords hold all the power, and any compromise is a small miracle. Like millions of Australians, we have little security going forward. All we can do is imagine a system which works for everyone, not just landlords and the wealthy. \u2022 Joshua Badge is a philosopher and writer living on Wurundjeri land in Melbourne",

Kotvojs only just fell short in a contest against Kelly. Conservatives say Constance would have a clear run at the neighbouring federal seat of Gilmore because moderates control the local branch, but may have struggled in a local plebiscite with Kotvojs in the field. Kotvojs is now expected to run. Labor\u2019s national executive has installed Kristy McBain, the Bega Valley shire mayor, as its candidate for the contest. A date for the byelection has not been set.

On Tuesday, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, announced plans to reopen schools, cinemas, bars and beauty parlours from Friday, with authorities set to hand out reusable face masks to all 7.5 million residents. Hong Kong has had 1,041 cases of coronavirus with four deaths. The move comes after the territory\u2019s economy, already damaged by months of protest before the coronavirus outbreak, recorded its worst decline on record. GDP shrunk 8.9% year-on-year in the first quarter, the deepest contraction since records began in 1974, and the fourth consecutive quarter to drop. Lam noted it was worse than that experienced during the Asian financial crisis in 1998. In South Korea, once the worst-hit country outside China, the government relaxed social distancing rules on Wednesday and students will return to school from Monday. The country, with more than 10,800 cases and 255 deaths, has been held up as an example of how to contain the virus. On Wednesday the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention reported two new cases \u2013 both imported \u2013 as the number of new infections continued to slow. The education minister, Yoo Eun-hae, said high school seniors, who are preparing for highly competitive university entrance exams, would return to schools on 13 May with younger students to follow in phases from 20 May. Students and teachers will have to wear a mask except during mealtimes, wipe their desks and observe social distancing as they move around. Schools will also be required to regularly disinfect their premises, conduct temperature checks and rearrange seating. The South Korean professional baseball season began on Tuesday, although teams played in empty stadiums, and football is to follow suit on Friday. \ufeffThailand, which has seen 2,987 cases and 54 deaths, began easing restrictions on movement and gatherings on Monday, allowing restaurants, hair salons and open-air markets to resume business, provided that social distancing is maintained and proprietors carry out temperature checks. In neighbouring Vietnam, which has had 271 cases and no deaths, life is also gradually returning to normal, but the economy, which relies on tourism for a 6% of its GDP, faces huge challenges. The Australian government on Wednesday said it was seeking ways to reopen locked down businesses as early as July, as its success in containing the coronavirus outbreak allows it to focus on trying to regain a million jobs lost since mid-March. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and state leaders will discuss health protocols at a national cabinet meeting on Friday that could enable businesses to open in a \u201cCovid-safe environment\u201d, with the government saying the shutdown has been costing the economy A$4bn a week. \u201cThe lesson from history \u2026 is that the quicker you can get people back into jobs and off those unemployment queues, the better off the economy will be and the better off those individuals will be,\u201d the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told ABC television. There would be three stages to easing restrictions on social distancing for affected industries, with cafes, restaurants and retail expected to be among the first to be allowed to reopen. Each state would move at its own pace with the common goal of having most of their economies rebooted by July. Australia has had fewer than 7,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and there are fewer than 1,000 active cases remaining. Ninety-six people have died in the outbreak. The resumption of business might also coincide with the opening of the border between Australia and New Zealand, creating what has been dubbed a trans-Tasman \u201ctravel bubble\u201d, given that both countries have significantly reduced infection levels and rates. In the US, the Trump administration is also pushing for an end to lockdowns to focus on economic growth, despite the nation leading the world in infections and deaths, and experts warning that the worst is yet to come. President Donald Trump has scrapped daily coronavirus task force briefings and marginalised his medical experts, preferring economic officials to publicly urge states to reopen. Chinese stock indices reopened in positive territory on Wednesday after the spring holiday but the Australian market lost 0.6% and futures trading pointed to a similar drop in London and New York later in the day. Disney cast a pall over Wall Street by announcing losses of $1.4bn in the first quarter and the entertainment company still had no indication when it might reopen its profitable theme parks in Europe and the US. Airbnb, the home booking site, said it was cutting 1,900 jobs amid the worldwide travel slump. In other coronavirus developments: Britain has overtaken Italy to become the worst-hit nation in Europe, and the second-worst in the world, with more than 32,000 deaths. Youth unemployment in Britain will reach 1 million people over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns. The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a \u201cdevastating\u201d surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths by 2025, new research shows. Brazil confirmed its highest daily coronavirus deaths on Tuesday. There were 6,935 new cases since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Mexico\u2019s president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, signalled some automotive factories could open in coming weeks. After two consecutive days of zero new coronavirus cases, on Wednesday New Zealand reported one new case of the virus and one more death. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said success in curbing Covid-19 had provided a \u201csafe haven\u201d advantage allowing the country to be open for investment.",

I don\u2019t know where we are going, but one thing seems clear: we are not going back.</p> <p><strong>Yanis Varoufakis</strong>: I like this phrase: capitalism has been suspended. The last time capitalism was suspended in the west was during the second world war, with the advent of the war economy: a command economy that fixed prices. The war economy marked the transcendence of the standard capitalist model.</p> <p>But what we see now is not so much the suspension of capitalism. The rules of capitalism may have been suspended \u2013 all those sacrosanct policies are gone, the neat separation of fiscal and monetary policy is gone, the idea that public debt is a bad thing is gone.</p> <p>But the institutions that are necessary to build \u201cthe war economy without war\u201d so to speak \u2013 to suspend and transcend capitalism \u2013 those have not been put in place. There is a profound difference between saying: \u201cIt\u2019s all going to shit, so we don\u2019t expect you to stick to the rules,\u201d and saying: \u201cThe rules themselves have changed, and we must make new ones to prevent an economic collapse.\u201d All this talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/quantitative-easing\">quantitative easing</a> by the European Central Bank suggests that we remain very far from a war economy mindset.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>This is a familiar category error in Europe. If you are basing your economic policy on the willingness of people who are too traumatised and sick to borrow \u2013 which is the core logic of quantitative easing \u2013 then you have a very serious problem. A common image of quantitative easing is the hose: a huge monetary hose, with water gushing out to stop the fire of crisis. But the hose of monetary policy is limited by this little valve called the banks, a little valve called the credit committee, a little valve called the \u201cwillingness of business to borrow money\u201d. And ultimately, that hose of money becomes a trickle \u2013 and even that trickle stands to benefit the wealthy much more than the poor.</p> <p>So I take your point that despite the suspension of the rules, the infrastructure remains in place. But people across Europe are now saying: \u201cHey, there is an alternative.\u201d This second phase will be about how we move ahead in rethinking capitalism, in rethinking finance, rethinking how economies work and for whom \u2013 potentially toward a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/nov/14/bretton-woods-1944-keynes-imf\">Bretton Woods-style settlement</a> for the entire global economy.</p> <p>So that\u2019s where we are: in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. Looking out at the next decade, armed with history as well as economics, what do you think the global and European economy will look like?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bf8f9edd6a1189e6e803fbd027f4071f177064b/0_0_3266_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yanis Varoufakis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>YV:</strong> We are sitting on a saddle point, prepared to tip in either direction. It is utterly indeterminate which of the two directions we travel.</p> <p>Let us start with the positive scenario. It builds from your point about the prospects for a new Bretton Woods \u2013 with its particular manifestation in the European Union.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If we are going to have continental consolidation, what should it look like? It would not be a federation, because \u2013 even though that is more necessary than ever \u2013 it is less likely than ever, because the centrifugal forces of the coronavirus crisis, the migration crisis, and the euro crisis are pulling us apart. But the alternative is to deploy the existing [EU] institutions in a way that can simulate a federated Europe, and we can do this tomorrow, if we so choose: to provide immediate cash to all those who are struggling in poverty, to invest in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/22/yanis-varoufakis-green-new-deal-can-unite-europes-progressives\">green transition</a>.</p> <p>There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between 2020 and 2010. Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany\u2019s industrial machine is broken \u2013 and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries \u2013 automobiles and machine tooling \u2013 were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It\u2019s no longer: \u201cYour problem: here\u2019s the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/07/troika-build-greece-up-not-blow-apart-ceasefire\">Troika</a>.\u201d</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>And we will send you the bill as well! So that\u2019s the positive scenario. The interruption of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d gives way to new policies and new possibilities for Europe and beyond. What\u2019s the other option?</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> Well, we humans \u2013 and we Europeans, in particular \u2013 love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It\u2019s very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/06/eurozone-germany-ordoliberalism\">European ordoliberals</a>, who will keep putting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/05/jolt-to-eurozone-as-german-court-warns-against-central-bank-stimulus\">roadblocks</a> in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy \u2013 a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe\u2019s emotional hinterland?</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/29/matteo-salvini-italy-league-party-master-campaigner-counts-cost-of-strategic-errors\">Salvini waiting</a> in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy \u2013 not just Italy, but all of Europe\u2019s most devastated regions \u2013 will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off.</p> <p>This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States\">Commonwealth of Independent States</a>.</p> <p><strong>DM: </strong>Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well \u2026</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/nov/26/politics-of-nostalgia-score-settling-populism-dominated-2010s-john-harris\">Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis</a> of this world. We would move into a transactional, Hobbesian global economy: nasty, brutish, and poor for the majority of people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My sense is that the period when you could travel, engage, move, we might have reached the end of that open period.</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>DM: </strong>When I was born in Ireland, the country was very poor. And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe\u2019s position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move \u2013 we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: \u201cThis virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.\u201d Whether it\u2019s right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/walter-scheidel-a-shock-to-the-established-order-can-deliver-change\">Black Death</a> resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: \u201cWho can we blame for this?\u201d And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto.</p> <p>This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: \u201cTurning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\u201d I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it\u2019s a clarion call.</p> <p><strong>YV:</strong> The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/04/drones-replace-patrol-ships-mediterranean-fears-more-migrant-deaths-eu\">severe restriction</a>: Nafta and the US-Mexico border; freedom of movement in Europe and <a href=\"https://frontex.europa.eu/\">Frontex</a> along the Mediterranean. This is not a contradiction; it is the logic of a system that prizes the movement of capital over the freedom of human beings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-bad-weather-uk\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-bad-weather-uk&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-bad-weather-uk&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>If we fail now to stand together \u2013 to rally around a new Bretton Woods, to deliver the investments that humanity and the planet so desperately need \u2013 my fear is that this system will only deepen its cruel logic. Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy; bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal. Because without it, the walls between us will only get taller and thicker: porous only to the money that flows through them.</p> <ul> <li><p>This is an edited version of a conversation that will appear in <a href=\"https://eris.press/A-Vision-for-Europe-2020\">A Vision for Europe 2020: Nothing But an Alternative</a>, published this month by Eris.</p></li> </ul>",

But the alternative is to deploy the existing [EU] institutions in a way that can simulate a federated Europe, and we can do this tomorrow, if we so choose: to provide immediate cash to all those who are struggling in poverty, to invest in the green transition. There is a glimmer of hope here, because there is a profound difference between 2020 and 2010. Back then, when Ireland and Greece went belly up, there were remarkable dissimilarities between what our countries were experiencing and what Germany was experiencing, what Holland was experiencing. Today, Germany\u2019s industrial machine is broken \u2013 and was broken long before coronavirus hit. Two main industries \u2013 automobiles and machine tooling \u2013 were already in serious trouble. So the fact that Germany is now in the same pile of shit as the rest of us offers a glimmer of hope that they might say: what should we do? It\u2019s no longer: \u201cYour problem: here\u2019s the Troika.\u201d DM: And we will send you the bill as well! So that\u2019s the positive scenario. The interruption of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d gives way to new policies and new possibilities for Europe and beyond. What\u2019s the other option? YV: Well, we humans \u2013 and we Europeans, in particular \u2013 love to miss fantastic opportunities and end up with dystopian outcomes instead. It\u2019s very likely that we will encounter the same recalcitrance by the same set of European ordoliberals, who will keep putting roadblocks in the way of moves toward a genuine, democratic federalism. DM: Obviously, such a roadblock will have a disproportionate impact on the southern member states of the European Union. What do you think the impact of this particular trauma will have on, say, Italy \u2013 a founding member of the European Union, and a crucial part of Europe\u2019s emotional hinterland? YV: Every time there is a crisis in Europe, Italian growth rates fall. Every time there is a problem, Italy sinks deeper into stagnation \u2013 with Salvini waiting in the wings. If Frankfurt, Berlin, and Brussels fail again to move toward the positive scenario, Italy \u2013 not just Italy, but all of Europe\u2019s most devastated regions \u2013 will move again toward the neo-fascist right. In that case, all bets are off. This is the endpoint of the negative scenario: a giant domino effect, leading to the disintegration of the European Union. Not that the EU will cease to exist. Only that it will become irrelevant, like the Commonwealth of Independent States. DM: Oh, I remember the Commonwealth of Independent States very well \u2026 YV: It still exists! It still has an office in Moscow. So the negative scenario is that the European Union will become like the CIS. And that will be music to the ears of the Trumps, Bolsonaros, and Modis of this world. We would move into a transactional, Hobbesian global economy: nasty, brutish, and poor for the majority of people. DM: When I was born in Ireland, the country was very poor. And then it became quite wealthy, on the back of the European project, on the back of Europe\u2019s position in the global supply chain, and with a tax policy that attracted lots and lots of capital. My sense is this model might be gone, and this style of globalisation along with it. I fear that the period when you could travel, engage, move \u2013 we might have reached the end of that open period. People will say: \u201cThis virus came from the cosmopolitan world, from the world of international movement.\u201d Whether it\u2019s right or not, we might begin to blame people. We know that the Black Death resulted in ferocious antisemitism in Europe. People asked: \u201cWho can we blame for this?\u201d And so they blamed the one community that was already in isolation in the ghetto. This is what terrifies me most, sitting here in the first year of the third decade of the 21st century. What we saw before may come again, and we turn back to Yeats: \u201cTurning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer; / Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.\u201d I fear now, unless we move quickly and in a new direction, the world that my kids will inherit is going to turn very nasty, indeed. So it\u2019s a clarion call. YV: The loudest call in a generation. I share all of your concern for the future, although I must challenge the analysis on which it is based. The openness that you describe has always gone hand in hand with severe restriction: Nafta and the US-Mexico border; freedom of movement in Europe and Frontex along the Mediterranean. This is not a contradiction; it is the logic of a system that prizes the movement of capital over the freedom of human beings. If we fail now to stand together \u2013 to rally around a new Bretton Woods, to deliver the investments that humanity and the planet so desperately need \u2013 my fear is that this system will only deepen its cruel logic. Surfing on the hose of liquidity unleashed by the policies like quantitative easing, the financial sector will increase its grip on the global economy; bankers are very good at getting rich from such volatility. So now is the time for us, here in Europe as around the world, to mobilise behind this shared vision of a global new deal. Because without it, the walls between us will only get taller and thicker: porous only to the money that flows through them. This is an edited version of a conversation that will appear in A Vision for Europe 2020: Nothing But an Alternative, published this month by Eris.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Ander Zabala, recycling manager for Hackney council, London</strong></h2> <p>Through my work, I have seen the huge amount of waste and recycling that we produce. Watching an incinerator for half an hour shocked me and made me want to take action. I was standing on a balcony wearing a full body suit and goggles watching gigantic grabbers emptying waste from trucks. The scale is so shocking and you realise how tiny we are compared to the amount of waste we create. I don\u2019t want to contribute to that wastefulness and it has made me want to take action.</p> <p>In 2018, I did the <a href=\"https://www.zerowasteweek.co.uk/\">Zero Waste Week</a> challenge and then kept going. I set myself a goal for 2019 of not having any waste collected. I made that commitment on social media, so I felt invested. Instead of using a bin, I put my waste in a jar each month so that I could see what I was throwing away. I also reduced the amount I was recycling.</p> <p>I look at waste from a data perspective. At the end of 2019, I opened <a href=\"https://goxuboys.wixsite.com/goxuboys/post/2019-waste-data-exposed\">all the jars of non-recyclable waste</a> I was keeping. They weighed a total of 5.72kg for the year. The average London house produces 10kg of waste a week, compared with my household\u2019s weekly average of 0.11kg. So our waste was 99% less than the average.</p> <p>My husband and I get a veg box delivery from Riverford every week. I buy most other things loose from my local corner shop and other bits from a nearby Bulk Market and Turkish supermarket. I bring my own containers and bags to fill with cereals, flour, pasta, rice, tofu, sugar, coffee beans, lentils, spices and more. I also refill my shampoo, washing-up liquid, laundry liquid and toilet cleaner bottles. I also get bottle refills of wine from a local shop.</p> <p>At first I felt a bit weird taking my own containers, but it forces you to explain what you are doing to people around you. Generally, people are really positive and say: \u201cWhat a great idea.\u201d I take tubs back to my Indian takeaway to be refilled and now they expect it. Of course, at the moment I wouldn\u2019t ask them to refill my containers because everyone is taking hygiene precautions due to the coronavirus, but I still use the tubs for my regular grocery shopping. My recycling has increased during lockdown because I cannot reuse things as much as I normally would.</p> <p>One of the biggest lifestyle benefits has been using my local shops more. I used to go to the supermarket and self-checkout, but I have gained so much by talking to local shop owners and cashiers.</p> <p>We have also done a lot more cooking, especially making things that we can\u2019t buy without packaging. My husband learned to make chapatis and naan bread, and they taste better than the ones we bought in the shops \u2013 and he can make them in minutes. We<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/jan/31/how-to-make-your-own-milk-simple-sustainable-guide-oat-nuts-seeds\"> make our own oat milk</a>, which is so cheap and easy. I will buy a packet of biscuits occasionally because I don\u2019t have the time to make everything.</p> <p>Sometimes, I would get a bit militant. I would ask friends at parties: \u201cWhy did you buy that when it can\u2019t be recycled?\u201d Or I would find some plastic packaging in the house and text my husband saying: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I have been called the zero-waste police. But now I am going a bit easier on myself and others.</p> <p>Overall, these changes have saved us a lot of money, mainly by reducing our consumption. We stopped buying stuff that we don\u2019t really need, but spend a little more on the things that we do buy. We have also eaten more healthily because we have bought less processed food.</p> <p>I am still putting my waste in a jar to keep it visible. I know that if there is a large bin in the room, people will use it.</p> <h2><strong>Cate Cody, jazz singer and Green councillor, Tewkesbury</strong></h2> <p>We haven\u2019t put our waste bin out for collection for more than three years, not since January 2017. My partner and I have one small metal bin in the kitchen and that\u2019s the only bin in the house. There\u2019s hardly anything in it, just occasional bits of non-recyclable plastic packaging, usually from gifts from well-meaning people.</p> <p>We try to bring in as little as possible, only buying what we need and secondhand wherever feasible, which tends to avoid packaging. We reuse, repurpose, recycle and compost.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cc35a376351ef00d458f6e7a848ac8b3edab41eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc35a376351ef00d458f6e7a848ac8b3edab41eb/0_250_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"None gone to waste ...

Cate Cody with her barely used bins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We get a weekly veg box full of local, seasonal produce. I forage too, for things such as nettles and wild garlic. We grow our own salad, which is very easy and quick to grow. Our rocket sprouts up between paving slabs.<br><br>We buy other food, such as pasta, rice and pulses, in bulk from an ethical cooperative wholesaler called <a href=\"https://www.suma.coop/\">Suma</a>. We get a delivery every couple of months that we share with five other friends. Our oats come in a 10kg paper sack. The toilet paper comes in biodegradable packaging that goes into the compost, and there\u2019s biodegradable dental floss too.<br><br>We use loofahs instead of regular sponges for washing up because they are made from a natural material and can be composted afterwards. They are more expensive, but we find they last longer, so the costs are not so different.</p> <p>Once you start to reduce your waste, you notice the outstanding things still going into the bin and then <a href=\"http://www.ecocody.com/2018/07/thirty-seven-things-you-can-do-to-be.html\">seek alternatives to them</a>. When you put your mind to it, you can find a solution for nearly everything. One challenge was what to do with an old bike inner tube. I considered a few possibilities and eventually made it into a tool belt.</p> <p>I hated toothpaste tubes going to landfill, so I started <a href=\"http://www.ecocody.com/2017/09/how-to-keep-it-clean-but-green-in-your.html\">making my own toothpaste</a> by mixing bicarbonate of soda with coconut and peppermint oil. It is very different, but it works. That said, we have now made Tewkesbury town hall into a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TewkTownCouncil/status/1184821106403876865?s=20\">collection point</a> for recycling toothpaste tubes so that others needn\u2019t end up in the bin.</p> <p>I never buy wrapping paper. For close friends and family I will use a scarf or a table cloth and they usually give it back afterwards. Recently, I wrapped a friend\u2019s present using recipes from a newspaper tied up with string and explained that the recipes (chosen especially) were part of the present. They loved it.</p> <p>I happily use a bar of soap instead of shower gel and wouldn\u2019t look back. The gel often slid straight down the plughole anyway. A decent soap lasts much longer.</p> <p>Instead of kitchen roll, I use old cloth, and rather than makeup wipes, I use a small hankie or a piece of cloth. These can all be washed.</p> <p>I don\u2019t miss the things that I have given up. It is not about loss, it is about what you gain. I derive real satisfaction from not throwing things away and I have gained skills by learning to make things myself. It is also about owning fewer things; if I want to read a book, I will order it from the library. I might have to wait longer for it, so there is less instant gratification, but it can feel like being a child waiting for Christmas and it is all the more rewarding when it arrives.</p> <p>As a <a href=\"http://www.jazzcats.co.uk/index.html\">jazz singer</a> I recycle songs, and in the rest of my life I try to recycle everything else.</p> <h2><strong>Claudi Williams, workshop manager for <a href=\"https://www.beeswaxwraps.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2-Hw4KaS6QIVhbTtCh3W7AXxEAAYASAAEgLaWfD_BwE\">the Beeswax Wrap Co</a></strong><strong>, </strong><strong> Stroud</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6d9fcec523e67b7f26edbbfe537f3808546fb66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6d9fcec523e67b7f26edbbfe537f3808546fb66/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G2 - Claudi Williams at home near Stroud.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">G2 - Claudi Williams at home near Stroud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was frustrated by the amount of plastic in my life, so in 2016 I decided to <a href=\"http://www.pfree.co.uk/about/\">try not buying any for a year</a>. It was a steep learning curve for me, my husband and our two sons but, after a few months, our waste went down to almost nothing. It has become our new normal.</p> <p>It was hard at first because we were used to the convenience of buying stuff at the last minute and we couldn\u2019t do that any more. Now we have a routine, cooking every day and making our own packed lunches.</p> <p>The first thing we ask ourselves is: \u201cDo we need this?\u201d The second is: \u201cHow can I get this unpackaged?\u201d Can we make it ourselves? Can we get it secondhand? Can we borrow it?</p> <p>Buying unpackaged food tends to make you buy more local, seasonal food, which also reduces your food miles, thereby creating a virtuous circle. We buy food from the farmers\u2019 market and local shops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1b82b5c3733e44e355ccfb2888d97315d7845fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1b82b5c3733e44e355ccfb2888d97315d7845fe/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homemade toothpaste, soap and reusable, compostable scourer \u2013 and hazelnuts from Cate Cody\u2019s garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homemade toothpaste, soap and reusable, compostable scourer \u2013 and hazelnuts from Cate Cody\u2019s garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Frost/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When we started, I did a little audit around the house to see how many cleaning products we were using and the result was staggering. We are led to believe that we need a different product for every single thing we clean, but actually you can clean nearly everything effectively with bicarbonate of soda, vinegar, lemons and a simple soap. Now I just use soap and a brush and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/jan/13/bicarb-vinegar-lemon-juice-how-to-clean-your-house-even-the-oven-the-old-fashioned-way\">make my own spray</a><sup> </sup>with vinegar for things such as tiles, mirrors and sinks. The whole journey has been one of simplifying further and further. Bicarb is a great thing to have around \u2013 for example, you can sprinkle it into tea-stained cups to remove the stains.</p> <p>You can make so many things from basic ingredients, and finding new solutions is hugely empowering. For instance, when we needed windscreen wiper liquid for the car, I found a really easy recipe on the internet that cost only a few pence to make. I make my own toothpaste and deodorant, which only takes five minutes. For shampoo, I buy <a href=\"https://www.faithinnature.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvr2plqSS6QIVVODtCh3PAAn6EAAYASAAEgJRgvD_BwE\">Faith in Nature</a> refills or a bar from <a href=\"https://mindthetrash.com/\">Mind the Trash</a>. I use a metal safety razor for shaving. I get toilet paper from a subscription service called <a href=\"https://greencane.com/\">Greencane</a> that sends out 48 unpackaged rolls in a cardboard box.</p> <p>I love herbal teas and was scrambling around for loose tea and then I realised that there were plants in my garden that I could pick fresh and use. You have to switch your brain away from consumption and realise what is in your environment. I dry herbs such as chamomile and peppermint to use in the winter months by tying bunches in a posy and hanging them upside down in a cupboard.</p> <p>Living like this has really changed me. Ultimately, we simply live with less stuff. I used to pop things into my supermarket trolley on impulse, but now I have a totally different relationship with what I want and need. I feel much more self-reliant and smarter about how I shop. I consider every purchase a vote.</p> <h2><strong>10 easy ways to start reducing your waste</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c45f3a78fafa5707c0e4f42d71207cfb61a4048\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c45f3a78fafa5707c0e4f42d71207cfb61a4048/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waste illustration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br><strong>1. </strong>Buy less stuff. If you have to buy furniture, clothes or tools and whatever else, try to get it secondhand, or borrow rather than buy.</p> <p><strong>2. </strong>For groceries, choose loose and unpackaged fruit and vegetables. Take your own reusable containers and bags to markets or deli counters to get things such as olives, cheese and bread package-free. Buy milk in returnable glass bottles or <a href=\"theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2020/jan/31/how-to-make-your-own-milk-simple-sustainable-guide-oat-nuts-seeds\">make your own plant-based milk</a>.<br><br><strong>3. </strong>Try making things that you find difficult to source unpackaged, such as biscuits, granola, hummus, bread and pizza. Popcorn is easy to make from kernels.</p> <p><strong>4. </strong>See what food you can grow or forage from your surroundings. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/shortcuts/2019/jan/08/want-to-grow-own-veg-dont-have-space-microgreens\">Salad can be grown in window boxes</a>.</p> <p><strong>5. </strong>Get rid of the plastics in your bathroom by using a bar of soap instead of shower gel, and try shampoo refills or a shampoo bar. You can make your own <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/23/make-your-own-toothpaste-lotion-ingredients-environment\">toothpaste</a> and deodorant or source low-impact alternatives.</p> <p><strong>6. </strong>Reduce your sanitary waste with reusable washable cloth nappies rather than disposables. Use a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/24/people-revolted-mooncup-bust-period-taboos\">Mooncup</a>, reusable pads or special <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/06/heavy-flow-are-period-pants-the-revolutionary-solution-to-an-age-old-problem\">period pants</a> instead of single-use tampons or sanitary towels.</p> <p><strong>7. </strong>In the kitchen, try a loofah or coconut scrub for washing up rather than a sponge. They are natural, biodegradable and can be composted after use. Get refills of washing-up liquid and make your own simple cleaning spray for surfaces.</p> <p><strong>8. </strong>Ditch tissues, kitchen towel and makeup wipes and use hankies and washable cloth options instead.</p> <p><strong>9. </strong>Compost and recycle whatever you can and seek out extra local recycling points for items such as crisp packets, toothbrushes, textiles and batteries. Some supermarkets collect types of plastic that can\u2019t be put in household recycling.</p> <p><strong>10. </strong>Repair items before buying new ones. With things that are beyond repair, consider how you might be able to repurpose or reinvent them. For example, you could cut up old clothes to make beeswax wraps for food or fabric bags for collecting loose groceries.</p>",

Of course, at the moment I wouldn\u2019t ask them to refill my containers because everyone is taking hygiene precautions due to the coronavirus, but I still use the tubs for my regular grocery shopping. My recycling has increased during lockdown because I cannot reuse things as much as I normally would. One of the biggest lifestyle benefits has been using my local shops more. I used to go to the supermarket and self-checkout, but I have gained so much by talking to local shop owners and cashiers. We have also done a lot more cooking, especially making things that we can\u2019t buy without packaging. My husband learned to make chapatis and naan bread, and they taste better than the ones we bought in the shops \u2013 and he can make them in minutes. We make our own oat milk, which is so cheap and easy. I will buy a packet of biscuits occasionally because I don\u2019t have the time to make everything. Sometimes, I would get a bit militant. I would ask friends at parties: \u201cWhy did you buy that when it can\u2019t be recycled?\u201d Or I would find some plastic packaging in the house and text my husband saying: \u201cWhat is this?\u201d I have been called the zero-waste police. But now I am going a bit easier on myself and others. Overall, these changes have saved us a lot of money, mainly by reducing our consumption. We stopped buying stuff that we don\u2019t really need, but spend a little more on the things that we do buy. We have also eaten more healthily because we have bought less processed food. I am still putting my waste in a jar to keep it visible. I know that if there is a large bin in the room, people will use it. Cate Cody, jazz singer and Green councillor, Tewkesbury We haven\u2019t put our waste bin out for collection for more than three years, not since January 2017. My partner and I have one small metal bin in the kitchen and that\u2019s the only bin in the house. There\u2019s hardly anything in it, just occasional bits of non-recyclable plastic packaging, usually from gifts from well-meaning people. We try to bring in as little as possible, only buying what we need and secondhand wherever feasible, which tends to avoid packaging. We reuse, repurpose, recycle and compost. We get a weekly veg box full of local, seasonal produce. I forage too, for things such as nettles and wild garlic. We grow our own salad, which is very easy and quick to grow. Our rocket sprouts up between paving slabs. We buy other food, such as pasta, rice and pulses, in bulk from an ethical cooperative wholesaler called Suma. We get a delivery every couple of months that we share with five other friends. Our oats come in a 10kg paper sack. The toilet paper comes in biodegradable packaging that goes into the compost, and there\u2019s biodegradable dental floss too. We use loofahs instead of regular sponges for washing up because they are made from a natural material and can be composted afterwards. They are more expensive, but we find they last longer, so the costs are not so different. Once you start to reduce your waste, you notice the outstanding things still going into the bin and then seek alternatives to them. When you put your mind to it, you can find a solution for nearly everything. One challenge was what to do with an old bike inner tube. I considered a few possibilities and eventually made it into a tool belt. I hated toothpaste tubes going to landfill, so I started making my own toothpaste by mixing bicarbonate of soda with coconut and peppermint oil. It is very different, but it works. That said, we have now made Tewkesbury town hall into a collection point for recycling toothpaste tubes so that others needn\u2019t end up in the bin. I never buy wrapping paper. For close friends and family I will use a scarf or a table cloth and they usually give it back afterwards. Recently, I wrapped a friend\u2019s present using recipes from a newspaper tied up with string and explained that the recipes (chosen especially) were part of the present. They loved it. I happily use a bar of soap instead of shower gel and wouldn\u2019t look back. The gel often slid straight down the plughole anyway. A decent soap lasts much longer. Instead of kitchen roll, I use old cloth, and rather than makeup wipes, I use a small hankie or a piece of cloth. These can all be washed. I don\u2019t miss the things that I have given up. It is not about loss, it is about what you gain. I derive real satisfaction from not throwing things away and I have gained skills by learning to make things myself. It is also about owning fewer things; if I want to read a book, I will order it from the library. I might have to wait longer for it, so there is less instant gratification, but it can feel like being a child waiting for Christmas and it is all the more rewarding when it arrives. As a jazz singer I recycle songs, and in the rest of my life I try to recycle everything else. Claudi Williams, workshop manager for the Beeswax Wrap Co, Stroud I was frustrated by the amount of plastic in my life, so in 2016 I decided to try not buying any for a year. It was a steep learning curve for me, my husband and our two sons but, after a few months, our waste went down to almost nothing. It has become our new normal. It was hard at first because we were used to the convenience of buying stuff at the last minute and we couldn\u2019t do that any more. Now we have a routine, cooking every day and making our own packed lunches. The first thing we ask ourselves is: \u201cDo we need this?\u201d The second is: \u201cHow can I get this unpackaged?\u201d Can we make it ourselves? Can we get it secondhand? Can we borrow it? Buying unpackaged food tends to make you buy more local, seasonal food, which also reduces your food miles, thereby creating a virtuous circle. We buy food from the farmers\u2019 market and local shops. When we started, I did a little audit around the house to see how many cleaning products we were using and the result was staggering. We are led to believe that we need a different product for every single thing we clean, but actually you can clean nearly everything effectively with bicarbonate of soda, vinegar, lemons and a simple soap. Now I just use soap and a brush and make my own spray with vinegar for things such as tiles, mirrors and sinks. The whole journey has been one of simplifying further and further. Bicarb is a great thing to have around \u2013 for example, you can sprinkle it into tea-stained cups to remove the stains. You can make so many things from basic ingredients, and finding new solutions is hugely empowering. For instance, when we needed windscreen wiper liquid for the car, I found a really easy recipe on the internet that cost only a few pence to make. I make my own toothpaste and deodorant, which only takes five minutes. For shampoo, I buy Faith in Nature refills or a bar from Mind the Trash. I use a metal safety razor for shaving. I get toilet paper from a subscription service called Greencane that sends out 48 unpackaged rolls in a cardboard box. I love herbal teas and was scrambling around for loose tea and then I realised that there were plants in my garden that I could pick fresh and use. You have to switch your brain away from consumption and realise what is in your environment. I dry herbs such as chamomile and peppermint to use in the winter months by tying bunches in a posy and hanging them upside down in a cupboard. Living like this has really changed me. Ultimately, we simply live with less stuff. I used to pop things into my supermarket trolley on impulse, but now I have a totally different relationship with what I want and need. I feel much more self-reliant and smarter about how I shop. I consider every purchase a vote. 10 easy ways to start reducing your waste 1. Buy less stuff. If you have to buy furniture, clothes or tools and whatever else, try to get it secondhand, or borrow rather than buy. 2. For groceries, choose loose and unpackaged fruit and vegetables. Take your own reusable containers and bags to markets or deli counters to get things such as olives, cheese and bread package-free. Buy milk in returnable glass bottles or make your own plant-based milk. 3. Try making things that you find difficult to source unpackaged, such as biscuits, granola, hummus, bread and pizza. Popcorn is easy to make from kernels. 4. See what food you can grow or forage from your surroundings. Salad can be grown in window boxes. 5. Get rid of the plastics in your bathroom by using a bar of soap instead of shower gel, and try shampoo refills or a shampoo bar. You can make your own toothpaste and deodorant or source low-impact alternatives. 6. Reduce your sanitary waste with reusable washable cloth nappies rather than disposables. Use a Mooncup, reusable pads or special period pants instead of single-use tampons or sanitary towels. 7. In the kitchen, try a loofah or coconut scrub for washing up rather than a sponge. They are natural, biodegradable and can be composted after use. Get refills of washing-up liquid and make your own simple cleaning spray for surfaces. 8. Ditch tissues, kitchen towel and makeup wipes and use hankies and washable cloth options instead. 9. Compost and recycle whatever you can and seek out extra local recycling points for items such as crisp packets, toothbrushes, textiles and batteries. Some supermarkets collect types of plastic that can\u2019t be put in household recycling. 10. Repair items before buying new ones. With things that are beyond repair, consider how you might be able to repurpose or reinvent them. For example, you could cut up old clothes to make beeswax wraps for food or fabric bags for collecting loose groceries.",

I tend to curate \u2013 not because I\u2019m dictatorial, but because she\u2019s not that interested in doing deep-dives to see what\u2019s just popped up on Amazon Prime. My go-to are thrillers. We recently had an impromptu season of 90s Harrison Ford movies including The Fugitive, Patriot Games and Presumed Innocent. I miss those classy, well-made, intelligent thrillers with good leading actors. I could watch one of those every night. Feels like something Netflix should be making.

This is almost a textbook definition of stereotyping \u2013 inferring a particular behaviour from the ethnicity of an individual without knowing anything about that individual other than their ethnicity.</p> <p>\u201cData is useful and can give helpful pointers about what is going on and who, in general, might be doing it.

      "bodyText": "The involvement of Trevor Phillips\u2019 consultancy in the inquiry into Covid-19\u2019s impact on ethnic minorities has run into fresh controversy after it emerged its software has been used to identify whether different ethnic groups \u201cspecialise\u201d in particular types of crime. Prof Richard Webber, Phillips\u2019 partner in the firm Webber Phillips, says its Origins programme \u2013 which identifies people\u2019s ethnicity/religion on the basis of their names \u2013 helps to ensure police investigations are \u201cnot based on stereotyping but on hard evidence\u201d. Critics argue it promotes stereotypes and stigmatisation. Writing about Origins in the industry journal Police Professional in 2017, Webber said it was wrong to lump different ethnic groups together. \u201cJust as each community develops legitimate means of acquiring wealth, it would be surprising if there were not a parallel specialisation in forms of criminality,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSometimes these go together; as, for instance, where the minority population most likely to run petrol stations is also the one that is most proficient in ATM fraud; or when those who run taxi services have the best opportunities to engage in abuse of young girls.\u201d In another article, on neighbourhoodalert.co.uk, he wrote that, while arguments that differences in behaviour are due to differences in opportunity and treatment \u201cno doubt have some validity, it is not unreasonable to recognise that different cultures do foster differences in behaviour among their members\u201d. He added: \u201cAlthough not all members of any minority behave in exactly the same way, it is legitimate to argue that deep seated attitudes do exist which characterise some communities and religions more than others, especially if these differences can be evidenced from operational data.\u201d Webber, who wrote that he had no desire \u201cto link particular criminal activities with particular communities publicly\u201d, said that a dozen or so police forces have used Origins. Last month, Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, and Webber, a visiting fellow at Newcastle University, were asked by Public Health England to investigate why coronavirus is leading to more deaths among black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities. The selection of Phillips had already provoked controversy because of his suspension from the Labour party in March over allegations of Islamophobia, including a reference to UK Muslims as being \u201ca nation within a nation\u201d. Critics said the way Origins has been used and promoted in policing further discredited Webber Phillips\u2019 role in the coronavirus inquiry. A spokesperson for the Institute of Race Relations thinktank said Origins was \u201cbuilt and marketed to police forces and others with a specific purpose in mind\u201d. The spokesperson added: \u201cIn turn, these data-driven identification technologies and databases can replicate racialised stereotypes and reinforce institutionalised prejudices. \u201cWe believe that the appointment of Phillips sends all the wrong signals, precisely because of the way he has interpreted ethnic data in the past, to suggest that \u2018aspects of minority disadvantage may be self-inflicted\u2019. To put it simply, he appears reluctant to trace, as most researchers do, the basis of racial inequality in societal, structural issues in favour of interpretations that focus on a cultural deficit within the groups that are \u2018failing\u2019.\u201d In the Police Professional article, Webber referred to \u201cmelting pot\u201d London boroughs such as Haringey, Waltham Forest and Newham as a \u201cTower of Babel\u201d, a description Phillips was criticised for using with respect to Grenfell Tower. Webber wrote that in such areas \u201cit was not obvious who the leaders of any minority community are \u2013 or who might be controlling criminal networks\u201d. Dal Babu, who was one of the UK\u2019s most senior Asian officers when he retired as chief superintendent for Harrow in north-west London in 2013, said: \u201cThey suggest that different cultures foster differences in behaviour and so different communities act differently. This is almost a textbook definition of stereotyping \u2013 inferring a particular behaviour from the ethnicity of an individual without knowing anything about that individual other than their ethnicity. \u201cData is useful and can give helpful pointers about what is going on and who, in general, might be doing it. But no data system can do so on it\u2019s own, particularly one which the communities will view with suspicion.\u201d Phillips told HuffPost UK last month that the Origins system, which has been used by the Premier League and Yale University according to the programme\u2019s website, would be used in the Covid-19 inquiry. He said it had an accuracy rate of over 95% for identifying ethnic or cultural origin. Harun Khan, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: \u201cIt [the inquiry] should not seek advice from those who propagate racist stereotypes or cast aspersions on minorities - issues of direct relevance in the inquiry. \u201cThe grave concerns already voiced widely across BAME communities cannot be ignored, and we - alongside all those who have raised concerns - urge Public Health England to rethink these appointments, and focus on the evidence.\u201d Webber Phillips declined to comment. Public Health England said it was engaging a wide range of external experts and independent advisers.",

Similar courage can lead us to a healthier world in recovery.\u201d In the letter, the committee reminded the prime minister of Britain\u2019s role on the world stage. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, Cop26, scheduled for November but now postponed to next year. Johnson and the Cop26 president, the business secretary Alok Sharma, will be urging other countries to come forward with national plans to curb carbon. Deben and Brown said the UK must show leadership by linking the economic recovery and the climate crisis.\u201cOur credibility as an international leader rests on taking action at home,\u201d they said.",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s just six weeks since <a href=\"https://www.nhscharitiestogether.co.uk/\">NHS Charities Together </a>(NHSCT), the then little-known membership body for local health service fundraisers, launched a NHS coronavirus appeal in place of the <a href=\"https://nhsbigtea.co.uk/\">annual tea parties</a> that used to be its main money-spinner. It has since had to expand its team from four to 25 and has raised an astounding \u00a392m, sending it rocketing into the UK fundraising elite. </p> \n<p>For Ellie Orton, the organisation\u2019s chief executive, the transformation has been breathtaking. Last year, the tea parties raised \u00a3160,000. On the first day of the new appeal, she picked up the phone to a single offer of \u00a310m. \u201cIn terms of income, the profile and the understanding of NHS trusts and boards that charity could be a key partner \u2013 well, instead of accomplishing that in five years as we had hoped under our strategic plan, it\u2019s pretty much been done in five weeks,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>But the stunning turnaround brings challenges. Not the least, Orton knows, will be countering the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/giving-nhs-charity-fundraising-coronavirus-state-taxes\">suspicion</a> that the sudden outpouring of public monetary support for the NHS opens the door for the government to backslide on exchequer funding. If people\u2019s spontaneous generosity of recent days could be developed into long-term commitment, the Treasury would be very happy indeed. \u201cWe have a responsibility to continue to tell the story that the charities are here to help by providing support above and beyond [core funding],\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbiotic relationship: one doesn\u2019t replace the other.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/giving-nhs-charity-fundraising-coronavirus-state-taxes\">Giving is good \u2013 but we should never forget that the NHS is not a charity | David Ainsworth</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are 234 local NHS charities in the UK and many of them predate the founding of the health service in 1948. The biggest and most well-known is the <a href=\"https://www.gosh.org/about-us/our-fundraising\">Great Ormond Street Hospital Children\u2019s Charity</a>, which raised \u00a387m in 2018-19 to support the famous London children\u2019s hospital, but others are far smaller affairs measuring success in tens of thousands of pounds.

An <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291844/summary-report-final-301012.pdf\">official review</a> in 2012 concluded that \u201cthere is no hard and fast rule that charities must not subsidise or replace public services\u201d.</p> \n<p>Orton\u2019s organisation \u2013 itself a charity \u2013 was established in 2009 as the Association of NHS Charities, although founding members had been meeting informally since 2000 to swap campaign ideas and good practice.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to wind down the coronavirus wage-subsidy scheme for workers from July as part of government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures. In a sign of the mounting costs to the exchequer with almost a quarter of employees in Britain furloughed in the past fortnight, the chancellor is expected to announce that the Covid-19 job retention scheme will be steadily scaled back as restrictions on business activity are lifted. The Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy paid by the state to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration. Sources indicated that a final decision has yet to be made, but the Treasury was working closely with No 10 as Boris Johnson prepares to outline plans on Sunday to gradually lift lockdown restrictions. After more than a month of tight controls on social and business activity across Britain and in other countries around the world, the UK is on the brink of the deepest recession in living memory. Sunak is expected to announce details of the plan before the middle of May, because employers making more than 100 staff redundant must run a 45-day consultation before making any job cuts. With the furlough scheme due to close at the end of June, firms will need to start making decisions from as early as next week, piling pressure on the chancellor to provide refreshed guidelines or face a wave of potential job losses. Employers groups have called for the chancellor to make urgent changes to the scheme to remove the risk of a \u201ccliff edge\u201d closure to the wage subsidy programme at the end of June, warning that it risks becoming a \u201cwaiting room\u201d for redundancies otherwise. Sunak used a television interview on Monday to promise there would be no cliff edge. He told ITV: \u201cI\u2019m working, as we speak, to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and to ease people back into work in a measured way.\u201d Figures released this week by HMRC showed that a total of 6.3m jobs have been temporarily laid off by 800,000 companies, as firms across the country flock to take advantage of the job subsidy scheme. Launched on 20 April, the programme involves the Treasury paying 80% of the wages of workers up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 per month to prevent them being laid off by their employers. Given rapid take up of the scheme, the costs to the public purse have steadily spiralled into the billions. HMRC said the total value of claims so far amounted to \u00a38bn by 3 May. The government\u2019s tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has estimated that the scheme could cost \u00a342bn over three months if as many as 8.3 million people are furloughed at an 80% subsidy. It could cost a further \u00a312bn for each additional month at this level, according to the Resolution Foundation.",

The killer word is \u201cmost\u201d. Read between the lines and the conclusion is obvious: some universities won\u2019t make it. On the same day, Roehampton University announced a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoehamptonUCU/status/1257418143888261120?s=20\">plan to cut 15% of posts</a>. Even the institutions best equipped to survive are facing considerable pain. But the problems didn\u2019t start with coronavirus: it\u2019s just making an already bad situation worse.</p> <p>The immediate problem for universities is the prospect of a collapse in international student recruitment. Along with the loss of income from accommodation rentals and summer conferences, the resulting <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/10871/LE_report_on_covid19_and_university_finances/pdf/LEreportoncovid19anduniversityfinances\">financial black hole</a> is estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-uk-universities-face-25bn-tuition-fee-loss-next-year\">at least \u00a32.5bn</a>. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk as applicants consider whether attending university this autumn \u2013 when it\u2019s likely social distancing will still be in place \u2013 is their best option.</p> <p>The government\u2019s response addresses universities\u2019 immediate cashflow problem by bringing forward payments of research funding and tuition fees (which are not paid directly by students but come from government). It promises to fund up to 10,000 extra student places, half of them in health and social care. But that in no way fills the financial gap. In an effort to prevent poaching, universities have agreed not to increase their intake of home students by <a href=\"universities%20have%20agreed%20not%20to%20increase%20their%20intake%20of%20home%20students%20by%20more%20than%205%\">more than 5%</a>. This sounds a reasonable compromise, but a 5% increase to a cohort of 300 students at a large university could ripple through other institutions leaving the last in the chain with a devastating drop in numbers. Similar trends in recruitment following the removal of student number controls in 2015 have already left <a href=\"https://medium.com/ussbriefs/stockpiling-students-undergraduate-history-and-english-edition-ca65972ed823\">some departments</a> in crisis. It is not at all clear that the promised new rules to \u201cprevent destabilising behaviours\u201d will change the longer-term trend.</p> <p>On top of that, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/08/tuition-fees-cut-could-be-devastating-for-universities-say-peers\">research funding</a> has fallen by 12.8% in real terms since 2010. The gap has been filled, in part, by international students, who pay much higher fees than home undergraduates. The number of Chinese students in the UK <a href=\"https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-7976/\">increased by 62%</a> between 2011-12 and 2018-19. There were already concerns that the impact of Brexit and the hostile environment on international recruitment left some universities dangerously exposed \u2013 now thousands of those prospective international students may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\">stay</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/10/uk-universities-fear-huge-budget-holes-as-chinese-students-stay-home\"> at home this year</a>. With <a href=\"https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10342/Value-of-university-staff-pay-has-plummeted-in-last-decade-employers-own-research-reveals\">staff pay</a> squeezed in real terms since 2009, university managers have little room for manoeuvre.</p> <p>It is clear, moreover, that the government is unlikely to intervene if things go wrong. In November 2018 the head of the Office for Students, Michael Barber, warned that \u201cfailing institutions\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/06/failing-universities-bailouts-michael-barber-office-for-students\">could not expect a bailout</a>. The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805127/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf\">Augar </a><a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/805127/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf\">review</a> of higher education, which reported in May 2019, got limited attention amid the preoccupation with Brexit, and its headline proposal for a cut in tuition fees from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/aug/08/tuition-fees-cut-could-be-devastating-for-universities-say-peers\">\u00a39,250 to \u00a37,500 a year</a> was said to have been \u201cquietly shelved\u201d a few months later.</p> <p>The broader proposals, however, are still well worth a look. Augar was concerned about the amount of money universities were spending on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/apr/02/universities-spending-millions-on-marketing-to-attract-students\">marketing</a>: up to \u00a3500 per student. Marketing spend and investment in attractive campuses that appeal to open day visitors are predictable consequences of a highly competitive market, but they take vital cash away from education.</p> <p>Also prominent in the Augar review was a plan to clamp down on courses perceived to offer poor employment prospects and long-term earnings (with a note that nursing and teaching should be exceptions). But this failed to take account of the structural problems in access to high-earning jobs. It\u2019s well documented that working-class students face <a href=\"https://createlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Panic-Social-Class-Taste-and-Inequalities-in-the-Creative-Industries1.pdf\">particular barriers</a> to entry to the arts sector, for example. Even if a performing arts student never makes a full-time career of it, he might well make a big contribution to society by running a theatre group in his spare time, something that employment and earnings measure simply don\u2019t capture. Access to arts and culture online has kept many of us going through the lockdown. Let\u2019s not write these subjects off as low value.</p> <p>There is a good case for maintaining a strong university sector. The demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds that has exacerbated admissions problems for the past few years is about to end. More young people typically go to university during recessions. But without further support, their prospects are grim.</p> <p>Redundancies now mean there will be fewer experienced staff to teach and support students in future. There is a real risk that between the mergers of institutions in financial trouble (a likely prospect following the <a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/even-in-the-covid-crisis-universities-are-not-too-big-to-fail/\">precedent</a> of the further education sector) and the attacks on \u201clow value\u201d courses, student choice will suffer. That choice should not be just about who gets into the \u201cprestigious\u201d institutions, but about offering people across the country a good selection of local courses that suit their lives and learning style. Higher education is a public good: it would be a deep shame to approach this crisis with a focus on its price, rather than understanding its value.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Fletcher is professor of history at Manchester Metropolitan University<br></p>",

But the problems didn\u2019t start with coronavirus: it\u2019s just making an already bad situation worse. The immediate problem for universities is the prospect of a collapse in international student recruitment. Along with the loss of income from accommodation rentals and summer conferences, the resulting financial black hole is estimated to be at least \u00a32.5bn. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk as applicants consider whether attending university this autumn \u2013 when it\u2019s likely social distancing will still be in place \u2013 is their best option. The government\u2019s response addresses universities\u2019 immediate cashflow problem by bringing forward payments of research funding and tuition fees (which are not paid directly by students but come from government). It promises to fund up to 10,000 extra student places, half of them in health and social care. But that in no way fills the financial gap. In an effort to prevent poaching, universities have agreed not to increase their intake of home students by more than 5%. This sounds a reasonable compromise, but a 5% increase to a cohort of 300 students at a large university could ripple through other institutions leaving the last in the chain with a devastating drop in numbers. Similar trends in recruitment following the removal of student number controls in 2015 have already left some departments in crisis. It is not at all clear that the promised new rules to \u201cprevent destabilising behaviours\u201d will change the longer-term trend. On top of that, research funding has fallen by 12.8% in real terms since 2010. The gap has been filled, in part, by international students, who pay much higher fees than home undergraduates. The number of Chinese students in the UK increased by 62% between 2011-12 and 2018-19. There were already concerns that the impact of Brexit and the hostile environment on international recruitment left some universities dangerously exposed \u2013 now thousands of those prospective international students may stay at home this year. With staff pay squeezed in real terms since 2009, university managers have little room for manoeuvre. It is clear, moreover, that the government is unlikely to intervene if things go wrong. In November 2018 the head of the Office for Students, Michael Barber, warned that \u201cfailing institutions\u201d could not expect a bailout. The Augar review of higher education, which reported in May 2019, got limited attention amid the preoccupation with Brexit, and its headline proposal for a cut in tuition fees from \u00a39,250 to \u00a37,500 a year was said to have been \u201cquietly shelved\u201d a few months later. The broader proposals, however, are still well worth a look. Augar was concerned about the amount of money universities were spending on marketing: up to \u00a3500 per student. Marketing spend and investment in attractive campuses that appeal to open day visitors are predictable consequences of a highly competitive market, but they take vital cash away from education. Also prominent in the Augar review was a plan to clamp down on courses perceived to offer poor employment prospects and long-term earnings (with a note that nursing and teaching should be exceptions). But this failed to take account of the structural problems in access to high-earning jobs. It\u2019s well documented that working-class students face particular barriers to entry to the arts sector, for example. Even if a performing arts student never makes a full-time career of it, he might well make a big contribution to society by running a theatre group in his spare time, something that employment and earnings measure simply don\u2019t capture. Access to arts and culture online has kept many of us going through the lockdown. Let\u2019s not write these subjects off as low value. There is a good case for maintaining a strong university sector. The demographic dip in the number of 18-year-olds that has exacerbated admissions problems for the past few years is about to end. More young people typically go to university during recessions. But without further support, their prospects are grim. Redundancies now mean there will be fewer experienced staff to teach and support students in future. There is a real risk that between the mergers of institutions in financial trouble (a likely prospect following the precedent of the further education sector) and the attacks on \u201clow value\u201d courses, student choice will suffer. That choice should not be just about who gets into the \u201cprestigious\u201d institutions, but about offering people across the country a good selection of local courses that suit their lives and learning style. Higher education is a public good: it would be a deep shame to approach this crisis with a focus on its price, rather than understanding its value. \u2022 Catherine Fletcher is professor of history at Manchester Metropolitan University",

Close to 75% of the island\u2019s 147,000-plus population get their income from tourism, directly and indirectly \u2013 besides the fabled nightclub scene, there\u2019s the hotels, Airbnbs, restaurants, bars, shops, taxis, and other businesses that exist because of the pull of the clubs. But a huge question mark hangs over them all, with the clubs beginning to cancel their summer seasons due to coronavirus.</p> <p>So far H\u00ef Ibiza, Ushua\u00efa, Amnesia and Eden have all cancelled their May calendar. Pacha hosted a virtual house party with a promise to \u201c#seeyousoon\u201d; their latest <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pacha/photos/after-this-moments-respite-pacha-and-ibiza-will-look-even-more-beautiful-ibiza-s/10157208103430509/\">social media post</a> stating, \u201cAfter this moment\u2019s respite, Pacha and Ibiza will look even more beautiful.\u201d DC-10 have cancelled their opening party and said they are currently unable to confirm any future dates at the club. Privilege have yet to comment.</p> <p>Some hope that some semblance of a season may be possible. A campaign called Move Your Spring launched a few weeks ago to encourage holidaymakers to shift bookings to later in the year, with an extension of the season to November touted as a solution. It doesn\u2019t look good: Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced plans for a cautious de-escalation to a \u201cnueva normalidad\u201d, or new normal, planning to gradually reopen businesses over an eight-week period starting this week. But the plan is reliant on people adhering to guidelines and preventing a second outbreak, not going to nightclubs.</p> <p>Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong has been visiting the island since the late 1980s and hasn\u2019t missed a season since 1991. \u201cI work behind the scenes at Pacha and I think pretty much everybody\u2019s accepted now that there won\u2019t be a season, not as we know it anyway,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Tong explains that clubs with smaller capacities could open up with only local DJs playing. \u201cI think that\u2019s where everybody\u2019s at,\u201d he adds. \u201cCertainly all the major clubs have come to that conclusion, with a few exceptions where people are still thinking they\u2019re going to experience a miracle and defy the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6b2b18ddbc53c2cff06a56c4609dacdb1f6575d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b2b18ddbc53c2cff06a56c4609dacdb1f6575d/0_0_2500_1669/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd at Ibiza club night Glitterbox, pre-lockdown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The crowd at Ibiza club night Glitterbox, pre-lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Pinta/Glitterbox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So many other variables mean the chances of the season going ahead are slim. How will the clubs manage social distancing regulations? How many airlines will fly to the island, and will anyone want to board a plane? Even if they did, will they have the money? \u201cThe majority of the bums on seats in Ibiza are Brits, Germans, Dutch, from the working classes, who won\u2019t have the money and will be naturally very sceptical of travelling abroad this summer,\u201d says Ed Karney, director of Grade Management, whose operations have almost entirely halted as the artists they manage have been grounded.</p> <p>Besides the local businesses, many individuals who work on the island are freelance, using the money they make in the summer to live until the next season. The Spanish government have offered support to those in need, giving out low interest loans of up to \u20ac900 (\u00a3790) to cover rent \u2013 with six to 10 years to pay them back \u2013 plus a ban on evictions for six months. But during the winter a lot of the self-employed (autonomo, as they\u2019re known) business owners put their companies on pause so they don\u2019t have to pay social security fees while they\u2019re not in operation. This means they\u2019re not eligible for government assistance.</p> <p>Caritas, one of the main charities on the island, has reported queues for food packages. Supermarkets have set up makeshift food banks placing empty trolleys around their stores for people to donate items. Local charity Food for Ibiza supports about 25 families with food donations through the winter, but are extending their operation to continue through the summer. Crist\u00f3bal, a small outfit that has been supporting vulnerable members of the island\u2019s community for the last five years, has also reported an increase in demand for its services.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a side to Ibiza that people don\u2019t see, where people are already struggling,\u201d says Rakhee, a 38-year-old private chef who\u2019s been living and working in Ibiza for six years. \u201cIt can be a tough island to live on, especially in the winter time.\u201d Her business is taking a big hit ahead of what she had hoped would be a successful season and she will now compete with many others for a handful of jobs.</p> <p>A VIP concierge, who asked not to be named, highlighted the fragility of the \u201csummer on, winter off\u201d lifestyle. \u201cThe concierge guys are bricking it. One of my friends has this group from Kazakhstan. They\u2019ll come and spend about \u20ac300,000 in a week and that one job covers him for the year,\u201d he says. \u201cThese people can\u2019t come now. Most of these [concierges] make their money in the summer, go off travelling in the winter, spend all their money and come back the next summer to make it all again. They\u2019re in a really bad position.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c5f314bf0dd424a8b4ca57d6a4f76cc644d6259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c5f314bf0dd424a8b4ca57d6a4f76cc644d6259/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A near-empty beach in Ibiza.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A near-empty beach in Ibiza.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Iglesias/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Leah Timmins, director of Decadance Agency, has 38 dancers on her books who appear at the major clubs on the island. She says these performers will be the first thing to go as venues cut costs and scale down. \u201cIt\u2019s scary because rents are extortionate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to suck it up for five months here and make it work. In London you can stretch out your income annually and survive, but without those five months how are people going to pay up to \u20ac1,400 a month for a room? The government scheme won\u2019t even cover rent for some people.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Mandelbaum, owner of Octan, a medium-sized club that once belonged to UK franchise Sankeys, is sure the clubs will survive, explaining that most of them own their premises so won\u2019t have to worry about paying the rent even if they\u2019re empty all summer. \u201cThe biggest issue is all the little businesses that live around the nightclubs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see 15 bars along the same street as one of the main clubs, places that only open in the summer and stay afloat because people stop there for a drink on the way to a club. That\u2019s a big part of Ibiza, the small bars and the shops. I\u2019m expecting many of them to disappear.\u201d</p> <p>But people are coming together to support one another. As well as the charitable organisations, a recent livestream event called Ibiza Needs Ibiza Beats has so far raised more than \u20ac9,000 for the Red Cross; the crew at DC-10, one of the island\u2019s most respected and influential clubs, have donated money, masks and gloves to the island\u2019s hospital and a care home for the elderly. \u201cOur mission is to bring Ibiza back,\u201d says Nicola \u201cNick Love\u201d Benedetti, worldwide manager and director of DC-10 and Circoloco. \u201cNot just DC-10, not one restaurant or one other club, the priority needs to be all of us working together to save the island.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e05520bd1e1b8e248b3e96739e026e859d9e7f62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05520bd1e1b8e248b3e96739e026e859d9e7f62/0_582_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"DC-10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A slot at a big Ibiza club can launch a DJ\u2019s career ... DC-10.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: tzahiV/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A slot at DC-10 or other big clubs can launch a DJ\u2019s career, and hits get made in Ibiza, propelling producers into the limelight and allowing them to tour for years afterwards. Luke Neville, owner of PR firm Listen Up, works with record labels to build up the summer\u2019s big anthems months ahead of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve got those tunes sitting here and it\u2019s like, what are we going to do with them? Do we push them back to next summer?\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to sound great regardless but the only medium you\u2019re going to hear them through for now is livestreams.\u201d</p> <p>Livestreamed DJ sets have provided some solace for DJs and fans, but they can\u2019t substitute being on a dancefloor. \u201cGood music will always be good music but there\u2019s something about hearing a record and going, that was the tune me and my mates were listening to in Ibiza last summer,\u201d Neville says. As livestreaming continues to evolve, a more structured economic model will emerge \u2013 companies like Side Door, StageIt and Looped are helping artists monetise streams with ticketed access. Any income, though, is likely to pale in comparison with what can be earned on the road.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Woldring is head of MediaNanny, a Dutch PR firm that counts megastars David Guetta and Martin Garrix as well as Ibiza club Ushua\u00efa among its clients. She worked with Guetta on a livestream from downtown Miami that attracted more than 12m viewers and raised $700,000 (\u00a3565,000) for numerous charities. \u201cUshua\u00efa is doing a lot of research and considering the worst-case scenario. They\u2019re looking into opening a virtual club with the artists that they have,\u201d she says, explaining that everyone is trying to find a way of maintaining a presence: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to close your doors and not post anything on socials, it\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d IMS, the conference that signals the start of the season, is duly going online at the end of May.</p> <p>Ibiza\u2019s bloated VIP culture has come under scrutiny for years now, and local talent has been largely overlooked in favour of the big name international DJs. Year after year of heavy tourism has certainly put a lot of strain on the ecosystem, particularly its coastline, which saw a 60.8% increase in urbanisation between 1990 and 2012, according to a <a href=\"https://ibizapreservation.org/issues-of-concern/\">study by the Ibiza Preservation Fund</a>. But with many islanders set to endure the most difficult summer of their lives, it will now need the businesses and artists that have leveraged the fabled magic of Ibiza to lend them their support.</p> <p>\u201cIbiza has seen a lot of crises in its history, many people gave up on it years ago, thinking it was finished,\u201d says DC-10\u2019s Benedetti. \u201cBut it will stand up again, even after the pandemic, to prove that it was, is and always will be the magic island.\u201d</p>",

A campaign called Move Your Spring launched a few weeks ago to encourage holidaymakers to shift bookings to later in the year, with an extension of the season to November touted as a solution. It doesn\u2019t look good: Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced plans for a cautious de-escalation to a \u201cnueva normalidad\u201d, or new normal, planning to gradually reopen businesses over an eight-week period starting this week. But the plan is reliant on people adhering to guidelines and preventing a second outbreak, not going to nightclubs. Radio 1 DJ Pete Tong has been visiting the island since the late 1980s and hasn\u2019t missed a season since 1991. \u201cI work behind the scenes at Pacha and I think pretty much everybody\u2019s accepted now that there won\u2019t be a season, not as we know it anyway,\u201d he says. Tong explains that clubs with smaller capacities could open up with only local DJs playing. \u201cI think that\u2019s where everybody\u2019s at,\u201d he adds. \u201cCertainly all the major clubs have come to that conclusion, with a few exceptions where people are still thinking they\u2019re going to experience a miracle and defy the world.\u201d So many other variables mean the chances of the season going ahead are slim. How will the clubs manage social distancing regulations? How many airlines will fly to the island, and will anyone want to board a plane? Even if they did, will they have the money? \u201cThe majority of the bums on seats in Ibiza are Brits, Germans, Dutch, from the working classes, who won\u2019t have the money and will be naturally very sceptical of travelling abroad this summer,\u201d says Ed Karney, director of Grade Management, whose operations have almost entirely halted as the artists they manage have been grounded. Besides the local businesses, many individuals who work on the island are freelance, using the money they make in the summer to live until the next season. The Spanish government have offered support to those in need, giving out low interest loans of up to \u20ac900 (\u00a3790) to cover rent \u2013 with six to 10 years to pay them back \u2013 plus a ban on evictions for six months. But during the winter a lot of the self-employed (autonomo, as they\u2019re known) business owners put their companies on pause so they don\u2019t have to pay social security fees while they\u2019re not in operation. This means they\u2019re not eligible for government assistance. Caritas, one of the main charities on the island, has reported queues for food packages. Supermarkets have set up makeshift food banks placing empty trolleys around their stores for people to donate items. Local charity Food for Ibiza supports about 25 families with food donations through the winter, but are extending their operation to continue through the summer. Crist\u00f3bal, a small outfit that has been supporting vulnerable members of the island\u2019s community for the last five years, has also reported an increase in demand for its services. \u201cThere\u2019s a side to Ibiza that people don\u2019t see, where people are already struggling,\u201d says Rakhee, a 38-year-old private chef who\u2019s been living and working in Ibiza for six years. \u201cIt can be a tough island to live on, especially in the winter time.\u201d Her business is taking a big hit ahead of what she had hoped would be a successful season and she will now compete with many others for a handful of jobs. A VIP concierge, who asked not to be named, highlighted the fragility of the \u201csummer on, winter off\u201d lifestyle. \u201cThe concierge guys are bricking it. One of my friends has this group from Kazakhstan. They\u2019ll come and spend about \u20ac300,000 in a week and that one job covers him for the year,\u201d he says. \u201cThese people can\u2019t come now. Most of these [concierges] make their money in the summer, go off travelling in the winter, spend all their money and come back the next summer to make it all again. They\u2019re in a really bad position.\u201d Leah Timmins, director of Decadance Agency, has 38 dancers on her books who appear at the major clubs on the island. She says these performers will be the first thing to go as venues cut costs and scale down. \u201cIt\u2019s scary because rents are extortionate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to suck it up for five months here and make it work. In London you can stretch out your income annually and survive, but without those five months how are people going to pay up to \u20ac1,400 a month for a room? The government scheme won\u2019t even cover rent for some people.\u201d Phil Mandelbaum, owner of Octan, a medium-sized club that once belonged to UK franchise Sankeys, is sure the clubs will survive, explaining that most of them own their premises so won\u2019t have to worry about paying the rent even if they\u2019re empty all summer. \u201cThe biggest issue is all the little businesses that live around the nightclubs,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see 15 bars along the same street as one of the main clubs, places that only open in the summer and stay afloat because people stop there for a drink on the way to a club. That\u2019s a big part of Ibiza, the small bars and the shops. I\u2019m expecting many of them to disappear.\u201d But people are coming together to support one another. As well as the charitable organisations, a recent livestream event called Ibiza Needs Ibiza Beats has so far raised more than \u20ac9,000 for the Red Cross; the crew at DC-10, one of the island\u2019s most respected and influential clubs, have donated money, masks and gloves to the island\u2019s hospital and a care home for the elderly. \u201cOur mission is to bring Ibiza back,\u201d says Nicola \u201cNick Love\u201d Benedetti, worldwide manager and director of DC-10 and Circoloco. \u201cNot just DC-10, not one restaurant or one other club, the priority needs to be all of us working together to save the island.\u201d A slot at DC-10 or other big clubs can launch a DJ\u2019s career, and hits get made in Ibiza, propelling producers into the limelight and allowing them to tour for years afterwards. Luke Neville, owner of PR firm Listen Up, works with record labels to build up the summer\u2019s big anthems months ahead of the season. \u201cWe\u2019ve got those tunes sitting here and it\u2019s like, what are we going to do with them? Do we push them back to next summer?\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to sound great regardless but the only medium you\u2019re going to hear them through for now is livestreams.\u201d Livestreamed DJ sets have provided some solace for DJs and fans, but they can\u2019t substitute being on a dancefloor. \u201cGood music will always be good music but there\u2019s something about hearing a record and going, that was the tune me and my mates were listening to in Ibiza last summer,\u201d Neville says. As livestreaming continues to evolve, a more structured economic model will emerge \u2013 companies like Side Door, StageIt and Looped are helping artists monetise streams with ticketed access. Any income, though, is likely to pale in comparison with what can be earned on the road. Jos\u00e9 Woldring is head of MediaNanny, a Dutch PR firm that counts megastars David Guetta and Martin Garrix as well as Ibiza club Ushua\u00efa among its clients. She worked with Guetta on a livestream from downtown Miami that attracted more than 12m viewers and raised $700,000 (\u00a3565,000) for numerous charities. \u201cUshua\u00efa is doing a lot of research and considering the worst-case scenario. They\u2019re looking into opening a virtual club with the artists that they have,\u201d she says, explaining that everyone is trying to find a way of maintaining a presence: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to close your doors and not post anything on socials, it\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d IMS, the conference that signals the start of the season, is duly going online at the end of May. Ibiza\u2019s bloated VIP culture has come under scrutiny for years now, and local talent has been largely overlooked in favour of the big name international DJs. Year after year of heavy tourism has certainly put a lot of strain on the ecosystem, particularly its coastline, which saw a 60.8% increase in urbanisation between 1990 and 2012, according to a study by the Ibiza Preservation Fund. But with many islanders set to endure the most difficult summer of their lives, it will now need the businesses and artists that have leveraged the fabled magic of Ibiza to lend them their support. \u201cIbiza has seen a lot of crises in its history, many people gave up on it years ago, thinking it was finished,\u201d says DC-10\u2019s Benedetti. \u201cBut it will stand up again, even after the pandemic, to prove that it was, is and always will be the magic island.\u201d",

Edwards and Attorney-General\u2019s Department deputy secretary, Sarah Chidgey, could not give a \u201c100% guarantee\u201d that the data would not be accessed by US law enforcement but said they were extremely satisfied, based on legal advice from the Australian government solicitor, that the legislative guarantees and the operation of US law would mean it was extremely unlikely that data would be so accessed. \u201cI can give a guarantee that it is a criminal offence under Australian law,\u201d Chidgey said. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that that situation would happen.\u201d When asked whether law enforcement in Australia had asked for a backdoor to be built into the app for their own purposes under anti-encryption legislation, both Edwards and Brugeaud said this had not happened. Under that legislation, it is against the law to disclose whether such a request has been received. The Daily Telegraph reported on Wednesday that Strathfield council had ordered staff to download the app on their work phones, against the direction and legislation prohibiting that Australians be coerced into using it. Edwards said the health department was investigating the matter and may refer it to the police. Another issue that has been resolved is Telstra has now enabled SMS over wifi for newer iPhones and Android devices, so people who live in regional areas with poor mobile coverage will be able to get the registration text message.",

how those sent overseas were treated.</p> <p>\u201cYes, of course there are big human rights problems in Cuba \u2013 there have been since the start [of the revolution] and there are still problems.</p> <p>\u201cBut whatever their intentions are, and whatever they gain from those programmes, we need to recognise that they are doing a good job \u2026 It is having an impact,\u201d said Panichelli-Batalla, who has interviewed Cuban medical workers who have served in countries including Guatemala, Ethiopia, East Timor, Ghana, Brazil and Tanzania.</p> <p>\u201cThe work they do there is valued by the local people, it is valued by the local governments and it does make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>That seems to be the case in Italy, where <a

Local newspapers and politicians have celebrated the Cuban reinforcements. \u201cThe arrival of these professionals will \u2026 give a respite to the healthcare structure,\u201d the Diari d\u2019Andorra newspaper commented in a recent editorial. \u201cThis is excellent news,\u201d agreed another newspaper, Bondia, claiming Cuban doctors would save Andorra\u2019s health system from collapse. St\u00e9phanie Panichelli-Batalla, an academic at the University of Warwick who studies Cuba\u2019s medical diplomacy, said the humanitarian deployments were partly about rebranding communist Cuba in the international press. \u201cThey can\u2019t miss out on this opportunity \u2013 especially now that it\u2019s coming from Europe \u2013 because it gives even more visibility to the good that they do.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s White House \u2013 which has declared Cuba part of a Latin American \u201ctroika of tyranny\u201d alongside Nicaragua and Venezuela and has sought to strangle its economy \u2013 is unimpressed. The state department claims Cuban doctors and nurses are being abused and exploited in order to fill the coffers of an authoritarian regime. \u201cThe Cuban \u2018medical missions\u2019 are exploitation: a for-profit front used to fund the regime\u2019s repression and sow political discord,\u201d the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, tweeted last week. Panichelli-Batalla said there were legitimate concerns about Cuba\u2019s authoritarian system and how those sent overseas were treated. \u201cYes, of course there are big human rights problems in Cuba \u2013 there have been since the start [of the revolution] and there are still problems. \u201cBut whatever their intentions are, and whatever they gain from those programmes, we need to recognise that they are doing a good job \u2026 It is having an impact,\u201d said Panichelli-Batalla, who has interviewed Cuban medical workers who have served in countries including Guatemala, Ethiopia, East Timor, Ghana, Brazil and Tanzania. \u201cThe work they do there is valued by the local people, it is valued by the local governments and it does make a difference.\u201d That seems to be the case in Italy, where the first Cuban \u201cbrigada\u201d has been working since late March at a field hospital in Crema, a city in the northern region of Lombardy, where Covid-19 has killed more than 14,000 people. The second team \u2013 21 doctors and 16 nurses led by a kidney specialist who previously worked in the Venezuelan Amazon \u2013 touched down in Piedmont\u2019s capital, Turin, on 12 April to replace overworked Italian professionals. Other medical brigades have fanned out across the world to fight Covid-19 in 20 other countries, from South Africa to Suriname. Grimaldi, the Piedmont councillor, said the Cubans were a lesson to Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that a small island that will pay the consequences more than other countries because it lives mostly off tourism, and which has few inhabitants compared with big European countries, has managed to send 22 medical teams abroad,\u201d he said. \u201cHow wonderful it would be to see brigades from north or eastern Europe in Spain or Italy,\u201d Grimaldi added. \u201cBut for this people need to work together.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The harbour master on duty when the Ruby Princess docked in Sydney on 19 March offered to \u201cturn it around\u201d when he was called by the Australian Border Force expressing concerns about the ship, a special commission of inquiry has heard.</p> \n<p>The inquiry into the cruise ship, which has been linked to 21 deaths and almost 700 cases of Covid-19, also heard that the ship was \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because coronavirus swabs on board needed urgent testing, and that a sick passenger was taken by ambulance<strong> </strong>\u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d of Royal Prince Alfred hospital.</p> \n<p>Here are the main development\u2019s from Wednesday\u2019s evidence.</p> \n<h2>Harbour master called by Border Force</h2> \n<p>Cameron Butchart, the port services manager and duty harbour master for the NSW Port Authority, told the inquiry he had \u201ca concern for the occupational health and safety\u201d of sending a pilot on board to help the ship dock, because of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>He said on the night of 18 March and again on 19 March he was called by representatives of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis particular person certainly had concerns with the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI used the phrase on the night \u2018turn it around\u2019 [which] was probably the simplest way to explain it to someone on shoreside.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we more than likely could have held the ship in a certain position. We could have dropped an anchor ... to allow us to gather some more facts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Commissioner Bret Walker SC asked Butchart: \u201cHad you ever experienced anything like that before?\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cNever,\u201d Butchart said.</p> \n<p>The inquiry heard on Tuesday that the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock after a second call from the same Border Force officer.</p> \n<p>Butchart rejected the idea that Home Affairs and Border Force were \u201cnot decision makers\u201d and said they \u201cwould have been working very closely with biosecurity in making this decision\u201d to let the ship dock.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, told a separate Senate inquiry the officer \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the harbour master what he or she should or shouldn\u2019t do. They\u2019ve got no legislated authority to do that\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Wednesday the port agent for Carnival Australia, the operator of the Ruby Princess, told the inquiry ABF officers were \u201caware\u201d that 11 passengers were in isolation on board with influenza-like illnesses.</p> \n<p>Dobrila Tokovic said she met three ABF officers and one from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment at 6am on 19 March and \u201c[the ABF] asked me about the people in isolation\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were aware of them already,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me about where they were, were they isolated. I was advised that they didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said it was \u201cnot unusual for ABF officers to not want to see passengers who may be unwell\u201d, and they could collect cards and details without coming face-to-face.</p> \n<h2>Paramedic taken to \u2018Covid-designated\u2019 area</h2> \n<p>The inquiry also heard testimony from two parademics who attended the ship on 19 March to take two passengers directly to hospital.</p> \n<p>Trainee paramedic Simeon Pridmore said he wrote in his case description that \u201con board testing showed negative for influenza and [the patient was] suspected Covid\u201d.</p> \n<p>Pridmore said the ambulance he was in was taken<strong> </strong>\u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when it arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Tokovic<strong> </strong>said the ship\u2019s doctor, Ilse von Watzdorf, told her the ambulances were for patients with \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves, rather than Covid-19.</p> \n<p>She was questioned on why the patients were taken to RPA rather than St Vincent\u2019s, which was the usual hospital used for cruise ship passengers.</p> \n<p>Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, said a transcript of her call showed she told paramedics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by New South Wales [sic] to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tokovic told the inquiry: \u201cWe always select St Vincent\u2019s, as just a common, \u2018please send them to St Vincent\u2019s\u2019\u201d.</p> \n<p>Beasley told the inquiry Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and asked if Tokovic if she recalled discussing that fact.</p> \n<p>Tokovic said she did not recall.</p> \n<h2>Passenger was on oxygen support</h2> \n<p>Another paramedic, Mathew Symonds, told the inquiry that when he boarded the ship and went to its medical centre on 19 March, one of the passengers was receiving oxygen treatment using \u201cnasal prongs\u201d, also known as an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d.</p> \n<p>Tokovic had earlier told the inquiry that when paramedics boarded the ship, she heard the on-board doctor discuss one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said</p> \n<p>Symonds said he then provided the patient with oxygen while transporting her, and the woman had had an oxygen saturation of 94%, which \u201cwith a comorbidity of emphysema\u201d would \u201cnot strike me as odd\u201d.</p> \n<p>The woman later tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital.</p> \n<p>In a written statement, Symonds said that when he boarded, the ship\u2019s doctor or nurse said other passengers had already left the ship and gone to hospital to get tested for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Walker asked Symonds if he could have been confused and been told that \u201cswabs\u201d rather than passengers \u201chad been disembarked for testing\u201d. Symonds said that was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d the case.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>\u2018Not a Covid ship\u2019</h2> \n<p>The inquiry also heard from Robert Rybanic, the senior manager of cruise and terminal operations at NSW Port Authority, who said that Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told him the ship was \u201cnot a Covid ship\u201d and \u201cit was basically business as usual\u201d.</p> \n<p>Rybanic told the inquiry he spoke to Mifsud on the phone and Mifsud \u201ccould not explain at all why the ship docked\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe [Mifsud] said that NSW Health had deemed the ship low risk,\u201d Rybanic said. \u201cHe said it was not a Covid ship, that the booking of ambulances were not related to Covid.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Ship \u2018hurried\u2019 back for tests \u2013 which were delayed by 16 hours</h2> \n<p>The inquiry heard the Ruby Princess \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because it had Covid-19 swabs that needed urgent testing, and as a result Border Force officers were not present when it docked.</p> \n<p>Tokovic told the inquiry the ship was scheduled to dock at 6am, but came in at 3am.</p> \n<p>\u201c[The ABF] are present on the basis of the scheduled disembarkation time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would not have been on site until 6am.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, she said she called an ABF manager to \u201cnotify them the vessel is coming in earlier\u201d and told them that two passengers needed immediate ambulance transfers to hospital.</p> \n<p>But the inquiry <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/05/ruby-princess-was-initially-refused-permission-to-dock-over-coronavirus-fears-inquiry-told\">heard the previous day</a> that the Covid-19 test results from the swabs were delayed by 16 hours because the laboratory did not prioritise them.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Beasley told the inquiry that after the delay, the swabs were put through testing and the results came back at 8am on 20 March.</p> \n<p>The inquiry, overseen by Bret Walker SC, continues on Friday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The harbour master on duty when the Ruby Princess docked in Sydney on 19 March offered to \u201cturn it around\u201d when he was called by the Australian Border Force expressing concerns about the ship, a special commission of inquiry has heard. The inquiry into the cruise ship, which has been linked to 21 deaths and almost 700 cases of Covid-19, also heard that the ship was \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because coronavirus swabs on board needed urgent testing, and that a sick passenger was taken by ambulance \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d of Royal Prince Alfred hospital. Here are the main development\u2019s from Wednesday\u2019s evidence. Harbour master called by Border Force Cameron Butchart, the port services manager and duty harbour master for the NSW Port Authority, told the inquiry he had \u201ca concern for the occupational health and safety\u201d of sending a pilot on board to help the ship dock, because of Covid-19. He said on the night of 18 March and again on 19 March he was called by representatives of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force. \u201cThis particular person certainly had concerns with the situation,\u201d he said. \u201cI used the phrase on the night \u2018turn it around\u2019 [which] was probably the simplest way to explain it to someone on shoreside. \u201cBut we more than likely could have held the ship in a certain position. We could have dropped an anchor ... to allow us to gather some more facts.\u201d Commissioner Bret Walker SC asked Butchart: \u201cHad you ever experienced anything like that before?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d Butchart said. The inquiry heard on Tuesday that the Ruby Princess was allowed to dock after a second call from the same Border Force officer. Butchart rejected the idea that Home Affairs and Border Force were \u201cnot decision makers\u201d and said they \u201cwould have been working very closely with biosecurity in making this decision\u201d to let the ship dock. On Tuesday the Border Force commissioner, Michael Outram, told a separate Senate inquiry the officer \u201cdidn\u2019t tell the harbour master what he or she should or shouldn\u2019t do. They\u2019ve got no legislated authority to do that\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday the port agent for Carnival Australia, the operator of the Ruby Princess, told the inquiry ABF officers were \u201caware\u201d that 11 passengers were in isolation on board with influenza-like illnesses. Dobrila Tokovic said she met three ABF officers and one from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment at 6am on 19 March and \u201c[the ABF] asked me about the people in isolation\u201d. \u201cThey were aware of them already,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me about where they were, were they isolated. I was advised that they didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d She said it was \u201cnot unusual for ABF officers to not want to see passengers who may be unwell\u201d, and they could collect cards and details without coming face-to-face. Paramedic taken to \u2018Covid-designated\u2019 area The inquiry also heard testimony from two parademics who attended the ship on 19 March to take two passengers directly to hospital. Trainee paramedic Simeon Pridmore said he wrote in his case description that \u201con board testing showed negative for influenza and [the patient was] suspected Covid\u201d. Pridmore said the ambulance he was in was taken \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when it arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. Earlier, Tokovic said the ship\u2019s doctor, Ilse von Watzdorf, told her the ambulances were for patients with \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves, rather than Covid-19. She was questioned on why the patients were taken to RPA rather than St Vincent\u2019s, which was the usual hospital used for cruise ship passengers. Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, said a transcript of her call showed she told paramedics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by New South Wales [sic] to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred.\u201d Tokovic told the inquiry: \u201cWe always select St Vincent\u2019s, as just a common, \u2018please send them to St Vincent\u2019s\u2019\u201d. Beasley told the inquiry Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and asked if Tokovic if she recalled discussing that fact. Tokovic said she did not recall. Passenger was on oxygen support Another paramedic, Mathew Symonds, told the inquiry that when he boarded the ship and went to its medical centre on 19 March, one of the passengers was receiving oxygen treatment using \u201cnasal prongs\u201d, also known as an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d. Tokovic had earlier told the inquiry that when paramedics boarded the ship, she heard the on-board doctor discuss one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d with them. \u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said Symonds said he then provided the patient with oxygen while transporting her, and the woman had had an oxygen saturation of 94%, which \u201cwith a comorbidity of emphysema\u201d would \u201cnot strike me as odd\u201d. The woman later tested positive for Covid-19 and died in hospital. In a written statement, Symonds said that when he boarded, the ship\u2019s doctor or nurse said other passengers had already left the ship and gone to hospital to get tested for Covid-19. Walker asked Symonds if he could have been confused and been told that \u201cswabs\u201d rather than passengers \u201chad been disembarked for testing\u201d. Symonds said that was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d the case. \u2018Not a Covid ship\u2019 The inquiry also heard from Robert Rybanic, the senior manager of cruise and terminal operations at NSW Port Authority, who said that Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told him the ship was \u201cnot a Covid ship\u201d and \u201cit was basically business as usual\u201d. Rybanic told the inquiry he spoke to Mifsud on the phone and Mifsud \u201ccould not explain at all why the ship docked\u201d. \u201cHe [Mifsud] said that NSW Health had deemed the ship low risk,\u201d Rybanic said. \u201cHe said it was not a Covid ship, that the booking of ambulances were not related to Covid.\u201d Ship \u2018hurried\u2019 back for tests \u2013 which were delayed by 16 hours The inquiry heard the Ruby Princess \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney because it had Covid-19 swabs that needed urgent testing, and as a result Border Force officers were not present when it docked. Tokovic told the inquiry the ship was scheduled to dock at 6am, but came in at 3am. \u201c[The ABF] are present on the basis of the scheduled disembarkation time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would not have been on site until 6am.\u201d However, she said she called an ABF manager to \u201cnotify them the vessel is coming in earlier\u201d and told them that two passengers needed immediate ambulance transfers to hospital. But the inquiry heard the previous day that the Covid-19 test results from the swabs were delayed by 16 hours because the laboratory did not prioritise them. On Wednesday Beasley told the inquiry that after the delay, the swabs were put through testing and the results came back at 8am on 20 March. The inquiry, overseen by Bret Walker SC, continues on Friday.",

How good that makes library services look to their councils.\u201d</p> <p>Being able to prove the value of services to their communities, and being appreciated by local politicians, is welcome news for many libraries after years of cuts \u2013 in the year to March 2018, <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/news/austerity-sends-library-spending-tumbling-296-35-more-close-1130326\">127 British libraries closed</a>, with 35 more closures the following year. </p> <p>There has also been investment during the crisis.

In Gateshead, where libraries recently became part of the council\u2019s public health service, a small dedicated team began by printing face mask valves for local hospital staff and has now moved on to produce visors for local care homes, using a network of 3D printers in libraries and people\u2019s homes.</p> <p>\u201cThe team has now delivered nearly 2,200 visors to more than 50 different local care homes,\u201d says Stephen Walters, Gateshead council\u2019s principal library manager. \u201cThe appreciation has been overwhelming.

The sudden switch from a physical space to online has been challenging for staff and users, but has also highlighted the vital role of library services and the skills of staff. From Orkney\u2019s Lego challenge to Truro\u2019s storytime at home sessions, librarians are coming up with innovative ways to stay engaged with users and each other. While many library staff have been redeployed to emergency roles with their councils, such as working on telephone helplines, packing and distributing care packages, and working as registrars, those still in their core roles are seeing demand leap for all kinds of digital services. Online borrowing has soared since 23 March, when the UK went into lockdown. Hampshire, for instance, has reported a 770% increase in uptake of its digital services. In east Yorkshire, library staff are working with a local radio station to encourage children to join their Big Spring Read-In, while Manchester libraries are running a creative challenge for young people. In Suffolk, a new online advice service has been launched. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget what we do as public librarians, which is provide information you can trust,\u201d explains Krystal Vittles, head of Suffolk library service delivery. \u201cSome question why we need librarians for this when we have the internet, but even the most internet-savvy people are worried about what to trust, and we are trained for this.\u201d It also enables staff to have a conversation, albeit online, with people as they would in real life. \u201cWe can have a bit of a laugh with the customers.\u201d Librarians are using social media to share lighter moments with one another, too, such as a Twitter conversation about interesting bookmarks they\u2019ve found in library books, including an After Eight mint still in its wrapper and a Blockbuster card (\u201ca proper ancient artefact\u201d). Staff and readers are also creating huge amounts of online content, with one rhyme time by a library regular shielding at home reaching more than 2,000 views. Librarian Ian Anstice, editor of Public Libraries News, has written that the pandemic has highlighted the ingenuity and ability of library staff. \u201cCovid-19 has been to library services the equivalent of what the second world war was to arms manufacturing,\u201d he writes. \u201cSuddenly, within a week in lots of cases, librarians have switched to online services. How good that makes library services look to their councils.\u201d Being able to prove the value of services to their communities, and being appreciated by local politicians, is welcome news for many libraries after years of cuts \u2013 in the year to March 2018, 127 British libraries closed, with 35 more closures the following year. There has also been investment during the crisis. Arts Council England has announced a \u00a31,000 grant for each of the 151 public library services in England to help them purchase new digital stock. Libraries are finding innovative ways to use resources, including using 3D printers and laser cutters to produce PPE equipment. In Gateshead, where libraries recently became part of the council\u2019s public health service, a small dedicated team began by printing face mask valves for local hospital staff and has now moved on to produce visors for local care homes, using a network of 3D printers in libraries and people\u2019s homes. \u201cThe team has now delivered nearly 2,200 visors to more than 50 different local care homes,\u201d says Stephen Walters, Gateshead council\u2019s principal library manager. \u201cThe appreciation has been overwhelming. One home applauded the driver as he made deliveries.\u201d Walters says staff have been working flat out. \u201cI felt like a Victorian mill owner,\u201d he says. \u201cThey even had to be persuaded to take Sundays off.\u201d As in other areas, some of Gateshead\u2019s library staff have been redeployed. One employee helped a resident get his utilities restored after they had been off for weeks. \u201cLibrary employees are perfectly suited to this new role,\u201d says Walters. \u201cThey are inherently creative and positive, and deal with diverse customer needs through their normal work. This is just a greatly enhanced version of what they do day to day.\u201d",

It comes amid higher testing rates in Victoria, far ahead of any other state, with 100,000 tests being conducted in a two-week period. South Australia marks two weeks with no cases South Australia recorded no new confirmed cases of coronavirus for two weeks. Western Australia has recorded no new confirmed cases in a week, and the ACT also reported no new confirmed cases. Government admits issues with Covidsafe app on iPhones The Digital Transformation Agency told a Senate committee hearing that the Covid-19 contact tracing app, Covidsafe, is less effective on iPhones when the phone is locked, or the app is running in the background. The operation also differs on older iPhones. The government is working on a fix for this with Apple but it will be at least two weeks before the iPhone version works as well as the Android version of the app. More than 5.1 million Australians have downloaded and registered on the app. Andrew Constance withdraws from Eden-Monaro race Less than 24 hours after announcing his candidacy for the federal seat of Eden-Monaro, the New South Wales transport minister, Andrew Constance, has withdrawn from the race, citing the need to focus on bushfire recovery efforts in the area, and work on public transport and roads in NSW. He later blamed being \u201csidelined\u201d by the NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro, who was also going to run in the seat but pulled out, and had some colourful descriptors of the minister splashed in one of the state\u2019s tabloid newspapers. \u201cWhen I said politics is stuffed in this country, and some of the people in it need to have a long hard look, I meant it,\u201d Constance said. \u201cWe\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Telegraph. I mean, stuff that. I mean, like, seriously. I hadn\u2019t signed up to, you know, contest federally to be called that type of smear.\u201d Regulator threatens Newmarch\u2019s licence The aged-care regulator has threatened to revoke the operating licence of Newmarch House, the western Sydney aged-care facility suffering a fatal outbreak of Covid-19. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission issued a notice to Anglicare, Newmarch\u2019s operator, that it must \u201cdemonstrate to the Commission that the serious risk to care recipients at the Service has been effectively addressed\u201d. Newmarch has until 5pm on Thursday to agree to the requests from the regulator. Carnival Australia manager could not explain why Ruby Princess docked A NSW Port Authority senior manager has told an inquiry that the manager of Carnival Australia \u201ccould not explain at all why the ship docked\u201d when the Ruby Princess returned to Sydney on 19 March. Robert Rybanic, the senior manager of cruise and terminal operations at NSW Port Authority, said Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told him \u201cit was basically business as usual\u201d. \u201cHe said that NSW Health had deemed the ship low risk,\u201d Rybanic told a special inquiry into the ship. \u201cHe said it was not a Covid ship, that the booking of ambulances were not related to Covid.\u201d What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?

Funds raised will be directed to the families of the deceased and collateral Covid-19 casualties with lost livelihoods.</p> <p>With other old favourites including Robbie Mustoe, Craig Hignett and Nick Barmby on the invitation list, it promises to combine a wonderful wallow in nostalgia and 90 minutes of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. Or, more particularly, what might have been had Robson\u2019s team not been relegated in 1997 as they achieved an unwanted hat-trick, also featuring losing appearances to Chelsea and Leicester in the FA and League Cup finals.</p> <p>Relegation could have been avoided had Boro not made the calamitous decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/dec/19/tony-parkes-blackburn-middlesbrough-flu\">pull out of a Premier League game at Blackburn</a> in December 1996 with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice.</p> <p>The Football Association was unimpressed by claims of a rapidly violent flu epidemic and deducted three points. After Boro ended up two points in arrears of fourth-bottom Coventry, Juninho and Ravanelli departed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Marseille respectively.</p> <p>It was as if a light had been flicked off. Suddenly the gorgeous Juninho pass that prefaced Fj\u00f8rtoft scoring in the 1-1 draw with Leeds and marked the Brazilian\u2019s Riverside debut appeared depressingly distant.</p> <p>A couple of years earlier Juninho\u2019s mother had felt equivalent excitement about her introduction to Middlesbrough. She was so taken with the exoticism of Marks &amp; Spencer that club officials were asked to house her son next door to its Aladdin\u2019s cave of shopping possibilities.

It will pit Robson\u2019s class of 1995-99 against a mix of McClaren\u2019s League Cup-winning, Uefa Cup final-reaching 2004-2006 teams and Aitor Karanka\u2019s 2015-16 promotion side. Given the intention is to play in front of a 30,000-plus full house, the date remains necessarily flexible. When kick-off comes, Juninho, Ravanelli and Jan Aage Fj\u00f8rtoft should star for Robson\u2019s old boys, and Karanka has volunteered to coach the opposition. Funds raised will be directed to the families of the deceased and collateral Covid-19 casualties with lost livelihoods. With other old favourites including Robbie Mustoe, Craig Hignett and Nick Barmby on the invitation list, it promises to combine a wonderful wallow in nostalgia and 90 minutes of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d. Or, more particularly, what might have been had Robson\u2019s team not been relegated in 1997 as they achieved an unwanted hat-trick, also featuring losing appearances to Chelsea and Leicester in the FA and League Cup finals. Relegation could have been avoided had Boro not made the calamitous decision to pull out of a Premier League game at Blackburn in December 1996 with less than 24 hours\u2019 notice. The Football Association was unimpressed by claims of a rapidly violent flu epidemic and deducted three points. After Boro ended up two points in arrears of fourth-bottom Coventry, Juninho and Ravanelli departed for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Marseille respectively. It was as if a light had been flicked off. Suddenly the gorgeous Juninho pass that prefaced Fj\u00f8rtoft scoring in the 1-1 draw with Leeds and marked the Brazilian\u2019s Riverside debut appeared depressingly distant. A couple of years earlier Juninho\u2019s mother had felt equivalent excitement about her introduction to Middlesbrough. She was so taken with the exoticism of Marks &amp; Spencer that club officials were asked to house her son next door to its Aladdin\u2019s cave of shopping possibilities. They explained, gently, that North Yorkshire\u2019s villages might be more suitable. By the time Juninho retired, three separate chapters of his career had taken place at Boro and he remains friends with the Brazilian couple who turned up at Teesside airport to meet him on his first day. Once it became apparent the interpreter hired by the club had a rather rudimentary grasp of Portuguese they became indispensable, their local knowledge helping Juninho swiftly integrate. Although Emerson relished nights out at the Tall Trees Nightclub \u2013 formerly a footballers\u2019 Mecca in the Georgian market town of Yarm \u2013 culture shock engulfed him and Ravanelli. Emerson\u2019s then wife dismissed her new habitat as \u201ca dark and dangerous place\u201d, claiming relatives were \u201cscared to step off the plane\u201d at Teesside. Ravanelli made almost as many public complaints about Boro\u2019s training regime as the 16 Premier League goals he scored. The \u201cWhite Feather\u2019s\u201d hat-trick on his Boro bow in a thrilling 3-3 home draw with Liverpool remains foremost among the still vivid memories he created and he, like Emerson, now views his Riverside odyssey through a softer, more affectionate lens. On- and off-pitch adventures continued as Robson recruited Rangers\u2019s Paul Gascoigne, Inter\u2019s Marco Branca and Arsenal\u2019s Paul Merson. Promotion was quickly clinched, another League Cup final lost against Chelsea and Gascoigne \u201cborrowed\u201d the keys to the \u00a3250,000 team bus, causing \u00a320,000 worth of damage after crashing it into a, mercifully, empty bus shelter. A club tour of Libya, at Colonel Gaddafi\u2019s invitation, followed. The word surreal has become synonymous with the present, dystopian moment in history but Beck\u2019s charity match promises to build a psychologically healing bridge to some happily bizarre past times once enjoyed by a small town in Europe.",

      "body": "<p>Not many actors are able to work from home, but for a group of women, filming has started on a drama series \u2013 in lockdown. Tamzin Outhwaite, one of the cast, is lucky that her partner is a director (although he is not used to shooting on an old iPhone). Her 11-year-old daughter is also helping with the camerawork. Is it weird acting in front of her children? She gives a throaty laugh. \u201cOf course it\u2019s weird.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite, still best known from her time in EastEnders, will star in Dun Breedin\u2019, a comedy-drama created by the actor Julie Graham about a group of women brought together in a menopause support group. Outhwaite plays Indie, a free spirit who is trying to get through the hormonal change \u201cwith yoga and breathing. Other characters are like: \u2018You need to get some HRT.\u2019\u201d As well as Graham, the other actors include Angela Griffin, Tracy Ann Oberman and Denise Welch (they are real-life friends), all filming their scenes from home to create 12 episodes, each just 10 minutes, to be shown on YouTube. The show aims to raise money for the Trussell Trust, the charity that organises <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2020/mar/17/how-to-help-food-banks-during-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">UK food banks</a>.</p> <p>The menopause, despite being a huge shift for many women, has traditionally been ignored, says Outhwaite, who turns 50 this year. \u201cIt\u2019s just not really documented and if it is, it\u2019s in health pamphlets, as opposed to drama and comedy,\u201d she says. Isn\u2019t it also because menopausal women are of the age when society, scandalously, traditionally starts to ignore them? \u201cAbsolutely, but the women I know of that age are some of the funniest people. The way that women deal with things at that age can be very comical. And a woman can still be sexy and going through her menopause.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite says she found the first few weeks of the coronavirus crisis \u201creally difficult\u201d, although she knows she is lucky to be at home in north London, with her partner, Tom Child, and children, and with daily glimpses of her father, who is self-isolating from his home \u2013 a cabin built for him at the bottom of her garden. In positive moments, she says: \u201cI think it will make us realise what really matters.\u201d For Outhwaite, that is family and a job she loves.</p> <p>Just before Covid-19 hit, Outhwaite was appearing in the Chekhov play, The Seagull, in the West End. They had only done a few previews before the theatres were shut, a week before the lockdown. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to kick off again, or if we kick off again. Whether people will go to the theatre. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to go back.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite began her career on the stage \u2013 doing several years of musical theatre. She then spent a couple of years working regularly with the playwright Alan Ayckbourn, becoming one of his favoured actors, and was subsequently cast in EastEnders. She joined the soap in 1998, thinking she would just stay for three months and that it wouldn\u2019t change her life much. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is just another acting job. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve made it, because then you\u2019ve got a whole heap of career to continue.\u2019\u201d Instead, she stayed for more than three years; by the time Mel Owen \u2013 no-nonsense, husky voiced, gorgeous \u2013 was written out in 2002, she had married first Ian Beale, then local criminal Steve Owen, been kidnapped and arrested for suspected drug smuggling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4ea166b5813fcc79cca76f11888c4a18c2b42d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4ea166b5813fcc79cca76f11888c4a18c2b42d7/0_0_2037_1371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outhwaite as Mel Owen and Martin Kemp as Steve Owen at their wedding in EastEnders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outhwaite as Mel Owen and Martin Kemp as Steve Owen at their wedding in EastEnders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicky Johnston/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During that period, when EastEnders was bringing in more than 10 million viewers, soap stars were the main focus of tabloid attention in the way that reality stars are now. Outhwaite was in her late 20s when she joined the cast, so says she felt relatively able to cope with the sudden fame. Were there times when it got too much? \u201cOh, yeah, there were many times when on a Friday night you\u2019d get a phone call from the News of the World, or whatever, saying someone had tried to sell some story that was nonsense. It was a whole new world.\u201d She was regularly followed by paparazzi. \u201cThere\u2019s not a part of you that enjoys that. There is a feeling that you\u2019re being spied on. Then your job is not just being an actor, you feel like some sort of public figure, but at the same time I never thought that I wanted to moan about it.\u201d Her family and friends helped her keep perspective, she says. \u201cWhen you think everyone\u2019s reading nonsense about you, actually they\u2019re not, because everyone\u2019s busy with their own lives. But in your head it\u2019s blown out of proportion.\u201d</p> <p>It must be hard for an actor to decide (if they have a choice) to leave the security of a regular, high-profile job and try to make it in the wilds outside, knowing there is still a bit of snobbery about soap stars. For every <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/may/11/suranne-jones-bad-stuff-worked-gentleman-jack\">Suranne Jones</a>, there are dozens more who struggle to transfer their profile into other roles. Outhwaite already had her lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, the BBC drama, lined up when she left and she says she didn\u2019t feel any anxiety about her career. The work has been steady ever since, including the BBC dramas Hotel Babylon and New Tricks, although she has been more likely to pop up in shows as a guest star than the lead. There have also been numerous theatre roles, including another Ayckbourn production and a triumphant turn in the musical Sweet Charity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"67f975f3cf57cc35ca9a497e233d5b8f17ef22c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/67f975f3cf57cc35ca9a497e233d5b8f17ef22c8/0_124_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tamzin Outhwaite in Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s West End production of Sweet Charity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tamzin Outhwaite in Alan Ayckbourn\u2019s West End production of Sweet Charity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen I hit 40, there were fewer scripts coming in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt did feel like I wasn\u2019t playing the leads in things, but that\u2019s fine by me. I\u2019m an ensemble actor, I really like to be in a company. I\u2019m not desperate to have all of the responsibility on my shoulders. I haven\u2019t really got much to moan about.\u201d It was harder to leave EastEnders the second time, she admits (Mel returned to the square in 2018, and was killed off the following year), \u201cbecause you\u2019re older and you\u2019ve got kids and the security\u2019s actually quite lovely, it did feel different. I thought: \u2018I wonder how I\u2019m going to be able to move back into the acting world after this time round.\u2019 But it\u2019s been pretty nonstop. Until Covid.\u201d She had a \u201clovely TV job\u201d lined up that she\u2019s not allowed to talk about. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s ever going to happen, but fingers crossed it does.\u201d</p> <p>She says she only ever wanted to make a living from doing something she loved. \u201cTo go from job to job, that was success, that was enough for me. I wasn\u2019t desperate to play a lead at the National. I really wanted to be in Cats the musical and that was kind of it,\u201d she says with a laugh. It hadn\u2019t occurred to Outhwaite, who grew up in Ilford, east London, and whose father worked at a newspaper printing plant and drove a black cab, that acting could be a job. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from a showbizzy kind of family, or even an artistic family,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started auditioning for performing arts schools when I was 15 and then I was like: \u2018Oh, people do this for a living\u2019.\u201d She says she never had a life plan. \u201cNo plan for career, family, anything. Otherwise, it\u2019s just disappointment, surely, because things don\u2019t ever really go to plan.\u201d</p> <p>Outhwaite\u2019s time in EastEnders, even if the peak was some 20 years ago, created an enduring interest in her private life \u2013 it helped, then and now, that she was glamorous and had famous friends, such as the Spice Girl Emma Bunton, the Appleton sisters from the group All Saints, and the actor and presenter Amanda Holden. These days, her Instagram account is full of pictures of this girl gang, an instant nostalgia trip for anyone who yearns for the 90s, as well as cuddly selfies of Outhwaite with her boyfriend.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"009237f586ebed2f3e769e999f3722ebf7aa6690\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/009237f586ebed2f3e769e999f3722ebf7aa6690/0_1_2089_1254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outhwaite in the lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, 2003.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outhwaite in the lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, 2003.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurie Sparham/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her divorce from the actor Tom Ellis in 2014 was fairly public, and now she is fielding questions about her two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 21 years younger than her. Such a gap is rarely a big deal when it\u2019s a man with a younger female partner, of course. \u201cWhereas you cannot read anything about me without it saying \u2018toyboy lover\u2019,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cA woman being very sure of what she wants or what she is in her life doesn\u2019t make her a cougar, because there are two people involved in this relationship. Not all men want younger women, that\u2019s another thing. When you find someone you connect with, what, because you\u2019re different ages you shouldn\u2019t do that?\u201d She says, and I can hear a wry smile in her voice, it\u2019s not as if their age gap has come as a shock to them, something they have only read about in the newspapers. \u201cWe have thought about this, we have talked about this.\u201d Has the interest put pressure on their relationship? No, she says. \u201cAt the beginning you think: \u2018Can we do this?\u2019 But the minute we became official and thought we\u2019re all right with it, then no one else\u2019s opinions matter, apart from my children.\u201d</p> <p>Other women in similar situations have contacted her to thank her for speaking about it, for normalising it. And it\u2019s not that unusual, she points out \u2013 among the cast of Dun Breedin\u2019, Graham and Welch also have much younger husbands. Outhwaite\u2019s character does, too. Never has the menopause looked so enjoyable. \u201cJulie and I always said we should put a tape recorder on [during] our evenings out and you\u2019d get some great dialogue. A lot of the stuff that comes out of [my friends\u2019 mouths] you think, if you had that in a script people would think it was far-fetched. What I love is that Julie has kept all that, the swearing and the gruesome stuff.\u201d The show, she says, is \u201cedgy, not worried about offending people. And I suppose that\u2019s one thing that comes with age; you\u2019re just so happy when you get to a place where you\u2019re comfortable in your own skin. That gets left out of an awful lot of [stories about] women of our age \u2013 you\u2019re comfortable enough not to worry about being judged.\u201d</p> <p><em>Dun Breedin\u2019 is available to view on YouTube and new episodes land every Thursday</em><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Not many actors are able to work from home, but for a group of women, filming has started on a drama series \u2013 in lockdown. Tamzin Outhwaite, one of the cast, is lucky that her partner is a director (although he is not used to shooting on an old iPhone). Her 11-year-old daughter is also helping with the camerawork. Is it weird acting in front of her children? She gives a throaty laugh. \u201cOf course it\u2019s weird.\u201d Outhwaite, still best known from her time in EastEnders, will star in Dun Breedin\u2019, a comedy-drama created by the actor Julie Graham about a group of women brought together in a menopause support group. Outhwaite plays Indie, a free spirit who is trying to get through the hormonal change \u201cwith yoga and breathing. Other characters are like: \u2018You need to get some HRT.\u2019\u201d As well as Graham, the other actors include Angela Griffin, Tracy Ann Oberman and Denise Welch (they are real-life friends), all filming their scenes from home to create 12 episodes, each just 10 minutes, to be shown on YouTube. The show aims to raise money for the Trussell Trust, the charity that organises UK food banks. The menopause, despite being a huge shift for many women, has traditionally been ignored, says Outhwaite, who turns 50 this year. \u201cIt\u2019s just not really documented and if it is, it\u2019s in health pamphlets, as opposed to drama and comedy,\u201d she says. Isn\u2019t it also because menopausal women are of the age when society, scandalously, traditionally starts to ignore them? \u201cAbsolutely, but the women I know of that age are some of the funniest people. The way that women deal with things at that age can be very comical. And a woman can still be sexy and going through her menopause.\u201d Outhwaite says she found the first few weeks of the coronavirus crisis \u201creally difficult\u201d, although she knows she is lucky to be at home in north London, with her partner, Tom Child, and children, and with daily glimpses of her father, who is self-isolating from his home \u2013 a cabin built for him at the bottom of her garden. In positive moments, she says: \u201cI think it will make us realise what really matters.\u201d For Outhwaite, that is family and a job she loves. Just before Covid-19 hit, Outhwaite was appearing in the Chekhov play, The Seagull, in the West End. They had only done a few previews before the theatres were shut, a week before the lockdown. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to kick off again, or if we kick off again. Whether people will go to the theatre. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to go back.\u201d Outhwaite began her career on the stage \u2013 doing several years of musical theatre. She then spent a couple of years working regularly with the playwright Alan Ayckbourn, becoming one of his favoured actors, and was subsequently cast in EastEnders. She joined the soap in 1998, thinking she would just stay for three months and that it wouldn\u2019t change her life much. \u201cI thought: \u2018This is just another acting job. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019ve made it, because then you\u2019ve got a whole heap of career to continue.\u2019\u201d Instead, she stayed for more than three years; by the time Mel Owen \u2013 no-nonsense, husky voiced, gorgeous \u2013 was written out in 2002, she had married first Ian Beale, then local criminal Steve Owen, been kidnapped and arrested for suspected drug smuggling. During that period, when EastEnders was bringing in more than 10 million viewers, soap stars were the main focus of tabloid attention in the way that reality stars are now. Outhwaite was in her late 20s when she joined the cast, so says she felt relatively able to cope with the sudden fame. Were there times when it got too much? \u201cOh, yeah, there were many times when on a Friday night you\u2019d get a phone call from the News of the World, or whatever, saying someone had tried to sell some story that was nonsense. It was a whole new world.\u201d She was regularly followed by paparazzi. \u201cThere\u2019s not a part of you that enjoys that. There is a feeling that you\u2019re being spied on. Then your job is not just being an actor, you feel like some sort of public figure, but at the same time I never thought that I wanted to moan about it.\u201d Her family and friends helped her keep perspective, she says. \u201cWhen you think everyone\u2019s reading nonsense about you, actually they\u2019re not, because everyone\u2019s busy with their own lives. But in your head it\u2019s blown out of proportion.\u201d It must be hard for an actor to decide (if they have a choice) to leave the security of a regular, high-profile job and try to make it in the wilds outside, knowing there is still a bit of snobbery about soap stars. For every Suranne Jones, there are dozens more who struggle to transfer their profile into other roles. Outhwaite already had her lead role as an army investigator in Red Cap, the BBC drama, lined up when she left and she says she didn\u2019t feel any anxiety about her career. The work has been steady ever since, including the BBC dramas Hotel Babylon and New Tricks, although she has been more likely to pop up in shows as a guest star than the lead. There have also been numerous theatre roles, including another Ayckbourn production and a triumphant turn in the musical Sweet Charity. \u201cWhen I hit 40, there were fewer scripts coming in,\u201d she says. \u201cIt did feel like I wasn\u2019t playing the leads in things, but that\u2019s fine by me. I\u2019m an ensemble actor, I really like to be in a company. I\u2019m not desperate to have all of the responsibility on my shoulders. I haven\u2019t really got much to moan about.\u201d It was harder to leave EastEnders the second time, she admits (Mel returned to the square in 2018, and was killed off the following year), \u201cbecause you\u2019re older and you\u2019ve got kids and the security\u2019s actually quite lovely, it did feel different. I thought: \u2018I wonder how I\u2019m going to be able to move back into the acting world after this time round.\u2019 But it\u2019s been pretty nonstop. Until Covid.\u201d She had a \u201clovely TV job\u201d lined up that she\u2019s not allowed to talk about. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s ever going to happen, but fingers crossed it does.\u201d She says she only ever wanted to make a living from doing something she loved. \u201cTo go from job to job, that was success, that was enough for me. I wasn\u2019t desperate to play a lead at the National. I really wanted to be in Cats the musical and that was kind of it,\u201d she says with a laugh. It hadn\u2019t occurred to Outhwaite, who grew up in Ilford, east London, and whose father worked at a newspaper printing plant and drove a black cab, that acting could be a job. \u201cI didn\u2019t come from a showbizzy kind of family, or even an artistic family,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I started auditioning for performing arts schools when I was 15 and then I was like: \u2018Oh, people do this for a living\u2019.\u201d She says she never had a life plan. \u201cNo plan for career, family, anything. Otherwise, it\u2019s just disappointment, surely, because things don\u2019t ever really go to plan.\u201d Outhwaite\u2019s time in EastEnders, even if the peak was some 20 years ago, created an enduring interest in her private life \u2013 it helped, then and now, that she was glamorous and had famous friends, such as the Spice Girl Emma Bunton, the Appleton sisters from the group All Saints, and the actor and presenter Amanda Holden. These days, her Instagram account is full of pictures of this girl gang, an instant nostalgia trip for anyone who yearns for the 90s, as well as cuddly selfies of Outhwaite with her boyfriend. Her divorce from the actor Tom Ellis in 2014 was fairly public, and now she is fielding questions about her two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 21 years younger than her. Such a gap is rarely a big deal when it\u2019s a man with a younger female partner, of course. \u201cWhereas you cannot read anything about me without it saying \u2018toyboy lover\u2019,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cA woman being very sure of what she wants or what she is in her life doesn\u2019t make her a cougar, because there are two people involved in this relationship. Not all men want younger women, that\u2019s another thing. When you find someone you connect with, what, because you\u2019re different ages you shouldn\u2019t do that?\u201d She says, and I can hear a wry smile in her voice, it\u2019s not as if their age gap has come as a shock to them, something they have only read about in the newspapers. \u201cWe have thought about this, we have talked about this.\u201d Has the interest put pressure on their relationship? No, she says. \u201cAt the beginning you think: \u2018Can we do this?\u2019 But the minute we became official and thought we\u2019re all right with it, then no one else\u2019s opinions matter, apart from my children.\u201d Other women in similar situations have contacted her to thank her for speaking about it, for normalising it. And it\u2019s not that unusual, she points out \u2013 among the cast of Dun Breedin\u2019, Graham and Welch also have much younger husbands. Outhwaite\u2019s character does, too. Never has the menopause looked so enjoyable. \u201cJulie and I always said we should put a tape recorder on [during] our evenings out and you\u2019d get some great dialogue. A lot of the stuff that comes out of [my friends\u2019 mouths] you think, if you had that in a script people would think it was far-fetched. What I love is that Julie has kept all that, the swearing and the gruesome stuff.\u201d The show, she says, is \u201cedgy, not worried about offending people. And I suppose that\u2019s one thing that comes with age; you\u2019re just so happy when you get to a place where you\u2019re comfortable in your own skin. That gets left out of an awful lot of [stories about] women of our age \u2013 you\u2019re comfortable enough not to worry about being judged.\u201d Dun Breedin\u2019 is available to view on YouTube and new episodes land every Thursday",

      "body": "<p>Christopher Thomas, a call center operator in Lawrence, Kansas, said his employer has been dismayingly slow to protect the center\u2019s more than 400 workers from Covid-19 \u2013 slow in making sure workers were at least 6ft apart, in getting them personal protective equipment and in assuring emergency sick leave.</p> <p>That dismay, Thomas explained, comes on top of long-festering anger over pay. His employer, a federal contractor named Maximus, has discussed reclassifying many workers in order to hold down their pay. Thomas and many co-workers have not received a raise for five years, he said. He makes $15.36 an hour after seven years on the job helping people from across the US apply for health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace.</p> <p>To Thomas\u2019s mind, there has been one positive outgrowth from all this dismay \u2013 far greater interest in unionizing. In the last four weeks, he said, membership has nearly tripled in a workplace committee that includes many union supporters and is calling for increased pay and benefits and more transparency on basic work issues.</p> <p>\u201cI support a union because I love what I do, and it would be nice to have better pay and benefits,\u201d said Thomas, 32, who supports efforts to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. \u201cIf we have a union, we will have more power to tell Maximus to stop throwing us bare bones.\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, there has been an extraordinary surge of anger and activism nationwide as workers have protested what they consider inadequate safety protections against Covid-19: at meatpacking plants, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/if-youre-sick-they-dont-care-pandemic-forces-food-service-to-review-its-policies\">McDonald\u2019s restaurants</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-safety\">Amazon warehouses,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-bus-drivers-lack-life-saving-basic-protections-transit-worker-deaths-coronavirus\">bus depots</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/15/whole-food-protests-coronavirus-working-conditions-sickout\">grocery stores</a>. Labor leaders applaud the walkouts and sickouts, and many of them are asking whether this spike in activism can be converted long-term into increased organizing and unionization and somehow reverse labor\u2019s decades-long slide.</p> <p>The answer depends in part on how vigorously unions and other worker groups respond, but also on how successfully America\u2019s many anti-union corporations respond in quelling this new militancy and any push for unionization. Some prominent companies have responded aggressively \u2013 Amazon has fired four outspoken worker leaders, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/02/amazon-chris-smalls-smart-articulate-leaked-memo\">the leader of a walkout at its Staten Island warehouse</a>, while Trader Joe\u2019s CEO sent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/labor-unions-trader-joes-workers-coronavirus-us\">an anti-union letter</a> to all employees.</p> <p>Monica Harris, who handles calls about Medicare at a Maximus facility in Chester, Virginia, cited another obstacle to unionizing: social distancing. \u201cPeople are very interested in the union right now because we\u2019re being required to come in under bad conditions,\u201d Harris said, speaking last month. But she added: \u201cYou\u2019re not really able to get in one-on-one, face-to-face contact with people right now.\u201d Another impediment to expanding union support is that many Maximus employees are transitioning to work at home, although union organizers are increasingly using Zoom to speak with workers and even hold rallies.</p> <p>Covid-19 has already spurred new organizing. With the virus spreading and his grocery store getting more crowded, Ryan Hartson was growing worried about getting infected in his job as an Instacart in-store shopper in Chicago \u2013 he gathers fruits, vegetables and other groceries for customers. Hartson and several co-workers grew upset that Instacart hadn\u2019t given them a mask or other PPE, hadn\u2019t provided hazard pay and made it hard to get paid sick leave. So he joined <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/business/economy/coronavirus-instacart-amazon.html\">the nationwide Instacart strike on 30 March</a> involving in-store shoppers (whom Instacart considers employees) and Instacart food deliverers (Instacart says they are independent contractors). Federal law gives employees a right to unionize, but not independent contractors.</p> <p>At the time of the strike, \u201cI was already in the middle of trying to organize my store,\u201d Hartson said. Instacart shoppers at a Mariano\u2019s grocery store in Skokie, Illinois, voted 10-to-4 to unionize in February, becoming the nation\u2019s first Instacart workers to unionize. Hartson said Covid-19 gave added momentum to the effort at his store, and he was soon discussing unionization with Instacart workers in Austin, Boston, Miami and Orlando.</p> <p>\u201cThe pandemic led to the strike, and the strike led to this opportunity to organize workers all over this country,\u201d Hartson said. \u201cNo question the pandemic has opened up a whole new dynamic in the labor movement.\u201d</p> <p>Todd Crosby, organizing director for the United Food and Commercial Workers, said that with regard to Instacart\u2019s in-store shoppers and its delivery workers \u2013 who he says are misclassified as independent contractors \u2013 \u201cwe are building a real organization at the workplace to win collective bargaining rights.\u201d He added, \u201cIn some other places, like Whole Foods and Trader Joe\u2019s, we\u2019re working with activists to engage in rebellion and protest that may lead to a permanent organization and collective bargaining.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Smith, national organizing director for the communications workers union, said coronavirus-related activism was setting the stage for longer-term organizing. \u201cIt\u2019s changing people\u2019s calculus,\u201d he said. \u201cWorkers often sense they\u2019re taking a risk when they\u2019re acting collectively. But Covid-19 has turned some of that calculus on its ear. Yeah, maybe the boss will hold it against me. Maybe this will put my job in jeopardy. But I\u2019m not going to put my life or my newborn\u2019s life or my immuno-compromised parent\u2019s life in danger.\u201d</p> <p>Smith oversaw a conference call with 1,000 largely non-union workers about Covid-19 and near-term and longer-term steps. \u201cAll of this is leading folks to really step forward and take action,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will be the first workplace confrontation for tens of thousands of people.\u201d The result, he said, will be many new workplace leaders, groups and networks.</p> <p>Edan Alva, a Lyft driver in Alameda, California, helped organize recent protests to make sure Uber and Lyft drivers obtain unemployment benefits after many stopped driving because of a sharp drop-off in business and fears of infection. After those protests, California\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/11812496/uber-and-lyft-arent-paying-for-drivers-unemployment-you-are-confirms-newsom\">Gavin Newsom, pledged to make unemployment benefits available to these drivers</a>, despite Uber\u2019s and Lyft\u2019s efforts to block such benefits.</p> <p>Alva, a leader of <a href=\"https://gigworkersrising.org/\">Gig Workers Rising</a>, hopes California\u2019s state legislature will give Uber and Lyft drivers a right to unionize, even though the Trump National Labor Relations Board has embraced Uber and Lyft\u2019s view that the drivers are independent contractors and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to unionize. \u201cOur No 1 goal is to organize and unionize,\u201d Alva said. \u201cDrivers are increasingly seeing that nothing prevents Uber and Lyft from taking what they want unless we have a union.\u201d</p> <p>Andrea Dehlendorf, co-executive director of United for Respect, a non-profit fighting for low-wage workers, predicts that Covid-19 will change how workers and the public view corporate America \u2013 and that that will in turn inspire more activism.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s been happening to working people in this country is like a frog in boiling water, where things get more dire and extreme, where there has been this slow burn of declining stability and voice, and this crisis turned up the heat and exposed just how unconscionably corporations treat workers in our economy and society,\u201d Dehlendorf said. \u201cThis is not just a momentary surge in reaction to this particular crisis. This crisis is exposing just how inhumanly corporations are treating workers in a way that working people are not going to accept again.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christopher Thomas, a call center operator in Lawrence, Kansas, said his employer has been dismayingly slow to protect the center\u2019s more than 400 workers from Covid-19 \u2013 slow in making sure workers were at least 6ft apart, in getting them personal protective equipment and in assuring emergency sick leave. That dismay, Thomas explained, comes on top of long-festering anger over pay. His employer, a federal contractor named Maximus, has discussed reclassifying many workers in order to hold down their pay. Thomas and many co-workers have not received a raise for five years, he said. He makes $15.36 an hour after seven years on the job helping people from across the US apply for health insurance through the Obamacare marketplace. To Thomas\u2019s mind, there has been one positive outgrowth from all this dismay \u2013 far greater interest in unionizing. In the last four weeks, he said, membership has nearly tripled in a workplace committee that includes many union supporters and is calling for increased pay and benefits and more transparency on basic work issues. \u201cI support a union because I love what I do, and it would be nice to have better pay and benefits,\u201d said Thomas, 32, who supports efforts to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. \u201cIf we have a union, we will have more power to tell Maximus to stop throwing us bare bones.\u201d In recent weeks, there has been an extraordinary surge of anger and activism nationwide as workers have protested what they consider inadequate safety protections against Covid-19: at meatpacking plants, McDonald\u2019s restaurants, Amazon warehouses, bus depots and grocery stores. Labor leaders applaud the walkouts and sickouts, and many of them are asking whether this spike in activism can be converted long-term into increased organizing and unionization and somehow reverse labor\u2019s decades-long slide. The answer depends in part on how vigorously unions and other worker groups respond, but also on how successfully America\u2019s many anti-union corporations respond in quelling this new militancy and any push for unionization. Some prominent companies have responded aggressively \u2013 Amazon has fired four outspoken worker leaders, including the leader of a walkout at its Staten Island warehouse, while Trader Joe\u2019s CEO sent an anti-union letter to all employees. Monica Harris, who handles calls about Medicare at a Maximus facility in Chester, Virginia, cited another obstacle to unionizing: social distancing. \u201cPeople are very interested in the union right now because we\u2019re being required to come in under bad conditions,\u201d Harris said, speaking last month. But she added: \u201cYou\u2019re not really able to get in one-on-one, face-to-face contact with people right now.\u201d Another impediment to expanding union support is that many Maximus employees are transitioning to work at home, although union organizers are increasingly using Zoom to speak with workers and even hold rallies. Covid-19 has already spurred new organizing. With the virus spreading and his grocery store getting more crowded, Ryan Hartson was growing worried about getting infected in his job as an Instacart in-store shopper in Chicago \u2013 he gathers fruits, vegetables and other groceries for customers. Hartson and several co-workers grew upset that Instacart hadn\u2019t given them a mask or other PPE, hadn\u2019t provided hazard pay and made it hard to get paid sick leave. So he joined the nationwide Instacart strike on 30 March involving in-store shoppers (whom Instacart considers employees) and Instacart food deliverers (Instacart says they are independent contractors). Federal law gives employees a right to unionize, but not independent contractors. At the time of the strike, \u201cI was already in the middle of trying to organize my store,\u201d Hartson said. Instacart shoppers at a Mariano\u2019s grocery store in Skokie, Illinois, voted 10-to-4 to unionize in February, becoming the nation\u2019s first Instacart workers to unionize.

The British diplomat added in his note to Churchill: \u201cI told him that zones of occupation did not, so as I understood, prejudice discussions with regard to frontiers and that for the time being he really should be grateful for British and American troops occupying as much of Germany as possible. The time would come, I felt, when he would be sorry to see them go.\u201d The unfortunate state of relations between the British prime minister and De Gaulle at the time are clearly elucidated in a cable sent at 11.55pm on VE Day itself by Churchill to Duff Cooper in Paris, marked personal and top secret. Churchill wrote: \u201cWe must discuss the visit of the general here later. It may well be that I could go and see him quietly one of these days on a trip to France, though I should have to know beforehand that he would not have the door banged, barred and bolted against me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The aged-care regulator has threatened to revoke the operating licence of Newmarch House, the western Sydney aged-care facility where 16 residents have died of Covid-19, over what it views as an \u201cimmediate and severe risk to the health, safety and wellbeing\u201d of residents. On Wednesday afternoon the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission issued a notice to Anglicare, Newmarch\u2019s operator, saying it must demonstrate \u201cthe serious risk to care recipients at the service has been effectively addressed\u201d and improve its communication with residents\u2019 families or risk the revocation sanction. Anglicare must also agree to appoint an independent adviser chosen by ACQSC and follow any recommendations the adviser made, and provide regular reporting to the commission. The operator must provide written agreement to ACQSC by 5pm on Thursday that it will take the required actions in order to continue operating Newmarch House. \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak at Newmarch House in Western Sydney during this pandemic has been one of the most devastating in Australia, with 16 residents having lost their lives to the virus,\u201d said Janet Anderson, the aged care quality and safety commissioner. \u201cThis is a tragic situation, and the anxiety and grief experienced by residents, their family members and staff has had an impact on all Australians.\u201d In its notice to agree letter, ACQSC raised concern about Anglicare\u2019s \u201cresponse to the outbreak and lack of suitable processes and systems in order to control transmission of the virus\u201d, as well as complaints received by residents and their families about a lack of information. \u201cThe commission has identified that there is an immediate and severe risk to the health, safety and wellbeing of care recipients at the service,\u201d it said. After a part-time carer worked six shifts with mild symptoms before being diagnosed with coronavirus on 11 April, more than 60 staff and residents contracted Covid-19, with the 16th death of a resident announced on Tuesday. Since the outbreak was declared, 35 surge staff from the private firm Aspen Medical have entered the home, with allegations levelled against both Newmarch and Aspen carers of breaches of personal protective equipment protocol. Grant Millard, the chief executive of Anglicare, indicated that he would agree to take the required action. \u201cWe acknowledge the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission have, this afternoon, taken regulatory action, including appointing an independent adviser to provide additional support to Newmarch House,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the outbreak, we have had generous support of providers in the Aged Care sector, including Commonwealth and NSW Governments, and various agencies. \u201cWhile the outbreak at Newmarch House has proved very challenging for all involved, the situation has substantially improved. We will continue to collaborate with key stakeholders as we work through the continuing challenges in the coming weeks.\u201d Wednesday marks the third time the regulator has intervened at Newmarch, but this action most seriously threatens its future operations. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, said: \u201cThe action by the Commissioner today will require high level co-ordinating support to Anglicare and Newmarch to ensure all elements of the operations on site are clearly coordinated and managed.\u201d Earlier on Wednesday, the aged care royal commissioners Tony Pagone and Lynelle Briggs announced that the inquiry would specifically look at \u201cthe lessons from what has happened at Newmarch House\u201d. The expansion of the royal commission came after Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, renewed her calls for the inquiry to examine Newmarch on Wednesday, in response to Guardian Australia\u2019s report that Aspen Medical clinicians who boarded the Ruby Princess cruise ship to test stranded crew for Covid-19 were sent into Newmarch just days later. According to Aspen Medical, two surge staff clinicians who conducted screening and testing of crew onboard the Ruby Princess when it was stuck off the coast of Port Kembla, near Wollongong, later worked a shift inside Newmarch House. The private staff worked on the cruise ship until it departed Port Kembla on 23 April, with two of the clinicians, who had tested negative for Covid-19, later working a shift at Newmarch on 25 April. On Monday Aspen complied with a request to stand down a member of its surge staff after Anglicare accused the carer of \u201cbreaches of the PPE protocol\u201d. The Guardian does not suggest that the two Aspen clinicians who worked on both the Ruby Princess and at Newmarch House breached any PPE protocol, nor that they were personally responsible for any further spread of the virus at the aged-care facility.",

News outlets around the world have faced measures to muzzle critical reporting in an environment that has already seen dozens of journalists harassed, arrested and censored by governments, according to editors and press freedom groups. Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, which has launched a dedicated tracker to record the impact of coronavirus on journalism, has reported abuses in more than a dozen countries, including Iran, Egypt and Brazil. In the group\u2019s annual global report on press freedom last week, secretary general Christophe Deloire said the pandemic had given countries the chance \u201cto take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times\u201d. Khadija Patel, editor-in-chief of South Africa\u2019s Mail &amp; Guardian, said even though the country\u2019s newspapers have been delivering important public interest reporting, they have been left in financial peril. She warned that unless there was a dramatic culture shift towards news media, the integrity of independent journalism could be at risk. \u201cThe news media needs to be reclaimed as a public good, it should not be seen as the playground of a few billionaires. The saddest sign would be for us to emerge from this pandemic with a handful of billionaires controlling all of our news,\u201d she said. Mainstream Indian media have offered little critical reporting, according to executive editor of the Caravan journal, Vinod Jose, who pointed to a meeting prime minister Narendra Modi reportedly held with more than 20 media chiefs in March. He said the media\u2019s financial and political independence is linked in India because as revenues fall companies may be forced to turn towards tax rebates and government advertising to survive. \u201cGoing forward, the challenges for Indian media will only increase, because an authoritarian government who is interested in killing journalism is in power, and a media who doesn\u2019t have the guts to speak truth to power or the financial independence to stay afloat without taking government advertisements constitutes the mainstream press in India,\u201d he said. Many outlets are reliant on print advertising and have suffered major losses as circulation has almost ground to a halt amid lockdowns and curfews around the world. Patel said the cancellation of major advertising campaigns meant the Mail &amp; Guardian was suddenly struggling even while its website recorded its best audience numbers. \u201cWithin days of the first [Covid-19] case our CEO had to address staff and say the way things are looking, in April we may not be able to pay salaries,\u201d she said. Financial problems would have a severe impact on how journalists work, and some smaller publications may not survive, Patel added. Even before the pandemic, the Reuters Institute for Journalism\u2019s 2019 report into digital media described the future for South Africa\u2019s media as \u201cgrim\u201d because of low online revenue and plummeting advertising. Philanthropic organisation Luminate has argued that with print circulations grinding to a halt for many newspapers and their business models destroyed, the pandemic could become a \u201cmedia extinction event\u201d. As a solution, it has renewed its call for a global fund to help public interest media maintain their independence. The editor of the Dhaka Tribune, Zafar Sobhan, said the crisis should be a wake-up call for Bangladesh\u2019s media, as it accelerates the downfall of print news and potentially puts those who are unable to adapt out of business. \u201cPrint circulation was already in freefall.

The statement said there were several factors including the coronavirus pandemic, but \u201cthe biggest scourge in Hong Kong comes from within\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt can be said the forces of black violence are destroying the foundation of Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>It said the central government had responsibility for safeguarding national security and the constitutional order in Hong Kong, and called for the urgent implementation of long-shelved national security laws.</p> <p>As Hong Kong relaxes strict Covid-19 pandemic measures, some protests have started again, mostly small groups of people gathering in shopping malls to sing. Police have reportedly enforced bans on public gatherings and used pepper spray to disperse people. Applications for larger marches have been denied.</p> <p>The HKMAO accused protesters of ignoring epidemic prevention laws to protest on Labour Day, and attempting to restart \u201cstreet warfare\u201d, citing police reports of discovering bomb-making materials and the arrest of a 15-year-old demonstrator for throwing a petrol bomb on 1 May.</p> <p>The pathology-themed statement repeated rhetoric last seen in November, when the protesters were denounced in Chinese state media as an \u201cinfection\u201d and a \u201cmalignant virus\u201d. Social media users associated with the protests described it as intimidating language, and joined observers noting its similarity to Communist party (CCP) discourse about Xinjiang and the detention of Uighurs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Anon_Snufkin/status/1257900241535164416\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I really hope everybody is paying full attention to the language being used by the CCP to discuss Hong Kong politics. <a href=\"https://t.co/8NCogsYCcr\">https://t.co/8NCogsYCcr</a></p>&mdash; Snufkin #MaskUp #RentStrike (@Anon_Snufkin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Anon_Snufkin/status/1257900241535164416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 6, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Human Rights Watch (HRW) told the Guardian the rhetoric was \u201cchilling and disturbing\u201d and indicated the CCP intended \u201cto assume greater direct control over Hong Kong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is regrettable that the Chinese government seems to be increasingly inflexible in dealing with its population from Xinjiang to Hong Kong, using the only tool it has in disposal: a crackdown,\u201d said HRW senior China researcher, Maya Wang.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese government can still reverse its course by addressing the many grievances people in Hong Kong have, namely, the erosion of freedoms and autonomy, but unfortunately it is going down the wrong path of heightening tensions.\u201d</p> <p>The HKMAO, the director of which was replaced in February by the hardline party official Xia Baolong, has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/police-in-hong-kong-arrest-14-activists-amid-autonomy-warnings\">increasingly interventionist in Hong Kong affairs</a>.</p> <p>Last month it was accused \u2013 alongside Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong \u2013 of a \u201cflagrant breach\u201d of the agreement struck between Britain and China in 1997, when Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control.</p> <p>Under the agreement, Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.</p> <p>However, the offices denied accusations they were bound by sections of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law which prevented central government interference in local affairs, saying \u201ca high degree of autonomy is not complete autonomy\u201d and the right to self-rule was \u201cauthorised by the central government\u201d.</p> <p>On Tuesday, pro-Beijing politicians formed the Hong Kong Coalition, calling for adherence to the one country, two systems principle. The HKMAO praised the group\u2019s formation.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Beijing\u2019s top political office in Hong Kong has called protesters a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d and said the semi-autonomous city will never be calm until \u201cpoisonous\u201d and \u201cviolent\u201d black-clad demonstrators are eliminated. The warning on Wednesday by China\u2019s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO) said the central government in Beijing would not sit idly by with \u201cthis recklessly demented force\u201d in place, referring to the protest movement which has shaken Hong Kong since last June and sometimes drawn millions to the street. It said the protesters and their oft-used mantra of \u201cif we burn, you burn with us\u201d were a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d, and that the movement\u2019s organisers wanted to \u201cdrag Hong Kong off a cliff\u201d. It said that while many Hong Kongers had sympathy and understanding for them, \u201cthe more sympathisers the tyrants have, the greater price Hong Kong will pay\u201d. The HKMAO statement comes amid a ratcheting up of rhetoric from Beijing towards protesters in Hong Kong and a crackdown on pro-democracy leaders before elections in September. More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested since June, and recent hardline tactics, including the mass arrests of protest figures, have drawn international criticism and accusations Beijing is using the pandemic as a cover to \u201cturn the screws on Hong Kong\u201d. The HKMAO labelled the protest movement as black-clad violence which openly challenged the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principle, trampled on the rule of law, disrupted the social order, damaged property, business, and Hong Kong\u2019s reputation, and endangered lives. Hong Kong\u2019s economy recorded its deepest ever contraction this quarter, dropping 8.9% year on year. The statement said there were several factors including the coronavirus pandemic, but \u201cthe biggest scourge in Hong Kong comes from within\u201d. \u201cIt can be said the forces of black violence are destroying the foundation of Hong Kong\u2019s prosperity and stability,\u201d the statement said. It said the central government had responsibility for safeguarding national security and the constitutional order in Hong Kong, and called for the urgent implementation of long-shelved national security laws. As Hong Kong relaxes strict Covid-19 pandemic measures, some protests have started again, mostly small groups of people gathering in shopping malls to sing. Police have reportedly enforced bans on public gatherings and used pepper spray to disperse people. Applications for larger marches have been denied. The HKMAO accused protesters of ignoring epidemic prevention laws to protest on Labour Day, and attempting to restart \u201cstreet warfare\u201d, citing police reports of discovering bomb-making materials and the arrest of a 15-year-old demonstrator for throwing a petrol bomb on 1 May. The pathology-themed statement repeated rhetoric last seen in November, when the protesters were denounced in Chinese state media as an \u201cinfection\u201d and a \u201cmalignant virus\u201d. Social media users associated with the protests described it as intimidating language, and joined observers noting its similarity to Communist party (CCP) discourse about Xinjiang and the detention of Uighurs. Human Rights Watch (HRW) told the Guardian the rhetoric was \u201cchilling and disturbing\u201d and indicated the CCP intended \u201cto assume greater direct control over Hong Kong\u201d. \u201cIt is regrettable that the Chinese government seems to be increasingly inflexible in dealing with its population from Xinjiang to Hong Kong, using the only tool it has in disposal: a crackdown,\u201d said HRW senior China researcher, Maya Wang. \u201cThe Chinese government can still reverse its course by addressing the many grievances people in Hong Kong have, namely, the erosion of freedoms and autonomy, but unfortunately it is going down the wrong path of heightening tensions.\u201d The HKMAO, the director of which was replaced in February by the hardline party official Xia Baolong, has been increasingly interventionist in Hong Kong affairs. Last month it was accused \u2013 alongside Beijing\u2019s liaison office in Hong Kong \u2013 of a \u201cflagrant breach\u201d of the agreement struck between Britain and China in 1997, when Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control. Under the agreement, Hong Kong was promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years. However, the offices denied accusations they were bound by sections of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law which prevented central government interference in local affairs, saying \u201ca high degree of autonomy is not complete autonomy\u201d and the right to self-rule was \u201cauthorised by the central government\u201d. On Tuesday, pro-Beijing politicians formed the Hong Kong Coalition, calling for adherence to the one country, two systems principle. The HKMAO praised the group\u2019s formation.

Separate to the aged care regulator, the Aged Care Royal Commission is also looking into the situation at Newmarch house. Let\u2019s review some of the major developments from today. The aged care regulator threatened to revoke the licence of the operator of stricken Newmarch House Victoria reported 17 new cases, with confirmation a concerning cluster at a meatworks has now spread to an aged care worker The government agency responsible for the Covidsafe app admitted it wasn\u2019t working properly on iPhones The attorney general, Christian Porter, has announced $63.3m boost to frontline legal services during the Covid-19 crisis. The government said $20m would go to domestic violence services, while $29.8m would fund other Covid-19 issues such as tenancy disputes, insurance, credit- and debt-related problems, and work-related claims. Morrison won\u2019t weigh in on Donald Trump\u2019s comments about the potential benefits of injecting disinfectant. He says the president has explained what he meant \u2013 Trump says he was being sarcastic \u2013 and \u201cI don\u2019t propose to go over them\u201d. Morrison is asked whether world leaders have been asking him how Australia has done \u201cit\u201d \u2013 it being minimising the spread of and deaths from Covid-19. The PM notes he spoke to Boris Johnson recently, who was \u201cvery much asking that exact question\u201d. He says he took Johnson through Australia\u2019s measures on border control and tracking and tracing. Morrison says he was speaking to the Queen too, who was also asking how Australia had performed so well: \u201cShe\u2019s so pleased that down under we\u2019re doing well.\u201d My colleague Paul Karp is also watching this interview with the PM. Samantha Maiden chances her arm with the PM over the report that Tony Abbott is being courted to run in Eden-Monaro. Scott Morrison won\u2019t buy in. He wishes the outgoing Labor MP, Mike Kelly, well. \u201cThere will be a preselection, there will be a candidate,\u201d he says of the Liberal party process. Does he imagine Abbott is interested in returning to parliament? \u201cI don\u2019t believe he is,\u201d Morrison says. Scott Morrison is asked why schools be open when parents cannot hold a birthday party for their children. The PM explains that the premiers sought to make the rules as simple as possible. \u201cOn schools I admit there\u2019s been some confusion there,\u201d he says. But he says the clear advice is that children are safe at school. Of distance learning, he acknowledges: \u201cIt\u2019s not the best for the kids\u2019 education.\u201d Scott Morrison is doing a live Q&amp;A with Samantha Maiden on news.com.au as we speak. The prime minister is asked when the lockdown might start to be wound back. He notes that some states, \u2013 WA and SA, for example \u2013 have already begun to loosen some restrictions. Morrison expects some restrictions might be loosened after the national cabinet meeting on Friday but he doesn\u2019t want to pre-empt any announcements from the states. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine there isn\u2019t the possibility of getting fully back to normal,\u201d he adds. But the aim is to get as close to normal as possible, and he says it \u201cwill take a couple of months to get back to that position\u201d. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, tells the ABC more people are expected to die at Newmarch House. Patricia Karvelas asks him if the facility should be shut down. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d he says. Colbeck says the Aged Care Quality and Safeguards Commission has intervened to ensure the situation at Newmarch improves. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that things have improved at the facility,\u201d he says. A McDonald\u2019s request to waive overtime rates and set shifts for part-timers in the fast food industry has been knocked back by the Fair Work Commission. The Australian Financial Review reported that the full bench of the commission had rejected the urgent bid from employers to alter the fast food award. The application was rebuffed despite backing from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the AFR said. Instead, the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, a new leftwing rival to Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association, opposed the changes to the award as an \u201coutrageous attack\u201d on workers\u2019 rights. The commission rejected the urgent application, saying it did not have evidence before it that McDonald\u2019s revenue had been hit during the pandemic. But the proposal will be considered in more detail at a later date. Channel Seven\u2019s Mark Riley reports on the nightly news that national cabinet is set to allow gatherings of up to 10 people in the family home after its meeting on Friday. Some good news from a little earlier today. All is going well over at Nats HQ. The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, will be on ABC Radio National after 6pm. Given the news about Newmarch House, I\u2019ll bring you some of his comments. I guess that\u2019s that then. Queensland authorities have confirmed a surge in domestic and family violence during the Covid-19 pandemic. The state\u2019s minister for women, Di Farmer, said service providers had reported a dramatic increase in the brutality and severity of attacks on women and children, AAP reported. Authorities held an online domestic violence summit to deal with the issue on Wednesday, amid reports magistrates have been inundated with cases of domestic and family violence in their courtrooms, and paramedics have been getting more calls for help. The health minister, Steven Miles, said he was concerned by the reports from frontline workers. \u201cI\u2019ve been disturbed to hear from our emergency department staff that the reduction in sporting injuries and road trauma has been partially offset by trauma caused by domestic and family violence,\u201d he said. Farmer said: \u201cIf you are a victim of domestic and family violence, life is already incredibly challenging. With the advent of Covid-19, those challenges have increased dramatically. \u201cIf you are a victim you are probably now at home 24 hours a day with a perpetrator who is watching your every move, so your ability to call for help, your ability to escape is severely limited.\u201d In Australia, if you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au. Anglicare, the operator of Newmarch House, has responded to the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. Grant Millard, Anglicare Sydney\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement: We acknowledge the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission have, this afternoon, taken regulatory action, including appointing an independent adviser to provide additional support to Newmarch House. Since the outbreak, we have had generous support of providers in the Aged Care sector, including Commonwealth and NSW Governments, and various agencies. While the outbreak at Newmarch House has proved very challenging for all involved, the situation has substantially improved. We will continue to collaborate with key stakeholders as we work through the continuing challenges in the coming weeks. Our primary concern remains the health, wellbeing and safety of our residents, their families, and our staff. My colleague Matilda Boseley has filed a story on the Cedar Meats cluster. She writes: A meat processing plant which now has almost 50 confirmed cases of Covid-19 was not told it could be dealing with an outbreak for three days after someone connected to the facility was diagnosed, according to a spokeswoman for the company. The aged-care regulator has threatened to revoke the operating licence of Newmarch House, the western Sydney aged-care facility suffering a fatal outbreak of Covid-19. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission issued a notice to Anglicare, Newmarch\u2019s operator, that it must \u201cdemonstrate to the Commission that the serious risk to care recipients at the Service has been effectively addressed\u201d. It must also immediately appoint, at its own expense, and independent adviser \u201cto ensure the safety and well-being of care recipients\u201d, and it must provide regular reporting to the commission. Anglicare has until 5pm on Thursday to agree to the regulator\u2019s request in order to retain its operating license. After a part-time carer worked six shifts with mild symptoms before being diagnosed with coronavirus on 11 April, more than 60 staff and residents are now Covid-19 positive, with the 16th resident death announced on Tuesday. The Victorian education minister, James Merlino, is on ABC Radio Melbourne to discuss the state\u2019s schools. As you might remember, the federal government has been heavily critical of Victoria\u2019s decision to keep students out of the classroom for the term. Merlino says the health advice remains that if your children can learn from home, they should. He says the state is now looking how schools might reopen, either in a staggered fashion or not. But the health advice remains the same, he says. Merlino says there will be at least a week\u2019s notice before face-to-face teaching resumes. The WA premier Mark McGowan has warned the state will not \u201ccompromise on our hard borders\u201d to allow the AFL season to restart. \u201cWe are not going to compromise on our hard borders just to meet the needs of football,\u201d McGowan told reporters on Wednesday, according to AAP. \u201cThe hub arrangement, in which teams were going to move to Western Australia and play football, was a great arrangement. \u201cI\u2019d urge the AFL to continue to pursue that arrangement because it would have meant that the integrity of our borders (remains). \u201cLots of people move away for work and live in difficult conditions. \u201cFootball players in the current difficult economic times should be no exemption to that.\u201d West Coast and Fremantle are opposed to hubs and, like the other 16 clubs, they want to see a more traditional home-and-away model where teams fly in and out for matches. But if WA\u2019s border restrictions don\u2019t ease, the Eagles and the Dockers could be forced into a Victorian-based hub instead. Victoria\u2019s industrial relations minister, Tim Pallas, has announced that the state will step in and pay $1,500 fortnightly payments to casuals in the public sector who were excluded from the commonwealth jobkeeper program. Pallas cited the fact that casual staff including swimming pool lifeguards, ticketing staff at museums and park staff were set to miss out on wage subsidies. Under the Victorian scheme, 3,000 workers will receive the $1,500 fortnightly until the end of September, provided they are happy to be redeployed to other public-sector roles where demand is high, such as healthcare. Unlike jobkeeper, the workers will receive the payment regardless of age, citizenship and length of service. Pallas said: This support will help people who have fallen through the cracks and redeploy them in the roles our community needs right now. These workers are not eligible for the commonwealth\u2019s jobkeeper payments so we\u2019re stepping in and making sure they get the support they need to make it through to the other side of the crisis. Dave Sharma is now asked to respond to reports that Tony Abbott is being asked to run for the Liberals in Eden-Monaro. Sharma looks very amused. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen those reports,\u201d he says. \u201cI think Tony\u2019s, you know, a former prime minister, he deserves all of our respect.\u201d \u201cI think he has a contribution to make in public life. Whether elected office is the best way for him to do that or not, that\u2019s really a matter for him.\u201d Would Sharma like to see him return to parliament? \u201cI\u2019m neutral,\u201d Sharma says. \u201cIt is up to Tony. I don\u2019t favour any candidate.\u201d The Liberal MP Dave Sharma has drawn the short straw and is on the ABC defending the infighting between the Liberals and the Nationals, and within the Nationals themselves. He says: It\u2019s been a confusing day. I have got a bit of whiplash trying to keep up with it as well. I think it\u2019s unfortunate that some of these things have been said in public. But I think we have to move on. I don\u2019t believe this is an Covid-approved activity. And first, here is the latest on the Draft Tony push, which appears to be disintegrating quite quickly. Thanks to Elias for his great work today. I\u2019ll be with you into the evening. And with that, I\u2019ll pass over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who will take you through from here. There is a very unconfirmed rumour circulating on Twitter that Teena McQueen, the vice-president of the Liberal party, is trying to gauge whether there is support for Tony Abbott to be the party\u2019s candidate in the Eden-Monaro byelection. Insolvency practitioners think Australian businesses shut down by the coronavirus crisis will last only months unless they are allowed to reopen or get more help from the government. Companies in the hospitality, tourism and retail industries will last less than three months and many already have less than a month of life left, according to a survey of the profession by the industry body the Turnaround Management Association and the insolvency firm KordaMentha. The survey also found that 80% of insolvency professionals also believe that education, real estate and manufacturing businesses can last less that six months. They are also tipping a slow economic recovery, with 58% believing it will be U-shaped and just 10% thinking there will be a V-shaped snapback. A staff member at an aged-care facility in Bacchus Marsh in Victoria has been diagnosed with Covid-19. According to a Department of Health and Human Services Victoria statement, the carer worked at Grant Lodge, which is part of Djerriwarrh Health Services. It said the staff member had been asymptomatic but was tested on Saturday as part of Victoria\u2019s expanded screening program. Updated Covid-19 statistics for the state show an increase of 17 people diagnosed with the virus since Tuesday. Four of the new cases are linked to the Cedar Meats processing facility, which is now associated with 49 cases. More on that earlier Mark McGowan presser, from a sporting angle: the WA premier has again pushed for quarantine hubs to be established if the AFL is to get its suspended season back under way. With tough border controls still in place, and seemingly working just fine given the latest infection figures, McGowan sees no reason to bow to pressure and allow the season to resume on a fly-in, fly-out basis. \u201cWe are not going to compromise on our hard borders just to meet the needs of football,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cThe hub arrangement, in which teams were going to move to Western Australia and play football, was a great arrangement. \u201cI\u2019d urge the AFL to continue to pursue that arrangement because it would have meant that the integrity of our borders [remains]. Lots of people move away for work and live in difficult conditions. Football players in the current difficult economic times should be no exemption to that.\u201d The federal sports minister, Richard Colbeck, indicated earlier this week that the quarantine idea \u2013 which has been largely unpopular with players \u2013 had nearly run its course and was unlikely to be used if infection rates continued to decline. The harbourmaster on duty when the Ruby Princess docked on 19 March has told a special inquiry he had been called by the Australian Border Force expressing concerns about the ship and he had offered to \u201cturn it around\u201d. Cameron Butchart, the port services manager and duty harbourmaster from the NSW Port Authority, said he himself had \u201ca concern for the occupational health and safety\u201d of sending a pilot on to help the ship dock, owing to Covid-19 concerns. On the night of 18 March and the day of 19 March, he told the special inquiry he had also been called by representatives of Home Affairs and Border Force. \u201cThis particular person certainly had concerns with the situation,\u201d he said of one call. \u201cI believed that I was in a position where ... I used the phrase on the night \u2018turn it around\u2019 [which] was probably the simplest way to explain it to someone on shoreside. \u201cBut we more than likely could have held the ship in a certain position. We could have dropped an anchor ... to allow us to gather some more facts. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, asked Butchart: \u201cHad you ever experienced anything like that before?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d Butchart said. The duty harbourmaster said it was not within his duties to deny sending a pilot to help the ship dock on to health grounds. But he rejected the idea that Home Affairs and the Border Force were \u201cnot decision makers\u201d and said they \u201cwould have been working very closely with biosecurity in making this decision\u201d to let the ship dock. The inquiry has adjourned for today. An aged care employee who tested positive to Covid-19 was a close contact of an employee at Cedar Meats, where a coronavirus cluster of nearly 50 cases has developed. The chief executive of Doutta Galla aged care in Footscray reportedly wrote to families on Wednesday confirming that the staff member had tested positive. The person had last worked at the facility on 26 April, Vanda Iaconese said in the letter reported by Nine News. Jenny Mikakos, the Victorian health minister, told reporters that the Doutta Galla employee was a close contact of a worker at Cedar Meats, a meat processing facility in Brooklyn. \u201cThis person I understand is a close contact of a worker at Cedar Meats,\u201d Mikakos said. \u201cAgain, this is a private aged care facility. The testing of residents and staff is being undertaken. All residents ... are being well supported and observed.\u201d Mikakos defended state health authorities\u2019 handling of the Cedar Meats outbreak, amid criticism from the opposition, which is calling for an inquiry. Iaconese, of the aged care home, told families there were no signs of an outbreak at the facility. It has activated its emergency response procedures and notified authorities. The government expects infections to rise as social restriction measures are eased, with the deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, warning that lockdowns could be reintroduced if further waves of Covid-19 are recorded. Kelly said the decision to keep the rules relaxed would that require authorities were satisfied with a combination of factors, including that the virus\u2019s effective reproduction rate remained below one and there was a low growth rate of infections. If local health districts became overwhelmed to a point where they couldn\u2019t respond to an outbreak, lockdowns could be tightened. Kelly has defended how authorities have handled an outbreak connected to Melbourne\u2019s Cedar Meats Processing plant, after reports that it took weeks to identify it as a cluster. Asked what authorities have learnt from this outbreak, Kelly said: It is very similar to a criminal investigation. You don\u2019t expect everything to come out in the first few minutes or hours or even days. Sometimes it can be quite complex. I don\u2019t believe and I don\u2019t accept the premise that Victorian DHHS [Department of Health and Human Services] hid this in any way. They have been certainly very transparent and open about the issues that they are facing. Paul Kelly also stresses that \u201cit\u2019s important that we have as many people as possible downloading\u201d the Covidsafe contact tracing app. He says the app has been downloaded 5.1m times since it launched 10 days ago. Responding to concerns about the app\u2019s compatibility with smartphones, he says \u201cover 90%\u201d of smartphone operating systems are compatible with it. Kelly also says that scientific research of Covid-19 has now confirmed that \u201cchildren in general are not as much of an issue in terms of this virus\u201d: It is absolutely clear now that it is less infectious in children. Children are less likely to spread the virus between each other, or even from children to adults. They are less likely to be infected and they are less likely to have severe infection and very, very rarely does that end up in intensive care and the more severe end of the spectrum. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 statistics as of Wednesday afternoon are: - 6,875 cases across the country, 62 patients are in hospital, 27 are in intensive care and 18 are on ventilators - 97 deaths - 688,000 tests have been conducted - 26 new cases have been diagnosed in the last 24 hours, which Kelly notes is a higher daily increase than recent figures but says they are mostly from outbreaks in Victoria and NSW. Government ministers including the prime minister have repeated the claim we need some 40% of the 16 million Australian smartphone users to download the Covidsafe app for it to be effective. It remains unclear where this figure came from. The Department of Health\u2019s acting secretary, Caroline Edwards, said she had never advised the health minister, Greg Hunt, of any download target, and no advice from the department had indicated what percentage of people need to download the app for national cabinet to consider easing restrictions at this Friday\u2019s meeting. One major issue is many of the most vulnerable groups, including the Indigenous population, people living with disabilities, people experiencing homelessness and older people are unlikely to have a phone that can run the app. Although the government messaging has been that the app is like \u201csunscreen\u201d, Edwards stressed that people should not be lulled into a false sense of security by having it, nor should they be worried if they don\u2019t. She said the app was just an add-on to the manual contact tracing methods, not designed to replace them. Manual contact tracing will need to continue to be strong as restrictions are eased. Nine is reporting that an aged-care facility in Melbourne has gone into lockdown after an employee tested positive for Covid-19. The report says the employee at the Doutta Galla aged care home in Footscray had last worked at the facility on 26 April. \u201cThere is not an outbreak nor a Covid-19 cluster,\u201d the facility\u2019s chief executive, Vanda Iaconese, is reported as saying. A NSW Port Authority senior manager has told an inquiry that the manager of Carnival Australia \u201ccould not explain at all why the ship docked\u201d when the Ruby Princess returned to Sydney on 19 March. Robert Rybanic, the senior manager of cruise and terminal operations at NSW Port Authority, said Paul Mifsud, a manager of Carnival Australia, told him \u201cit was basically business as usual\u201d. \u201cHe said that NSW Health had deemed the ship low risk,\u201d Rybanic told a special inquiry into the ship. \u201cHe said it was not a Covid ship, that the booking of ambulances were not related to Covid.\u201d Earlier, a trainee paramedic, Simeon Pridmore, told the inquiry he had written that a sick passenger from the ship was \u201csuspected [of] Covid\u201d and he was taken \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when he arrived at Royal Prince Alfred hospital. The ship\u2019s port agent, Dobrila Tokovic, also told the inquiry earlier today that the ambulances had not been called for respiratory issues, but because the patients had \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves. A paramedic has told the Ruby Princess special inquiry that when he arrived to take two sick passengers off the ship on 19 March he was told by the ship\u2019s doctor or nurse that other passengers had already left the ship and gone to hospital to get tested for Covid-19. Mathew Symonds told the special inquiry into the ship that he had boarded the vessel and went to its medical centre at 2.48am to transport a sick patient to Royal Prince Alfred hospital. That patient later died of Covid-19. In a written statement, he said either the doctor or nurse onboard had told him other passengers had disembarked the ship and had gone to RPA to be tested. The commissioner, Bret Walker SC, asked Symonds if he could have been confused and been told that \u201cswabs\u201d rather than passengers \u201chad been disembarked for testing\u201d. Symonds said that was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d the case. The paramedic also said he had observed the sick passenger was receiving oxygen treatment onboard, using \u201cnasal prongs\u201d, also known as an \u201coxygen nasal cannula\u201d. He also provided the patient with oxygen while transporting her. Symonds said the woman had an oxygen saturation of 94%, which \u201cwith a comorbidity of emphysema\u201d would \u201cnot strike me as odd\u201d. The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, has linked his decision to back away from the Liberal preselection contest for the Eden-Monaro byelection to an alleged \u201csmear\u201d by his deputy premier, John Barilaro. In a press conference this afternoon, Constance said he had been \u201csidelined\u201d by the front page of today\u2019s Daily Telegraph, which featured an article alleging that Barilaro, who announced he would not contest Eden-Monaro for the Nationals earlier in the week, had labelled him a \u201ccunt\u201d in private conversations when considering a tilt at the federal seat. This morning Constance announced that he had changed his mind and would not quit state politics to run for the federal seat \u2013 just a day after announcing the plan. When I said politics is stuffed in this country, and some of the people in it need to have a long hard look, I meant it. We\u2019re now seeing that in such a great way on the front page of the Telegraph. I mean, stuff that. I mean, like, seriously. I hadn\u2019t signed up to, you know, contest federally to be called that type of smear. Constance said he had since had a \u201cfruitful\u201d conversation with Barilaro after seeing the newspaper article, but added: I think people have had a gutful of this stuff. I\u2019ve had a gutful of it. He criticised people who sought to \u201cplay politics\u201d over his decision to open up about his struggle with mental health after summer\u2019s bushfires in his local seat of Bega on the NSW south coast. We\u2019re trying to destigmatise these things and we\u2019ve got, you know, big strong people out there who think that it\u2019s OK to run round and play politics with it. When you see, you know, your name associated with that type of language on the front page of the paper, anyone thinking about entering politics \u2026 why would I sit here for the next five weeks defending that type of front page? The government agency behind Covidsafe has admitted to a parliamentary committee that there are issues with the iPhone version of the app. Some 5.1 million people have downloaded and registered on the app on both iPhone and Android, but those on iPhone may not be recording accurate data about people they\u2019ve been in contact with. The Digital Transformation Agency chief, Randall Brugeaud, told the Senate committee that if the app is running and in the foreground with the screen unlocked, it is exchanging Bluetooch handshakes with others running the app in the area, but this connectivity lessens if the screen is locked and the app is in the background. \u201cWhat we can say is the quality of the Bluetooth connectivity for phones that have the app installed running in the foreground is very good. And it progressively deteriorates and the quality of the connection is not as good as you get to a point where the phone is locked in the app is running in the background.\u201d This admission comes despite repeated claims from the government that the iPhone app operates the same, whether in the foreground or the background. Brugeaud said another factor would be if the iPhone was older, in which case the quality would also be poorer (the app doesn\u2019t work on phones running below iOS 10). Officials from both the Department of Health and the Attorney General\u2019s Department also reiterated the rules about accessing the data, stating that police could not access it for any purpose. While they could not give a \u201c100%\u201d guarantee that the data, held in Australia by Amazon, would not be accessed by US law enforcement they pointed out it will be a crime to move the data outside of Australia, and said they had legal advice from the Australian government solicitor that made them confident privacy would not be compromised. They refused to waive privilege to detail the legal advice. The Department of Health acting secretary, Caroline Edwards, also revealed that the department was seeking to determine whether Strathfield council had forced staff to download the app, in breach of the law. The matter may end up being referred to police. That\u2019s where I will leave you for today. Thanks, as always, for reading. I want to give a special shoutout to my neighbour, who has spent the last four hours banging a hammer into the wall next to my head for no discernible reason. Couldn\u2019t have done it without you. I\u2019ll hand you over to my colleague Elias Visontay, who will take you through the rest of the afternoon. The health department is investigating this Daily Telegraph report that employees at Strathfield council in Sydney have been ordered to download the Covidsafe app on to their work devices. McGowan also says the state\u2019s border will remain closed for the foreseeable future. He also says WA is better than NSW \u2013 an obvious lie. Western Australia is a much better place than New South Wales so I can understand people in New South Wales wanting to come to Western Australia but, no, we will keep the border in place for a longer period of time to protect ourselves from potential infection spreading here from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. Mark McGowan says he believes the unemployment rate in WA is between 10% and 11%. About 80,000 people have lost their jobs since the Covid-19 crisis began. That is way too high and clearly we need to take steps to bring that down. It is catastrophic for many people. It is catastrophic for many businesses. It is very sad to see it. Clearly the jobkeeper payment and the increase in the jobseeker payment will expire at some point in time so we need to come up with ways of getting the economy back on its feet in a Covid-safe and health-safe way. Before the Senate\u2019s Covid-19 committee began today\u2019s hearing, the chair, Katy Gallagher, made some comments about the Eden-Monaro contest and Andrew Constance\u2019s decision to pull out. She told reporters in Canberra: I think it\u2019s a contrast \u2013 we\u2019ve got Kristy McBain, a local candidate, there working hard, part of her community, putting the community first and then we\u2019ve got this unseemly battle that goes right to the top of the Morrison government and I think that says it all, really. The people of Eden-Monaro need leadership \u2026 someone who cares about the people of that electorate rather than someone\u2019s political ambition. Gallagher said McBain was \u201cout in front by miles\u201d in the race to demonstrate who the \u201cnext best representative\u201d of the electorate is. She also addressed evidence by the home affairs department on Tuesday that it refused to guarantee it would respond to subpoenas from the Ruby Princess inquiry: Certainly, you got the feeling the federal government was prepared to comply with the special commission of inquiry up to a point and they certainly gave themselves room to move in that space, and that would ultimately be a matter for the government and I think that is concerning. Apparently we\u2019re all in this together until we\u2019re not all in this together. Mark McGowan is speaking in Perth. The WA premier says the state has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 overnight. That\u2019s its seventh day in a row without a new case. The state still has 14 active cases, with seven people in hospital. Three remain in intensive care. Another prominent Liberal party member has ruled himself out of contention for pre-selection in the Eden-Monaro byelection. Senator Jim Molan, who had been tipped to nominate, says he will not put his hand up. He\u2019s just issued a statement, insisting he was not \u201cintimidated by the prospect of competing in a preselection or in a campaign\u201d but that he is due to have surgery soon. It is my belief that the most important contribution I can make to the Morrison government, and to serve the people of New South Wales who supported me so strongly, is to continue to engage on national security and sovereignty issues in the Senate. The Covid-19 crisis has graphically demonstrated what those of us who have been advocating for a national security strategy in Australia have been speaking about for years: the absence of a strategy exposes us to unacceptable risk. I thank colleagues and supporters who have suggested to me that I may be the right person to put myself forward to represent the people and communities of Eden-Monaro, to fight for their views in recovering from both bushfire and Covid-19, and to represent their interests in Canberra. Because of media reports, I do wish to clarify that no one has tried to force me to not nominate, nor was I ever intimidated by the prospect of competing in a preselection or in a campaign. We now have a range of good Liberal candidates for Eden-Monaro who will be subject to the democratic process of preselection. This will be the first formal preselection conducted through a plebiscite under democratic reform rules in NSW, something which I and many others fought for over many years. My decision was also strongly influenced by the fact that I must have surgery on a condition I have been putting off for the last year because of politics. I cannot put surgery off any longer and I will enter hospital tomorrow and expect a full recovery. The Morrison government has led us brilliantly through Covid-19 crisis, and as a proud resident of Eden-Monaro, I shall join my fellow Liberals in campaigning fiercely for our endorsed candidate to join the prime minister\u2019s team as he guides Australia back to a secure, safe and prosperous post-Covid-19 existence. A paramedic who took a sick passenger off the Ruby Princess wrote that the patient was \u201csuspected [of] Covid\u201d, a special inquiry has heard. Earlier today, the ship\u2019s port agent, Dobrila Tokovic, said ambulances had not been called for respiratory issues but because the patients had \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves. But she said the ship\u2019s doctor had told her to let paramedics know the passengers had been swabbed for Covid-19 and they should wear protective equipment. Simeon Pridmore, a trainee paramedic who transported one passenger, told the inquiry that his case description on the day had said: \u201cOn board testing showed negative for influenza and suspected Covid.\u201d He said his case description was \u201can amalgamation of both a doctor\u2019s report \u2013 I received a verbal handover and a written handover \u2013 as well as info provided by the patient\u201d. Earlier, Tokovic told the inquiry that sick passengers were usually sent to St Vincent\u2019s hospital, but that these two were had been to Royal Prince Alfred hospital. Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley SC, asked if this was because Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and Tokovic said she did not recall. Pridmore later told the inquiry that he had been taken \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when his ambulance arrived at Royal Prince Alfred. The Walkley Foundation may as well hand over the award for headline of the year now, we\u2019ve just flushed the competition (sorry). Trust Sydney\u2019s rental market to have already developed a vaccine for Covid-19. Here\u2019s something I missed from that earlier interview of Scott Morrison by Ray Hadley. The prime minister says NRL players who refuse to get a flu shot should be banned from competing. Morrison is adamant that players should abide by a \u201cno jab, no play\u201d policy after the Gold Coast player Bryce Cartwright polarised the rugby league community by refusing to consent to the shot. Cartwright rejected a request to be vaccinated as part of strict measures to restart the NRL competition on 28 May and must now explain his actions to the NRL chief medical officer, Paul Bloomfield. \u201cWhen I was social services minister I started the \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 rule into the childcare facilities,\u201d Morrison told Hadley on Wednesday. \u201cAnd I think the same rule applies there \u2013 no jab, no play.\u201d An NRL spokesperson told AAP that players who refused to receive the shot would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis amid consultation with club and NRL medical staff. While reports claimed Cartwright faced a ban, the NRL spokesperson refused to speculate on possible penalties if a player could not justify refusing to take the shot. The NRL is not aware of any other player rejecting the jab. A Rugby League Players Association spokesman said on Wednesday a player who refused to be vaccinated had the option to sign a waiver in order for them to continue to train and be available for selection while their case was dealt with by the NRL. The spokesman said the RLPA strongly recommended flu shots in biosecurity protocols but believed players who refused should be dealt with case by case, and that the vaccination was not mandatory. The league community appears to be split down the middle by Cartwright\u2019s stance as the majority of NRL teams returned to training on Wednesday. The former Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and New South Wales captain Paul Gallen backed the Titans star. \u201cI\u2019m not against the flu shot, but I just think if they don\u2019t want to have it, they don\u2019t have to have it,\u201d he told 2GB\u2019s Wide World of Sports Radio. \u201cIf they don\u2019t want to put it into their body, they don\u2019t have to have it.\u201d The ACT has again recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. A total of 103 people have recovered from Covid-19 and have been released from self-isolation, according to the territory\u2019s health department. The ACT has recorded three deaths from the virus. The port agent for the Ruby Princess has told a special inquiry that Australian Border Force officers were \u201caware\u201d that passengers were in isolation onboard with influenza-like illnesses. Dobrila Tokovic, an employee of Carnival Australia, said she had met with three ABF officers and one from the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment at 6am on 19 March and \u201c[The ABF] asked me about the people in isolation\u201d. \u201cThey were aware of them already,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me about where they were, were they isolated. And was advised that they didn\u2019t want to see them.\u201d \u201cIt is not unusual for ABF officers to not want to see passengers who may be unwell,\u201d she added. Canned soup has beaten out toilet paper as the top supermarket item purchased in the panic-buying spree that gripped Australia in March, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The ABS released its full March retail sales report on Wednesday, showing a record 8.5% jump in the value of purchases. Ben James, the director of the ABS quarterly economy wide surveys, said there was \u201cunprecedented demand in food retailing, household goods, and other retailing\u201d. \u201cHowever the impact of social distancing regulations saw sales fall in cafes, restaurants and takeaway food services, and discretionary spending in clothing footwear and personal accessory retailing, and department stores, was also weak,\u201d he said. While food retail spending grew by 24.1%, some obvious areas were hit hard. Restaurants and takeaway food services went down by 22.9%, clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing fell 22.6% and department stores by 8.9%. But in the race to be the most panic-purchased item, canned and mix dry soup has beaten out all competitors, rising by 180% through March. Flour sales rose by more than 140%. Toilet and other paper products came in third, rising by almost 120%. There were other big increases for canned fruit or vegetables (100%), pasta and noodles (110%) and long-life milk (80%). Sky is reporting that the New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, will still not run for Eden-Monaro after sending one of the all-time \u201ctexts from last night\u201d to the federal Nationals leader, Michael McCormack. Andrew Constance has released a statement confirming he will not contest Liberal party preselection for the seat of Eden-Monaro, saying he wants to \u201cremain focused on the bushfire recovery\u201d: I need to remain focused on the bushfire recovery and be grateful for the opportunities I already have. The community\u2019s needs at this difficult time must be the centre of the campaign. I appreciate people will be confused by my actions over the past couple of days, and for that I am sorry. I also have unfinished business as Transport and Roads Minister. I want to deliver crucial life-saving reforms in road safety and a safer, cleaner future in public transport. I want to thank the Premier for her incredible support and will continue to lead the bushfire recovery in my community by working with her, Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons and the recovery coordinators Dick Adams and Andrew Colvin. As Bega MP I will be supporting the Liberal campaign and ask the people of Eden Monaro to reflect on the benefits of having a member of the federal Liberal government. After two days with no new cases of Covid-19, New Zealand has recorded two new cases on Wednesday. A day after its prime minister Jacinda Ardern joined a meeting of Australia\u2019s national cabinet meeting, the country has also recorded its 21st Covid-19 death. The woman was a resident of the Rosewood rest home in Christchurch. Labor\u2019s aged care spokeswoman, Julie Collins, has renewed her calls for the aged care royal commission to investigate the coronavirus outbreak at Newmarch House amid revelations about the management of surge staff at the western Sydney facility. Collins was responding to a Guardian Australia report that the government-contracted private medical firm Aspen Medical sent responders who had boarded the Ruby Princess into a Sydney aged-care facility battling its own deadly outbreak just days later: New reports today about the second wave of infections at Newmarch House underscore the need for a full investigation into what has gone wrong at the facility. The residents of Newmarch House, their loved ones and staff deserve answers ... Sixteen residents have sadly passed away at the facility and more than 60 people have tested positive. Australia\u2019s aged care system was broken before the COVID-19 pandemic and this is only putting extra stress on the system. Two Aspen Medical surge staff clinicians who conducted screening and testing of crew onboard the Ruby Princess up until its departure from Port Kembla on 23 April worked a shift at Newmarch on 25 April after testing negative for Covid-19. The revelation came as Aspen complied with a request to stand down a member of its surge staff on Monday after Newmarch\u2019s operator, Anglicare, accused the carer of \u201cbreaches of the PPE [Personal Protective Equipment] protocol\u201d. Two passengers who were taken by ambulance off the Ruby Princess would ordinarily have been taken to St Vincent\u2019s hospital but were instead taken to Royal Prince Alfred, which was a designated \u201cCovid response hospital\u201d, a special inquiry has heard. Dobrila Tokovic, the port agent for the Ruby Princess, booked ambulances for two sick passengers on 19 March \u2013 one of whom later died of Covid-19. Tokovic has told the inquiry today that the ambulances were not called for respiratory issues but were called because the patients had \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves. But she said they were taken to a different hospital than usual. Counsel assisting, Richard Beasley, said a transcript of her call showed she told paramedics: \u201cWe\u2019ve been requested by New South Wales [sic] to take them to the Royal Prince Alfred.\u201d Tokovic told the inquiry today that \u201cwe always select St Vincent\u2019s, as just a common, \u2018Please send them to St Vincent\u2019s.\u2019\u201d Beasley asked: \u201cRPA was allocated as a Covid response hospital, do you recall having any discussion with anyone about that fact? And that\u2019s why the RPA was nominated?\u201d Tokovic said she did not recall. The port agent also said that when paramedics had boarded the ship, the onboard doctor had discussed one patient\u2019s \u201coxygen saturation\u201d. \u201cShe said that was what had changed throughout the night,\u201d Tokovic said. She added that when she had arrived at the dock, there was nobody from the NSW Port Authority, NSW Health or Australian Border Force present. Tokovic said she had been the one tasked with taking the 13 Covid-19 swabs from the ship on 19 March, and she had given them to a driver who was a subcontractor hired by Carnival Australia to take them to the lab. Yesterday a NSW Health senior epidemiologist said those test results had been delayed because the lab had not processed them as a priority. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, is speaking in Melbourne. He says there are still 66 people with Covid-19 in hospitals across Australia, including 27 in ICU and 18 on ventilators. Hunt also says there has now been more than 5m downloads and registrations of the Covidsafe contact tracing app. My colleague Anne Davies has confirmed those reports that Andrew Constance will pull out of the Eden Monaro byelection \u2013 just 24 hours after announcing his intention to run. The NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has told Sky News this morning that he wants restaurants and cafes in the state to begin reopening as Covid-19 restrictions ease. \u201cThe main focus we have at the moment \u2026 we want the NSW economy to be opened up as much as possible but at the same time, we want to do that in a way that keeps people safe,\u201d he told Sky. \u201cWe obviously want to see restaurants and cafes move from takeaway to actually having people sit down, and obviously will be in a way that social distancing is in practice, but we have a range of areas we are working through.\u201d This, I have to stress, has not been confirmed. Sky, SBS and the Ten network are reporting that the New South Wales transport minister, Andrew Constance, will withdraw from the Eden Monaro byelection. Very Mal Meninga if true. A port agent for Carnival Australia, the operator of the Ruby Princess, has told a special inquiry that the ship \u201churried\u201d back to Sydney early because it had Covid-19 swabs that needed urgent testing. She added that this meant Australian Border Force officers were \u201cnot going to be there\u201d, and would not be present when it docked. Dobrila Tokovic, who was the port agent for the Ruby Princess on 19 March, told the inquiry that the ship had been scheduled to dock at 6am but had come in at 3am. \u201c[The ABF] are present on the basis of the scheduled disembarkation time,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would not have been on site until 6am.\u201d Tokovic said she had called an ABF manager to \u201cnotify them the vessel is coming in earlier\u201d and said two passengers needed immediate ambulance transfers to hospital. Counsel assisting the inquiry, Richard Beasley SC, asked the port agent if she understood this early arrival was because the ship was \u201churrying back to Sydney because it had Covid swabs that needed urgent testing\u201d. She said this was her understanding. The inquiry continues. In that same interview, Scott Morrison said he thought the Ruby Princess inquiry commissioner, Bret Walker SC, was \u201ca bit out of line\u201d after his tough questioning reduced a senior epidemiologist to tears. Walker is heading the New South Wales inquiry into the cruise ship fiasco. On Tuesday a senior epidemiologist, Kelly-Anne Ressler, broke down under questioning from Walker, saying members of the state\u2019s public health unit \u201care working very hard\u201d. \u201cWe did what we could,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if we could do it again, it would be very different. It was not our intent.\u201d Speaking to Ray Hadley this morning, Morrison said he thought Walker was \u201ca bit out of line\u201d. \u201cAnd I think to see her reduced to that under the aggressive line of questioning, you\u2019ve got to get the balance right on this one and I hope Mr Walker would reflect on that,\u201d he said. \u201c[Public servants] have been working day and night for months and months and months. They\u2019re not perfect, they\u2019re not going to get it right every single time.\u201d Good morning, blog readers, thanks as always for hanging out with me. In the time of coronavirus, a lot of our petty grievances seem to have fallen away as we focus on the bigger issue facing us all. It\u2019s in that spirit, it seems, that the Sydney radio shock jock Ray Hadley and the prime minister, Scott Morrison, are speaking again. You might remember Hadley and Morrison\u2019s bromance came to a spectacular end in 2017 when the then treasurer bumped his regular spot on radio 2GB for an interview with the ABC. Hadley banned Morrison from his show, accusing him of lying, being \u201cboring\u201d and treating him \u201clike an idiot\u201d. Well, earlier this morning Morrison was back with Hadley, who offered his \u201csincere apologies\u201d to the prime minister. \u201cA few years ago I had a blue with you and it was the subject of much publicity,\u201d Hadley said. \u201cI want to apologise, because I think you\u2019ve proven since your time, particularly this critical time, you\u2019ll end up one of our great prime ministers. I think you have handled yourself with class, dignity and distinction and a level of energy I\u2019ve rarely seen. So accept my sincere apologies. \u201cYou\u2019re a great prime minister and I appreciate your time today.\u201d Morrison accepted the apology. Love in the time of coronavirus, eh. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you this morning but my inimitable colleague Michael McGowan will guide you through the rest of the day. In sports news, overnight the Albury council voted against the Melbourne Storm using its facilities. The NRL team relocated up to the NSW border town after they were refused permission to train in Victoria. A little more from Jim Chalmers: Jobkeeper has the capacity to do a heap of good in our workforce and in our broader community as well ... but the confusion around it, the poor communication, the fumbled implementation, the exemptions from the jobkeeper payments, means so many more Australians will join the unemployment queue as a consequence of these decisions than is necessary. So when unemployment spikes in the next little while, and it will, Australians need to know that that unemployment rate is higher than it needed to be because of the way the government has gone about this. The federal shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has criticised Josh Frydenberg\u2019s management of the jobkeeper program. Jobkeeper is a good idea, being badly implemented, badly communicated, and too many workers are left out and left behind ... When the treasurer says that this program is coming in under budget, what he really means is that it is too hard for too many businesses and too many workers to access the scheme itself. The federal minister for agriculture, David Littleproud, is speaking now. He is advocating for an additional levy on all Australian dairy products, similar to those now imposed on milk, to support farmers. We\u2019ve lost over 500 dairy farmers in the last 12 months. There is considerable structural reform that needs to take place within the dairy market ... Australians need to understand that dairy farmers don\u2019t get that full 10 cents. They\u2019re only getting a small portion of that ... Some of it goes into butter and cheese and yoghurt and some of the branded milk doesn\u2019t also have that levy. So we asked the supermarkets to work with processors to ensure there is a better mechanism to get more back to the dairy farm gate to help dairy farmers survive through the drought, the fire and now Covid-19. So here is what we know about the new Covid-19 cases across the country. Victoria \u2013 17, including four connected to Cedar Meat NSW \u2013 nine, with five still under investigation Tasmania \u2013 two, including one health care worker Queensland \u2013 zero Tasmania\u2019s health minister, Sarah Courtney, said two more people had been diagnosed with Covid-19 overnight. One patient was a direct contact of an existing case and the other a healthcare worker from Launceston general hospital. Courtney said that person had not been at work for nearly a fortnight. We had said before that it wasn\u2019t going to be unexpected if we got further cases and, while it is always hopeful that we won\u2019t, we need to be mindful that this disease does exist in Tasmania. Tasmanians need to be vigilant. And to that end, I\u2019d like to remind Tasmanians how important it is to be aware of your symptoms. Victoria\u2019s treasurer, Tim Pallas, has confirmed that the state has recorded 17 additional Covid-19 cases overnight. Of these, four are linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, taking the total for that cluster to 49. Seven of today\u2019s cases are overseas travellers in mandatory quarantine. Six remain under investigation. So we\u2019ve had no new deaths reported overnight. There are now eight people with coronavirus in hospital in Victoria, six in intensive care. More than 10,000 tests were conducted in the state yesterday. Inquiries into the Ruby Princess cruise ship continue today. Yesterday it was revealed that a senior doctor onboard told a NSW Health employee that \u201cwe just have to stop all cruise ships\u201d from as early as 8 March. My colleague Naaman Zhou is back on deck covering the inquiries today. Catch up on what you missed here: Victoria\u2019s opposition leader has taken to Twitter with a fairly searing condemnation of the state\u2019s handling of the Cedar Meats cluster. The ABC is reporting that there are 17 new cases in Victoria today. Four of them have come from the Cedar Meats cluster. The rest are from people in hotel quarantine or are still under investigation. More information to come on this one. One of the biggest news stories in Victoria this week is, of course, the Cedar Meats processing plant. Forty-five people associated with the cluster have now tested positive and the abattoir has been shut down for deep cleaning. The meat works management has previously said they first became aware of one of their workers being infected on 27 April, but the Australia newspaper is today reporting that the first case was diagnosed on 2 April. It said the Victoria Department of Health and Human Services confirmed there was a positive case in early April but the worker did not attend the facility while infectious, and therefor the facility was not considered an exposure site. Hopefully I can bring you a bit more information on this one once Victoria holds its daily press conference. Catch up with the Melbourne meat works situation here: The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has spoken about the Aspen health workers\u2019 presence on both the Ruby Princess and at the Newmarch House aged care home. If every time a healthcare worker who cared for a patient with Covid was then was required to take 14 days we wouldn\u2019t have healthcare workers to care for patients ... In terms of the workers we have no indication that they were in any way the source of infection ... At the moment the earliest introduction into the facility was the original aged care worker. Glady Berejiklian is holding her daily press conference now. The NSW premier says nine new cases of Covid-19 were identified in the state overnight. If you are looking for an informative and moving podcast to start your day, may I suggest today\u2019s episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s Full Story. Its host, Laura Murphy-Oates, talks with the Guardian Australia reporter Ben Doherty about the more than 1 million people in Australia who have been excluded from government assistance. Frydenberg defended the government\u2019s plan to remove the addition $550 jobseeker supplement in October, returning recipients to receiving about $40 a day. I believe that Australia has a fair and decent welfare and safety net ... The reality is that we want to get as many people off the unemployment lines and into a job, and we can do that through reforms in the recovery stage, namely around infrastructure tax, industrial relations deregulation skills ... Our spending through the coronavirus process has been consistent right along, it\u2019s temporary, it\u2019s targeted and proportionate, and it uses existing tax and transfer system. Frydenberg is having a busy morning. He\u2019s speaking with ABC radio now. Unlike his fellow cabinet member Dan Tehan, Frydenberg has encouraged parents to listen to state premiers on whether to send their children to school. I want my kids to go back to school as quickly as possible. They\u2019re obviously home-schooling \u2013 I\u2019ve got young children. Like many other families that will take the medical advice and will follow what the Victorian government has outlined, because obviously it\u2019s their decision when it comes to government schools and when it comes to non-government schools. Josh Frydenberg said the government was keen to have large portions of the Australia economy back online by the start of July if the curve continues to flatten. The fact is we saw just a few weeks ago the number of coronavirus cases here in Australia increase by more than 20% per day, that is now well below 1%. And as a result of flattening the curve, we should be able to ease those restrictions. They\u2019re the discussions the national cabinet had yesterday and they\u2019ll have again on Friday. The lesson for history, the early 1990s, with a massive spike in unemployment, the quicker you can get people back to jobs the better off the economy and the better off those individuals. The West Australian is reporting on its front page today that the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is now receiving round-the-clock protection from the federal police. This is allegedly due to threats he has received in relation to the economic fallout from the Covid-19 lockdowns. Frydenberg was asked about this on ABC this morning. They\u2019re matters the federal police handle and I will leave any comments to them and the minister for home affairs. You know, they make their assessments and I behave accordingly ... I\u2019m getting about my daily job. Yesterday I made a speech to the National Press Club about the importance of getting people back to jobs and back to work and the $4bn price tag from the restrictions \u2013 that\u2019s the loss of economic activity each week, as these restrictions stay in place \u2013 and the importance of having them lifted in accordance with the medical advice. More developments from the Newmarch House aged care home. Aspen Medical clinicians who tested cruise ship crew for coronavirus later worked in aged-care home where 16 people have died. My colleague Elias Visontay has the full report: Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. We will bring you all the latest news and updates as the day goes on. You have me, Matilda Boseley, with you for the first part of the day. Last night Scott Morrison announced on Instagram that the Queen had called to wish Australians well in dealing with coronavirus, bushfires and drought, AAP reports. \u201cWas very kind to receive Her Majesty\u2019s call this evening to check in and see how we\u2019re all getting on in Australia,\u201d Morrison wrote on Instagram on Tuesday night. \u201cThe Queen was very interested to hear about our progress in combating Covid-19 and was so pleased we have managed to prevent the terrible impacts. \u201cOur recovery from the bushfires was also a key area of interest for her as well as the ongoing drought. \u201cHer Majesty was also pleased to hear our horse races were still running in Australia and sent her very best wishes to all Australians.\u201d In other overnight developments: Mike Pence confirmed that the White House was considering winding down its coronavirus taskforce. The news comes as the US\u2019s death toll surpassed 70,000, representing more than a quarter of all coronavirus deaths reported across the world. UK overtook Italy to become the country with the highest Covid-19 death toll in Europe, reaching 29,427. There are now calls for an inquiry into the country\u2019s response. One of the UK\u2019s top scientific coronavirus advisers, Neil Ferguson, has resigned after it was discovered he had broken strict lockdown rules. The confirmed global death toll passed 250,000, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Five Eyes intelligence network, the World Health Organization and Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infections diseases and a key member of Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, have all said there is no current evidence to suggest that coronavirus leaked from a Chinese research laboratory. OK, let\u2019s get started.",

Now, as the lone chaplain in her hospital, she confronts death on a daily basis.

They\u2019re present in these people\u2019s lives. One nurse asked me, \u2018I just don\u2019t know what to say.\u2019 I told her, \u2018Just keep on saying, \u2018You\u2019re not alone. I am with you.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Each floor of the hospital is equipped with tablets that Maddalone uses to connect family members to loved ones who are on the brink of death, family who would otherwise receive a phone call after the fact. A son in Oregon who was able to speak to his father one last time. A woman gazing at her husband through a screen. \u201cImagine yourself in the room,\u201d Maddalone tells her. \u201cImagine holding his hand and telling him whatever you want to tell him.\u201d She uses Zoom and FaceTime, and when she\u2019s unable to visit a certain patient, some rooms are equipped with Amazon Echo Show, where a camera can beam images to loved ones in an instant \u2013 all under the hospital\u2019s secure network that ensures privacy.</p> <p>As a pastor for 20 years at churches in neighboring Rockland county, Maddalone plied her trade with a warm embrace. She baptized babies and laid hands on the sick, passed the peace and buried the dead. God was in the hugs that congratulated newlyweds and young graduates, in the tears that fell whenever anyone received a scary diagnosis. So much assurance had passed through her hands, and now that conduit has been largely closed. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m behind my PPE and I can\u2019t wait \u2026\u201d she says, then pauses to compose herself. \u201cI can\u2019t wait until I can hold all these people again.\u201d</p> <p>The virus and its cruel isolation have reminded her what she\u2019s long known, that God lives in the small and in-between spaces of each day, in the seemingly inconsequential. In the case of Gatorade that miraculously appeared one afternoon after a nurse, sweltering in her PPE during long and awful shift, had muttered, \u201cI could really use a Gatorade.\u201d And the divine is in every pair of eyes that open after a ventilator is switched off and life is granted another day. In the small and labored steps down a hallway as they learn to walk again, each little shuffle a thousand loaves and fishes.</p> <p>\u201cEverything feels so sacred right now,\u201d she says. \u201cThese little synchronicities assure me there\u2019s a force greater than myself out there at work.\u201d</p> <p>And she\u2019s learned to embrace the divine that moves through a Zoom chat, even as her hands can no longer touch. \u201cWe have to get used to seeing God differently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s made me so grateful that we even have this technology.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus lockdown has caused major disruption to students, driving many back home as universities have been forced to close, leaving their rented halls of residence or privately rented rooms empty. Some accommodation providers have agreed to waive or cut fees, but others have refused to release students from their contracts. Students in privately run accommodation in several cities have gone on rent strike, including Portsmouth and Bristol. Issues about whether or not students must continue to pay rent for accommodation that they are not using due to the coronavirus crisis will depend on the type of accommodation or their tenancy agreement. If a student has a private landlord, it is likely they will have entered into an assured shorthold tenancy agreement, which may be hard to get out of, says Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at the law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, although they could try arguing that the contract has been frustrated by the Covid-19 outbreak. In rare instances, tenancy agreements contain a \u201cforce majeure\u201d clause, allowing parties to terminate a contract if events beyond their control prevent them for performing their obligations under it. While Covid-19 may be a force majeure event, says Manjinder Kaur Atwal, director of housing and property litigation at the law firm Duncan Lewis, it is unlikely to stop a tenancy from continuing. If students have entered into a contract for a fixed period of time, which is yet to expire, she explains there may be a break clause allowing them to terminate the contract before the end of the fixed term, after providing the required notice. Students are advised to negotiate with their landlord immediately, as the obligation to pay their rent will continue in accordance with their contract, and adds Atwal, they could remain liable for any rent due up to the expiry of the notice period. If the contract does not have a break clause or it cannot be applied yet, there is no automatic right to end the contract. Here, students seeking to terminate their tenancy should notify their landlord. Fitzpatrick says a landlord may agree to terminate the contract, in which case they will no longer have to pay the rent. Alternatively, a landlord may agree to a rent reduction or waiver for a certain period. In the event the student is not released from the contract, Atwal adds, the landlord has the right to request the money due from the student or their guarantor, even after the student has moved out. Students could press the landlord to try to rent the property out to others in order to mitigate any loss, suggests Fitzpatrick, noting that once the property is re-let, the landlord cannot continue to charge them. If a student rents accommodation with others, some of whom do not want to terminate their contract, she adds, that it is unlikely that a student would be able to leave without continuing to pay the rent unless a replacement tenant is found and agreed with the landlord. For students renting university halls of residence, some universities have agreed to release students from rent obligations. Where they have not, Fitzpatrick suggests that students have a strong case for arguing that they should not be charged for accommodation they are no longer able to use. \u201cThey could argue that they have only rented the accommodation because they are going to that university, and as they cannot go to university they should be able to end the contract.\u201d If the accommodation is rented from a private landlord recommended by the university, it will be harder for students to get out of paying the rent due, he says. But he suggests contact their student union and liaison officers and ask them to get the university to negotiate with landlords and press them to waive or reduce rents. \u201cWhere a university has given landlords business over the years, they could suggest that if they do not help their students now, they won\u2019t give them students in the future or they will tell their students to look for other providers\u201d. Where students come to an agreement with their landlord to change terms, Fitzpatrick suggests noting it in writing, but adds, an email will do rather than a formally drafted contract. Failure to pay rent that is due or clear arrears, Fitzpatrick warns, can lead to the enforcement action by the landlord, seeking a possession order if the property is still occupied and/or a money claim for the debt if the property has been vacated. Failure to pay could result in the landlord instructing bailiffs to obtain the value of the money judgment, and he warns, the judgment against them could affect their credit rating, which could affect their future financial plans, making it harder to get credit or loans.

      "body": "<p>The UK health secretary has said he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules by having a woman visit him at his home.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government\u2019s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign, Matt Hancock told Sky News.</p> \n<p>Hancock said: \u201cI back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right, it\u2019s always been like that.<br><br>\u201cEven though I have got a clear answer to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision, but I think he took the right decision to resign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Scotland Yard said later no further action would be taken against Ferguson. A Met police statement criticised his behaviour as \u201cplainly disappointing\u201d but ruled out issuing a fine because he \u201chas taken responsibility\u201d after resigning. The police declined to say whether officers had spoken directly to Ferguson.</p> \n<p>Ferguson, who works with an Imperial College London team whose modelling influenced the government\u2019s decision to move to a lockdown, resigned after the Telegraph revealed that Antonia Staats had crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions, on 30 March and 8 April, since lockdown measures were imposed.</p> \n<p>The scandal was revealed on Tuesday, when figures showed the UK\u2019s official death toll from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">had exceeded that of Italy</a> to become the highest in Europe.<br><br>Hancock said physical distancing rules were very important and everyone should follow them. He said he had supported the Scottish police warning to Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who visited her second home during lockdown.</p> \n<p>He described Ferguson\u2019s decision to flout lockdown rules as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and one that had left him \u201cspeechless\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked whether he was speechless by the presenter, Kay Burley, he said: \u201cI am.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cProf Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science he\u2019s done has been an important part of what we\u2019ve listened to, and I think he took the right decision to resign,\u201d Hancock added.</p> \n<p>He said he would not have fought for Ferguson to keep his job.</p> \n<p>Earlier, another senior minister urged people to stick unequivocally to the coronavirus lockdown.</p> \n<p>James Brokenshire, a Home Office minister, said Ferguson had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and was right to resign. He stressed that the government\u2019s physical distancing guidelines must be followed by law and were \u201cthere to protect us all\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">Ferguson\u2019s resignation</a> had been \u201can appropriate course\u201d because other people had tried so hard to stick to the lockdown, even though it had been hard not to see loved ones.</p> \n<p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Brokenshire stressed it was still important to follow the lockdown rules before Thursday\u2019s review of whether they should be extended, and any decision to ease them would be \u201ccareful, cautious and thoughtful\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XLVK1dmuLhUs/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902XLVK1dmuLhUs/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/neil-ferguson-20-years-experience-with-pathogen-outbreaks\">Neil Ferguson: 20 years' experience with pathogen outbreaks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pressed on why the outcome has been so bad in the UK, Brokenshire gave the clearest acknowledgment yet that the government accepted it had made errors in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>He told Sky News: \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right. But we will have plenty of time for searching questions and to reflect on the actions that were taken.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, he hinted at the inevitability of a public inquiry, saying there would be a \u201cfirm and clear opportunity to look at those issues\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, had already acknowledged that testing should have been increased sooner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"82beeb58-e861-4575-90dd-2b879d1a3a65\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic</a>&nbsp;like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill.

      "bodyText": "The UK health secretary has said he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules by having a woman visit him at his home. Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government\u2019s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign, Matt Hancock told Sky News. Hancock said: \u201cI back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right, it\u2019s always been like that. \u201cEven though I have got a clear answer to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision, but I think he took the right decision to resign.\u201d Scotland Yard said later no further action would be taken against Ferguson. A Met police statement criticised his behaviour as \u201cplainly disappointing\u201d but ruled out issuing a fine because he \u201chas taken responsibility\u201d after resigning. The police declined to say whether officers had spoken directly to Ferguson. Ferguson, who works with an Imperial College London team whose modelling influenced the government\u2019s decision to move to a lockdown, resigned after the Telegraph revealed that Antonia Staats had crossed London from her family home to visit him on at least two occasions, on 30 March and 8 April, since lockdown measures were imposed. The scandal was revealed on Tuesday, when figures showed the UK\u2019s official death toll from coronavirus had exceeded that of Italy to become the highest in Europe. Hancock said physical distancing rules were very important and everyone should follow them. He said he had supported the Scottish police warning to Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who visited her second home during lockdown. He described Ferguson\u2019s decision to flout lockdown rules as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and one that had left him \u201cspeechless\u201d. Asked whether he was speechless by the presenter, Kay Burley, he said: \u201cI am.\u201d \u201cProf Ferguson is a very, very eminent and impressive scientist and the science he\u2019s done has been an important part of what we\u2019ve listened to, and I think he took the right decision to resign,\u201d Hancock added. He said he would not have fought for Ferguson to keep his job. Earlier, another senior minister urged people to stick unequivocally to the coronavirus lockdown. James Brokenshire, a Home Office minister, said Ferguson had made an \u201cerror of judgment\u201d and was right to resign. He stressed that the government\u2019s physical distancing guidelines must be followed by law and were \u201cthere to protect us all\u201d. He said Ferguson\u2019s resignation had been \u201can appropriate course\u201d because other people had tried so hard to stick to the lockdown, even though it had been hard not to see loved ones. In a round of broadcast interviews, Brokenshire stressed it was still important to follow the lockdown rules before Thursday\u2019s review of whether they should be extended, and any decision to ease them would be \u201ccareful, cautious and thoughtful\u201d. Pressed on why the outcome has been so bad in the UK, Brokenshire gave the clearest acknowledgment yet that the government accepted it had made errors in its response to the coronavirus outbreak. He told Sky News: \u201cThere is an acknowledgement mistakes have been made \u2013 no government is going to get everything right. But we will have plenty of time for searching questions and to reflect on the actions that were taken.\u201d Later, he hinted at the inevitability of a public inquiry, saying there would be a \u201cfirm and clear opportunity to look at those issues\u201d. He said Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, had already acknowledged that testing should have been increased sooner. However, the minister appeared to suggest testing levels had been low because of \u201ccapacity constraints\u201d, while at the time politicians and scientists were saying a widespread testing regime was not necessary because the point had passed for trying to contain and suppress the virus. He said: \u201cWould there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes. \u201cThe challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests [per day] in February to 120,000 at the end of April.\u201d",

It is the fourth consecutive day that cases have risen by more than 10,000. The crisis response centre also reported 86 new coronavirus deaths, meaning the death toll in Russia has reached 1,537. UK health secretary says professor who advocated lockdown right to step down after breaking rules The British health secretary has said he would back the police in any action they wish to take over Prof Neil Ferguson breaking social distancing rules by having a woman visit him at his home. Ferguson, an epidemiologist who has helped shape the government\u2019s response to coronavirus and who advocated the lockdown, made the right decision to resign. Matt Hancock told Sky News: \u201cI back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right, it\u2019s always been like that.\u201d Wuhan teenagers return to school for first time since outbreak hit the Chinese City Teenagers in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, have returned to school wearing masks and walking in single file past thermal scanners. In 121 schools, older pupils were back in classrooms \u2013 sitting at individual desks spaced a metre apart \u2013 for the first time on Wednesday since the city was forced into shutdown in January. Returning pupils had to navigate thermal scanners at school gates, with anyone displaying a high temperature barred from entry. Spain on course to extend state of emergency for another fortnight Spain looks set to extend its state of emergency for two more weeks as it eases Covid-19 lockdown measures, with the country\u2019s prime minister expected to secure enough parliamentary votes today to make the move. Pedro Sanchez\u2019s weak coalition government has the support of the regional Basque nationalist party PNV, as well as the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which said last night it would back an extension to the state of emergency set to expire on Saturday. In an increasingly fraught political government, it means the government will guarantee enough votes to approve the state of emergency decree. It comes after the government lost the support of opposition conservatives, the People\u2019s party (PP), for any further extensions. Covid-19 immunity only covers up to 5% of Czech Republic population, says study Immunity to Covid-19 is building only very slowly in the Czech Republic and probably does not cover more than 4-5% of the population, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The preliminary figures came from a mass testing for antibodies that started in April, the ministry added. The country, which has a population of 10.7 million, was one of the swiftest in Europe to impose curbs on travel and border crossings and shut most shops and restaurants in March.",

Still, the better-than-expected figures delivered on Wednesday gave rise to a more than 5% increase in ITV\u2019s share price in early trading.

The broadcaster reported an 8% year-on-year increase in advertising income in February, before the spread of coronavirus had a major impact on the UK economy. In March, advertising revenues flatlined year on year as businesses shut and lockdown measures were introduced. ITV, whose share price slumped to the lowest point in more than a decade, said the uncertainty in the market means it will not be providing further guidance on advertising income.

The broadcaster has also reached an agreement with its pension trustees and tax authorities to delay at least \u00a3150m of payments due by June, to the second half and into 2021. ITV, which earlier this week announced its flagship summer programme Love Island will be cancelled this year, said it was working on a \u201cphased approach to office re-entry\u201d and a \u201creturn to production protocol\u201d to restart programme production.

      "bodyText": "UK tourism industry leaders plan to introduce a physical distancing standards symbol for hotels and attractions to encourage the return of visitors once lockdown measures are eased. The move is part of a bid to encourage responsible travel in the country when it is safe to do so. Visit Britain, the UK\u2019s tourist authority, confirmed an industry mark, similar to the British Standards Institution\u2019s Kitemark, to flag up attractions, and potentially accommodation, that have implemented safe distancing measures. It said it would provide more details when they were available. Visit Britain\u2019s acting chief executive, Patricia Yates, said: \u201cWe think as an industry that\u2019s going to be a real shift in where we are in consumer behaviour now.\u201d Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said Visit Britain hoped to persuade ministers to think about encouraging tourism, after successfully persuading the population to stay at home in the coronavirus lockdown. She said the tourism industry would be \u201casking government to be just as clear when they start announcing the lifting of lockdown that it is socially responsible to go out and travel. And yes, you can drive and enjoy yourself\u201d. The tourism industry is worth an estimated \u00a3127bn to the UK economy annually and employs more than 3 million people. Much of that income and employment has been cut off by the lockdown, amid forecasts that some of Britain\u2019s most beautiful spots will be worse hit. The industry is worried the stay-at-home message has been so successful and overzealously interpreted, that it will require a new campaign to encourage people to venture out when it\u2019s safe to do so. However, for the moment it cannot be seen to be encouraging travel when the message from the government is to stay at home. Police and councils have reminded potential tourists not to travel ahead of the bank holiday weekend. David Simpson, the leader of Pembrokeshire county council, said: \u201cPembrokeshire is a beautiful place and when the time is right, we will welcome you. But that time is not now.\u201d The council and Dyfed Powys police have written to the owners of around 6,000 holiday homes, urging them to remain where they are. Key workers in north Devon have started a campaign to thank tourists for staying away from the area. Preston police reminded the public to stick to the physical distancing rules and only leave home to exercise or shop for essentials.",

He is definitely out of his comfort zone without his baying crowd behind him. Bikergaz \u2018That was wonderful\u2019 Oh that was wonderful. Starmer just feeding more and more rope to Johnson. And now Johnson having Blackford to contend with, marvellous. funkymentalist \u2018It\u2019s all bluster and deflection but Johnson is still bouncing\u2019 Starmer is asking the right questions and responding well but he can\u2019t nail Johnson, who seems totally unphased by anything Starmer raises. It is all bluster and deflection but Johnson is still bouncing. They need someone much harder.

So refreshing compared to the desperate May v Corbyn PMQs! zambooka \u2018Starmer should have attacked harder\u2019 Starmer was \u2018fine\u2019 at PMQs and Johnson was completely floundering, but Starmer should honestly have attacked harder. Corbyn was so often criticised of not pressing the advantage; Starmer is repeating the same error! gbrading \u2018PM is talking absolute rubbish \u2013 complete word salad\u2019 The PM at PMQ is talking absolute rubbish. Real rubbish. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. Complete word salad. It is terrible. Challenge blah blah ramp up blah plan blah blah billions blah blah. jenniwrenbird \u2018Really surprised how poor Johnson is when speaking live\u2019 I am really surprised how poor Johnson is when speaking live. It is hard for him to come up with two or three logical sentences. Starmer is wiping the floor with him. IdioticPanda \u2018Nice technique from Starmer\u2019 Starmer having to answer his own question in the absence of an answer. Nice technique, very nice \u2026 StuffnBalls \u2018Johnson struggling badly with Starmer\u2019s attention to detail\u2019 Johnson having to concede that Keir Starmer \u201cis quite right\u201d several times. Just like Raab, he is struggling badly with Starmer\u2019s attention to detail and use of government data to challenge him. rustledust74 \u2018Johnson doesn\u2019t sound as convincing in an empty room\u2019 Johnson doesn\u2019t sound as convincing in an empty room.

Not just because she\u2019s coping with lockdown by the beach near San Diego, with former England and Lions prop Alex Corbisiero \u2013 her fianc\u00e9 \u2013 and Kasey McCravey, from the US squad. Attempting to keep on training, she suffered the same fate as Tom Brady, the great NFL quarterback who had a run-in with authorities in Tampa. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d go to the park and just get kicked off. You want to you want to respect the boundaries of everything, but we couldn\u2019t even use the patch of grass outside the library by our house. They\u2019re like, \u2018No, parks are closed.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat is considered a park these days?\u201d There has therefore been \u201ca lot of street running\u201d, which is \u201ca little difficult on the body\u201d, but all things considered, things could be worse. The beaches are open \u2013 the Pacific Ocean a \u201cfree ice bath\u201d at this time of year \u2013 and Gustaitis is \u201cbecoming a pilates teacher\u201d because she \u201cfigured it was something to put my mind to. I\u2019m super-passionate about it but it takes a lot of time, and now I seem to have nothing but time.\u201d Such is the need for displacement activity, thousands of miles from family in Pylesville, Maryland, up by the Pennsylvania line. \u201cI\u2019m actually due to call my mother back,\u201d Gustaitis says, \u201cnow I think about it. But they\u2019re good. My parents are staying safe. My older brother lives 10 minutes from them, so they stay in contact with him. \u201cHe\u2019s a state trooper, so he\u2019s taking everything very seriously, and because he\u2019s out in contact with the public, he\u2019s not going over to my parents. And he has two kids, and so my parents miss the grandkids a lot, but they\u2019re hanging in there and everyone\u2019s safe for now. That\u2019s all you can ask.\u201d The family has always, it seems, asked a lot of itself. \u201cI kind of grew up in the fire department,\u201d Gustaitis says. \u201cI joined when I was 16, my brother was a member as well. My dad was the local fire chief. Eventually, I plan to enter back into it in some capacity, probably a less crazy version of riding around in an ambulance, waiting for a 911 call.\u201d Gustaitis is a full-time athlete now, but she was once an emergency medical technician. There\u2019s a story about how on her way to her high school prom she stopped to assist at a road accident, gown, hairdo and all. \u201cI became an EMT when I was 16,\u201d she says. \u201cI really grew to love it, and I think that it sparked the drive in me to want to help people. There was that sort of thrill you get, I guess, the pressure to perform. I loved that about being an EMT, and that\u2019s kind of what I love about sevens as well. You only have a certain amount of time and opportunities, and it\u2019s on you to take them.\u201d For now, the thrill of the chase on hold, the Eagles are holed up across America, holding team meetings on Zoom. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on a reflection point,\u201d she says, \u201clooking back on the last year and a half and where that\u2019s led us, to the highs and lows and how we\u2019re going to carry through to the Olympics.\u201d Elite athletes, it seems, really are in this with the rest of us. \u201cLuckily,\u201d Gustaitis says, \u201ceveryone is obsessed with social media, so you don\u2019t feel too far from them. As bizarre as it is.\u201d",

The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. The video footage, which was taken by an unidentified witness in another car, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around a white pickup truck stopped in the right lane, its driver\u2019s door open. As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face-down on to the asphalt. The graphic footage has prompted an outcry and demands for justice; the activist Shaun King posted the video on Twitter, describing it as \u201cone of the worst things I\u2019ve seen in my entire life\u201d. Tom Durden, the acting district attorney for a neighboring district, said in a letter posted on Facebook that he believed \u201cthe case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn county for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr Arbery\u201d. Durden, who was assigned to investigate the fatal shooting after prosecutors in Brunswick and a neighboring district recused themselves due to potential conflicts of interest, said he would present the case to the next available grand jury in Glynn county. That grand jury might not meet until mid-June or later because courts were under restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, he said. According to a police report obtained by the New York Times, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator, told investigators the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard \u201chauling ass\u201d down the street. McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he summoned his son and the two men gave chase in the truck, Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.

John Perry, a pastor and president of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) civil rights organization, said: \u201cIt\u2019s our hopes this is tried outside of this area so we don\u2019t get a jury that\u2019s partial in any kind of way.\u201d He described the killing as \u201cextremely disheartening\u201d as \u201ca man with a gun tried to take his life [even] as he fought for his life\u201d. A small protest took place in the neighborhood on Tuesday evening, curtailed in its scope by social restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic.

      "bodyText": "He was once fearful of endangering the country\u2019s deep economic relationship with China, but the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has now begun to campaign for an international inquiry into the Covid-19 outbreak. The call comes amid claims from the Trump administration that China covered up a laboratory leak in Wuhan, or even released the novel coronavirus on purpose. The tenor of debate in the United States gives an indication of the stakes. The Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson \u2013 a favourite of the president \u2013 has been drawing on reports in the Australian tabloid the Daily Telegraph of a supposed secret dossier linking the outbreak to the Wuhan lab. \u201cWe are squabbling about lockdowns \u2026 that is the debate in this country,\u201d said Carlson. \u201cThat is not the debate in China, why? Because they have bigger plans. By the time this pandemic has played out, China plans to rule the world.\u201d The dossier has been contradicted by intelligence sources, who believe it was based on freely available material and was most likely to have come from the US to help Washington \u201c[build] a counter-narrative and [apply] pressure to China\u201d. Meanwhile, the scientific community says there is no evidence for the claim that the virus originated in a Wuhan lab \u2013 even Morrison has poured cold water on that particular idea. And a US intelligence community statement on the origins of Covid-19 was agnostic. Whether they can resist pressure from the Trump administration to produce a politically convenient narrative, as reported in the New York Times, is an open question. But given that anti-Chinese sentiment so evidently plays into ramping election rhetoric in the US, a blame-shifting operation seems to be under way. Even so, there is a good case for an inquiry. From the shameful cover-up of the initial outbreak, such as the silencing of the heroic doctor Li Wenliang, to the subsequent censorship, the disappearance of critics and sowing of disinformation, there\u2019s still a lot to learn. China has seen a litany of food and agriculture scandals (amazingly, it is still not well understood why 16,000 pig carcasses floated down the Huangpu river in 2013); its citizens certainly deserve to know more about the role of intensified animal agriculture and environmental destruction in propelling new pathogens into human population centres.

And even if it went ahead, China would likely give an inquiry the same heed it gave a critical 2016 UN ruling on the South China Sea, calling it \u201cnothing more than a piece of waste paper\u201d. Instead of spurring learning or action, this type of aggressive diplomacy will only lead to the further emboldening of hardline nationalist and protectionist narratives in Beijing, along with the escalating sabre-rattling that keeps us as far as ever from the cooperation required to handle the pandemic and its aftermath. Chinese elites may indeed be fearful of international pressure, with one intelligence-linked thinktank warning of the global fallout from anti-Chinese opprobrium.

      "bodyText": "As the coronavirus pandemic eats its way into the Amazon, raising fears of a genocide of its vulnerable indigenous tribes, the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and its supporters are dismantling rules shielding protected reserves. Key environment officials have been sacked, and environmentalists and indigenous leaders fear the pandemic is being used as a smokescreen for a new assault on the rainforest. They say a presidential decree awaiting congressional approval and new rules at the indigenous agency Funai effectively legalise land grabbing in protected forests and indigenous reserves. \u201cThe indigenous peoples are alone and we have to fight against the virus, the loggers and the wildcat miners. We don\u2019t know which is worse,\u201d said Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous leader from Par\u00e1 state. Bolsonaro, notorious for racist remarks about indigenous people and a nationalist argument in favour of developing the Amazon, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers. He said the Yanomami indigenous reserve \u2013 Brazil\u2019s largest \u2013 was too big and attacked environment agencies for fining people for environmental crimes. In December 2019 he issued a decree known as MP910, allowing farmers squatting up to 2,500 hectares within government-controlled reserves to legalise it. A previous law in 2017 allowed this for land squatted until 2011; Bolsonaro\u2019s decree extended it until 2018. Critics called it the \u201cland grabbers decree\u201d. Grabbing land on federal reserves by deforesting it, burning the dead trees and putting cattle on it to consolidate possession is common practice in the Amazon. \u201cThe measure permits titling public areas which were illegally deforested with the objective of obtaining the land,\u201d said Imazon, a non-profit environmentalist group. Federal prosecutors said it would further facilitate land grabbing, in a detailed analysis. The decree has until 19 May to be approved by Congress. Lawmakers from the agricultural lobby are pushing for a vote before then, in the midst of the pandemic, after proposing changes that will effectively make it even easier and cheaper to legalise squatted land \u2013 even if the landowner seeking title has already received a land title under \u201cagrarian reform\u201d schemes and sold it on. On 22 April, Funai published a new rule to allow land grabbers on indigenous reserves to regularise their land, provided the reserve has not completed the lengthy demarcation process. That process can take decades to complete and requires presidential approval \u2013 and Bolsonaro has vowed not to demarcate \u201cone centimetre\u201d more of indigenous land. The Funai employees\u2019 association said the new rule \u201cturns Funai into a real-estate notary for squatters, land grabbers and land developers in indigenous lands\u201d. The National Council of Human Rights, an independent federal body, called for the rule be revoked, noting that 237 indigenous reserves had yet to complete the demarcation process and another six were \u201crestricted use\u201d areas with reports of isolated groups who have no immunity to common diseases such as the flu, never mind Covid-19. Landgrabbers could now claim title in all of these. In a rare move, 49 federal prosecutors across Brazil called for the Funai rule to be annulled for its \u201cunconstitutionality, unconventionality and illegality\u201d.

Ibama\u2019s director of protection, Olivaldi Azevedo, had already been sacked. Environmentalists said reducing protection and encouraging invasions of protected areas risked more violence against those who defend them. In March an indigenous teacher, Zezico Guajajara, was murdered in Maranh\u00e3o state, the fifth killing in the area in six months. In April, Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, a teacher from the Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau reserve in the Amazon state of Rond\u00f4nia, was murdered.

We only have gloves and they are running out.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought this company was alright until I whistleblew. They said I was letting the team down moaning about this; they told all the other staff I was complaining about them. That\u2019s not true.

That\u2019s not medical care. The people who are sick are really suffering. They can\u2019t take a drink, they need to be on a drip, they are so thirsty, and they need help to breathe. This is like a war zone in here. They need to be in hospital. I keep reporting this but am told leave it alone. Yes, people have died from lack of medical care. I feel so useless they won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d</p> \n<p>Chubb adds in the report: \u201cI have worked with whistleblowers for two decades, supporting over 8,000 people to date. I know the fate of people who have courage and integrity. The past few weeks are the hardest I have ever experienced running a helpline, many of the most traumatic details of suffering and inhumanity have been omitted from this report mainly because the details would identify individual whistleblowers.\u201d</p>",

They do not listen to us staff.\u201d Another whistleblower said: \u201cThe first few days I think we were all running on adrenaline. Then people got sick. I do not know what I expected but not this. These people need nursing, they need to be in hospital. We are looking after people with no PPE. We only have gloves and they are running out. \u201cI thought this company was alright until I whistleblew. They said I was letting the team down moaning about this; they told all the other staff I was complaining about them. That\u2019s not true. I reported proper concerns that people should be sent to hospital and staff were at risk with no PPE. I felt I had no choice but to leave, it was so horrible.\u201d A third said: \u201cThere are no nurses here, we have no PPE, and the only advice is from a GP on a video link. That\u2019s not medical care. The people who are sick are really suffering. They can\u2019t take a drink, they need to be on a drip, they are so thirsty, and they need help to breathe. This is like a war zone in here. They need to be in hospital. I keep reporting this but am told leave it alone. Yes, people have died from lack of medical care. I feel so useless they won\u2019t listen to me.\u201d Chubb adds in the report: \u201cI have worked with whistleblowers for two decades, supporting over 8,000 people to date. I know the fate of people who have courage and integrity. The past few weeks are the hardest I have ever experienced running a helpline, many of the most traumatic details of suffering and inhumanity have been omitted from this report mainly because the details would identify individual whistleblowers.\u201d",

It is thought to be unlikely a simultaneous online release for such a title would be pursued, as the profit margins for such a release \u2013 as well as its substantial sponsorship campaigns \u2013 would require the maximum possible theatrical footfall.</p> <p>Some sources suggest that Universal may consider a fresh postponement of the release to next year, further suggesting the studio remains committed to cinema releasing.</p> <p>That film\u2019s current release date in the US falls over the Thanksgiving weekend, a traditionally lucrative spot in the calendar, which other studios will be eyeing should No Time to Die move. Earlier this week, Paramount Pictures announced a Christmas release for Top Gun: Maverick, which sees a belated return for Tom Cruise\u2019s flying ace.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bd997a7dbe64d086c77b1dd8ca5bb4328ca7922/26_0_817_490/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maximum footfall needed \u2026 No Time to Die</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The studio also announced an early September spot for A Quiet Place 2, which was pulled from the schedules just before its mid-March debut. This echoes the eagerness of exhibitors for an early end to cinema closures, while also allowing for the option of a digitally led campaign.</p> <p>The film, which stars Emily Blunt as the head of a family self-isolating to try and protect themselves against a global threat, would likely follow in the footsteps of Bird Box, Netflix\u2019s similarly themed hit starring Sandra Bullock, which was seen by 45m accounts in its first seven days of release in late 2018.</p> <p>A Quiet Place 2 \u2013 which relies on long periods of near silence punctuated by abrupt and loud moments of shock \u2013 is also a film ideally suited to the drive-in, which has seen a dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/may/05/social-distance-cinema-drive-in-theatres-boom-coronavirus-in-pictures\">upturn in popularity</a> since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>While studios have been relatively swift to announce plans for tentpole titles, release strategies for smaller-scale dramas \u2013 thrown off course by both the closure of cinemas and uncertainty over the future of the film festivals where many of them would have begun their journey \u2013 mostly remain murky.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/14/cannes-film-festival-says-2020-edition-cannot-go-ahead-in-original-form\">Cannes </a>and Venice film festivals have still to officially declare whether this year\u2019s editions will be cancelled; that news will likely determine the fates of films vying for next year\u2019s awards.</p> <p>Yet the announcement last week by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that the 2021 Oscars would, for one year only, extend its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/28/academy-awards-oscars-streaming-films-coronavirus\">eligibility criteria</a> to films that had not debuted in cinemas is likely to serve as a considerable reassurance to companies sitting on prestige cinema.</p> <p>It may also be an incentive: if some studios still choose to hold titles back in the hope of maximum theatrical profit, smaller outfits could reap the benefits both in terms of digital revenue and awards acclaim.</p>",

I don\u2019t know anyone in America who is pushing harder to get the theatres reopened and to get his movie released than Chris Nolan.\u201d If the studio succeeds in turning a profit from the strategy, it will need public confidence to be high enough for them to venture out, and competitors to remain sufficiently nervous that Tenet is the sole major title playing in most cinemas \u2013 which will be operating at far short of full capacity \u2013 for many weeks. At the present time, only Disney have another major title on the books for July: the long-delayed live-action remake of Mulan, scheduled for release a week after Tenet. Last week, plans were unveiled for cinemas in the Czech Republic and Norway to reopen later in May. Cinemas in China remain closed after a small-scale reopening in mid-March was abruptly halted by the government on 27 March, amid fears of a second wave of infections.

Universal is also the UK distributor of new James Bond film No Time to Die, which was the first big release pushed back, from April to November. It is thought to be unlikely a simultaneous online release for such a title would be pursued, as the profit margins for such a release \u2013 as well as its substantial sponsorship campaigns \u2013 would require the maximum possible theatrical footfall. Some sources suggest that Universal may consider a fresh postponement of the release to next year, further suggesting the studio remains committed to cinema releasing. That film\u2019s current release date in the US falls over the Thanksgiving weekend, a traditionally lucrative spot in the calendar, which other studios will be eyeing should No Time to Die move. Earlier this week, Paramount Pictures announced a Christmas release for Top Gun: Maverick, which sees a belated return for Tom Cruise\u2019s flying ace. The studio also announced an early September spot for A Quiet Place 2, which was pulled from the schedules just before its mid-March debut. This echoes the eagerness of exhibitors for an early end to cinema closures, while also allowing for the option of a digitally led campaign. The film, which stars Emily Blunt as the head of a family self-isolating to try and protect themselves against a global threat, would likely follow in the footsteps of Bird Box, Netflix\u2019s similarly themed hit starring Sandra Bullock, which was seen by 45m accounts in its first seven days of release in late 2018. A Quiet Place 2 \u2013 which relies on long periods of near silence punctuated by abrupt and loud moments of shock \u2013 is also a film ideally suited to the drive-in, which has seen a dramatic upturn in popularity since the start of the pandemic. While studios have been relatively swift to announce plans for tentpole titles, release strategies for smaller-scale dramas \u2013 thrown off course by both the closure of cinemas and uncertainty over the future of the film festivals where many of them would have begun their journey \u2013 mostly remain murky. The Cannes and Venice film festivals have still to officially declare whether this year\u2019s editions will be cancelled; that news will likely determine the fates of films vying for next year\u2019s awards. Yet the announcement last week by the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences that the 2021 Oscars would, for one year only, extend its eligibility criteria to films that had not debuted in cinemas is likely to serve as a considerable reassurance to companies sitting on prestige cinema. It may also be an incentive: if some studios still choose to hold titles back in the hope of maximum theatrical profit, smaller outfits could reap the benefits both in terms of digital revenue and awards acclaim.",

In his first prime minister\u2019s questions since recovering from coronavirus, Johnson said he would give a statement on Sunday on plans for an \u201cunlockdown\u201d, with a view to making changes on Monday. Possible areas for change could be allowing more outdoor activities and making clear ways in which businesses could get employees back to work with looser physical distancing. A review of the lockdown will be carried out on Thursday, but the prime minister said the data which would contribute to the easing of physical distancing measures was still coming in, which was why he had decided to release information to the public over the weekend. He said people needed to know the day before what would change on Monday 11 May. Johnson said there would be the opportunity for the Commons to debate and interrogate him or the government at a later date \u2013 in a hint that he may try to dodge appearing before parliament to answer questions himself next week.

      "body": "<p>In the morning in Olievenhoutbosch, the children wake early and run in the small dirt yard. There is hot tea and hope. In the afternoon, everyone is hungry and listless, and the hours drag. Tempers fray. By nightfall, with little for dinner except vegetables and maize meal, spirits flag.</p> <p>\u201cThe evenings are hard,\u201d said Maria Rabutla, who lives with her two daughters and three grandchildren in a small two-bedroom house in Olievenhoutbosch. \u201cThe children are saying they want more to eat. We just tell them that we all must trust in God and that God will answer us and that this will pass too.\u201d</p> <p>Last week there was excitement in the township, where 70,000 people live in tightly packed rows of small houses and shacks surrounded by the malls, business parks and gated communities that sprawl around Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s biggest city.</p> <p>First, the strict lockdown imposed across South Africa in late March to stem the spread of Covid-19 was eased to allow people out of their homes between 6am and 9am for exercise, and for a few to go back to work.</p> <p>Then, <a href=\"https://m.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/lockdown-foundation-feeds-thousands-as-olievenhoutbosch-residents-line-up-for-food-parcels-20200502\">a local charitable organisation set up a hand-out of food parcels</a>. Thousands formed queues to receive a package of flour, rice, baked beans and tinned fish.</p> <p>\u201cWe got a parcel but with this corruption and inefficient people we have not got anything from the government. We have not seen an official here since the disease came,\u201d Rabutla, 57, said.</p> <p>South Africa\u2019s rapid response and proactive campaign to contain the disease has been widely praised, and has so far limited the outbreak to 7,572 confirmed cases, with 148 deaths.</p> <p>But the cost of the lockdown has been steep in a country where <a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=12075\">half the population of 56 million </a><a href=\"http://www.statssa.gov.za/?p=12075\">live in poverty.</a></p> <p>In Olievenhoutbosch, as in other townships across South Africa, the restrictions have prevented thousands from earning a precarious living. All those who made enough for dinner for their families through selling home-made food at a stall, ironing in middle-class homes nearby, labouring, or \u2013 in the case of Rabutla \u2013 working as a seamstress, have been deprived of an income.</p> <p>\u201cWe had no chance to prepare, to get food, to get ready, to save some money.

      "bodyText": "In the morning in Olievenhoutbosch, the children wake early and run in the small dirt yard. There is hot tea and hope. In the afternoon, everyone is hungry and listless, and the hours drag. Tempers fray. By nightfall, with little for dinner except vegetables and maize meal, spirits flag. \u201cThe evenings are hard,\u201d said Maria Rabutla, who lives with her two daughters and three grandchildren in a small two-bedroom house in Olievenhoutbosch. \u201cThe children are saying they want more to eat. We just tell them that we all must trust in God and that God will answer us and that this will pass too.\u201d Last week there was excitement in the township, where 70,000 people live in tightly packed rows of small houses and shacks surrounded by the malls, business parks and gated communities that sprawl around Johannesburg, South Africa\u2019s biggest city. First, the strict lockdown imposed across South Africa in late March to stem the spread of Covid-19 was eased to allow people out of their homes between 6am and 9am for exercise, and for a few to go back to work. Then, a local charitable organisation set up a hand-out of food parcels. Thousands formed queues to receive a package of flour, rice, baked beans and tinned fish. \u201cWe got a parcel but with this corruption and inefficient people we have not got anything from the government. We have not seen an official here since the disease came,\u201d Rabutla, 57, said. South Africa\u2019s rapid response and proactive campaign to contain the disease has been widely praised, and has so far limited the outbreak to 7,572 confirmed cases, with 148 deaths. But the cost of the lockdown has been steep in a country where half the population of 56 million live in poverty. In Olievenhoutbosch, as in other townships across South Africa, the restrictions have prevented thousands from earning a precarious living. All those who made enough for dinner for their families through selling home-made food at a stall, ironing in middle-class homes nearby, labouring, or \u2013 in the case of Rabutla \u2013 working as a seamstress, have been deprived of an income. \u201cWe had no chance to prepare, to get food, to get ready, to save some money. It is like I have been bound in chains \u2026 I understand it is [the same] for the whole world but we don\u2019t know how or when we will solve [this disease],\u201d Rabutla said. Though the government has promised support, there are problems reaching those who need it most. Sporadic rioting has broken out in some poor communities around Johannesburg and near Cape Town. In Kliptown, one of the poorest parts of Soweto, to the south-west of Johannesburg, there is desperation. Some cannot afford to pay the 500 rand (\u00a322) monthly rent - for a shack. \u201cIt is very hard, very hectic,\u201d said Ntokozo Dube, a 29-year-old youth leader who earned an uncertain living from guiding tourists around Soweto\u2019s landmarks until domestic and international flights were stopped seven weeks ago. \u201cI am the only breadwinner for my wife, my own small child, my sister and her three children as well as my dad. This disease has affected the whole world and everyone is crying,\u201d Dube said. South African health authorities have been scrambling to build up the capacity of the public health system after years of under-investment. \u201cMy dad is 73 and I don\u2019t think he will get good treatment if he gets the virus. I\u2019m very anxious, and the whole family depends on me so if I\u2019m sick and pass away, they will have nothing,\u201d said Dube. Ministers have said they hope to start reopening schools within four to six weeks. Few students have access to computers or internet facilities which would allow them to study at home. Many miss school lunches, which often provided the most nutritious meal of the day. If incidents of some serious crimes have fallen dramatically during the lockdown, in part due to a strict ban on the sale of alcohol, others appear to have soared. Tina Thiart, a trustee of 1,000 Women One Voice, an NGO that works through grassroots initiatives to tackle violence against women and children, said women were locked up with abusers and reports to the NGO of gender-based violence had \u201creally spiked\u201d. South Africa\u2019s vibrant media sector is adapting fast to the new environment. A new soap opera - Lockdown Heights \u2013 is already in production. It will narrate the lives of residents of a Johannesburg apartment complex whose lives are intertwined through scandalous affairs, murder, dangerous secrets \u2026 and \u201cthe struggle to adhere to government restrictions\u201d.

Last week, British Airways announced 12,000 staff would be made redundant, and on Tuesday Virgin Atlantic said it would cut 3,000 jobs and mothball its Gatwick operations. The collapse in Airbnb\u2019s revenue has thwarted its plans to float on the stock market this year. The projected $40bn-plus flotation would also have earned many of its staff large payouts, as early entrants into the company were partly remunerated in stock options. This year, Airbnb shored up its finances with $2bn in new loans and funding, which according to reports suggested a valuation of about $18bn, much below earlier expectations. Airbnb started life as AirBed &amp; Breakfast in 2008 after Chesky and another co-founder, Joe Gebbia, let out their apartment in San Francisco. The platform has about 150 million users and 7m property listings across the world. In a blogpost detailing the job cuts, Chesky told staff: \u201cI have a deep feeling of love for all of you.\u201d Within hours, those being made redundant received an email invitation for a departure meeting, with US and Canadian tstaff told they would leave by next Monday. But for some campaigners fighting soaring rents in cities with large number of Airbnb hosts, the company\u2019s crisis has a silver living. For example, the number of longer-term rental properties in central Dublin coming on to the market has increased by 71%, as landlords abandoned short-term lets through Airbnb.",

There is no doubt that Ferguson, who sat on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) before his resignation, was wrong to ignore the government\u2019s social distancing rules. He has admitted as much, even if he did believe that he was at low risk of spreading the Sars-Cov-2 virus because he had already recovered from Covid-19. But today\u2019s lurid front-page headlines follow a campaign to discredit him by those ideologically opposed to government interventions, and who have used such tactics against scientists in other fields, particularly climate change. It is a further sign that some media commentators and politicians favour a version of Britain in which politicians and newspaper editors dictate the public\u2019s understanding of biology and physics. Ferguson has been under attack ever since his research team\u2019s modelling suggested in mid-March that hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK from Covid-19 were possible if stronger efforts were not made to curb the growing epidemic. Within a week, the prime minister announced the current lockdown measures. The move was perceived as a U-turn because the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser had days earlier suggested that allowing widespread infection might be an option to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d across the country. Ferguson\u2019s contribution was initially praised, but it was not long before his reputation was under assault from parts of the media traditionally sceptical of a so-called \u201cnanny state\u201d. On 28 March, the Daily Telegraph published an article alleging that \u201cthe scientist whose calculations about the potentially devastating impact of the coronavirus directly led to the countrywide lockdown has been criticised in the past for flawed research\u201d. The story relied on the views of a handful of critics of how Ferguson\u2019s models were used by the then Labour government to tackle the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

Bizarrely, this article was written by Benny Peiser and Andrew Montford, the director and deputy director of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, which was set up by Nigel Lawson in 2009 to lobby against climate change policies.

      "bodyText": "A burglary at a Derbyshire hospital in which laptops were stolen and televisions pulled off walls has been described as \u201cutterly deplorable\u201d by police. The break-in took place at Royal Derby hospital between 8.30pm on Monday and 7.30am on Tuesday in the hand outpatients\u2019 area. The hospital\u2019s paediatric treatment area, the main therapy treatment area and a number of treatment cubicles were forced to close on Tuesday. Derbyshire police have launched an investigation into the incident. University hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS trust said four laptops were stolen, while televisions were broken after being pulled off the walls by the thieves. A spokesperson said a water bath in the therapy area was also emptied, causing water damage to the ward. Gavin Boyle, the trust\u2019s chief executive, said the incident was \u201cvery upsetting and disheartening\u201d for colleagues who were working in the hospital amid the coronavirus crisis. \u201cWe take a zero-tolerance approach to theft and treat all such offences with the upmost severity,\u201d he said, adding that the trust was working closely with the police to support their investigation. Insp Keith Chambers, of Derbyshire police, said: \u201cThe targeted burglary of a hospital is sickening at any time \u2013 but with the current pressures the NHS faces is utterly deplorable. \u201cThe service the Kings treatment centre provides is absolutely critical to our community and I have no doubt there are people out there with information about those responsible for this act.\u201d The hospital trust is at the forefront of tackling the Covid-19 outbreak in Derbyshire, where so far 401 people have died after contracting the virus. Two staff members have died after becoming infected with coronavirus while working on the frontline at Royal Derby hospital, including Manjeet Singh Riyat, 52, who was the UK\u2019s first Sikh A&amp;E consultant. The Pulvertaft hand centre, where the break-in took place, is a world-renowned specialist in hand surgery.",

      "body": "<p>In the topsy-turvy world of lockdown, the message from the UK\u2019s holiday hotspots this bank holiday weekend is the same as it was at Easter four weeks ago: stay away.</p> <p>However, behind the scenes tourism officials and hospitality bosses are busy working out how destinations will start to welcome back visitors this summer. Without knowing exactly what changes will be announced when Boris Johnson produces his roadmap on Sunday, tourist boards across the UK are setting out plans for a phased reopening of attractions and businesses as they endeavour to salvage some of the 2020 season. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to wait until lockdown\u2019s over and find we\u2019ve not got the plans in place,\u201d said Gill Haigh, chief executive of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cThe question is how we reset.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a big question. Discussions around what to open and when are taking place against a backdrop of huge public anxiety about coming out of lockdown. An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fearful-britons-oppose-lifting-lockdown-schools-pubs-restaurants-opinium-poll\">Observer poll</a> at the weekend found that the majority of people believe it\u2019s too soon to ease restrictions, and local people are understandably furious<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\"> </a>with those do flout the current rules, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/lake-district-coronavirus-lockdown-north-east-second-wave-risk\">as happened this week in the Lake District</a>.</p> <p>The challenge for destinations is giving tourism the shot in the arm that it desperately needs while reassuring visitors, employees and residents that they will be safe. As a result of that delicate balancing act, holidaying in the UK this summer may well feel like we\u2019ve time-travelled back to the 1950s, before the advent of affordable foreign travel: there will be day trips to beaches, parks and gardens; we\u2019ll be able to buy an ice-cream but won\u2019t be dining in a crowded restaurant; if it rains we won\u2019t be sheltering in the nearest museum or indoor activity centre.</p> <p>Outdoor spaces in rural and coastal areas and attractions with large grounds will be the first to welcome visitors, not just because those are places where social distancing can be maintained but because, post-lockdown, people will be drawn to nature for its calming effects. \u201cConsumer research shows that people want to get back to simple pleasures,\u201d said Kate Mavor, chief executive of English Heritage, which manages 400 historic sites in England. \u201cPeople can come with a picnic and just enjoy being close to nature. There\u2019s also great comfort in being in places that have stood the sense of time \u2013 that have survived war and pestilence. We will be a tonic for people when they come.\u201d</p> <p>But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff.</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,\u201d said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.\u201d</p> <p>This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. \u201cIf local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you\u2019re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,\u201d said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b70518f33382e6eac36cad75970d811672c97d/0_8_4272_2564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A cosy wooden cottage by a stream in Snowdonia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Self-catering cottages like this one in Snowdonia, may be able to open before hotels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: pr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: \u201cWe had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/scottish-government-furious-at-travellers-to-highlands-and-islands\">trying to get to islands to self-isolate</a>. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,\u201d said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cIf tourism isn\u2019t allowed to return \u2013 and if the value of that tourism isn\u2019t created, a lot of businesses won\u2019t be here this time next year.\u201d</p> <p>Of course the economic impact hasn\u2019t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on individuals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company <a href=\"https://www.underthethatch.co.uk/\">Under the Thatch</a>, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August \u2013 but mainly for more expensive properties. \u201cIt\u2019s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.\u201d</p> <p>Stevenson, who lives in Ireland, believes Johnson\u2019s roadmap announcement will boost public confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Ireland, where there\u2019s a massive difference in public feeling [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/ireland-extends-covid-19-lockdown-to-18-may-before-phased-exit\">since a five-stage exit from lockdown was announced on 2 May</a>]. I think people in the UK will be much less panicky about the situation after Sunday.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People come for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of people in the bar. If that doesn\u2019t exist it will be strange</p> <footer> <cite>Robin Hutson, hotelier</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there\u2019s an appetite for holidays this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>The owner of campground <a href=\"https://thequietsite.co.uk/\">The Quiet Site</a> in Ullswater agrees that an appetite for travel will return relatively swiftly. \u201cIn Denmark, which was the first European country to ease lockdown, demand is at 90% compared with last year. There won\u2019t be a rush to travel but it will come back,\u201d said Daniel Holder. He is anticipating welcoming campers and caravanners back to his site this summer although the onsite bar, shop and check-in will come later. But part-opening will take its toll. \u201cIt will be hard to reach a break-even point this season.\u201d</p> <p> Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/aug/20/the-pig-at-combe-honiton-devon-hotel-review\">Pig hotels</a> and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: \u201cThe worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed \u2026 This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.\u201d</p> <p>The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme.</a></p> <p>Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hours talking about what we\u2019re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.\u201d</p> <p>Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/uk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines</a> comes into place, but Hutson fears they\u2019ll also make the atmosphere strained: \u201cPeople come to us for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That\u2019s part of what we sell and if it doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be \u2018released\u2019. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.\u201d </p> <p>Despite Hutson\u2019s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. \u201cIn Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,\u201d said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. \u201cThis summer we might look more continental.\u201d</p> <p>In the meantime, as the nation prepares to spend another bank holiday at home, destinations are sticking to the same message: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ndevoncouncil?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1257959404256866305&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2020%2Fmay%2F06%2Fuk-tourism-sector-to-flag-attractions-with-physical-distancing-measures\">stay away this VE day and come back later. </a><br></p>",

We will be a tonic for people when they come.\u201d But even simple pleasures will be different post-lockdown. Pre-booking visits to heritage sites will become the new norm. One-way systems, extra signage, hand sanitiser stations and staff in PPE will be familiar sights as attractions strive to minimise risk to visitors and staff. \u201cThe challenge even with open spaces will be around security and making sure people are being sensible,\u201d said Deirdre Wells, chief executive of Visit Kent and Hertfordshire. \u201cWhat people were used to beforehand will not happen now: just turning up at a National Trust place may not be possible.\u201d This first phase of openings will be closely watched by tourist boards aware that recovery is dependent on the confidence of local communities. \u201cIf local people see that these attractions are acting responsibly, you\u2019re warming them up to the idea of more visitors coming back by late summer and autumn,\u201d said Jo Dilley of Marketing Peak District. Riddell Graham of Visit Scotland added: \u201cWe had a not particularly helpful situation early on when people were trying to get to islands to self-isolate. So no matter what we do, we have to take on board the community interest, particularly for more remote rural areas.\u201d At the same time as reassuring communities that their safety is a priority, tourism officials will be pushing the value of visitors to the local economy. The impact of coronavirus on the 241,000 tourism businesses in the UK has been catastrophic. \u201cYou can\u2019t underestimate how important the visitor economy is for an area like ours,\u201d said Haigh of Cumbria Tourism. \u201cIf tourism isn\u2019t allowed to return \u2013 and if the value of that tourism isn\u2019t created, a lot of businesses won\u2019t be here this time next year.\u201d Of course the economic impact hasn\u2019t just been on businesses. Financial pressures on individuals will affect the recovery. Greg Stevenson, founder of cottage company Under the Thatch, said the company is receiving daily bookings for July and August \u2013 but mainly for more expensive properties. \u201cIt\u2019s wealthier people who are booking five-star cottages.\u201d Stevenson, who lives in Ireland, believes Johnson\u2019s roadmap announcement will boost public confidence. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in Ireland, where there\u2019s a massive difference in public feeling [since a five-stage exit from lockdown was announced on 2 May]. I think people in the UK will be much less panicky about the situation after Sunday.\u201d He believes self-catering properties will be in the second tranche of openings. New procedures will be put in place, such as sterilising hard surfaces and providing antiseptic sprays, but he is sure there\u2019s an appetite for holidays this summer. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt at all that there is demand for people to get away tomorrow.\u201d The owner of campground The Quiet Site in Ullswater agrees that an appetite for travel will return relatively swiftly. \u201cIn Denmark, which was the first European country to ease lockdown, demand is at 90% compared with last year. There won\u2019t be a rush to travel but it will come back,\u201d said Daniel Holder. He is anticipating welcoming campers and caravanners back to his site this summer although the onsite bar, shop and check-in will come later. But part-opening will take its toll. \u201cIt will be hard to reach a break-even point this season.\u201d Hotels, restaurants and bars also fear that opening halfway through the season with reduced capacity due to social distancing will be fatal to certain businesses unless the government extends its financial support. In an open letter to Johnson this week, Robin Hutson, chief executive of Homegrown Hotels, which operates six Pig hotels and the Lime Wood Hotel in the New Forest, wrote: \u201cThe worst possible scenario for rural hospitality would be the \u2018perfect storm\u2019 of furlough ceasing, hospitality opening up, but social distancing rules imposed \u2026 This toxic recipe would immediately translate to mass redundancies and the permanent loss of hundreds of thousands of rural jobs. This would be economically and socially devastating for rural Britain.\u201d The letter, supported by many of the biggest names in the food and hotel trades, including Rick Stein, Mitch Tonks, Michael Caines and Gordon Campbell-Gray, called for a flexible, part-time furlough scheme until the end of the first quarter of 2021 and an extension of the business rates holiday until the second quarter. He is optimistic that hospitality will be considered when the Treasury announces details of the scaled-back scheme. Like hoteliers across the country, Hutson and his team are drawing up plans for post-lockdown operating. Measures being discussed include meeting guests at their car instead of at reception, express checkouts, two-hour slots for room cleaning, and even decorative screening between tables. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent hours talking about what we\u2019re going to do but without knowing the ground rules,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s terribly difficult to formulate a plan.\u201d Such measures will reassure potential visitors, especially when a nationwide kite mark showing that businesses are complying with new guidelines comes into place, but Hutson fears they\u2019ll also make the atmosphere strained: \u201cPeople come to us for the social aspect \u2013 to hear the buzz of other people in the bar. That\u2019s part of what we sell and if it doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s going to be strange. The little bit of hope for our industry is that we will probably be among the last to be \u2018released\u2019. By then the population may have gained some confidence in moving around - that could help the mindset.\u201d Despite Hutson\u2019s fears for rural Britain, recovery will start sooner than in cities. Galleries, museums and other indoor attractions will be in the final tranche of openings in late summer or early autumn, although tourism officials hope to see some life return to cities if planning restrictions are relaxed to allow restaurants and bars to expand on to the streets. \u201cIn Sweden they have closed down streets and made them into dining and drinking areas in the evenings to increase floor space and bring food outside,\u201d said Kurt Janson, director of Tourism Alliance, a consortium of 55 trade bodies in tourism and hospitality. \u201cThis summer we might look more continental.\u201d In the meantime, as the nation prepares to spend another bank holiday at home, destinations are sticking to the same message: stay away this VE day and come back later.",

That production received a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/06/ss-mendi-dancing-the-death-drill-review\">five-star review</a> from the Guardian.</p> <p>Palfrey stated: \u201cWe will do our best to sell the business and its assets, albeit in testing commercial conditions which have no parallel in modern British history \u2026 NST is a well-respected theatre company, with a range of assets, that could survive and thrive. A buyer would need to be patient because no one yet knows when theatres will reopen, or how social distancing measures would impact upon seating and stage and therefore revenues. However, for the right person or company, this presents a rare opportunity to acquire one of the leading and long-established theatre brands in southern England.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/05/london-west-end-theatres-extend-coronavirus-shutdown\">West End theatres extend shutdown caused by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2015, NST was named \u201cregional theatre of the year\u201d by the Stage newspaper.

NST has become a major cultural force in the region and beyond, particularly with dramas based on local stories such as Howard Brenton\u2019s The Shadow Factory, about the production of Spitfires, and SS Mendi, about the sinking of a South African ship in Southampton waters. That production received a five-star review from the Guardian. Palfrey stated: \u201cWe will do our best to sell the business and its assets, albeit in testing commercial conditions which have no parallel in modern British history \u2026 NST is a well-respected theatre company, with a range of assets, that could survive and thrive. A buyer would need to be patient because no one yet knows when theatres will reopen, or how social distancing measures would impact upon seating and stage and therefore revenues. However, for the right person or company, this presents a rare opportunity to acquire one of the leading and long-established theatre brands in southern England.\u201d In 2015, NST was named \u201cregional theatre of the year\u201d by the Stage newspaper. Its recent commissions include a play about a local pub, The Hobbit, and its legal battle with a Hollywood film company over copyright infringement. The theatre plays an important role in Southampton\u2019s bid to become UK city of culture in 2025. Its campus site, which has a 500-seat auditorium, cafe and bar, temporarily closed earlier this year as part of an extensive university refurbishment programme. NST is led by Samuel Hodges. It is one of Arts Council England\u2019s national portfolio organisations and a registered charity, receiving additional core funding from the University of Southampton and Southampton city council. The playwright James Graham was among those to react to the news on Twitter: \u201cSo sad and senseless. A theatre loved locally, well attended, but ticket refunds due to the necessary shutdown means it has no cash and no sign of a cash injection from government. There\u2019ll be many more soon without theatres receiving extra public support as seen in other sectors.\u201d",

But that has quickly revealed itself to be a fallacy \u2026 There are now many signs that the government in London massively underestimated the pandemic.\u201d In a piece this week drawing on the British prime minister\u2019s frequent deployment of classical allusions, the London correspondent of Spain\u2019s left-leaning El Pa\u00eds queried suggestions that the prime minister was some latter-day Odysseus. \u201cThe conservative press tries to present Johnson as a man of reborn wisdom\u201d, whose experience of Covid-19 had led him to \u201clash himself to the mast to resist the siren calls\u201d of those demanding the lockdown be lifted soon, wrote Rafa de Miguel. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s far from clear whether such determination is the fruit of careful calculation \u2013 or the result of simply closing one\u2019s eyes when there\u2019s no other option.\u201d Officials in Greece, which has been widely praised for its handling of the pandemic, have watched London\u2019s handling of the crisis with disbelief, with epidemiologists also criticising the UK government\u2019s initial embrace of a \u201cherd immunity\u201d policy. The progressive daily Ethnos described Johnson as \u201cmore dangerous than coronavirus\u201d, saying one of the crisis\u2019s greatest tragedies was that \u201cincompetent leaders\u201d such as Johnson and Donald Trump were \u201cat the helm at a time of such emergency\u201d. Before changing tack, Johnson \u201chad gone out and essentially asked Britons \u2026 to accept death\u201d, wrote the columnist Giorgos Skafidas. Irish commentators also expressed dismay at the UK\u2019s record. \u201cMinisters of slim talent have bumbled through daily briefings and now big business-Conservative donors are impatient to reverse a shutdown so contrary to Brexiteer dreams,\u201d Fionnuala O\u2019Connor wrote in the broadly nationalist Irish News. \u201cBoris Johnson needs all his showman\u2019s tricks now to sell the phasing out of a lockdown which was less than effective, at least in part, because of his stubborn libertarianism.\u201d Outside Europe, criticism has been strongest in Australia and New Zealand, both of which imposed strict, early lockdowns and have contained their outbreaks. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, said no country that had pursued herd immunity had achieved it, describing the strategy as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d. David Hunter, an Australian-educated professor of epidemiology and medicine at Oxford University, told the conservative Sydney Morning Herald the British response was \u201cnot a model to follow. It has one of the worst epidemics in Europe and the world \u2026 Some aspects of the response have almost certainly contributed to the high mortality\u201d. Hunter particularly criticised the British decision \u2013 in contrast to Australia and New Zealand \u2013 not to close its borders early. Mike Rann, a former Australian high commissioner to Britain, told the paper Britain had \u201chandled the earliest stages negligently\u201d, lamenting \u201ca shambles of mixed messaging, poor organisation and a complacent attitude that what was happening in Italy wouldn\u2019t happen here\u201d. A UK government spokesperson said: \u201cThis is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice. \u201cThe government has been working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives. Herd immunity has never been a policy or goal.\u201d Additional reporting by Angela Giuffrida, Philip Oltermann, Sam Jones, Helena Smith and Rory Carroll",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201ciOS apps are forbidden from using Bluetooth for long after they are minimised. To keep iPhones registering contact events appears to require either the user to constantly remember to reopen and refresh the app or, stranger still, sufficient Android \u2018herd immunity\u2019 among app users, where a nearby user of a non-iPhone, if in range, nudges nearby iPhones to not fall asleep, and to keep listening out.\u201d</p> \n<p>The workaround is required because the NHS took the controversial decision to build a \u201ccentralised\u201d app, which sends data about interactions back to the health service to help with modelling the spread of the disease. As a result, the app cannot use tools built by Apple and Google for the purposes of contact tracing. Those tools, due to be released this month, are restricted to apps that operate in a privacy-first \u201cdecentralised\u201d manner.</p> \n<p>Other countries that have made a similar decision to the UK have faced strict limits to what their contact-tracing apps can do as a result. Singapore, which built the first national contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, had to ask iPhone users to keep the screen turned on and the app open as much as possible in order to ensure their contacts were traceable.</p> \n<p>In Australia, the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/covidsafe-app-is-not-working-properly-on-iphones-authorities-admit?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=twt_gu&amp;utm_medium&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1588749760\">admitted on Wednesday</a> that its tracker app, COVIDSafe, \u201cprogressively deteriorates\u201d for iPhone users over time.</p> \n<p>The UK\u2019s app is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/guinea-pigs-isle-of-wight-residents-mixed-reactions-to-contact-tracing-app-coronavirus\">being trialled in the Isle of Wight</a>, where it is understood to have been downloaded more than 5,000 times in early release, out of an estimated population of smartphone users of around 100,000 and an overall population of 140,000.</p> \n<p>Sources say they are confident that the proportion of smartphone owners installing the app will exceed 50% after everybody on the island receives a formal invite by letter in the coming days.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Experts from Oxford University have said that the contact-tracing app should be installed by 60% of the population for it to be effective, but those involved believe it will provide useful information about the future spread of the disease with a download rate of 20% \u2013 with the help of the centralised database.</p> \n<p>iPhone\u2019s operating system begins to shut down the UK app\u2019s functions an hour or so after last use, until it ends up in \u201clisten-only\u201d mode. Two phones in that limited mode would be unable to carry out their contact-tracing function.</p> \n<p>As a result, Android phones, which are less aggressive about shutting down unused apps to preserve battery life, will be key to ensuring the contact tracing works. They will \u201cwake up\u201d nearby iPhones, ensuring that the contact tracing works.</p> \n<p>If even that does not occur, the app has a second fallback, sending a push notification to users asking them to reopen the application, in effect restarting the clock.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b768d0a9-0396-458b-be59-8c1f042adefe\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>On 18 May, Matt Hancock announced coronavirus testing is being extended in the UK to anyone over the age of five with symptoms.</p>\n    <p>Before then,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">eligibility had been limited</a>&nbsp;to a series of groups including key workers, those aged over 65, people who could not work from home, or people who lived with someone from one of these groups.</p>\n    <p>Those with symptoms can now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-getting-tested\">use the gov.uk website to book</a> home test kits or appointments at drive-through centres across the country.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Jason Kneen, <a href=\"https://www.bouncingfish.com\">a freelance app developer</a>, says the workarounds mean the app should have a higher chance of success than those in other nations. Analysing the log files produced while the app is running on an iPhone shows that the software continues to run in the background long after it stops being actively used. \u201cIf the argument is that it only works in the foreground, that\u2019s wrong. There is some backgrounding going on, using the normal process.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Veale said: \u201cSuch convoluted workarounds will certainly consume more battery and patience than the Apple-Google approach being adopted in other countries,\u201d including Austria, Germany and Switzerland.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf apps become the international norm, this has significant consequences, including at the Irish border where the Republic has pledged a decentralised approach.\u201d To enable cross-border contact tracing, the NHS would probably have to switch approaches, Veale said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>NHSX said its app had been rigorously tested and would run in the background on both iOS and Android phones and still remain effective. Users will not be required to have the app running in the foreground for it to work. NHSX offered up few other specifics except to say that testing of the technology would continue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK government is not the only one deciding to plough its own furrow.

To keep iPhones registering contact events appears to require either the user to constantly remember to reopen and refresh the app or, stranger still, sufficient Android \u2018herd immunity\u2019 among app users, where a nearby user of a non-iPhone, if in range, nudges nearby iPhones to not fall asleep, and to keep listening out.\u201d The workaround is required because the NHS took the controversial decision to build a \u201ccentralised\u201d app, which sends data about interactions back to the health service to help with modelling the spread of the disease. As a result, the app cannot use tools built by Apple and Google for the purposes of contact tracing. Those tools, due to be released this month, are restricted to apps that operate in a privacy-first \u201cdecentralised\u201d manner. Other countries that have made a similar decision to the UK have faced strict limits to what their contact-tracing apps can do as a result. Singapore, which built the first national contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, had to ask iPhone users to keep the screen turned on and the app open as much as possible in order to ensure their contacts were traceable. In Australia, the government admitted on Wednesday that its tracker app, COVIDSafe, \u201cprogressively deteriorates\u201d for iPhone users over time. The UK\u2019s app is being trialled in the Isle of Wight, where it is understood to have been downloaded more than 5,000 times in early release, out of an estimated population of smartphone users of around 100,000 and an overall population of 140,000. Sources say they are confident that the proportion of smartphone owners installing the app will exceed 50% after everybody on the island receives a formal invite by letter in the coming days. Experts from Oxford University have said that the contact-tracing app should be installed by 60% of the population for it to be effective, but those involved believe it will provide useful information about the future spread of the disease with a download rate of 20% \u2013 with the help of the centralised database. iPhone\u2019s operating system begins to shut down the UK app\u2019s functions an hour or so after last use, until it ends up in \u201clisten-only\u201d mode. Two phones in that limited mode would be unable to carry out their contact-tracing function. As a result, Android phones, which are less aggressive about shutting down unused apps to preserve battery life, will be key to ensuring the contact tracing works. They will \u201cwake up\u201d nearby iPhones, ensuring that the contact tracing works. If even that does not occur, the app has a second fallback, sending a push notification to users asking them to reopen the application, in effect restarting the clock. Jason Kneen, a freelance app developer, says the workarounds mean the app should have a higher chance of success than those in other nations. Analysing the log files produced while the app is running on an iPhone shows that the software continues to run in the background long after it stops being actively used. \u201cIf the argument is that it only works in the foreground, that\u2019s wrong. There is some backgrounding going on, using the normal process.\u201d But Veale said: \u201cSuch convoluted workarounds will certainly consume more battery and patience than the Apple-Google approach being adopted in other countries,\u201d including Austria, Germany and Switzerland. \u201cIf apps become the international norm, this has significant consequences, including at the Irish border where the Republic has pledged a decentralised approach.\u201d To enable cross-border contact tracing, the NHS would probably have to switch approaches, Veale said. NHSX said its app had been rigorously tested and would run in the background on both iOS and Android phones and still remain effective. Users will not be required to have the app running in the foreground for it to work. NHSX offered up few other specifics except to say that testing of the technology would continue. The UK government is not the only one deciding to plough its own furrow. The French government is waging a much louder campaign against Apple and Google, calling on both companies to change their policies so that it does not need to employ workarounds as Britain has done. \u201cApple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone,\u201d the French minister for digital technology, C\u00e9dric O, told BFM Business TV on Tuesday. \u201cThey have not wished to do so.\u201d",

As economists who work on poverty alleviation in developing countries, we are often asked what the effects of coronavirus will be in south Asia and Africa. The truth is, we don\u2019t know. Without extensive testing to map the number of cases, it\u2019s impossible to tell how far the virus has already spread. We don\u2019t yet have enough information about how Covid-19 behaves under different conditions such as sunlight, heat and humidity. Developing countries\u2019 more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/18/sub-saharan-africa-youth-population-potential\">youthful populations</a> may spare them the worst of the pandemic, but health systems in the global south are poorly equipped to deal with an outbreak, and poverty is linked to co-morbidities that put people at a higher risk of serious illness.</p> \n<p>Without the information widespread testing provides, many poorer countries have taken an extremely cautious approach. India imposed a total <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus\">lockdown on 24 March</a>, by which time the country had about 500 confirmed cases. Countries such as Rwanda, South Africa and Nigeria enforced lockdowns in late March, long before the virus was expected to peak. But these lockdown measures can\u2019t last forever. Poorer countries could have used the quarantine to buy time, gather information about how the disease behaves and develop a testing and tracing strategy. Unfortunately, not much of this has happened. And, far from coming to their aid, rich countries have outrun poorer nations in the race for PPE, oxygen and ventilators.</p> \n<p>In many places, the human toll of the lockdown is already becoming obvious. Children <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52503313\">go without vaccinations</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/covid-19-lockdown-sparks-harvest-crises-in-pakistan-india/1799536\">crops are not harvested</a>. As construction projects stall and markets are shuttered, jobs and incomes evaporate. The effects of prolonged quarantine on developing nations could be as harmful as the virus itself. Before Covid-19 rippled across the world, 15,000 children under five <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/despite-remarkable-progress-15000-children-and-800-women-still-die-every-day-mostly\">died every day</a> in the global south, mostly of preventable diseases associated with poverty. It\u2019s likely that many more will die if their families are plunged further into poverty.</p> \n<p>What can poor countries do in the face of this pandemic \u2013 and how can rich countries help them? First, the systematic testing strategies that have been crucial to containing the epidemic and easing lockdown measures in Europe are equally critical in poor countries. In places where public health authorities don\u2019t have information about the spread of the virus and resources are limited, the response to coronavirus needs to be targeted at active hotspots. In this way, rather than imposing a universal lockdown, health authorities can identify the clusters where quarantine measures are required.</p> \n<p>Second, developing countries must be able to improve the ability of their health systems to cope with a potential sudden influx of sick people.</p> \n<p>And third, it\u2019s crucial that poor countries are able to guarantee people a secure livelihood in the months to come. In the absence of such a guarantee, people will grow tired of quarantine measures and lockdowns will be increasingly difficult to enforce.<strong> </strong>To protect their economies from a collapse in demand, governments must reassure people that financial support will be available for as long as it\u2019s needed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"429927ae-d5f6-4294-9345-b635df4091ac\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2OEONouL5aU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In our recent book, written before coronavirus struck but with a title that is now eerily appropriate \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/11/good-economics-for-hard-times-abhijit-banerjee-esther-duflo-review\">Good Economics for Hard Times</a> \u2013 we recommend that poor countries implement what we call a universal ultra basic income (UUBI), a regular cash transfer that amounts to enough for basic survival. The virtues of a UUBI are its simplicity, transparency, and its assurance that nobody will starve. It avoids the problems of many welfare systems that are designed to exclude the \u201cnon-deserving\u201d, even at a cost to the needy. During a pandemic, when governments need to help as many people as quickly as possible, the simplicity of a UUBI could be lifesaving. Reassuring people that nobody will be excluded from subsistence aid also limits the feeling of existential foreboding that so many individuals in poor (and not so poor) countries are currently experiencing.</p> \n<p>These ideas aren\u2019t mere fantasy. The small west African country of Togo, with its eight million inhabitants and its <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/togo\">GDP (</a><a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/togo\">purchasing power parity) per capita of $1,538,</a> is working on all these fronts. In addition to testing <a href=\"https://visalist.io/emergency/coronavirus/togo-country\">7,900 suspected cases</a>, the country is deploying 5,000 test on a random basis to assess prevalence. Health authorities will use the results to determine when<strong> </strong>and where to restrict peoples\u2019 mobility. The government has also launched a<a href=\"https://www.togofirst.com/en/public-management/0405-5464-covid-19-novissi-cash-transfer-scheme-extended-to-tchauodjo-in-the-central-region\"> cash transfer scheme</a> linking an electronic wallet to peoples\u2019 cellphones; it already has 1.3 million people registered and has sent money to 500,000<strong> </strong>in the region of Greater Lom\u00e9 (the capital) alone.</p> \n<p>The good news is that many countries, particularly those in Africa, already have the infrastructure to rapidly transfer money across a population using cellphones. Many people already use these systems in private exchanges, so government schemes based on this infrastructure can be up and running in a matter of days. If phone data indicates that some regions are experiencing greater economic distress, the transfer could be more generous in those places.</p> \n<p>In fact, the greatest constraint we face isn\u2019t the feasibility of these measures \u2013 it\u2019s the willpower to finance them. Developing countries will need a substantial amount of help from richer nations if they are to pay for a UUBI. Some fear that their currencies will depreciate if they act aggressively, potentially spurring a debt crisis. Richer nations will need to work with global financial institutions to offer debt relief and additional resources to developing nations. Many developing countries will need to buy food and medical supplies with hard currency, which will become increasingly difficult because of faltering export earnings and collapsing remittances.</p> \n<p>Given the unprecedented collapse in earnings that many people face, conventional fiscal prudence is perhaps less important now than it was in the recent past. Now is the time for governments to help citizens and economies by spending more, rather than less. The governments of developing countries may need to accept large budget deficits in order to finance a UUBI, at least in the short term. When countries begin to loosen their lockdowns and resume production, they will face extremely weak demand. Pledging that cash transfers will continue for some time in the future will allow people to go out and spend money when it becomes safe to do so. In turn, this will drive the revival of the economy.</p> \n<p>None of this means that governments should simply ignore concerns about macro-economic stability. But a clear spending plan that responds to the immediate shock of coronavirus, in conjunction with a longer term strategy for how the lockdown will end, offers the best hope for preventing the present crisis developing into a future catastrophe.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee won the 2019 Nobel prize in economics for their work on poverty alleviation.

To protect their economies from a collapse in demand, governments must reassure people that financial support will be available for as long as it\u2019s needed. In our recent book, written before coronavirus struck but with a title that is now eerily appropriate \u2013 Good Economics for Hard Times \u2013 we recommend that poor countries implement what we call a universal ultra basic income (UUBI), a regular cash transfer that amounts to enough for basic survival. The virtues of a UUBI are its simplicity, transparency, and its assurance that nobody will starve. It avoids the problems of many welfare systems that are designed to exclude the \u201cnon-deserving\u201d, even at a cost to the needy. During a pandemic, when governments need to help as many people as quickly as possible, the simplicity of a UUBI could be lifesaving. Reassuring people that nobody will be excluded from subsistence aid also limits the feeling of existential foreboding that so many individuals in poor (and not so poor) countries are currently experiencing. These ideas aren\u2019t mere fantasy. The small west African country of Togo, with its eight million inhabitants and its GDP (purchasing power parity) per capita of $1,538, is working on all these fronts. In addition to testing 7,900 suspected cases, the country is deploying 5,000 test on a random basis to assess prevalence. Health authorities will use the results to determine when and where to restrict peoples\u2019 mobility. The government has also launched a cash transfer scheme linking an electronic wallet to peoples\u2019 cellphones; it already has 1.3 million people registered and has sent money to 500,000 in the region of Greater Lom\u00e9 (the capital) alone. The good news is that many countries, particularly those in Africa, already have the infrastructure to rapidly transfer money across a population using cellphones. Many people already use these systems in private exchanges, so government schemes based on this infrastructure can be up and running in a matter of days. If phone data indicates that some regions are experiencing greater economic distress, the transfer could be more generous in those places. In fact, the greatest constraint we face isn\u2019t the feasibility of these measures \u2013 it\u2019s the willpower to finance them. Developing countries will need a substantial amount of help from richer nations if they are to pay for a UUBI. Some fear that their currencies will depreciate if they act aggressively, potentially spurring a debt crisis. Richer nations will need to work with global financial institutions to offer debt relief and additional resources to developing nations. Many developing countries will need to buy food and medical supplies with hard currency, which will become increasingly difficult because of faltering export earnings and collapsing remittances. Given the unprecedented collapse in earnings that many people face, conventional fiscal prudence is perhaps less important now than it was in the recent past. Now is the time for governments to help citizens and economies by spending more, rather than less. The governments of developing countries may need to accept large budget deficits in order to finance a UUBI, at least in the short term. When countries begin to loosen their lockdowns and resume production, they will face extremely weak demand. Pledging that cash transfers will continue for some time in the future will allow people to go out and spend money when it becomes safe to do so. In turn, this will drive the revival of the economy. None of this means that governments should simply ignore concerns about macro-economic stability. But a clear spending plan that responds to the immediate shock of coronavirus, in conjunction with a longer term strategy for how the lockdown will end, offers the best hope for preventing the present crisis developing into a future catastrophe. \u2022 Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee won the 2019 Nobel prize in economics for their work on poverty alleviation.

Starting on Wednesday, for the first time in its history the usually 24-hour service will shut down every night between 1am and 5am to be disinfected in a bid to improve travel conditions for essential workers during the Covid-19 outbreak. But homelessness groups and charities said the move will have \u201ccounterproductive and harmful\u201d impacts for those who seek safety and shelter in subway trains and stations \u2013 forcing them on to the streets or into the city\u2019s shelters, where more than 700 people have tested positive for coronavirus in recent weeks. \u201cIt\u2019s actually extraordinarily counterproductive and harmful,\u201d said Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, which works with 3,500 people in New York every day. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that large groups of police officers are gathering at the end of the [subway] line, telling people to move, forcing people often to the streets, offering them access to congregate shelters which many are rightfully refusing to enter because of the safety issues and not actually offering real solutions to help people access a safer space.\u201d New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, who recently referred to a picture of homeless people on the subway as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful to the essential workers\u201d, made the announcement about closures last week amid concerns about conditions on the subway.

McElhenney plays an egomaniacal, bushy-bearded game creator named Ian (pronounced Iron) Grimm who constantly butts heads with long-suffering lead engineer Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao). The seed of the show was planted when Ubisoft, the gaming giant that develops Assassin\u2019s Creed, approached McElhenney about making a TV show. At their offices in Montreal he met a game designer who, when McElhenney asked what he did, replied after an uncomfortably long pause: \u201cI build worlds.\u201d</p> <p>Since the show first aired, McElhenney has been contacted on social media by a number of game developers who all assumed that they alone were the inspiration for the preening buffoon. \u201cI thought that was really funny,\u201d he grins. \u201cFirst, that they would own up to that, and second, because he has a very specific look, and the guys all look very, very similar.

He\u2019s a ridiculous version of an actual human being.\u201d</p> <p>With Mythic Quest, he wanted to explore the tension between the game developer as the driving force behind a game, and the reality that, like making a TV show, building a game is an intensely collaborative process. \u201cAs humans we like this idea that there\u2019s one person solely responsible for everything. Because of the human ego\u2019s desire for glorification, people step into the spotlight and say: \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s me.\u2019 I don\u2019t have to draw parallels to the situation we have in this country now, but it\u2019s fairly obvious there\u2019s a cult of personality that Americans specifically are driven to adore.\u201d</p> <p>McElhenney is self-aware enough to see some of these traits in himself. Always Sunny, he points out, would never have existed had he not moved to Los Angeles \u201cfuelled by privilege, true privilege, and the ignorance and testosterone of a 25-year-old white dude. The world was my oyster, and I felt that way even though I grew up poor and didn\u2019t know anybody in Hollywood.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMaPCYRPhY0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pMaPCYRPhY0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Born in Philadelphia in 1977, McElhenney was a scrawny child who at 13 weighed just 87lb. He credits his Jesuit education for helping him productively channel his teenage aggression, but says he was never class clown. \u201cI\u2019m in a text chain with my friends from high school and I\u2019m not even the third funniest person,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is astonishing to them, having known me for ever, that I\u2019m in this position. I was never the funny guy.\u201d</p> <p>What he did have was an obsessive love of television. \u201cI grew up watching immense amounts of it,\u201d he explains, \u201cso I\u2019m a student of the form.\u201d He started out as an actor in New York, but when he struggled to find parts his agent suggested he write. His first script \u2013 a dark Scorsese homage \u2013 was optioned by Taxi Driver writer Paul Schrader, but never produced.</p> <p>After moving to Hollywood, McElhenney wrote a scene in which a character, on hearing a friend say they have cancer, can\u2019t get away fast enough. He took the scene to the two people he thought could make it work, Charlie Day (\u201cOne of the funniest people alive\u201d) and Glenn Howerton (\u201cHe does something I\u2019ve never seen before: take Ted Bundy and make him comic\u201d). Always Sunny spawned from their dynamic, boosted by Kaitlin Olson, whom McElhenney married in 2008 and describes as \u201chands down the funniest woman on television\u201d. Their network, FX, insisted they add Danny DeVito to the cast in the second season to boost abysmal ratings. With the gang assembled, the show began to reach cult status, becoming what McElhenney dreamed it could be, a monstrous inversion of Friends\u2019 mantra: \u2018I\u2019ll be there for you.\u2019 \u201cEverybody is narcissistic to a certain extent, but we have governors in our brains and hearts that don\u2019t allow us to act that way,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat happens if five people who don\u2019t have that find each other? You create the confluence of narcissism, evil and sociopathic behaviour that is Sunny.\u201d</p> <p>Fifteen years later, Always Sunny is now the longest-running live-action sitcom on air, yet it retains the capacity to shock. That is down to McElhenney\u2019s determination to keep subverting expectations, not least with his own physical transformations that make a mockery of the idea that sitcom characters enter a form of stasis. For the show\u2019s seventh season, he piled on 22kg (48lb) by adopting a strict regimen of nighttime cottage cheese, then for the 13th he hired Channing Tatum\u2019s Magic Mike trainer Arin Babaian to get him into superhero shape. The latter\u2019s pay-off came in a remarkable season finale, in which McElhenney performs a moving five-minute interpretative dance routine as a way for his character Mac to come out to his incarcerated father. The joke is there is no joke. After years of being set up to expect grotesque catastrophe, the last thing you expect from Always Sunny is heartfelt sincerity.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe that scene goes back to not thinking of myself as being funny,\u201d he offers. \u201cMy approach becomes: I\u2019m going to deliver something unexpected, and hope that\u2019s where the comedy comes from. With Sunny we never say: \u2018What\u2019s going to be profane?\u2019 It\u2019s: \u2018What\u2019s nobody else doing?\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a831596c81379ca9cef192c026d0a2b03bef26ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a831596c81379ca9cef192c026d0a2b03bef26ea/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A confluence of narcissism, evil and sociopathic behaviour\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A confluence of narcissism, evil and sociopathic behaviour\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock/REX_Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was also a way for McElhenney, whose parents separated when he was eight after his mother began a relationship with a woman, to send a message to the show\u2019s gay fans. \u201cWhen Mac came out of the closet, it got an amazing response from the LBGTQ community that I did not expect,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realise so many fans of Sunny were not only members of the community, but thought of Sunny as a true advocate.\u201d</p> <p>Mythic Quest is also in the business of subverting expectations. After quickly establishing itself as a witty workplace sitcom, the show pulls the rug in its much-talked-about fifth episode, Dark Quiet Death, which distills the show\u2019s themes into a stand-alone episode about creativity, commerce and compromise. It revolves around the titular game in which players can never win but only prolong their inevitable demise \u2013 much like life. \u201cI\u2019m not a morbid person, but I think about death all the time,\u201d says McElhenney. \u201cSometimes the meaninglessness is liberating, and sometimes it\u2019s devastating. I navigate through life like that.\u201d</p> <p>The episode is a formally inventive and sophisticated piece of storytelling, but McElhenney shrugs it off by saying that in the age of streaming, showrunners no longer have any excuse not to push beyond old established limits. \u201cIt\u2019s just theft,\u201d he says, with a laugh. \u201cYou look at what Master of None did, what Donald [Glover] does with Atlanta, what Phoebe Waller-Bridge does, and you\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, wow, there\u2019s no more rules.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to believe the anarchic mind behind Always Sunny ever felt confined by rules. With Mythic Quest he has crafted another sharp, funny show that asks pertinent questions about these trying times, and which explores the positive aspects of masculinity along with those clearly toxic ones. When the first episode of Always Sunny aired, McElhenney was 28 and the youngest showrunner in Hollywood. Now, at 42, he says he seeks out writers who\u2019ll tell him: \u201c\u2018Hey, old man, it\u2019s not like that any more.\u2019\u201d Unlike the relic on his desk, he is looking firmly to the future.</p> <p><em>Mythic Quest: Raven\u2019s Banquet is available to stream on Apple TV+</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic threatens the future of the eurozone by creating huge economic divisions between its 19-member states during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression, the European commission has warned. The EU\u2019s economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said there was an urgent need to mitigate the inevitable exacerbation of existing social and economic fissures, as countries emerge at different speeds from the unprecedented economic downturn. The economic output of the Eurozone is likely to shrink by a record 7.75% in 2020 and rebound by just 6.25% in 2021, with unemployment rising from 7.5% in 2019 to 9.5%. Gentiloni said economic activity in the EU as a whole had \u201cdropped by around one-third practically overnight\u201d owing to the lockdowns imposed by European governments. More than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and more than 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). But the commission warned that a number of countries were likely to lag behind in bouncing back next year. Gentiloni said the pace of recovery of European governments would depend on the speed at which lockdowns could be lifted, the importance of services such as tourism in each economy and by each country\u2019s financial resources. Greece\u2019s gross domestic product \u2013 is forecast to shrink the most, by 9.7%, owing to the closure of its tourist industry. GDP in Italy and Spain are is expected to contract by 9.5% and 9.4% respectively. Germany is expected to have a far less dramatic contraction than most, and recover more swiftly even though the economic downturn (6.5%) is still expected to be the country\u2019s deepest since the second world war. Austria, Croatia Slovakia and Poland are the only other countries expected to return to 2019 levels of economic productivity by the end of 2021. \u201cSuch divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area \u2013 yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action,\u201d Gentiloni said. The European commission is planning a \u20ac1.5tn (\u00a31.3tn) recovery package made up of loans and grants but there remain differences of opinion on the level of burden sharing. As it have its official spring forecasts, the commission also said it expected the UK to be among the five European countries to suffer most from the economic impact of the coronavirus, with recovery then set to be hampered by the country\u2019s exit from the EU\u2019s single market at the end of the year. The commission said the UK economy was expected to shrink by 8.3% by the end of the year, as a result of lockdown measures, with investment down 14% and unemployment doubling. The UK has recorded the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe and the ECDC said the country was one of a handful where there had been no significant downturn in the number of infections. Only the GDPs of Greece, Italy, Spain and Croatia are expected to contract more than the UK\u2019s. The French economy is forecast to shrink by 8.2%, a similar figure to the UK, but the recovery of the British economy is likely to be hampered by the extra barriers to trade when the Brexit transition period ends. The commission listed the the blow to the UK\u2019s hospitality and continued uncertainty about the outcome of the country\u2019s departure from the EU as reasons for its relatively poor economic prospects. The UK government is negotiating with Brussels on the terms of trade once Britain leaves the single market and customs union. The European commission\u2019s official forecast said the end of the transition period would \u201cdampen economic growth, even if a free trade agreement between the EU and the UK was concluded. The economy of the 27 member states as a bloc is forecast to contract by 7.5% in 2020 and grow by 6.1% in 2021, but \u201cnot enough to fully make up for this year\u2019s loss\u201d, said Gentiloni, a former prime minister of Italy. The UK would be expected to grow by 6% next year, according to the commission, if the status quo in terms of trading relations was maintained.",

There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cThe primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d</p> <p>He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a \u201cminded to grant\u201d bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the \u2018minded to grant\u2019 but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.\u201d</p> <p>Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail.</p> <p>Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.\u201d</p> <p>Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: \u201cThis letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThat the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d</p> <p>Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: \u201cSeparation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.\u201d</p> <p>\ufeffA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention. The public expects law and order to be maintained, which is why 95% of those currently in detention are foreign-national offenders.\u201d\ufeff</p>",

Stevens outlined the ways in which the Home Office had responded to the risks coronavirus posed to detainees, before adding: \u201cWhere bail is granted I would ask you to consider whether immigration judges could provide written reasons for this.\u201d Judges are not required by law to do this. Stevens wrote: \u201cWhile I realise this is not a requirement under the procedure rules, it would assist the Home Office to fully understand the reasons why bail has been granted.\u201d The Home Office is supposed to detain only those it can deport imminently, and its ability to do this has been drastically reduced due to flights being grounded. There have been three confirmed cases of Covid-19 among immigration detainees, and the risk of catching the virus remains high among those who are locked up for extended periods.\ufeff In a response dated 1 May, Michael Clements, the chamber\u2019s president, issued a robust rejection of the Home Office\u2019s request. \u201cAs independent judiciary we decide bail applications in accordance with the law, which includes the guidance which has been issued. There has been no change in either the law or the guidance,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe primary function of detention is accordingly to facilitate removal, and unless there are very powerful reasons to the contrary bail should be granted if there is no removal of the bail applicant within the reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d He said that during the pandemic he had instituted a \u201cminded to grant\u201d bail process, giving the Home Office an early indication before a bail hearing took place that a judge was likely to grant bail unless the Home Office could provide specific reasons why this should not happen. \u201cUnfortunately, the feedback that I am receiving is not only that the Home Office rarely consent to the grant of bail having seen the \u2018minded to grant\u2019 but that bail is still opposed at the hearing without any meaningful additional representations being given.\u201d Pierre Makhlouf, an assistant director at Bail for Immigration Detainees, accused the Home Office of interfering with the judicial approach to bail applications because the rate of successful bail applications had shot up from its usual level of about 30%. He said 55 out of 58 cases where the charity provided representation since lockdown began had been granted bail. Adrian Berry, the chair of the Immigration Law Practitioners\u2019 Association, said: \u201cIt is not appropriate for government to use its position outside of the courtroom to seek to influence decisions. The separation of powers between the government and judiciary is a core constitutional principle.\u201d Bella Sankey, the director of Detention Action, which launched a legal challenge calling for the mass release of detainees during the pandemic, said: \u201cThis letter is a constitutional disgrace, entirely in keeping with a government that thinks it is above the law and not answerable to our sovereign parliament. \u201cThat the Home Office has sought to pressure the immigration tribunal over its bail decisions during a global pandemic shows alarming disrespect for the right to liberty, the rule of law and the separation of powers.\u201d Toufique Hossain, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who brought the Detention Action case, said: \u201cSeparation of powers is a basic principle of any democratic society to safeguard liberties and guard against tyranny.\u201d \ufeffA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis is completely untrue, and the Guardian knows full well that this letter is explaining transparently to the judiciary how we are responding to this pandemic, including carefully reviewing the cases of those in detention. The public expects law and order to be maintained, which is why 95% of those currently in detention are foreign-national offenders.\u201d\ufeff",

      "body": "<p>Angela Merkel has introduced some new ground rules for relaxing physical-distancing restrictions in an attempt to reassert her authority over Germany\u2019s 16 federal states, some of whom have announced unilateral re-opening plans.</p> <p>In recent days the German chancellor has struggled to preserve a fragile compromise over the introduction of nationwide lockdown measures bartered with federal states in mid-March.</p> <p>But during a lengthy video conference on Wednesday afternoon, she managed to rein in some of the regional tearaways by introducing a new \u201cemergency mechanism\u201d that can be triggered to contain local Covid-19 outbreaks.</p> <p>As latest official figures confirmed that the spread of the virus was slowing in Germany, Merkel and state premiers said people would be allowed to meet and move in public not just with members of their household but also with \u201cpersons belonging to one other household\u201d.</p> <p>Elderly people in risk groups still required \u201cspecial attention\u201d, Merkel said at a press conference, without categorically ruling out family reunions in smaller groups. The requirement to keep a 1.5m safety distance would remain in place.</p> <p>However, the German leader said relaxing physical distancing rules would only be possible if the country adhered to a new \u201cemergency mechanism\u201d, whereby hospitals, care homes or entire municipalities would be put under lockdown if they accumulatively registered more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days.</p> <p>If the consensus over lockdown measures appeared to have slipped from Merkel\u2019s grasp in recent days, the new emergency mechanism represents a small victory for the chancellor following opposition from the northern city states of Hamburg and Bremen.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be careful that this thing doesn\u2019t slip from our grasp,\u201d Merkel said. She said Germany was following a \u201cvery open and brave path\u201d by having avoided a stricter lockdown of the kind applied in France, Italy or Spain.</p> <p>Further steps in the lockdown exit strategy involve the reopening of shops including department stores and shopping malls, as well as a phased reopening of restaurants and bars with new hygiene requirements by 22 May.</p> <p>The German football league\u2019s first and second division <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/06/bundesliga-set-for-go-ahead-to-resume-season-in-second-half-of-may\">will restart \u201cin the second half of May\u201d</a>, with the German football association to rule on Thursday whether games will kick off on the weekend of 15 or 22 May.</p> <p>The decision on whether to reopen restaurants, hotels, cinemas, theatres and concert halls \u2013 and if so, when, and under what restrictions \u2013 has been delegated to the 16 federal governments.</p> <p>Nurseries will expand emergency care to beyond families where parents qualify as \u201cessential workers\u201d. Elderly people in care homes will be able to select a \u201creference person\u201d that is allowed to pay them visits.</p> <p>The latest official figures in Germany appear to show that the first steps to relax physical-distancing restrictions have not had the dramatic impact on infection rates some had originally feared.</p> <p>The number of new infections has in recent days repeatedly stayed below 1,000 and the virus\u2019s reproduction number has stayed below one. Merkel spoke of a \u201cvery, very good development\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Angela Merkel has introduced some new ground rules for relaxing physical-distancing restrictions in an attempt to reassert her authority over Germany\u2019s 16 federal states, some of whom have announced unilateral re-opening plans. In recent days the German chancellor has struggled to preserve a fragile compromise over the introduction of nationwide lockdown measures bartered with federal states in mid-March. But during a lengthy video conference on Wednesday afternoon, she managed to rein in some of the regional tearaways by introducing a new \u201cemergency mechanism\u201d that can be triggered to contain local Covid-19 outbreaks. As latest official figures confirmed that the spread of the virus was slowing in Germany, Merkel and state premiers said people would be allowed to meet and move in public not just with members of their household but also with \u201cpersons belonging to one other household\u201d. Elderly people in risk groups still required \u201cspecial attention\u201d, Merkel said at a press conference, without categorically ruling out family reunions in smaller groups. The requirement to keep a 1.5m safety distance would remain in place. However, the German leader said relaxing physical distancing rules would only be possible if the country adhered to a new \u201cemergency mechanism\u201d, whereby hospitals, care homes or entire municipalities would be put under lockdown if they accumulatively registered more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days. If the consensus over lockdown measures appeared to have slipped from Merkel\u2019s grasp in recent days, the new emergency mechanism represents a small victory for the chancellor following opposition from the northern city states of Hamburg and Bremen. \u201cWe have to be careful that this thing doesn\u2019t slip from our grasp,\u201d Merkel said. She said Germany was following a \u201cvery open and brave path\u201d by having avoided a stricter lockdown of the kind applied in France, Italy or Spain. Further steps in the lockdown exit strategy involve the reopening of shops including department stores and shopping malls, as well as a phased reopening of restaurants and bars with new hygiene requirements by 22 May. The German football league\u2019s first and second division will restart \u201cin the second half of May\u201d, with the German football association to rule on Thursday whether games will kick off on the weekend of 15 or 22 May. The decision on whether to reopen restaurants, hotels, cinemas, theatres and concert halls \u2013 and if so, when, and under what restrictions \u2013 has been delegated to the 16 federal governments. Nurseries will expand emergency care to beyond families where parents qualify as \u201cessential workers\u201d. Elderly people in care homes will be able to select a \u201creference person\u201d that is allowed to pay them visits. The latest official figures in Germany appear to show that the first steps to relax physical-distancing restrictions have not had the dramatic impact on infection rates some had originally feared. The number of new infections has in recent days repeatedly stayed below 1,000 and the virus\u2019s reproduction number has stayed below one. Merkel spoke of a \u201cvery, very good development\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been another day of dire economic data, as the coronovirus pandemic hits firms across the globe. American companies laid off more than 20 million workers in April -- a record-breaking amount that dwarfs the previous record of 835k set in 2008. More than 16m jobs were lost at service sector companies, with hospitality and leisure worst hit. Economists warned that the US jobless rate has rocketed towards 15% since the pandemic began, wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis. Britain\u2019s construction sector is also in a deep rut, with activity almost wiped out last month. Builders reported that new orders evaporated last month as sites were forced to shut down, with materials and parts in short supply too. Cash-strapped small UK businesses have secured more than 69,000 government-backed loans worth in excess of \u00a32bn in the first 24 hours of the scheme\u2019s launch. German factories have posted their biggest ever slump in orders for March, with demand cratering by 15%. Capital goods orders crashed by over 20%, as domestic and overseas customers hunkered down. Private sector activity across the eurozone fell at a record rate, data firm Markit reported. The European Commissioned warned that Europe faces its worst slump since the Great Depression. It predicted GDP would shrink by 7.75% across the eurozone, with Greece, Italy and Spain the worst hit. Goodnight. GW After a choppy day\u2019s trading, European stock markets have closed mostly in the red. The Stoxx 600 index dipped by 0.4%, with America\u2019s surge in unemployment reminding traders that the world economy is entering a steep recession. In London, though, the market was lifted by Ocado (+5.5%) after it reported a 40% surge in sales this quarter, and by pharmaceuticals firms Hikma (+5%) and AstraZeneca (+3.7%). FTSE 100: up 4 points or 0.07% at 5853 German DAX: down 123 points or 1% at 10,606 French CAC: down 49 points or 1% at 4,433 Back in the UK, troubled department store chain Debenhams is to permanently close five additional sites. The move puts more than 1,000 jobs at risk. All the stores are in shopping centres owned by property firm Hammerson including The Oracle in Reading and Birmingham\u2019s Bullring. The latest closures mean that 16 of the department stores outlets will now remain closed once lockdown is eased. The department store, which collapsed into administration last month, has reached agreement on 120 sites and the future of six more hangs in the balance. The Financial Times says America is facing an unemployment crisis of historic proportions, judging by today\u2019s slump in private sector payrolls. The US private sector shed a record 20m jobs in April as coronavirus lockdowns and the resulting closure of non-essential businesses led to historic unemployment. Non-farm private employers cut 20.2m jobs last month, according to payroll processor ADP. That compared with economists\u2019 expectations for 20m and easily surpassed the previous record of about 835,000 in February 2009 during the financial crisis. Bloomberg fears the US government\u2019s own jobs report, due on Friday, will be a shocker too: The report is a harbinger of the government\u2019s April jobs report on Friday and adds to evidence of the pandemic\u2019s widespread economic devastation. The Labor Department\u2019s figures are projected to show a record 21 million decline in total nonfarm payrolls and a jobless rate surging to 16%. Marketwatch suspects that ADP\u2019s grim report actually underestimates the true toll of joblessness (something ADP also acknowledged): More than 30 million people have applied for jobless benefits in the past six weeks, though not all of them are still unemployed. Another 3 million probably applied in the past week. In all likelihood, total job losses probably exceed the 23 million new jobs created from the end of the last recession in 2009 until the pandemic took hold in mid-March. Whatever the case, the labor market has suffered an enormous blow that will make it harder for the economy to recovery once the COVID-19 pandemic begins to fade. Washington has stepped in with massive subsidies to encourage companies to keep workers on payrolls until the economy reopens, but even that might not be enough. What were viewed as temporary job losses are increasingly becoming permanent. The global recession caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has also driven up US oil stockpiles. US crude oil inventories jumped by nearly 4.6 million barrels in the last week, the Energy Information Administration reports, despite some producers cutting output following the slump in prices. That\u2019s a smaller rise than expected, while gasoline stocks dropped unexpectedly. But there was a 9m barrel surge in distillate stockpiles (such as heating oil and diesel). Back in the UK, more than 400 oil rig workers have been flown off North Sea oil rigs in recent weeks with suspected Covid-19 symptoms or because they are at high risk of contracting it. Industry body Oil and Gas UK reported that 206 workers with mild symptoms had been taken off North Sea installations between March 23 and May 3, with another 198 workers flown back to shore after coming into close contact with suspected Covid-19 cases. It is thought only one offshore worker has died from Covid-19, but a number of others have been taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary\u2019s high dependency unit or put on respirators, one trade union official said. Industry data showed there was a surge of repatriations in late March and early April, but the rate had since dropped significantly. The central North Sea has been the worst affected, with 193 workers flown back to base, followed by 146 in the northern North Sea. Data on the number of workers hospitalised or the number of fatalities is not collected by the oil industry but by the NHS, unless deaths happen offshore. Jake Molloy, an offshore organiser for the RMT trade union, said the industry had reduced staffing offshore to about 7,000 essential posts, stopped workers sharing cabins, were now prescreening temperatures before workers flew offshore, and had introduced face coverings for all offshore workers. Even so, there were still major concerns for the workforce. It was impossible to enforce the two-metre social distancing rules on helicopters for instance. Molloy said there were reports yesterday of an outbreak of nine positive cases on one rig. He said: \u201cThe industry has been toiling with all the ramifications of social distancing and isolations, as well as how to test and when to test. It has been a pretty turbulent four or five weeks.\u201d In mid-March, as the pandemic erupted, Molloy described the situation offshore as \u201cchaotic\u201d, with outbreaks occurring on installations, forcing oil rig workers to isolate before being evacuated by helicopters set aside for the task. Trevor Stapleton, Oil and Gas UK\u2019s health and safety director, said data last week showing a reduction in suspected cases, down from a peak of 56 in April to 20 last week, was welcome. \u201cThis apparent reduction is a small move in the right direction but we can\u2019t stress enough the need to remain alert, to continue to follow protocols and to raise any concerns in both on and offshore working environments.\u201d Here\u2019s a good video clip explaining the record fall in US employment: The US stock market appears to be shrugging off the dramatic surge in US unemployment. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 0.3% in early trading, gaining 76 points to 23,959. Quite a subdued reaction to the news that Twenty Million Americans lost their jobs last month. Traders appear to be encouraged that lockdowns are now easing, both in parts of Europe and in many American states. But this move does bring risks of a rise in Covid-19 infections, which could lead to new restrictions - and another economic hit. Christopher Smart, Chief Global Strategist and Head of Barings Investment Institute, says: \u201cEquity markets seem quite happy about the prospects of factories and shops gearing up for more activity, but confidence, the key ingredient to secure a return to normal, remains elusive. Even though China has now gone weeks without a new case, the COVID19 curves are not flattening everywhere. Indeed, in some US states the trends continue to worsen and there are still lots of unanswered questions about how and why it spreads. \u201cFresh outbreaks raise the threat of further lockdowns in some parts of the country. More damaging will be delays in restoring confidence to workers and shoppers that more normal activity is safe. Uber is also permanently close 180 driver service centres as part of its cost-cutting drive, Bloomberg reports: Of the more than 450 driver centers Uber operates worldwide, 40% will shut down. The locations, called Greenlight Hubs, are used to sign people up to drive for Uber, teach them how to use the app and address issues that arise on the job. In March, as the virus was spreading in North America, Uber said it was temporarily closing all hubs in the U.S. and Canada. Dara Khosrowshahi signaled that more \u201cdifficult adjustments\u201d would be put forth in the next two weeks. \u201cDays like this are brutal,\u201d he wrote [in an email to employees]. Just in: Uber is adding to America\u2019s unemployment misery, by cutting 3,700 jobs in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As part of the cost-cutting drive, chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi is waiving his base salary for the remainder of the year. In a regulatory filing, the ride-hailing and food delivery firm blamed \u201cthe economic challenges and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d. Due to lower trip volumes in its Rides segment and the Company\u2019s current hiring freeze, the Company is reducing its customer support and recruiting teams by approximately 3,700 full-time employee roles. In connection with these actions, the Company estimates that it will incur approximately $20 million related to severance and other termination benefits. Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics fears that America\u2019s jobless rate will hit at least 15% on Friday, when the government publishes April\u2019s Non-Farm Payroll. He points out that today\u2019s ADP report isn\u2019t completely comparable to NFP: The ADP counts anyone on the active payroll rather than just people who were paid during the month, which is the official non-farm payroll definition. Within many people put on temporary layoff, that could have created a discrepancy, with those people still on the active payroll, but not counted in the official non-farm payroll figures and also qualifying as unemployed in the other official household survey. As such, the collapse in employment could look even worse on Friday: We still estimate that non-farm payrolls fell by 22,500,000, with the unemployment rate rising to somewhere between 15% and 20%. Heather Long of the Washington Post points out that America\u2019s labor market has lost all the job creation gains of the last decade: Greg Daco of Oxford Economics points out that service sector companies bore the brunt - especially leisure and hospitality firms (such as restaurants, theme parks, sports companies and travel firms). Bloomberg\u2019s Michael McDonough has plotted the job losses by company size: MacroPolicy Perspectives\u2019s Julia Coronado sums up what the data means to families across America: ADP have also provided a sector-by-sector breakdown of the catastrophic job losses across America last month: Goods producers cut 4.23 million jobs: Mining/natural resources: -78,000 Construction: -2.47m Manufacturing: -1.6m Services companies laid off 16 million people: Trade/transportation/utilities: -3.4m Information: -309k Professional/business services: -1.1m Education and health care: -971k Leisure and hospitality: -8.6m Other services: -1.3m We\u2019ve had a lot of bad data recently, but April\u2019s US private sector payroll is a real shocker. At 20.3 million, last month\u2019s job losses obliterate the previous record of around 835,000 jobs lost in February 2009 after the financial crisis. On Friday, we get the broader US unemployment report, called the Non-Farm Payroll. ADP and NFP don\u2019t always match up - but today\u2019s data is sending an awful signal. Newsflash: More than 20 million Americans lost their jobs at companies across the country last month. ADP, which processes payrolls for companies across America, has just reported that private sector employment decreased by 20,236,000 jobs from March to April. That\u2019s obviously a huge increase, out of a total US labor force of around 162m, and highlights the awful economic damage caused by Covid-19. It\u2019s the worst monthly job losses ever recorded by ADP, explains Ahu Yildirmaz, co-head of the ADP Research Institute: Job losses of this scale are unprecedented. The total number of job losses for the month of April alone was more than double the total jobs lost during the Great Recession. The job axe fell sharply across American firms. ADP reports that small firms cut 6 million jobs, medium-sized firms lost 5.2m workers, and large companies said goodbye to 8.9m staff. The ADP also cautions that its report uses data through the 12th of the month, so won\u2019t catch job losses in the last couple of weeks. It says: As such, the April NER does not reflect the full impact of COVID-19 on the overall employment situation. US car maker General Motors has cheered Wall Street by beating profit expectations, and outlining plans to restart operations later this month. Net income at the carmaker tumbled in the last quarter to around $300m, down from $2.16bn a year ago. Adjusted earnings came in at 62 cents per share, from $1.41, ahead of forecasts of 30 cents per share. GM also outlined plans to reopen some factories within a fortnight, saying: Considerable planning is under way to restart operations in North America. Based on conversations and collaboration with unions and government officials, GM is targeting to restart the majority of manufacturing operations on May 18 in the U.S. and Canada under extensive safety measures.\u201d Shares in GM are up 7% in pre-market trading (having lost 40% so far this year). Despite the surge in UK government borrowing, there\u2019s no shortage of willing buyers for British gilts. Reuters has spotted that the UK borrowed for thirty years at a cheaper rate than ever before: Britain\u2019s government paid investors an interest rate of under 0.5% to borrow for more than 30 years on Wednesday, the lowest-ever yield at an auction for a conventional British government bond with a maturity of more than 10 years. Investors bid for 2.6 times the 1.75 billion pounds ($2.17 billion) on offer of the 1.625% 2054 gilt, similar to the last sale of the bond on April 21, and the average successful bidder will receive an annual yield of 0.495%. In March the Bank of England cut its main interest rate to a record low 0.1%, and announced a record 200 billion pounds in extra bond purchases that has kept a firm lid on bond yields and government borrowing costs. Since then Britain has massively stepped up its borrowing plans to fund government efforts to lessen the impact of the coronavirus, but its cost of borrowing has fallen, not risen. The lowest-ever yield at a conventional gilt auction came at a sale of 3.25 billion pounds of five-year gilts on Tuesday, when the average bidder received a yield of 0.017%. Overnight, Airbnb has set out plans to make 1,900 staff redundant \u2013 around a quarter of its global workforce \u2013 as it forecast that its revenues in 2020 will be half the $4.8bn it earned in 2019. Co-founder and chief executive Brian Chesky described coronavirus as \u201cthe most harrowing crisis of our lifetime\u201d telling staff that \u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly when travel will return. When travel does return, it will look different.\u201d Airbnb has staff in 24 countries, with its headquarters in San Francisco and its European head office in Dublin, where it employs around 500 people. Some of the deepest cuts are likely to be in newer areas of the business such as Airbnb \u2018Luxe\u2019, which offers upmarket homes and dedicated trip designers. Chesky explained: \u201cPeople will want options that are closer to home, safer, and more affordable,\u201d It said there are signs of a mild recovery in some locations, with evidence growing that travellers in Europe are booking properties in their own countries this summer rather than flying abroad to Spain or Italy. It told the Financial Times that bookings by Danish users planning stays in their own country was at around 90% of April 2019 levels, while in the Netherlands domestic bookings were approaching 80% of last year. Airbnb joins airlines and travel operators around the world axing staff as the global tourism industry is at a standstill. British Airways said it is cutting 12,000 staff while Virgin Atlantic said yesterday it will shed 3,000 jobs and mothball its Gatwick operations. The collapse in Airbnb\u2019s revenue has also thwarted plans by the company for a projected $40bn-plus stock market flotation this year, which would also have earned many of its staff large payouts, as early entrants into the company were partly remunerated with stock options. Both sterling and the euro have fallen, after this morning\u2019s dire PMI surveys. The pound has shed half a cent against the US dollar to $1.238, its lowest in seven sessions, as traders digested the unprecedented drop in construction activity. The euro is also down half a cent to $1.078, its lowest in eight sessions, after private sector across the eurozone slumped and German factory orders tumbled. Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, says this morning\u2019s surveys of purchasing managers have hurt both currencies: \u201cThe euro and sterling are in the firing line this morning, with a host of economic releases highlighting just how dire the economic picture is irrespective on continued gains seen throughout stock markets. \u201cFrom a PMI perspective, final readings are typically perceived as a somewhat drab affair as minimal adjustments are made to previous estimates. \u201cHowever, with the economic picture changing so dramatically throughout the month of April, today has seen huge downward revisions to eurozone and UK PMI surveys to the detriment of the pound and euro. From a eurozone perspective, we have now seen the sharpest contraction in activity throughout the region since its inception, with the composite eurozone PMI coming in at a record low of 13.6. In the UK, the construction sector saw the worst decline on record, with the PMI reading slumping to a record low of 8.2 in April.\u201d Nearly 70,000 state-backed loans to small UK firms have been granted, totalling over \u00a32bn, in the latest effort to protect Britain\u2019s economy from the pandemic. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme opened on Monday, and proved popular with struggling companies. Seven large lenders received more than 130,000 applications on Monday, the Treasury reports. The scheme allows small and medium-sized businesses (a struggling builder, for example) to borrow between \u00a32,000 and \u00a350,000 for up to six years. The government guarantees 100% of the loan, and there are no fees, interest or repayments for the first 12 months. However, there are also signs that UK banks are struggling to handle demand: Europe will experience a recession this year of a depth unmatched since the Great Depression and the UK will be one of the hardest hit, the European Commission has just warned. Economic forecasts published by the Commission on Wednesday suggest that the UK will experience an 8.3% contraction by the end of the year, with investment down by 14% and a doubling of unemployment. In terms of the drop in GDP - the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a year - only Italy, Greece, Spain and Croatia among the EU member states will endure a bigger shrinking of the economy. The commission said that the coming recession will be of historic proportion. The EU economy is forecast to contract by 7.5% in 2020 and grow by around 6% in 2021. But countries will be impacted and find they are able to recover to greater and lesser degrees. Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for the economy, said: \u201cAt this stage, we can only tentatively map out the scale and gravity of the coronavirus shock to our economies. \u201cWhile the immediate fallout will be far more severe for the global economy than the financial crisis, the depth of the impact will depend on the evolution of the pandemic, our ability to safely restart economic activity and to rebound thereafter. \u201cThis is a symmetric shock: all EU countries are affected and all are expected to have a recession this year.\u201d The UK\u2019s GDP is predicted to bounce back by 6% by the end of 2021, according to the commission\u2019s predictions, although this presumes the continuation of the status quo between Britain and the EU in its trading relationship. Despite this morning\u2019s torrent of bad news, the UK stock market has nudged higher - with the blue-chip FTSE 100 and the smaller FTSE 250 index both up 0.5%. That\u2019ll please those investors who piled into shares last month, on hopes that the worst of the market slump is over. My colleague Patrick Collinson explains: Small investors poured into the stock market in April in the hope of picking up bargains, with record inflows into funds according to data provider Calastone. A net \u00a32.6bn was invested in equity funds in the UK in April, the highest monthly figure on record and six times more than a typical month, it said. Most of the buying took place in the middle of the month as evidence began to emerge that the outbreak was beginning to slow down in some of the worst-hit European countries. By the end of the month, inflows slowed to a trickle, said Calastone. About 70% of the country\u2019s 10,500 fish and chips shops have reopened as owners find new ways of doing business under lockdown. Six weeks ago 80% closed their doors as they moved to protect staff and customers from the spread of coronavirus, according to the National Fish Fryers Federation. But now chippies are using innovative ideas such as online or app-based ordering systems which give customers a time slot to pick up their freshly-fried dinners and help maintain physical distancing. Virgin Money is delaying its company wide rebrand\u2013 which will involve snuffing out the Clydesdale and Yorkshire bank names \u2013 due to Covid-19. But the bank\u2019s chief executive insisted the project has not been derailed due bad press linked to Richard Branson\u2019s poorly-received attempts to tap government rescue money to save his Virgin Atlantic airline. David Duffy told journalists: \u201cEffectively we are continuing with the implementation of the our rebranding. We think it\u2019s a great consumer brand and we\u2019re delivering for our customers in a really customer-oriented way, which is in the DNA of that brand. So absolutely no changes to make in terms of that. And all airlines I think are suffering from the same level of difficulty, so I\u2019m not concerned about that.\u201d The bank currently pays around \u00a311-12m per year in license fees to use the Virgin name. However, Virgin Money\u2019s CFO Ian Smith said there were \u201cvarious provisions on both sides for amending that as necessary.\u201d The comments came as Virgin Money reported a 97% fall in statutory pre-tax profit in the first half of the year, pushing it to a \u00a37m loss compared to a \u00a3274m profit a year earlier. The slump was driven by loan loss provisions worth more than \u00a3230m, the bulk of which was linked to Covid-19. The Covid-19 lockdown has knocked the wind out of the building industry, warns Duncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply. He fears it will take many years to recover: \u201cOnly a few civil engineering and infrastructure projects were able to continue in April, but a tentative restart is expected in other areas such as house building and commercial construction in the short-term. As new plans from policymakers are developed over social distancing, building work may continue but not as we know it as restrictions and new safety rules are likely to make progress more difficult. For a sector still not fully recovered from the skills shortages created by the financial crisis in 2008, the vacuum of output created by the pandemic has knocked the sector back another decade.\u201d Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit, reports that UK builders are (understandably) worried about the future after effectively shutting down in April. Many are concerned about their cash flow, despite putting many workers on the government\u2019s furloughing scheme. A drop in construction activity of historic proportions in April looks set to be followed by a gradual reopening of sites in the coming weeks, subject to strict reviews of safety measures. \u201cHowever, the prospect of severe disruption across the supply chain will continue over the longer-term and widespread use of the government job retention scheme has been needed to cushion the impact on employment. Looking ahead, construction companies widely commented on worries about cash flow, rising operating costs and severely reduced productivity, as well as a slump in demand for new construction projects. Construction firms reported that new business orders tumbled in April as customers shied away from signing contracts amid the lockdown. Markit explains: Construction companies commented on the suspension of contract awards due to business closures among clients, as well as uncertainty about the duration of stoppages on site and feasibility of starting new projects. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s construction industry has suffered its worst ever monthly contraction, as builders downed tools to comply with the Covid-19 lockdown. The UK construction PMI has slumped to just 8.2 for April, down from 39.3 in March, and far (far!) below the 50-point mark showing stagnation. It\u2019s the worst reading since Markit started surveying purchasing managers across UK building firms. Markit says: The vast majority of survey respondents (86%) reported a reduction in business activity since March, reflecting widespread site closures and shutdowns across the supply chain in response to the public health emergency. All three main categories of construction work experienced a survey-record fall during April, with declines in house building (7.3) and commercial activity (7.7) exceeding that for civil engineering (14.6), Markit reports. As well as site closures, construction firms also reported supply chain problems - with long delays to obtain raw materials and a shortage of safety products. Just in: The eurozone\u2019s private sector shrank at an unprecedented rate last month, led by Spain and Italy. Data firm Markit\u2019s eurozone composite PMI, which tracks activity across its private sector, has slumped to 13.6 for April, down from 29.7 in March. That\u2019s a record low, showing the worst ever slump in growth. Purchasing managers at companies across the eurozone reported that exports and new business fell very sharply, while job losses accelerated. Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, says the decline is \u2018shocking\u2019, and warns that countries will struggle to recover quickly: \u201cThe extent of the euro area economic downturn was laid bare by record downturns in every country surveyed in April, with output falling at unprecedented rates across the region\u2019s manufacturing and services sectors. With a large part of the region\u2019s economy shut down while COVID-19 infections spiked higher, the economic data for April were inevitably going to be bad, but the scale of the decline is still shocking. The survey data are indicative of GDP falling at a quarterly rate of around 7.5%, far surpassing the worst decline seen in the global financial crisis. Jobs are also being lost at a rate never previously seen. Hopefully, with coronavirus curves flattening and governments making moves to ease lockdown restrictions, many sectors should start to see output and demand pick up. The process will be only very gradual, however, as governments juggle between reviving economies and preventing a second wave of infections. Most companies will inevitably need to work at levels well below full capacity and sectors such as retail, travel, tourism and recreation \u2013 already the hardest hit \u2013 will continue to be badly affected by social distancing. Ocado is continuing to profit from the Covid-19 pandemic. The online grocer has reported a 40% surge in UK revenue so far this quarter, up from 10% growth in the first three months of 2020. Demand surged as the lockdown began, creating an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 level of demand from customers keen to avoid venturing to the shops. It says: Growth in Retail Revenue in the Second Quarter to date is 40.4% up on last year, compared to 10.3% growth in the First Quarter. The number of items per basket appears to have passed its peak but remains high, as more normal shopping behaviours have returned, and the share of fresh and chilled products in the mix, relative to ambient, is also returning to normal. Shares in the online grocer hit \u00a317.44 this morning, a new record high: Ouch! Spain\u2019s service sector has also suffered its worst monthly slump on record, with its PMI sliding to a mere 7.1 in April, from 23 in March. That shows an \u201cunprecedented\u201d drop in activity. India\u2019s service sector is shrinking at an unprecedented rate, due to its Covid-19 lockdown. The Indian service sector PMI, which measures activity across the sector, has taken an almighty tumble -- dropping to just 5.4 from 49.3 in March. An extraordinary plunge, on an index where 50 points shows stagnation. Markit, which compiles the data, says it\u2019s the worst plunge since it started measuring India\u2019s economy 14 years ago, as businesses were closed and citizens ordered to stay at home. Joe Hayes of Markit says it shows India\u2019s economy is suffering a severe contraction: Historical comparisons with GDP data suggest that India\u2019s economy contracted at an annual rate of 15% in April. It is clear that the economic damage of the COVID-19 pandemic has so far been deep and far-reaching in India, but the hope is that the economy has endured the worst and things will begin to improve as lockdown measures are gradually lifted. A single-digit PMI is quite remarkable - its hard to believe any country has posted a worse reading before: ITV has revealed the scale of the impact of the coronavirus, by furloughing 800 staff as advertising slumped 42% last month. The broadcaster said it will reduce overhead costs by \u00a360m this year, an increase in its previously announced \u00a330m, and has withdrawn its final dividend for 2019. Other actions include furloughing 800 staff, about 15% of ITV\u2019s UK workforce, mostly in ITV Studios after TV and film production was shutdown nationwide in mid-March. The broadcaster has also reached an agreement with its pension trustees and tax authorities to delay at least \u00a3150m of payments due by June, to the second half and into 2021. ITV, which earlier this week announced that its flagship summer programme Love Island will be cancelled this year, said that it is working on a \u201cphased approach to office re-entry\u201d and a \u201creturn to production protocol\u201d to re-start programme production. Carolyn McCall, chief executive of ITV says: \u201cWe are now very focused on emerging from this crisis in a strong position, continuing to offer advertisers effective marketing opportunities and making preparations to restart productions safely.\u201d ITV said that total viewing hours were up 2% in the year to the end of March, while viewing of shows on streaming service ITV Hub was up 75% year-on-year to 169m hours. German carmaker BMW has also highlighted the economic cost of Covid-19 this morning. BMW has reported a 20% tumble in vehicle deliveries in the first quarter of 2020, including a 30% slump in China. It points out that the international motor market crumbled this year: The worldwide spread of coronavirus has left international automobile markets in an extremely weak overall condition after the first three months of the year. Initially, events were dominated by a slump in registrations in China in February and March. However, all other major automobile markets subsequently reported declines, some of them drastic, especially from March 2020 onwards. BMW also issued a profit warning last night, saying the pandemic was causing more damage than it expected. It explained: \u201cThe decisive factor for the adjustment is that the measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic are lasting longer in several markets and are thus leading to a broader negative impact than was foreseeable in mid-March. It is therefore apparent that delivery volumes in these markets will not \u2013 as was previously assumed - return to normal within a few weeks. The highest negative impact is expected in the second quarter of 2020.\u201d Germany\u2019s economy ministry blamed the dramatic fall in orders on the global economic shock of Covid-19, and warned that the situation will worsen. In a statement, it says: \u201cIt is to be expected that production will decline sharply from March onwards due to corona\u201d This chart confirms that March\u2019s slump is the worst since reunification: Demand for heavy-duty German tools, machinery, vehicles and other equipment slumped particularly sharply in March. Orders for these capital goods fell over 22%, while intermediate goods [used to make something else] fell 7.5%. Consumer goods, though, only dropped 1.3%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The economic gloom in Germany has deepened this morning, with the biggest slump in factory orders since reunification. German factory orders plunged by 15.6% in March alone, new figures show, as its economy started to lock down to handle the coronavirus pandemic. This appears to be the worst slump since the data series began in 1991. On an annual basis, orders were 16% lower than in March 2019 - with a slump in demand from other German companies, and from customers abroad. Statistics firm Destatis explains: Domestic orders decreased by 14.8% and foreign orders fell by 16.1% in March 2020 on the previous month. New orders from the euro area went down 17.9%, and new orders from other countries decreased by 15.0% compared with February 2020. This is even worse than expected - economists had forecast a 10% drop in German factory orders. Another sign that Europe\u2019s economy is suffering its worst downturn in decades. More details to follow... Also coming up today We get new surveys of Eurozone service sector companies, and UK building firms, this morning -- likely to confirm that output slumped at unprecedented rates in April. Later today, US payroll operator ADP will publish its monthly estimate of how many private sector jobs were created last month - and it\u2019s likely to be horrific. Economists predict that more than 20 million jobs were lost across America last month during the pandemic.

Which is why a woman in Kentucky <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200504-qjpnujrrpzdtzlxlsavkfanjie-story.html\">went viral</a> for wearing a mask \u2026 with holes cut into it for her nose and mouth to make it \u201ceasier to breathe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people are missing the point of the mask: it\u2019s not about conforming, it\u2019s about safety,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cCan you imagine if people brought this attitude to sex? \u2018Don\u2019t worry, babe, of course I used a condom.

I think what he meant to tweet was: \u2018I am completely devastated by the loss of life caused by this insidious virus. My thoughts are with the families of those who have passed. I pledge to spend every waking moment working to make sure our medical workers have the support they need and every American has access to tests. PS - congrats to Greg Gutfeld!\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s better, right? He does seem to be familiar with all the late-night shows \u2013 I\u2019ve heard that if you snort enough Adderall, you can watch four of them at once.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Antibody tests have been hailed as a key to understanding the spread of the coronavirus and even as a means of easing us out of lockdown. But what are they, and what can they tell us?</p> \n<h2><strong>Why do we need an antibody test?</strong></h2> \n<p>An antibody test is often described as the \u201chave you had it?\u201d test, as it reveals whether a person has had the coronavirus. The results are valuable for a number of reasons. At the population level, antibody tests give a picture of how widely the virus has spread. More people with antibodies means a lower risk of a second wave of infections when the lockdown is eased, since the antibodies are expected to confer at least some resistance.</p> \n<p>The number also sheds light on the lethality of the disease, giving doctors an indication of the infection fatality rate \u2013 the risk of death from picking up the virus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The tests are less helpful on the individual level, but can potentially tell who has been infected and had an immune response and who hasn\u2019t. But tests would need to become much more accurate, and the level of protection better understood, for them to be used for the much-mooted idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/immunity-passports-could-speed-up-return-to-work-after-covid-19\">immunity passports</a>\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will a test tell you if you are immune?</strong></h2> \n<p>No. The antibody test is just that \u2013 it reveals if your body has antibodies, which means you have encountered the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Speaking to MPs on the health and social care committee on Tuesday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser, said current evidence suggested the vast majority of people who have had an infection got some form of antibody response.

      "bodyText": "Antibody tests have been hailed as a key to understanding the spread of the coronavirus and even as a means of easing us out of lockdown. But what are they, and what can they tell us? Why do we need an antibody test? An antibody test is often described as the \u201chave you had it?\u201d test, as it reveals whether a person has had the coronavirus. The results are valuable for a number of reasons. At the population level, antibody tests give a picture of how widely the virus has spread. More people with antibodies means a lower risk of a second wave of infections when the lockdown is eased, since the antibodies are expected to confer at least some resistance. The number also sheds light on the lethality of the disease, giving doctors an indication of the infection fatality rate \u2013 the risk of death from picking up the virus. The tests are less helpful on the individual level, but can potentially tell who has been infected and had an immune response and who hasn\u2019t. But tests would need to become much more accurate, and the level of protection better understood, for them to be used for the much-mooted idea of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d. Will a test tell you if you are immune? No. The antibody test is just that \u2013 it reveals if your body has antibodies, which means you have encountered the coronavirus. Speaking to MPs on the health and social care committee on Tuesday, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government chief scientific adviser, said current evidence suggested the vast majority of people who have had an infection got some form of antibody response. But he said it was not yet clear whether asymptomatic cases got as strong a response. What these antibodies mean for immunity is still being unpicked. \u201cEverything suggests that you can get neutralising antibodies. Those are antibodies which protect against the disease,\u201d said Vallance. But, he added, while that means some degree of protection would be expected \u2013 whether it be reduced severity of the disease or a reduced ability to catch it \u2013 it is not yet clear what that level of protection is. \u201cWe don\u2019t know that it provides absolute immunity, and it almost certainly doesn\u2019t \u2013 it will provide some degree of protection \u2013 and the other thing that we don\u2019t know is whether it is still possible to carry the virus, even if you have got antibodies,\u201d Vallance added. That could mean an individual could be infectious to someone else despite being protected themselves. Even if there is some level of immunity, it is unclear for how long that would last. \u201cExperience from other coronaviruses suggest it may last for one, two, three years, but not for many, many years,\u201d said Vallance. How do the tests work? There are two types of antibody test, but they work on the same principle. The most reliable ones are lab-based tests called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or Elisas. The others are like pregnancy tests and can be used at home. Both contain proteins from the virus that antibodies bind to if they are present in a blood sample. The presence, and sometimes even the amount of antibodies, are detected by a colour change in the Elisa and the appearance of a line on the home test stick. How far off are widespread antibody tests?

This story somehow found its way to the Telegraph, a hawkishly pro-Conservative newspaper (and until recently the employer of the prime minister himself) more than a month after the event. Ferguson\u2019s partner visited him on 30 March and 8 April: 37 and 28 days ago respectively. Whatever the reason for this delay, the story has certainly come at a politically opportune moment: when the government should be being scrutinised about a death toll exceeding that of Italy, whose plight just weeks ago was discussed in near-apocalyptic tones.</p> <p>What public interest is there in revealing the identity of Ferguson\u2019s partner, given she is not a public figure? On the front pages of two pro-government newspapers \u2013 the<em> </em>Sun and the Daily Mail \u2013 her face looms larger than that of the scientist himself: sexism flaunted without subtlety or shame. It\u2019s mesmerising to witness their rediscovery of family values, as they engage in prurient discussion about Ferguson\u2019s partner \u2013 or \u201cmistress\u201d, as the<em> </em>Times transmits from its 1950s timewarp \u2013 and her marriage. Wait until they find out what the prime minister has been up to, because boy are they going to be livid.</p> <p>Exposing Ferguson\u2019s partner\u2019s identity may not be in the public interest, but it certainly serves a political interest. How else would we discover that \u2013 gasp! \u2013 she\u2019s on the political left, that \u2013 gasp! \u2013 she supports progressive causes such as tackling the climate emergency, that \u2013 gasp! \u2013 she\u2019s a remainer? We even discover that \u2013 find some pearls to clutch \u2013 she lives in a \u00a31.9m house with her academic husband. Full house: metropolitan remainer champagne socialist elite.</p> <p>Even a deadly pandemic cannot free us from the constraints of a culture war. Far from it, polling shows that leave supporters are most inclined to back the government\u2019s handling of this national catastrophe, while Tory Brexiters such as Iain Duncan Smith are leading the charge against a continued lockdown. Does it not suit them to portray lockdown as a remainer conspiracy, a chronic overreaction by those who brought us Project Fear?</p> <p>If they can name Ferguson\u2019s partner for the purpose of exposing her political leanings, then let me point out that the newspapers leading on this expos\u00e9 double up as de facto political campaigning arms for the Conservatives. It\u2019s their political leanings that are relevant, not those of Ferguson\u2019s partner. These newspapers are not here to speak truth to power, but to manage democracy instead.</p> <p>The day that Britain became the second worst afflicted nation in the world is a day to ask searching questions. How have we exceeded Italy\u2019s death toll, when they were taken by surprise and we were not? Why did we pursue a disastrous policy of herd immunity and hand-washing to the tune of Happy Birthday while corpses were being stuffed into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/an-unfinished-odyssey-italians-coronavirus-europe\">body bags in Lombardy</a>? How many lives would have been saved with a swifter lockdown? What is the human cost of the government failing to provide enough <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/03/nearly-half-of-british-doctors-forced-to-find-their-own-ppe-new-data-shows\">personal protective equipment</a>, having allowed stocks to be depleted by years of austerity? Was the NHS saved from collapse \u2013 as our government crows and boasts \u2013 because the pandemic was driven into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/uk-care-home-covid-19-deaths-may-be-five-times-government-estimate\">care homes</a>, with thousands of unnecessary resulting deaths? Instead of asking these questions much of the British press has chosen to whip up more fury and bile against a scientist for a personal misdemeanour. </p> <p>The polls are clear: the public are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/fearful-britons-oppose-lifting-lockdown-schools-pubs-restaurants-opinium-poll\">overwhelmingly opposed</a> to lifting lockdown, more so than any other European country. Our government has it all worked out: \u201cOur comms have been the best in Europe,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34c45068-5cc0-4356-86e9-ed71cafe6f93\">says one Conservative MP</a>. \u201cWe scared everyone shitless, but now we have to undo some of that.\u201d Could a more rational explanation not be that rather than superb comms \u2013 the government\u2019s communications strategy for the first few weeks was a farce \u2013 the public have noticed the deaths of tens of thousands of their fellow citizens and drawn rational conclusions?</p> <p>For those agitating for lockdown to be lifted fast, how convenient to take out one of the most influential opponents of lifting it too soon. To repeat, again. Our death toll is greater than anywhere else in Europe. Thousands more people are going to die in Britain. Our government has devastatingly serious questions to answer. This is what we should be talking about, not the sex life of a scientist.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. The standfirst of an earlier version referred to Britain having the worst coronavirus death rate in Europe. It is the total number of deaths which is the worst in Europe. This has been corrected.</p>",

We even discover that \u2013 find some pearls to clutch \u2013 she lives in a \u00a31.9m house with her academic husband. Full house: metropolitan remainer champagne socialist elite. Even a deadly pandemic cannot free us from the constraints of a culture war. Far from it, polling shows that leave supporters are most inclined to back the government\u2019s handling of this national catastrophe, while Tory Brexiters such as Iain Duncan Smith are leading the charge against a continued lockdown. Does it not suit them to portray lockdown as a remainer conspiracy, a chronic overreaction by those who brought us Project Fear? If they can name Ferguson\u2019s partner for the purpose of exposing her political leanings, then let me point out that the newspapers leading on this expos\u00e9 double up as de facto political campaigning arms for the Conservatives. It\u2019s their political leanings that are relevant, not those of Ferguson\u2019s partner. These newspapers are not here to speak truth to power, but to manage democracy instead. The day that Britain became the second worst afflicted nation in the world is a day to ask searching questions. How have we exceeded Italy\u2019s death toll, when they were taken by surprise and we were not? Why did we pursue a disastrous policy of herd immunity and hand-washing to the tune of Happy Birthday while corpses were being stuffed into body bags in Lombardy? How many lives would have been saved with a swifter lockdown? What is the human cost of the government failing to provide enough personal protective equipment, having allowed stocks to be depleted by years of austerity? Was the NHS saved from collapse \u2013 as our government crows and boasts \u2013 because the pandemic was driven into care homes, with thousands of unnecessary resulting deaths? Instead of asking these questions much of the British press has chosen to whip up more fury and bile against a scientist for a personal misdemeanour. The polls are clear: the public are overwhelmingly opposed to lifting lockdown, more so than any other European country. Our government has it all worked out: \u201cOur comms have been the best in Europe,\u201d says one Conservative MP. \u201cWe scared everyone shitless, but now we have to undo some of that.\u201d Could a more rational explanation not be that rather than superb comms \u2013 the government\u2019s communications strategy for the first few weeks was a farce \u2013 the public have noticed the deaths of tens of thousands of their fellow citizens and drawn rational conclusions? For those agitating for lockdown to be lifted fast, how convenient to take out one of the most influential opponents of lifting it too soon. To repeat, again. Our death toll is greater than anywhere else in Europe. Thousands more people are going to die in Britain. Our government has devastatingly serious questions to answer. This is what we should be talking about, not the sex life of a scientist. \u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. The standfirst of an earlier version referred to Britain having the worst coronavirus death rate in Europe. It is the total number of deaths which is the worst in Europe. This has been corrected.",

For those in an office space, it may mean the end of hot-desking.</p> <h2><strong>On-site temperature checks</strong></h2> <p>SafeWork acknowledges that there may be times where it is reasonable for employers to administrator temperature checks to staff when they reopen. These include situations where staff live together in accommodation, such as agricultural workers, or in workplaces where vulnerable people are, like aged care facilities.</p> <p>But on the whole, a temperature check isn\u2019t going to definitively prove someone has Covid-19, and SafeWork says \u201cthere may be little benefit\u201d. </p> <h2><strong>What do the experts say about a return to work?</strong></h2> <p>In terms of whether this is the right time for businesses to open up again, leading epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely says \u201cthere is absolutely no question\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEverything comes down to whether the goal [in Australia] is elimination or suppression [of the virus],\u201d Blakely says. \u201cAssuming we are going for suppression, then absolutely we should try and open things back up, but it should be done in tranches.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to accept there will be some low amount of community transmission, but we need to stamp those cases out as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/coronavirus-and-airborne-transmission-scientists-warn-australia-to-be-on-guard\">Coronavirus and airborne transmission: scientists warn Australia to be on guard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Dr Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University, says Safe Work\u2019s guidelines pose challenges that may deter some businesses from inviting staff back into the office.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a lot of discussion about bringing teams into offices on certain days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if there was hot-desking in place, which is the case for a lot of high corporates in Australia, there would have to be a deep cleaning done at the end of the day before the next shift comes in.

For workers such as taxi drivers, it might be physically impossible to keep a 1.5m distance between themselves and the customer. One suggestion on the Safe Work website is for taxi and ride-share drivers to install a perspex screen between the front and back seats. The end of all-staff meetings and communal lunches All non-essential gatherings, meetings and training should be postponed, cancelled or conducted via tele or video conferencing. In fact, workplaces should also try to stagger meal breaks and start times to reduce the number of workers using common spaces at the same time. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendon Murphy, said on Tuesday that staggering start and finish times could also help ease public transport congestion. \u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody crowding on public transport at the same time, we don\u2019t want everyone crowding in the lifts at the beginning of the day and the end of the day,\u201d he said. Cleaning, cleaning, cleaning Workplaces will have to be cleaned at least daily using detergent, and disinfected as needed depending on how high-traffic the area is. In retail stores, that means regularly cleaning counters, phones, Eftpos machines and even clothes racks. It may be difficult to disinfect high-contact areas multiple times in a shift; in those cases a workplace may need to limit the number of people coming into contact with that area. For taxi drivers, this may mean telling passengers not to open the doors from the outside themselves to avoid disinfecting the handle after each ride. For those in an office space, it may mean the end of hot-desking. On-site temperature checks SafeWork acknowledges that there may be times where it is reasonable for employers to administrator temperature checks to staff when they reopen. These include situations where staff live together in accommodation, such as agricultural workers, or in workplaces where vulnerable people are, like aged care facilities. But on the whole, a temperature check isn\u2019t going to definitively prove someone has Covid-19, and SafeWork says \u201cthere may be little benefit\u201d. What do the experts say about a return to work? In terms of whether this is the right time for businesses to open up again, leading epidemiologist Prof Tony Blakely says \u201cthere is absolutely no question\u201d. \u201cEverything comes down to whether the goal [in Australia] is elimination or suppression [of the virus],\u201d Blakely says. \u201cAssuming we are going for suppression, then absolutely we should try and open things back up, but it should be done in tranches. \u201cWe need to accept there will be some low amount of community transmission, but we need to stamp those cases out as quickly as we can.\u201d But Dr Libby Sander, assistant professor of organisational behaviour at Bond University, says Safe Work\u2019s guidelines pose challenges that may deter some businesses from inviting staff back into the office. \u201cThere is a lot of discussion about bringing teams into offices on certain days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if there was hot-desking in place, which is the case for a lot of high corporates in Australia, there would have to be a deep cleaning done at the end of the day before the next shift comes in. This is a significant change and cost for a lot of businesses. \u201cI also think the genie is out of the bottle that working from home is possible and we can\u2019t go back on that. We will see that people will work from home two days a week, maybe.\u201d",

For those still in work, hours worked fell from an average of 35 to 32 a week. When combined with the drop in jobs, total hours worked fell by 56.2m or 13%. The report found average household after-tax weekly income fell 9.1% from $1,795 in February to $1,632 in April. Average income per person fell from $740 a week to $663, about 10.4%. Very low income earners in the lowest decile actually experienced a 33.5% boost in incomes from $160 to $213 a week, most likely due to the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy and the doubling of the jobseeker unemployment benefit to $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement.

The report\u2019s co-author Nicholas Biddle said perceived levels of job insecurity were \u201cvery high\u201d: almost twice as high as they had been since 2001. The study found \u2013 consistent with the Guardian Essential poll \u2013 that women are more concerned about the health impact of Covid-19 and supportive of restrictions on movement. Almost four in 10 people said they feel it was either very likely (4.3%) or likely (35.2%) that they would be infected with the coronavirus in the next six months. A \u201csignificant minority\u201d of respondents (19.7%) agreed that \u201cthere has been too much unnecessary worry about the Covid-19 outbreak\u201d. Since January there were big increases in Australians\u2019 confidence in all tiers of government and the public service. Confidence in the federal government recovered from its lows during the summer bushfires, up from 27% in February to 57% in April. Trust in state and territory governments was up from 40% to 67% and the public service was up from 49% to 65%. The report argued that while Australia has \u201cdone extremely well in limiting the level of infections and deaths\u201d there was \u201cstrong initial [evidence] that this has come at the cost of deterioration in mental health and increases in psychological distress\u201d. Life satisfaction has declined from an average rating of 7.05 out of 10 in October, to 6.9 in January and then to 6.5 in April. The report estimated the decline from January to April was equivalent to a decline in income of $581 per person per week, or moving from the top 20% of income earners to the bottom third. The average decrease in life satisfaction for an 18- to 24-year-old (between January and April) was more than three times that of the average decrease for a 65- to 74-year-old, and the life satisfaction of a person 75 years and over actually increased.",

      "bodyText": "Halfway across the world, Puerto Rican scientist Daniel Col\u00f3n-Ramos watched Australian breakfast television with a growing sense of dread. The host of Channel Nine\u2019s Today Show, Karl Stefanovic, was interviewing a doctor from a small Brisbane company, Promedical Equipment, who was making extraordinary claims about its ability to supply millions of Covid-19 antibody tests to Australia each week. Promedical, virtually unheard of before the pandemic, was of sudden and immense interest to Col\u00f3n-Ramos, a Yale University cell biologist volunteering with scientific colleagues to help improve Puerto Rico\u2019s pandemic response. The company had made promises to a strange cast of intermediaries working for the Puerto Rican government, saying it was able to quickly supply large quantities of desperately needed Covid-19 antibody tests as part of a US$38m (A$59m) deal. \u201cI watched this video and this guy is being interviewed in front of a garbage truck, there was a garbage truck behind him, backing up,\u201d Col\u00f3n-Ramos tells Guardian Australia. \u201cI became worried about who was supplying these important tests to Puerto Rico, where my parents and many loved ones live.\u201d The US$38m deal was Puerto Rico\u2019s single biggest expenditure on testing. It collapsed. Promedical was never paid, no final agreement was reached, and the tests never materialised in San Juan. Puerto Rico \u2013 where testing and contact tracing was the primary strategy against Covid-19 \u2013 is now in a testing crisis. The deal\u2019s collapse, while unlikely to have been Promedical\u2019s fault, has prompted global scrutiny of the claims the company was making at the height of the pandemic. Leaked emails show it had promised Puerto Rico\u2019s intermediaries it could send large shipments of Covid-19 testing \u201con the first available lift flight\u201d as soon as it was paid. At the time, it held only a small batch of testing kits of unknown provenance in its Brisbane warehouse. Its promises were initially based on a deal to resell testing kits made by a reputable Chinese manufacturer, which collapsed without Promedical receiving the devices. When that broke down, Promedical decided to start manufacturing its own Covid-19 tests, Guardian Australia has learned. Promedical, which is headed by a convicted rapist, has no prior experience in the complex business of manufacturing diagnostic devices. The company is better known for selling erectile dysfunction, vaginal rejuvenation, massage and cryotherapy machines, and similar promises to supply the Australia government with 500,000 testing kits have not been fulfilled. All the while, Promedical\u2019s website continued to falsely claim it had regulatory approval from Australia and the US for the devices it was selling. The man managing Promedical\u2019s exports and logistics, Bradley Mayo, has now walked away from the company, saying he is uncomfortable with what he has learned about its practices. \u201cIn these unprecedented and extremely challenging times, the medical supply chain industry is volatile at best, with many opportunists who aim to use this time of crisis to \u2026 enrich themselves,\u201d he wrote in an email obtained by Guardian Australia. \u201cAfter lengthy investigation and due diligence, I have decided to distance myself from Promedical.\u201d The Puerto Rico deal In Puerto Rico, a US territory where disaster after disaster has made citizens vulnerable and social distancing difficult, comprehensive testing was its government\u2019s only viable strategy to counter Covid-19. The proposed US$38m transaction was the strategy\u2019s centrepiece. It was relying on an unusual band of characters to pull it off. The sale was brokered by the owner of a New Jersey supplement company, and the tests were to be paid for by a tiny construction firm in San Juan with ties to a former government official. The arrangement shocked experts like Col\u00f3n-Ramos. The government had placed huge reliance on antibody tests, instead of the ribonucleic acid testing favoured by much of the world, and the construction company given responsibility for finding them, Apex General Contractors, had no obvious experience in medical devices. On 26 March, the government awarded a \u201cfast track\u201d contract to Apex after representations by Juan Maldonado de Jesus, a former director of the territory\u2019s maritime authority. Local media reports suggest Maldonado submitted a brochure about the Promedical-branded tests and promised they could arrive in San Juan within five days. Promedical subsequently told the Associated Press it had not been in conversation or entered into a contract with Apex. But emails reviewed by Guardian Australia, first revealed by the local newspaper NotiCel, show Promedical told Maldonado it could dispatch 1m tests soon after payment was made. \u201cI just wanted to confirm for safety and financial purposes, given the size of the order, that Promedical was in fact working with our order, procured through your North American distributor,\u201d Maldonado wrote to Mayo from Promedical on 30 March. Mayo responded: \u201cIt is extremely hard to hold unpaid stock as we are producing for governments departments around the world. \u201cOnce remittance is received we treat all clients orders with urgency and priority. \u201cYour order will be booked on the first available lift flight by our partner DHL after payment received.\u201d Promedical: from cryotherapy to pandemic testing The Brisbane company\u2019s main business before the pandemic was selling fat-freezing technology, ultrasound vaginal rejuvenation, erectile dysfunction machines and \u201cbiohacking\u201d devices. Its founder and chief executive, Neran de Silva, is a convicted rapist and has made claims to be a doctor through his previous business, Cryo Australia. He claims on his LinkedIn page to have medical qualifications from the University of Queensland and Griffith University but neither has any record of him in their online graduate verification systems. A spokeswoman for Promedical said De Silva did not claim to be a \u201cpracticing medical doctor\u201d. Promedical has no diagnostic experience. The only approved Australian manufacturer of Covid-19 tests is AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd, a company headed by the Cambridge-educated molecular biologist and immunologist Keith Stanley. It has offices in London, Dallas and Auckland. For Promedical and its chief executive, the pandemic presented a much-needed business opportunity. Just months earlier, De Silva had lost his final appeal in Australia\u2019s high court against a rape conviction, after years in court unsuccessfully battling allegations he sexually assaulted a woman in the Brisbane suburb of Fortitude Valley in 2016. His name and affairs had been thrown into the spotlight when Guardian Australia revealed that the Australian politician Stuart Robert, now a cabinet minister, had invested in De Silva\u2019s alternative health company Cryo Australia, which treated ailments using a human-sized cooler. When Cryo Australia collapsed last year it owed more than $1.4m, liquidators said in a report to creditors, including $410,000 to a company linked to Robert and his business partner. \u2018We assumed it was authorised to sell\u2019 In March Promedical gained regulatory approval to act as a reseller of Covid-19 rapid tests made by a well-regarded manufacturer in China, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. The approval connected the company to people across the globe who were also keen to involve themselves in the coronavirus response. A company from New Jersey, 501 Nutrition, entered into an arrangement with Promedical in March to find US-based buyers for large quantities of tests supplied by the Australian company. Information supplied to Guardian Australia by 501 Nutrition\u2019s attorney indicates that Promedical had sent glossy brochures about its own branded test kits, but its documentation \u2013 sent as evidence it had approval to sell tests \u2013 related to those manufactured by Wondfo. \u201cPromedical represented that it manufactured the test kits,\u201d says Tyler Brossart, the 501 Nutrition company president. \u201cIts website and documentation from the Australian Government approving the device supported its representation. Based on Promedical\u2019s representation that it was the manufacturer, we assumed it was authorised to sell and export the device. \u201cWe had ongoing negotiations with them, mostly trying to verify if they had product, and what exactly it was. We attempted on multiple occasions to have an independent third party verify the goods, but were unable to do so. Promedical also said it sent sample kits to us (it even sent us a tracking number), but we never received any kits.\u201d Promedical disputes the description of its dealings with 501. It said 501 had made the initial approach on 28 March. \u201cPromedical issued 501 Nutrition an invoice on 31 March 2020 for the requested number of COVID-19 Rapid Test Kits [for the Puerto Rico deal], in line with the company\u2019s standard ordering process. The order was never finalised by 501 Nutrition, nor was the invoice ever paid. \u201cAs a result, the order was terminated and Promedical did not send any product to the company.\u201d Most of the parties involved in the deal have sought to blame one another for its collapse. But it appears that the reason payment was never made, and the tests were never sent, is that a bank in Puerto Rico intervened. The Oriental Bank placed a US$19m deposit from the government to Apex into escrow and froze the Puerto Rican company\u2019s account, because it had security concerns about the deal. A few days later the government cancelled the Apex contract because the tests had not materialised when they were supposed to. A shifting narrative Last week, when Guardian Australia approached Promedical about false public claims that the company had various approvals, it said tests were being delivered to it by an \u201cAustralian supplier\u201d it refused to name. This week, when the Guardian obtained evidence that it had been importing the test\u2019s main chemical reagent from South Korea, the company said it \u201cworks with a number of different suppliers\u201d but that Promedical was the ultimate manufacturer and that the \u201cfinal test\u201d was Australian. Asked whether Promedical was equipped to be making Covid-19 testing devices, given its lack of experience, a spokeswoman compared its actions to other industries pivoting their production during the pandemic. \u201cFrom aeronautical companies manufacturing ventilators and major fashion houses producing face masks, to distilleries producing hand sanitiser; there is an incredibly strong drive to support local communities wherever possible,\u201d she said. The company is not sanctioned to supply tests in Australia but is seeking regulatory approval for its own devices from the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia and from the Food and Drug Administration in the US. It has defended its attempts to sell the tests overseas based on an export-only listing on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. But all applications for export listing are placed on the register. An additional export certificate \u2013 which Promedical does not have \u2013 is required to send medical devices to most countries, excluding the US. The Therapeutic Goods Administration said: \u201cAt this stage, the TGA is yet to issue an export-only certificate to Promedical. A TGA issued export certificate is required by most importing countries. \u201cThe TGA can and will take action in relation to any reports of potential non-compliance related to any devices included in the ARTG, including export-only devices.\u201d A company spokeswoman said Promedical \u201cworks closely with all regulatory bodies in Australia and overseas, including the TGA, to make a positive impact and provide a high-quality product to assist in managing the current Covid-19 health crisis\u201d. Mayo said he had managed Promedical\u2019s logistics but had not been involved in the procurement of components or regulatory approvals. When told the TGA was investigating Promedical, and that it did not have export certificates necessary to send medical devices to most countries, Mayo said he was \u201cjust dumbfounded\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide, I\u2019m just doing the logistical side of it,\u201d he said. Profiting from the pandemic Promedical\u2019s interactions in Puerto Rico have brought into focus the at-times murky business of the pandemic. Covid-19 rapid test kits such as those marketed by Promedical can retail for $40 a test. The Puerto Rico government\u2019s deal was to buy them for about US$38 from Apex. The local newspaper El Nuevo D\u00eda reported that the same tests were normally available on the international market for less than US$10. The public health emergency has created an overwhelming demand for tests and at the same time forced regulators to relax usually stringent reviews of new products and issue emergency approvals. But before the tests get to where they are needed, in some circumstances up to six companies are taking a cut. These include manufacturers, exporters, agents, freight firms and suppliers. Nowhere is the impact of this convoluted wheeling and dealing more stark than in Puerto Rico. The island now has the lowest testing rate of any US state or territory. The Puerto Rico legislature is now holding a formal inquiry into the saga. Col\u00f3n-Ramos says Puerto Ricans are seething. \u201cThey were preying on the most vulnerable time in our history to make a dime,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just unforgivable.\u201d",

Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee.</p> <p>\u201cThat was our much-lauded funding mix,\u201d Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. \u201cAnd before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn\u2019t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding.

      "bodyText": "The announcement on Monday that Sydney\u2019s Carriageworks had entered voluntary administration came as a shock for an arts community already in brace position. \u201cIt\u2019s the first big announcement like this but I can tell you now, it won\u2019t be the last,\u201d says Esther Anatolitis, executive director of the National Association of Visual Arts. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right across Australia is a total loss of self-generated income for galleries. As yet, there\u2019s no strategy looking at how to financially support galleries so that they will be able to survive and reopen.\u201d Carriageworks has been one of the jewels of Sydney\u2019s performance and exhibition venues since 2007, hosting some of the largest-scale art installations seen in Australia at its historic 50-hectare site at the Eveleigh rail yard complex. It served as a hub for festivals and provided a home to leading arts companies. The organisation had its income projections for the current financial year trashed as the coronavirus crisis unfurled, with big-ticket events cancelled or suspended. The decision to enter into administration was sealed when the New South Wales government \u2013 which currently does not have an arts minister after the recent resignation of Don Harwin \u2013 declined to guarantee future funding. Rumours are swirling about a possible takeover of the venue by the Sydney Opera House. But Carriageworks\u2019 exposure to commercial headwinds is no greater than many others in the sector, says Anatolitis. The Covid-19 shutdown has come hard on the heels of cuts to Australia Council funding and a summer of bushfires that had an impact on gallery attendance and operations, most notably in Canberra. All galleries Australia-wide are closed until further notice. Most if not all are taking considerable financial hits while continuing to manage multimillion-dollar collections and maintain a level of community outreach. Regional galleries have been hard hit by drought, fire and the resulting loss of tourist traffic. \u201cThere\u2019s barely been time to recover from that and now we have a global pandemic for which there is no treatment and no vaccine,\u201d Anatolitis says. Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art has accessed the jobkeeper scheme in order to maintain its staff, says its director, Liz Ann Macgregor. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lifeline,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to tell you of the scenarios we were working through before jobkeeper was announced. All I can say is that they were truly horrible.\u201d Government funding accounts for about 25% of the MCA\u2019s budget, says Macgregor. The rest comes from venue hire (including weddings and corporate events), the museum\u2019s retail and caf\u00e9 operations, and philanthropy. Apart from special exhibits, the MCA does not charge an entrance fee. \u201cThat was our much-lauded funding mix,\u201d Macgregor says with an exasperated laugh. \u201cAnd before this crisis, everyone thought that was a great thing. Even the GFC didn\u2019t impact us very much. But this time, 40% of our income vanished overnight. It throws into question the whole orthodoxy of that kind of funding. Those of us who developed really good business models are particularly suffering, much more so than the institutions who get 60, 70, 80% of their funding from government.\u201d The MCA\u2019s philanthropic community has been supportive. \u201cActually, they\u2019ve been fantastic, telling us that they understand we can\u2019t use the money in the way we wanted to but to please spend it to keep the museum going,\u201d Macgregor says, adding that she has ruled out bringing back an admission fee for the MCA. As it stands, access to the jobkeeper scheme is not an option for Australia\u2019s local council, university or state-owned institutions. \u201cOur permanent full-time and temporary staff continue to work behind the scenes while our doors are closed to the public,\u201d says Michael Brand, director of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. \u201cDuring this period we have also sought to retain and redeploy a number of our regular casuals within the gallery.\u201d Adelaide\u2019s Art Gallery of South Australia is in a similar position. \u201cWe\u2019re doing all we can to look after our small number of casuals, some of whom are assisting us to deliver our online programs,\u201d says Rhana Devenport, AGSA\u2019s director, adding that permanent and contract staff had been asked to exhaust all leave entitlements. Like all arts and entertainment enterprises, Australia\u2019s art galleries are keenly awaiting updated advice on social distancing. Galleries, says Anatolitis, are in a far better position to reopen in the next few months than theatres and concert venues. \u201cGalleries are, almost by definition, controlled environments. We can absolutely control the number of people in a space and when we walk into a gallery we don\u2019t generally stand close to other people because art demands, quite often, a deep and solitary response.\u201d Until physical reopening is permitted, galleries and museums nationwide are increasing their digital footprints in order to maintain connections with their communities and artists. The MCA has a virtual tour of its Sydney Biennale exhibition, the Art Gallery of NSW has Together in Art, and the National Gallery of Victoria has virtual tours, including jumping early on digitising its blockbuster Haring/Basquiat (resulting in more than 50,000 online views so far), and the AGSA has a raft of podcasts and talks around 2020 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art: Monster Theatres. Devenport says despite AGSA expanding further into digital, there is much more to be done in what is \u201can extraordinarily challenging time\u201d. She says what\u2019s needed now is a political strategy that puts the arts at the centre of the population\u2019s long-term wellbeing. Brand agrees: \u201cArt museums will have to play a greater role than ever to support and assist our art communities to survive the pandemic, recover, then thrive again in the long term. This will require enormous action. Some of our initial actions now might be quite small in scale but they will set the tone for what will follow.\u201d Macgregor believes it is important to keep art galleries and museums afloat for economic as well as cultural reasons. \u201cWhen all this is over, there is going to be a huge growth in domestic tourism and galleries and museums are real drivers in that market. [State] borders are going to open again and all those people who normally go overseas and spend money \u2013 something like $6bn \u2013 are going to be here and we want to grab some of that, but the museums are going to have to work together,\u201d she says. \u201cCultural tourists spend three times as much as other tourists, so for the sake of the economy, we need a stimulus package that will allow organisations like ours to reopen.\u201d",

To help weather the Covid-19 storm, the AFL has had assets up its sleeve, a future fund worth $120m and half a billion in bank-supplied credit. So while the cash-strapped NRL has been rabid in its push to resume competition, the AFL has allowed events to take their natural course before making its move. It is a luxury that granted it a high ground of sorts. Where the NRL invited censure for its plans to resume when public restrictions were still broadly in place, the AFL stayed comfortably out of the headlines.</p> <p>Not that one can imagine the ARLC chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, giving a jot about who might be winning the popularity contest. Indeed, in some ways, the AFL is indebted to the NRL\u2019s bulldozer tactics. By announcing a 28 May return, largely without the buy-in of health authorities or governments, the NRL hastened talk of logistics and health protocols that otherwise might have been some time coming. It got Scott Morrison talking sport. Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Queensland premier who barely weeks ago was considered a stumbling block in the NRL\u2019s roadmap, got on board and rubber-stamped the NRL proposal when opening borders last week. <br><br>And now, with pathways endorsed, the AFL is in the process of showing its hand. McLachlan has already briefed clubs about a probable return to playing in June, with specifics about dates, competition structure and biosecurity measures to be announced once the national cabinet has reviewed restrictions on Friday. With interstate travel now on the table, the AFL\u2019s initial plan to play out the season in hubs seems less likely. \u201cThere is now optionality for us in what lies ahead,\u201d McLachlan said. \u201cIt remains early days, but the fly in, fly out possibility would have advantage.\u201d</p> <p>Keeping everyone happy, however, is proving to be another challenge altogether. Although outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people are now permitted in most states, the AFL last week decreed that no club would be allowed to train in groups larger than two until the Victorian government followed suit.</p> <p>Although the move was generally accepted, it reignited the old debate about an apparent pro-Victoria bias at AFL headquarters. \u201cI sort of get where the AFL\u2019s coming from,\u201d the Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff told the ABC. \u201cThe ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it\u2019s generally got a bias towards Victorian teams.\u201d </p> <p>Rockliff\u2019s teammate Travis Boak added: \u201cI think some things certainly need to change to make sure interstate clubs are looked after a little bit better. The biggest thing that\u2019s been talked about is the games the Victorian clubs have at home at the MCG, the big run they have. The amount of travel [that] interstate clubs have becomes pretty taxing, and I think that needs to be looked at a little bit more.\u201d</p> <p>Even the AFL\u2019s plan for a three-week pre-season has been called into question. When clubs are allowed to train in groups of 10, this will see them progress to level B restrictions: skills and fitness work, but with no physical contact. Full training and competition can only commence once the government allows athletes to progress to level C. </p> <p>\u201cYou are going to get athletes who are sore and you will lose guys,\u201d said the Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley, who feels three weeks is insufficient. \u201cIf time allows, and I think it does, I think a couple of weeks at that level B and three at level C. If it came in at level C straight away, then three weeks, four weeks might be enough but I believe slowly ramping it up, or more gradually ramping it up, is going to be important to look after the players and still get the product out at the end.\u201d</p> <p>And then, of course, there is the playing group itself. The oblivious element in both the AFL and NRL has already shown it is quite capable of scuppering best-laid plans and placing the recovery effort in jeopardy. To a man, they will have to do all that\u2019s required to get the show back on the road and keep it there. There will be no leeway, no room for lapses of judgment. McLachlan is well placed to bring footy back next month, but everything will need to fall neatly in place at a time when tomorrow is a long way away.</p>",

Where the NRL invited censure for its plans to resume when public restrictions were still broadly in place, the AFL stayed comfortably out of the headlines. Not that one can imagine the ARLC chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, giving a jot about who might be winning the popularity contest. Indeed, in some ways, the AFL is indebted to the NRL\u2019s bulldozer tactics. By announcing a 28 May return, largely without the buy-in of health authorities or governments, the NRL hastened talk of logistics and health protocols that otherwise might have been some time coming. It got Scott Morrison talking sport. Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Queensland premier who barely weeks ago was considered a stumbling block in the NRL\u2019s roadmap, got on board and rubber-stamped the NRL proposal when opening borders last week. And now, with pathways endorsed, the AFL is in the process of showing its hand. McLachlan has already briefed clubs about a probable return to playing in June, with specifics about dates, competition structure and biosecurity measures to be announced once the national cabinet has reviewed restrictions on Friday. With interstate travel now on the table, the AFL\u2019s initial plan to play out the season in hubs seems less likely. \u201cThere is now optionality for us in what lies ahead,\u201d McLachlan said. \u201cIt remains early days, but the fly in, fly out possibility would have advantage.\u201d Keeping everyone happy, however, is proving to be another challenge altogether. Although outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people are now permitted in most states, the AFL last week decreed that no club would be allowed to train in groups larger than two until the Victorian government followed suit. Although the move was generally accepted, it reignited the old debate about an apparent pro-Victoria bias at AFL headquarters. \u201cI sort of get where the AFL\u2019s coming from,\u201d the Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff told the ABC. \u201cThe ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it\u2019s generally got a bias towards Victorian teams.\u201d Rockliff\u2019s teammate Travis Boak added: \u201cI think some things certainly need to change to make sure interstate clubs are looked after a little bit better. The biggest thing that\u2019s been talked about is the games the Victorian clubs have at home at the MCG, the big run they have. The amount of travel [that] interstate clubs have becomes pretty taxing, and I think that needs to be looked at a little bit more.\u201d Even the AFL\u2019s plan for a three-week pre-season has been called into question. When clubs are allowed to train in groups of 10, this will see them progress to level B restrictions: skills and fitness work, but with no physical contact. Full training and competition can only commence once the government allows athletes to progress to level C. \u201cYou are going to get athletes who are sore and you will lose guys,\u201d said the Collingwood coach Nathan Buckley, who feels three weeks is insufficient. \u201cIf time allows, and I think it does, I think a couple of weeks at that level B and three at level C. If it came in at level C straight away, then three weeks, four weeks might be enough but I believe slowly ramping it up, or more gradually ramping it up, is going to be important to look after the players and still get the product out at the end.\u201d And then, of course, there is the playing group itself. The oblivious element in both the AFL and NRL has already shown it is quite capable of scuppering best-laid plans and placing the recovery effort in jeopardy. To a man, they will have to do all that\u2019s required to get the show back on the road and keep it there. There will be no leeway, no room for lapses of judgment. McLachlan is well placed to bring footy back next month, but everything will need to fall neatly in place at a time when tomorrow is a long way away.",

It\u2019s a figure so large it is hard to grasp. And as always with unemployment, the losses are not evenly spread. In every economic downturn, younger workers suffer the worst and the job losses recede until you get to workers close to retirement, whereupon the numbers rise again: Younger workers inevitably have less attachment to any job than older workers, they are usually less skilled and are therefore easier to replace when things pick up again. But while previous recessions have seen massive falls in the number of youth employed, nothing compares to what we are seeing now: If the employment numbers flow through at the same level as these latest job figures do, it will mean there is now a lower percentage of teenagers with a job than has ever been recorded. The GFC saw a massive shift in our working life \u2013 the plunge in teenagers employed continued to fall as many departed the labour force and stayed in school. Since the middle of 2017 there had been an increase in youth employed, mostly due to an increase in those no longer in school getting a job. But that 18 months increase and more has been lost in four weeks. The loss has also been much larger for female teenagers \u2013 a 21.5% fall compared to a 13.3% drop for males. The reason why youth and women in general have suffered larger losses of work is because of the industries that have been hammered by closures. If we are to find any sliver of good news in these latest figures it is that in the middle of April, for the first time in six weeks, the number of jobs in the accommodation and food services industry did not fall. The bad news is that this is the case because there was hardly anyone left to lose their job. There are now 33% fewer jobs in that sector than there was a month ago. The arts and recreation sector, which continues to lose jobs at a stunning rate, has a workforce that is 27% smaller than it was in March, while the \u201cother services\u201d sector, which includes health and beauty service workers, fell 12%. And the thing about those three industries is they all feature much higher levels of young workers than others. A quarter of those working in the accommodation and food services sector are teenagers, as are 1 in 10 of workers in the arts and recreation sector. The only high employer of youth not in the top six of industries to lose jobs was the retail sector. But even here, while there have not been losses in supermarkets and food retailing, the latest retail sales figures show massive falls among other sectors such as clothing and department stores. And while it is clear that young workers have taken the economic hit on the chin, let us not pretend things are fine for others. Nearly 12% of people in their 20s have lost work in the past month \u2013 with the number of men in their 20s in work now lower than ever recorded, and the level of women with a job back to that of the early 1990s: While the situation is less dire for those in their 30s and 40s, who are more likely to be starting or raising a family and hoping to buy their first home, it is still terrible.

In short, Ferguson\u2019s intervention may have been directly responsible for saving thousands of lives.</p> <p>Even more significantly, the UK, with already the highest death toll in Europe, needs all the expertise it can get in dealing with the next stages of the pandemic.</p> <p>Clearly, the scientist made a huge error of judgement.

Despite suffering himself, he worked tirelessly and his group\u2019s research had a major impact on the handling of the epidemic.</p> <p>Ferguson\u2019s resignation from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) because of a breach of the physical distancing rules shows him to be a man of honour who does not wish his error to get in the way of the UK\u2019s fight against the coronavirus.</p> <p>Contrast this with the behaviour of Boris Johnson, a man significantly lacking in honour, who boasted about gladhanding everyone, whether infected or not \u2013 and subsequently suffered the consequences.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s attitude throughout his career resembles that of Sir John Falstaff (Henry IV Part 1): \u201cWhat is honour? A word \u2026 I\u2019ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.\u201d</p> <p>Do we want to live in a country led by Boris Falstaff? No, we do not. He should resign or be replaced immediately.<br><strong>Dr Chris Newall</strong><br><em>Ealing, London</em></p> <p>\u2022 The furore over Neil Ferguson being visited by his girlfriend, and Matt Hancock\u2019s response, reek of hypocrisy.

      "bodyText": "Matt Hancock said he was \u201cspeechless\u201d to hear that Neil Ferguson had broken lockdown rules (Hancock says he backs any police action against Ferguson, 6 May). However, the Imperial College scientist\u2019s warning that 250,000 people could die without a lockdown is widely credited as being the catalyst for Boris Johnson\u2019s belated but necessary decision to take more drastic Covid-19 action. In short, Ferguson\u2019s intervention may have been directly responsible for saving thousands of lives. Even more significantly, the UK, with already the highest death toll in Europe, needs all the expertise it can get in dealing with the next stages of the pandemic. Clearly, the scientist made a huge error of judgement. But he is only human. Surely he deserves a second chance. Joe McCarthy Dublin, Ireland \u2022 Re your report (Neil Ferguson: UK coronavirus adviser resigns after breaking lockdown rules, 5 May), Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s epidemiological modelling played a major part in moving government policy away from the misguided \u201cherd immunity\u201d scenario. Despite suffering himself, he worked tirelessly and his group\u2019s research had a major impact on the handling of the epidemic. Ferguson\u2019s resignation from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) because of a breach of the physical distancing rules shows him to be a man of honour who does not wish his error to get in the way of the UK\u2019s fight against the coronavirus. Contrast this with the behaviour of Boris Johnson, a man significantly lacking in honour, who boasted about gladhanding everyone, whether infected or not \u2013 and subsequently suffered the consequences. Johnson\u2019s attitude throughout his career resembles that of Sir John Falstaff (Henry IV Part 1): \u201cWhat is honour? A word \u2026 I\u2019ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon. And so ends my catechism.\u201d Do we want to live in a country led by Boris Falstaff? No, we do not. He should resign or be replaced immediately. Dr Chris Newall Ealing, London \u2022 The furore over Neil Ferguson being visited by his girlfriend, and Matt Hancock\u2019s response, reek of hypocrisy. The Scottish chief medical officer had to resign after visiting a country home. Boris Johnson went to hospital from No 10. And when discharged he went off to his second home (Chequers). I suggest we need Ferguson more than Johnson. Prof Adrian Renton Emeritus professor of public health medicine, Institute for Health and Human Development, University of East London \u2022 The Daily Telegraph considers it right that the adviser admitting to breaching regulations should immediately resign. Why doesn\u2019t it hold its long-term columnist Boris Johnson to the same standard when he has boasted of flouting regulations on more than one occasion? Angela Barton Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Hertfordshire \u2022 You report Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s 20 years\u2019 experience in modelling epidemics including foot and mouth disease, Sars, swine flu, Mers, Ebola and Zika (Report, 5 May), but omit his 2005 forecast that up to 200 million people could be killed by an imminent bird flu pandemic. The World Health Organization reports that to date the cumulative total of deaths from bird flu is 455. Dr John Doherty Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire",

We are, of course, making our own preparations to ensure that the interests of the people of Wales remain paramount.\u201d Sturgeon\u2019s spokesman hinted at growing frustration in Edinburgh about the lack of consultation from No 10 about Johnson\u2019s proposals, and implied a clear split was emerging. \u201cIf there is to be a four-nations approach, and for it to be meaningful, it has to take into account all four nations. If the preference is to go in lockstep, to do things in a coordinated fashion whereby all four nations of the UK move more or less in unison, obviously all four have to be ready,\u201d he said. The Scottish and Welsh governments are heavily dependent on the UK government for emergency funding and the scientific expertise needed to fight the pandemic, but there have been differences in approach between the Scottish, Welsh and UK governments during the crisis. Sturgeon was first to announce a ban on large gatherings over 500 people and unlike the UK government has made clear she does not expect Scottish schools to reopen until August. The Welsh suggested schools might slowly reopen before the UK government floated that in England.",

Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster.<strong> <br></strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures.</strong> A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration.</li> \n   <li><strong>The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded.</strong> The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders.</strong> The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. </strong>The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased.</li> \n   <li><strong>The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said.</strong> The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. </li> \n   <li><strong>And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules.</strong> The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken.

Some new research from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the figure may be much higher than people assume.</p> \n  <p>The researchers looked at data from the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where eventually 80% of passengers and staff were tested. Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic.</p> \n  <p>The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/asymp-transmission.html\">here</a>, and a press release <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/almost-75-people-board-diamond-princess-covid-19-may-have-been-asymptomatic\">here</a>. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case.</p> \n   <p>Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns.

The cabinet will meet, as usual, tomorrow. But the spokesman also said that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that cabinet would meet at the weekend. And he indicated that Cobra, the committee that includes representatives of the devolved administrations, would also meet shortly before the announcement gets made by Boris Johnson on Sunday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to comment on reports suggesting that the government may abandon its \u201cStay home\u201d slogan at the weekend, replacing it with another message consistent with the lockdown starting to ease.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that, when Boris Johnson set a new testing target in the Commons of 200,000 tests by the end of May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f#block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f\">12.12pm)</a>, the target applied to testing capacity</strong>.

But the spokesman said the actual target referred to by Johnson at PMQs this afternoon just covered capacity, not actual tests. In recent weeks daily capacity for testing almost always been significantly higher than the number of tests actually carried out. The spokesman said the target also covered antibody testing, which looks at whether people have had the virus, as well as the antigen testing, which looks at whether people have the virus. The current figures only cover antigen testing because a reliable antibody test for use at home is not yet available.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Prof Neil Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</strong> But he said that others from Imperial College contribute to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The spokesman said that the government wanted Imperial\u2019s \u201cinvaluable work\u201d to continue to be available to it. The spokesman also said that Johnson thought Ferguson had taken the right decision to resign from Sage, and that the social distancing rules were there for a purpose.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Ferguson\u2019s resignation exposed double standards over the social distancing rules.</strong> There have been claims that Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Johnson himself have both broken these rules, because <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/10/robert-jenrick-pressure-quit-claim-mansion-family-home-called/\">Jenrick left London with his family to stay in a home in the country</a>, and Johnson and his fiancee stayed at Chequers after Johnson come out of hospital. The spokesman said that Jenrick was just travelling to rejoin his family, and that Johnson went to Chequers on the advice of his doctors.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that when Johnson spoke at PMQs about a a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes, he was referring to death rates falling.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenrick, the housing secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, will also be appearing.

But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time.</p> \n  <p>As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering.</p> \n  <p>Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE.</p> \n  <p>In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504993/You-were-the-future-once.html\">how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d</a> \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd/0_110_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:25:22.222Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a8438f0898654cef9874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:06:38.336Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a69e8f0898654cef9856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:00:50.043Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector.</p> \n  <p><strong> National Records of Scotland</strong>, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad#block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad\">12.22.</a>).</p> \n  <p>That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places.

She told PA that racist behaviour and comments are \u201cjust a day-to-day reality for Chinese people and the pandemic has made it a lot worse\u201d. She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s escalated, it\u2019s immediately more threatening.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019m a professional woman, I\u2019m 41 years old, I work in the City of London.

And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. </p> \n   <p>This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge.</p> \n   <p>Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb293048f0898654cef96e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:42:27.872Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese in Britain 'too scared to venture out alone' amid rising levels of anti-Asian racism</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned.</p> \n  <p>Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola. Reported experiences ranged from casual jokes to violent attacks and death threats, with people left too frightened to venture out alone and children ridiculed by their peers, 29 in-depth interviews with people of east Asian heritage revealed.</p> \n  <p>Kandola told the PA news agency that some people who have lived in the UK their whole life are questioning \u201cwhether people of Chinese heritage will ever be accepted as British\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Just over half of the 412 people surveyed said they had experienced an increase in discrimination during the Covid-19 outbreak. Three in 10 said they had witnessed or experienced discrimination at work, while 37% said they had experienced this outside the office. </p> \n  <p>One woman, an NHS doctor who works in her local hospital\u2019s respiratory unit, said she has stopped her daily morning jog because of the abuse. Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him. One respondent told Kandola:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nearly every British-born Chinese person I\u2019ve spoken to is genuinely very shocked about what has happened. They are British, have lived all their lives in Britain and yet they feel like outsiders now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Prof Kandola said society has an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour when the UK eases lockdown measures. Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene.</p> \n   <p>We are actually better than this.

And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved.</p> \n  <p>Asked by the presenter <strong>Kay Burley</strong> if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can imagine what my views are.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/\">which broke the story</a>, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved.</p> \n  <p>However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e/240_3_1487_892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sky news</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:24:52.239Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb27b6e8f085c470051f0da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T09:05:05.916Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime.

Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this.

Yes.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir Patrick Vallance</strong> told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial.</p> \n   <p>And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brokenshire defended the decision <strong>not to close UK borders</strong> in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time.</p> \n   <p>Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Brokenshire, the security minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Brokenshire, the security minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:51:05.259Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26a948f085c470051f052\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:45:22.478Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson right to step down, says minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Security Minister <strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will present his plan to begin easing lockdown measures on Sunday, with aspects to come into effect on Monday. The cabinet and Cobra will meet over the weekend to agree a plan before the prime minister makes the announcement; he will make a statement to the Commons on Monday. Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster. Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures. A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration. The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded. The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher. Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders. The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls. No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running. The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity. Later, Robert Jenrick told the daily press briefing that 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday. Rising levels of racism towards people of east Asian heritage have left many feeling too scared to venture out when the lockdown is eventually lifted, research suggests. The survey by Prof Binna Kandola found that just over half of respondents had experienced an increase in discrimination since the pandemic began, with Chinese people reporting being coughed at, attacked, mocked and abused. Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased. The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said. The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules. The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken. Downing Street confirmed Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side for today. Thank you to everybody who got in touch and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coronavirus coverage, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. This is from the statistician David Spiegelhalter. It all started when the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, praised \u201can excellent article in today\u2019s Guardian\u201d last week. Boris Johnson also referenced it in today\u2019s PMQs when Keir Starmer asked how we had reached a stage where the UK had the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe. Here are the main points from the press conference. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, announced the latest daily headline coronavirus death figures. Another 649 deaths have been recorded, taking the UK total to 30,076. These figures cover people who have tested positive for coronavirus and died in any setting (not just in hospital). As this Worldometer chart shows, the UK is the first country in Europe to record more than 30,000 deaths. But the official UK figures do not cover the many people who have died from coronavirus without a test. Jamie Jenkins, a former ONS statistician who has been modelling what the overall figure for excess deaths related to coronavirus might be, says his latest estimate is 54,475. Jenrick confirmed that the government has again missed its target on testing. He said 69,463 coronavirus tests were conducted yesterday. That means that for the last four days the government has failed to meet the 100,000 a day target set for the end of April, and for the last three days the number of tests has been falling, not rising. (See 6.04pm.) He claimed that councils have had more money from central government so far than they have said they need to meet the costs of coronavirus. Repeatedly stressing his commitment to ensure they get the help they required, he said: In terms of ensuring that councils get the resources they need, we are absolutely committed to doing that. Councils are receiving more money, so far, than they have reported to us as needing to meet the Covid-related costs that they are bearing. He hinted that, as the lockdown starts to ease, the government may reimpose micro lockdowns, in particular areas where coronavirus starts to spread rapidly again. Asked if the lockdown would be lifted in some areas first, he replied: Our strong preference is that the whole country moves as one. But if, as we build up our infrastructure for testing and tracking and tracing, in time it is required for us to make interventions in smaller micro communities where you are seeing the virus take hold again, then that will be something that we consider as other countries around the world have done when they have implemented effective track-and-trace systems. But that is very quite different from making major changes to lockdown measures in one part of the country versus another. He said the government did not believe school staff needed PPE. He said: We\u2019ve taken scientific advice with respect to the level of PPE required in schools. As I understand it, the advice is that staff in non-residential education settings don\u2019t require PPE but we will obviously keep that under close review. The former Tory chancellor George Osborne told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM he thought tax rises were inevitable amid reports Rishi Sunak is working on plans to \u201cwean\u201d Britain off the furlough scheme. He said that as the crisis has made Britain poorer, the government would be forced into a choice between reducing public services or increasing taxes, adding: Yes, you can borrow in the short term and of course, we\u2019re borrowing vast amounts, now. That is not sustainable in the medium term. It\u2019s not a problem for now and it\u2019s not necessarily problem for this year. But ultimately, the government will have to set out a credible fiscal path to try and get the deficit down to stop the debt rising so quickly. And that will have elements of spending constraints and tax increases. The Labour party just sent out a press release with this statement from the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth. He says: Far from delivering on the promise of 100,000 completed tests a day, testing numbers have now fallen three days in a row. A test, trace and isolate strategy is crucial to tackling this virus. Ministers needs to explain why the number of tests being completed daily is falling rather than rising. Q: Will the funding still be available to improve places like Bradford after this is over? Jenrick says the government remains committed to this agenda. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: Final-year student nurses have not had bursaries. But they are now on the frontline dealing with coronavirus. Is that fair? And would you back a campaign to support this? Jenrick says the government is very grateful to nursing and midwifery students who have joined the frontline. They will get salaries and pensions appropriate for their level. And their student loans will continue if they have opted to start work early. Q: Sir Patrick Vallance hinted this week that some areas of the country might come out of lockdown sooner. If that were to happen, what help would the police get to deal with the influx of people? Jenrick says the police are getting the support they need. Doyle says the contact-tracing process being introduced will ensure that people with symptoms get isolated quickly. This scheme is essential to allow ordinary life to resume. Q: [From Cornwall Live and the Western Morning News] Hoteliers and others fear they will lose the whole season if they do not reopen by July. What can you do to help? Jenrick says he understands this. He says measures to help businesses announced by the Treasury have helped. Cornwall council has been one of the best in the country at getting grants out. He says the PM has said that if further interventions are required to help a sector, the government will consider that. Q: Will PPE be introduced in schools? Jenrick says the government has taken advice on this. But the advice has been that staff in non-residential settings do not need PPE, he says. Doyle says getting the confidence of parents and children will be critical. She says there has been a lot of debate about face masks. They are probably helpful in protecting others if the wearer is infected. But face masks alone are not enough. Good hygiene is essential. There are issues like how schools are cleaned, and spacing, to be considered. She says the government is working intensely on this, and look at what is happening in other countries. On testing, this is from my colleague Anushka Asthana. Q: Might you lift lockdown restrictions later in places like the north-east? Jenrick says the PM will address this on Sunday. But the government\u2019s \u201cstrong preference\u201d is for the UK to move as one, he says. However, he suggests that if specific measures were need to prevent a recurrence in particular places, the government might re-impose measures locally. Here is Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, on the latest testing figures. (See 5.09pm.) My colleague Rowena Mason has the full story here: Jenrick says he thinks the money given to councils so far is sufficient to meet their immediate needs. But the government will work with them to make sure they have what they need. He says they should continue to do essential work. And the government will then work with them to understand what the extra costs will be. Q: [From BBC Yorkshire] What is the government doing to make sure that people who need vital operations can get them? Kanani says in recent months the NHS had to focus on coronavirus, and essential treatments. But now it is getting back to normal services. Q: [From BBC West Midlands] The PM said councils would get extra help. But it looks as if that won\u2019t be enough. Birmingham council has extra costs of more than \u00a3260m. The council says essential services will get cut if they don\u2019t get more help. Jenrick says the government has promised to give them what they want. It has already committed \u00a33.2bn, he says. In the West Midlands councils are getting \u00a3347m, he says. If further resources are required, the government will consider this, he says. Q: But will the extra money get through to each council. A council like Shropshire says it has not had enough. And town councils say the money does not filter down. Jenrick says the government is committed to helping councils. He says councils have had more money than they need to meet their Covid costs. Jenrick takes a question from Emma from Swansea. She says sport seems to have been prioritised over religion. When will people be free to worship again? Jenrick says this has been a difficult time for faith groups. But he says it is right to stick to the medical advice to protect others. The government is talking to faith leaders about recommencing services when the time is right. But that time is not now, he says. But he says his department has issued guidance allowing people to hold funerals with small numbers of family members present. He says it was \u201cnot right\u201d that some families were not allowed to attend funerals. Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, is now presenting the daily slides. Here is the chart of testing, showing the 100,000 tests per day target has again been missed. Here is the crude global death comparison slide. This one is shown every day. And here is the chart showing global comparisons on a per head basis. (Even on this chart, the UK\u2019s performance is poor. Of the countries featured, only Spain comes out worse.) Doyle says it takes time to get the figures that allow a fair comparison. She says it may take a year before the data is available. Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, is speaking now. She says she is a GP. She says she wants to thank people for following the government advice. Primary care services are still there for people, she says. There may be more telephone calls or online consultations. But the NHS is still there, she says. Jenrick says this week the government has announced funding to allow councils to help small businesses. Referring to VE day, he says events will have to be marked at home on Friday. He recalls speaking to a veteran who said, just as we recovered from the second world war, we will recover again. Jenrick says coronavirus won\u2019t hold back the government\u2019s commitment to levelling up. He says Boris Johnson will set out on Sunday how the government will move ahead. Jenrick says his department will help local communities recover. He says they are looking at how public transport can be made safer. And they are looking at what can be done to make it easier for people to walk or cycle to work, he says. Jenrick is starting now. He says 69,463 tests were carried out yesterday. That means that for the fourth day in a row the government has missed the target of 100,000 tests per day. And he says there have been a further 649 deaths, taking the UK total to 30,076. This figure represents the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus and who have died. It will be an understatement, because there will also be people who have died from coronavirus without being tested. Here is the government dashboard with the latest figures. A millionaire mayor who lives in a stately home and who was criticised for closing his town\u2019s parks amid the pandemic has announced they will be reopened on VE Day. Andy Preston, who ran a hedge fund and a charity before he was elected as an independent in Middlesbrough, previously said he was right to lock the gates in three major parks, saying the town had been officially found to be the most vulnerable to coronavirus in the country. But since then, Preston, who owns a grade-II listed mansion with extensive grounds near Northallerton, North Yorkshire, has announced the parks will be opened again from Friday on a trial basis. The mayor said on Twitter that the time was right to make the change, due to it being VE Day and with the \u201capparent levelling of infection rates\u201d. He said play areas would remain off limits, but the \u201cbeautiful scenery\u201d was open. The Labour MP for Middlesbrough Andy McDonald had earlier told the Guardian some of the town\u2019s parks could fit within the grounds of the mayor\u2019s mansion, adding: He can enjoy that, but people living in small terraced houses, they can\u2019t get their lungs breathing in a pleasant environment. And the local government minister Simon Clarke, the Tory MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, had written to all councils urging them to keep parks open. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is taking the government\u2019s press conference. It is due to start around now. He will be appearing with Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England. And since we are looking at what academics are saying, this is worth flagging up. It is from Oxford University\u2019s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and it presents the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales in the form of what it calls a Florence Nightingale diagram (because she presented data in a similar way). The idea is that presenting death figures in a radial form like this makes it easier to spot variations from the seasonal norm. Key workers in the frontline battle against Covid-19 should be paid a real living wage, the archbishop of York has told the Lords. The Rt Rev John Sentamu said the current coronavirus crisis had underlined the need to recognise and value the UK\u2019s key workers, and that paying them at least a real living wage would be a \u201clitmus test\u201d for a fair recovery after the lockdown. Opening a virtual debate, the archbishop, who chaired the Living Wage Commission, said it was \u201cshocking\u201d that child poverty had not been the number one priority in the \u201cunprecedented package of support\u201d announced by the chancellor. He said: The coronavirus national emergency is already exposing the inadequacy of the safety net provided by our social security system. People not previously reliant on the system were now finding how \u201cmean\u201d it was and the crisis would hopefully lead to a more generous and compassionate system, he added. The real living wage would provide an hourly rate of \u00a39.30 across the UK and \u00a310.75 in London. Sentamu said higher pay would benefit not just workers but businesses and allow the country to \u201cbounce back better\u201d from the pandemic. One of the major unknowns in relation to coronavirus is how many people get the virus but remain asymptomatic. Some new research from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the figure may be much higher than people assume. The researchers looked at data from the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where eventually 80% of passengers and staff were tested. Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic. The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline here, and a press release here. Here\u2019s an extract. The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case. Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period. Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said: We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus. This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns. Using data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, we aimed to help fill this knowledge gap. Yesterday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that people had a duty to download the new contact-tracing app. Lord Sumption, the former supreme court justice, told Radio 5 Live\u2019s Emma Barnett earlier that he was fed up of being spoken to like that by Hancock. Sumption explained: I\u2019m fed up with being told by the health secretary what my duty is. My duty is to comply with the law. And that I will continue to do. As to everything else I will decide for myself if it is a sensible thing to do. And it sounds like it is. Sumption, who has been critical of the lockdown, said it was time for the government to trust the public. He said: The government have really got to stop treating the whole of the population as if they were children. Those who... still want a lockdown, can isolate themselves. Let those who don\u2019t, exercise their own common sense and own sense of self-preservation, and get on with their lives. I think this should become voluntary. It would be perfectly possible to make compliance voluntary but to keep closed venues such as restaurants, pubs, theatres, football matches and so on. In the latest episode of the Politics Weekly podcast, Heather Stewart and Kate Proctor discuss a particularly bad week for Boris Johnson\u2019s government which saw the UK\u2019s death toll surpass 32,000, overtaking Italy as the worst-hit in Europe. Plus Frances Perraudin reports on how the response of devolved governments in the UK to Covid-19 might affect the future of the union. The rate of increase in confirmed cases of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales accelerated in the most recent 24-hour period, data from the Ministry of Justice shows. As of 5pm on Tuesday, 386 prisoners had tested positive for Covid-19 across 74 prisons, an increase of 7%, while the number of infected prison staff rose by 8% to 433 workers across 67 prisons in the same period. The number of confirmed cases had been slowly rising by about 1% a day in the last week. A total of 19 prisoners and six prison staff are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died. There are 80,100 prisoners in England and Wales and around 33,000 staff in public-sector prisons. Public Health England modelling published last week showed the number of cases and deaths at this point in the pandemic was lower than expected but warned restrictive measures would need to remain until April next year. The updated figures come as two major penal reform campaigners urge the government not to abandon its early temporary release scheme after documents showed a fraction of those approved for release had been freed. A \u201cmuch-loved\u201d care home nurse died with coronavirus just days after her granddaughter was born. Karen Hutton, 58, died at home in the town of Carnoustie, Angus, on 28 April after testing positive for Covid-19. Her only daughter, Lauren, gave birth to a baby girl just two weeks ago, according to care home operators Thistle Healthcare. She was employed as a staff nurse in the dementia unit at Lochleven Care Home in Broughty Ferry, Dundee. Andrew Chalmers-Gall, manager of Lochleven Care Home, said: Karen was a tenacious advocate for her residents and she always put their needs first. She was a much-loved friend and colleague, and she\u2019ll be missed terribly by everyone at Lochleven. A report commissioned by the judge in charge of the family courts in England and Wales raises severe doubts about the \u201cfairness\u201d of remote video hearings being conducted during the coronavirus crisis. Carried out by the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory on behalf of Sir Andrew McFarlane, the study says many of those involved found it \u201cextremely difficult to conduct hearings with the level of empathy and humanity\u201d normally required. More than 930 people responded to the survey including judges, magistrates, barristers, solicitors and parents participating in remote video hearings. Only urgent cases were initially being dealt with by the courts during the lockdown but fear of a massive backlog of cases and the wide availability of online technology created pressure for more online justice. The report said there were significant concerns raised about the fairness of remote hearings and there were \u201csome worrying descriptions of the way some cases had been conducted\u201d. Concerns related to \u201cwhere not having face-to-face contact made it difficult to read reactions and communicate in a humane and sensitive way, the difficulty of ensuring a party\u2019s full participation in a remote hearing, and issues of confidentiality and privacy\u201d. There were also fears about cases involving domestic abuse, parties with a disability or cognitive impairment or where an intermediary or interpreter is required, and concerns were raised about the presence of children during proceedings. In domestic abuse cases, the report said, \u201cthere is a risk that the court process itself may be used as a coercive control tactic and increase feelings of vulnerability. ...Some [victims] are distressed by being alone at home during the hearings where they might hear or see the perpetrator.\u201d The report noted: Particular concerns were raised by some respondents about urgent applications for interim care orders in relation to newborn babies, with new mothers having to join hearings from hospital, with accompanying difficulties in connectivity and in ensuring any privacy while the hearing was taking place. Some uplifting mid-afternoon news. A father-of-two who spent 19 days in an induced coma in hospital has recovered from coronavirus and returned home in time to celebrate his son\u2019s second birthday. Omar Taylor, 31, was welcomed home by applause and banners from neighbours after spending six weeks in hospital with Covid-19. He had been intubated, placed in an induced coma at Colchester hospital, and was on a ventilator for 30 days. His wife, Kaitlyn, had been told to prepare for the worst. After suffering from coronavirus, double pneumonia, sepsis, heart failure and two strokes, he recovered enough to continue his recovery at home. Doctors said he would never walk again, but he left hospital - on foot - in time for his son\u2019s birthday. He is stable but remains critical. Kaitlyn told the BBC: \u201cHe still can\u2019t speak, it\u2019s very hard for us to understand him. But he\u2019s done so well at home. It\u2019s just going to take time.\u201d The BBC has the story and here is a GoFundMe page set up to support the family. Beauty firm The Hut Group is utilising its global supply chain to donate 3.5 million items of medical-grade personal protective equipment to the healthcare system in Greater Manchester. The total shipments include 150,000 face masks, 50,000 disposable masks, 950,000 surgical gloves, 184,000 face shields, 24,000 medical gowns, 500,000 single gloves and 750,000 FFP2 masks. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: I\u2019m proud that a Manchester-headquartered global business has used its international contacts and purchasing power to support us in our hour of need to save lives and protect the NHS. This comes on top of what they\u2019ve already donated to support our frontline staff across Greater Manchester. What a great example of business stepping up to help others. Another 14 coronavirus deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, three of which happened in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities there to 418, the Department of Health said. A total of 3,934 cases of the virus have been confirmed. The full details are here (pdf). Discussing the \u201cwinding down\u201d of the government\u2019s furloughing scheme on BBC Radio 4\u2019s World at One today, the former Treasury minister David Gauke said that although the scheme seemed to be working, there was a risk people will \u201cget too used to it\u201d as unfreezing the economy is set to take a while. He said: The challenge is to strike that balance between preventing mass unemployment, which nobody wants, and laying people off from jobs that are completely viable at the end of this process, but on the other hand incurring huge costs to the taxpayers and locking people into doing nothing, when in fact everyone would be better off if they ultimately could go out and move to a different sector, a different employer where they\u2019ve got a sustainable business. There is a broader risk that we as a society are perhaps insulated from the economic challenges in a way that is a bit of a false position, because in the end you can\u2019t properly be protected from the economic realities and if we don\u2019t recognise that in the end we are going to have to pay our way, we are going to get people back to work, there are long-term risks for the economy. I don\u2019t think anybody is addicted yet but if over time we end up paying people for staying at home, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll do. England\u2019s Test cricketers have been told to expect daily temperature checks, regular Covid-19 swabs and possibly nine weeks away from their families under ambitious plans to get the series against West Indies and Pakistan played. Joe Root\u2019s side had their first briefing about the \u201cbio-secure\u201d measures due to be in place this summer on Tuesday and learned that a squad of up to 30 could be chosen for a run of six Tests at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford from 8 July. While the plan is still fraught with hurdles and subject to guidelines for all sports being approved by central government, there is a growing belief at the England and Wales Cricket Board that the two grounds, with their on-site hotels, could see the risk of playing behind closed doors mitigated to an acceptable level. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman signalled that cabinet and Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, will meet at the weekend to agree the plan to start easing the lockdown. The cabinet will meet, as usual, tomorrow. But the spokesman also said that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that cabinet would meet at the weekend. And he indicated that Cobra, the committee that includes representatives of the devolved administrations, would also meet shortly before the announcement gets made by Boris Johnson on Sunday. The spokesman refused to comment on reports suggesting that the government may abandon its \u201cStay home\u201d slogan at the weekend, replacing it with another message consistent with the lockdown starting to ease. The spokesman said that, when Boris Johnson set a new testing target in the Commons of 200,000 tests by the end of May (see 12.12pm), the target applied to testing capacity. In the Commons Johnson said: [Keir Starmer is] right that capacity currently exceeds demand, we\u2019re working on that, we\u2019re running at about 100,000 a day, but the ambition clearly is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month and then to go even higher. When Matt Hancock set 100,000 a day as a testing target for the end of April, No 10 said that was as target for the actual number of tests carried out, not just capacity (the number of tests that could theoretically be carried out). But the spokesman said the actual target referred to by Johnson at PMQs this afternoon just covered capacity, not actual tests. In recent weeks daily capacity for testing almost always been significantly higher than the number of tests actually carried out. The spokesman said the target also covered antibody testing, which looks at whether people have had the virus, as well as the antigen testing, which looks at whether people have the virus. The current figures only cover antigen testing because a reliable antibody test for use at home is not yet available. The spokesman said Prof Neil Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way. But he said that others from Imperial College contribute to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The spokesman said that the government wanted Imperial\u2019s \u201cinvaluable work\u201d to continue to be available to it. The spokesman also said that Johnson thought Ferguson had taken the right decision to resign from Sage, and that the social distancing rules were there for a purpose. The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Ferguson\u2019s resignation exposed double standards over the social distancing rules. There have been claims that Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Johnson himself have both broken these rules, because Jenrick left London with his family to stay in a home in the country, and Johnson and his fiancee stayed at Chequers after Johnson come out of hospital. The spokesman said that Jenrick was just travelling to rejoin his family, and that Johnson went to Chequers on the advice of his doctors. The spokesman said that when Johnson spoke at PMQs about a a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes, he was referring to death rates falling. Jenrick, the housing secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said. Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, will also be appearing. The questions at the press conference are being allocated to regional newspapers, not national newspapers. The spokesman said this was in recognition of the important role regional papers play. The spokesman said more than 69,000 of the new \u201cbounce back\u201d loans were approved when the scheme opened on Monday, worth more than \u00a32bn. He also said 130,000 applications have been now been received, and are being processed. NHS England has announced 331 new deaths in hospital of people who tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 22,049. The full details are here. The full figures are here (pdf). Of the 331 new deaths announced today, 54 occurred on May 5, 121 occurred on May 4 and 28 occurred on May 3. A further 21 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,044, Public Health Wales has said. The latest figures are here. In the House of Commons the business minister Paul Scully said that any workers asked to work in an environment they thought was unsafe should contact the health and safety authorities. He was responding to an urgent question tabled by Labour about the potential risk to employees. Andy McDonald, the shadow employment rights minister, asked the government to publish the guidelines being drawn up for employers to follow when the lockdown starts to relax. Scully told MPs: This is not a finished process at the moment. What we need to do is get into the technical detail to make sure that everybody has confidence, in the same way that employees need to have confidence. They should be able to discuss with their employers the steps they might take to make their workplace safer themselves, especially when we start to lift restrictions. Where workers still feel unsafe though, they can contact the Health and Safety Executive or their local authority and where [poor health and safety is uncovered] they can take action. The EU trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, has warned the UK needs \u201cto get on with the job\u201d if there is to be a deal by the end of the year. Speaking at an Institute of International and Economic Affairs virtual conference, he said: They need a lot more intensive engagement than we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks and months. And if we want to achieve the outcome that is preferred by the United Kingdom, to have a deal by the end of the year, we need to get on with the job. He said the June stock-take by both sides would be \u201ccritical\u201d but the UK need to come up with a plan for fisheries, governance and level playing field so they could put it on the negotiating table. He went on: We\u2019ve been very patient in the European Union and with the United Kingdom in terms of the slow pace that it has shown in relation to engaging with the discussions, and we take account of course of the illness of the prime minister and we hope that he continues to his full recovery. But I think that the place to do all of this work is at the table of negotiations where there\u2019s been many opportunities, which have not been taken by the United Kingdom in recent weeks, so we hope that in the next two rounds of negotiations, one of which will be next week, that we will see much more intensive work being done much more engagement. A \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to lifting the lockdown is required, the Welsh government\u2019s finance minister, Rebecca Evans, has said. At her administration\u2019s daily press conference,Evans said the Labour-led Welsh government\u2019s preference remained for a four-nation approach to the easing of lockdown. She said: We\u2019re keen to move as closely as we can with England at the moment because in Wales we have so many people living on the Wales-England border and it\u2019s important we move in step when we can. What I expect to see from the prime minister on the weekend is a careful and cautious approach to lifting the lockdown. Evans called for a \u201ctapered approach\u201d when the furlough scheme winds up. She said: When it does finally come to an end, as it will inevitably have to do, I think a more tapered approach would be the way to do that. Here is our story on the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges at PMQs. It\u2019s by Rowena Mason and Kate Proctor. Sir Keir Starmer and other Westminster opposition leaders will be speaking with Boris Johnson about the coronavirus response tomorrow. The Labour leader would raise the need for a \u201cnational consensus\u201d on easing the lockdown based around keeping the public safe, a \u201cmass expansion\u201d of contact tracing and protecting key workers, his spokesman said. A legal challenge has been launched over the way in which do not resuscitate (DNR) orders are being issued during the coronavirus crisis without allegedly sufficient consultation with patients or their families. Lawyers representing Kate Masters, who brought a case over such orders in 2014, have written to the Department of Health and Social Care warning that the way in which DNRs are made is currently unlawful. Masters believes that decision-making around DNRs has become \u201copaque, inconsistent and deficient\u201d. She is concerned about her own position because of her health problems. She says she feels at significant risk of DNR decisions being made without proper process. She said: I have watched with alarm as reports of blanket DNR orders in care homes and failures to consult with patients and their families have been reported in the news since the start of the coronavirus crisis. After all that my dad did to fight to clarify the law regarding DNRs, I am determined to ensure that my human rights and those of others are not breached due to a lack of government direction. Merry Varney, her solicitor at the law firm Leigh Day, said: DNRs imposed in circumstances where patients and their families have no or little information, and no consultation, often lead to a complete breakdown in trust and numerous stories reported in the media show how common it is that patients and families believe these cannot be imposed without consent. Healthcare professionals are already overburdened, our client believes it is time for the government to step up and give national guidance that will ensure consistent and lawful decision-making at a local level and also ensure patients\u2019 fundamental human rights are being upheld. In a pre-Covid PMQs a Tory prime minister who was riding high in the opinion polls and who was returning to the House of Commons after an illness that left him in intensive care would have been welcomed by such a wall of noise that it would have been hard for any opposition leader to make much of a mark. But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time. As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering. Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE. In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday. Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said. The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector. National Records of Scotland, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see 12.22.). That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places. There were 310 care home deaths recorded in Scotland last week, compared with 339 the week before. The NRS said 37% of all Covid-19 deaths last week happened in hospitals compared with 42% the week before. It said three-quarters of all registered deaths so far involved people aged 75 or over, and 52% of the total were male and 48% female. Pete Whitehouse, the NRS director of statistical services, said: These latest figures shown that for the first time, since reporting of registered deaths relating to Covid-19 began for week beginning 16 March, there has been a reduction in Covid-19 related deaths from the previous week \u2013 down from 658 to 523 Covid-19 related deaths. Cycling could increase fivefold across London under post-lockdown plans to overhaul the city\u2019s streets, where pavements will be widened to allow for physical distancing and queueing outside shops. New walking and cycling routes will be constructed along major corridors, including temporary cycle lanes along routes such as Euston Road, under the \u201cLondon Streetscape\u201d plans. Transport for London (TfL) is also looking at creating temporary cycle lanes on Park Lane. The release of the initial details by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, comes as he continues to come under pressure to increase tube services or take steps to address significant numbers of people still using the network. Khan\u2019s office said that millions of journeys a day would need to be made by other means, with London\u2019s public transport capacity potentially running at a fifth of pre-crisis levels. If people switched only a fraction of those journeys to cars, it warned that London risked grinding to a halt, air quality would worsen, and road danger would increase. The plans were welcomed by organisations such Living Streets, a walking charity, which said the the pandemic had highlighted the importance that walking plays in people\u2019s lives. Its director, Stephen Edwards, said: Where London\u2019s pavements aren\u2019t suitable for safe social distancing, it is vital widening happens to ensure people aren\u2019t forced into the paths of oncoming traffic. Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs the Scottish government will start to lift lockdown restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d after the latest data showed overall Covid-19 deaths fell last week for the first time since the crisis began. The first minister told Holyrood she planned to uphold the current lockdown regulations from tomorrow, when she has to refresh the lockdown orders for the next three weeks, but indicated the new data would spur changes soon. The progress, while real, is still too fragile to immediately ease restrictions in any significant way but we are planning now for ways in which we can gradually do so, as soon as possible. She said intensive care cases had again fallen overnight by 15 patients, down to 89, while the number of hospital patients had also fallen by 24 to 1,632. National Records of Scotland, the government agency, said at noon on Wednesday that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May. A total of 1,703 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, up by 83 from 1,620 on Tuesday, Sturgeon said. The figures are lower than the 2,795 deaths given earlier by the NRS (see 12.22.) as they do not include suspected and probable coronavirus infections. The first minister said 12,709 people have now tested positive for the virus in Scotland, up by 272 from 12,437 the day before. Scotland Yard said Prof Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error so it will not take further action. A statement for the force said: We remain committed to our role in supporting adherence to government guidance and have made it clear that our starting position is explaining the need to follow the regulations with anyone who is in breach in order to keep people safe and protect the NHS. It is clear in this case that whilst this behaviour is plainly disappointing, Prof Ferguson has accepted that he made an error of judgment and has taken responsibility for that. We therefore do not intend to take any further action. Ferguson, whose scientific modelling was key to the imposition of the UK lockdown, resigned as a government adviser last night after the Telegraph revealed he had flouted lockdown rules by receiving visits from his lover at his home. Earlier this morning, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the scientist\u2019s breach of the rules had left him \u201cspeechless\u201d. He said it was right that Ferguson had resigned and that he would back the police in any action they decided to take. Labour\u2019s Lilian Greenwood asks Johnson to give councils a cast-iron guarantee that they will not lose out from coronavirus. Johnson says the government has already given billions to councils. And that won\u2019t be the last they get, he says. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. Rob Butler, a Conservative, asks Johnson to support \u201cBernie the Bus\u201d, a community initiative in his constituency. Johnson does so, saying he is a supporter of buses. The SNPs David Linden asks if the goverment will lift the benefits cap. Johnson says the government is spending an extra \u00a37bn on benefits. Simon Fell, a Conservative, asks if the government supports giving a catch-up premium for schools with disadvantaged pupils, who are likely to have fallen behind. Johnson says extra computers and laptops have been provided. And there will be more to come, because this is a government that will pursue our agenda of uniting and levelling up. The SNP\u2019s Mhairi Black asks if there are any plans to increase the value of employment support allowance. Johnson says the seven-day waiting time has been removed. People want a wide programme of support from the government, he says. Ben Bradley, a Conservative, asks about further education. Johnson says the government is going to need this sector badly to provide the skills required for the recovery. Justin Madders, a Labour MP, asks Johnson if he agrees that it would be wrong for furloughed staff to get laid off. Johnson says this scheme has been a success. He wants people to be able to go back to work safely and securely. Rehman Chishti, a Conservative, asks the government to allow small family funerals. It is not fair that they cannot take place while cremations can, he says. Johnson says he agrees. He wants councils to address this. Labour\u2019s Mike Amesbury asks about his local council. The government said it would compensate councils for spending on coronavirus. But nationally they are short by billlions, he says. Johnson says the government has \u201cabsolutely no intention of returning to the A word [austerity]\u201d. I can certainly tell him that the government has absolutely no intention of returning to the A-word, which I won\u2019t quote. That is not going to be our approach. The faster we can suppress the virus, the quicker we can restart the economy, and ensure communities get the help they need, he says. Heathrow is to begin temperature screening of passengers, several weeks after the measure was deployed by many other major airports around the world. The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes which could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports in a bid to encourage passengers to return to flying. The scheme is aimed at reducing the risk of passengers contracting or transmitting Covid-19 while travelling. The first trial will be launched in the next two weeks and will involve using cameras which are capable of monitoring people\u2019s temperatures. Cameras will initially be used in the airport\u2019s immigration halls, but could be deployed in areas for departures, connections and airport staff searches. Temperature screening of passengers has been used by airports in some countries for several weeks as part of measures to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Holland-Kaye said: Aviation is the cornerstone of the UK economy, and to restart the economy the government needs to help restart aviation. The UK has the world\u2019s third-largest aviation sector, offering the platform for the government to take a lead in agreeing a common international standard for aviation health with our main trading partners. This standard is key to minimising transmission of Covid-19 across borders, and the technology we are trialling at Heathrow could be part of the solution. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, also mentions the figures showing the UK with the highest death figures for Europe. Some estimates show the numbers could be even higher. Will the PM follow the best scientific advice in relaxing the lockdown? Johnson says he will. He says it would be a mistake to introduce measures that would allow a second peak. Blackford welcomes Johnson\u2019s comment, but says the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has been politicising this issue. Will the PM agree to ensure the devolved administrations agree what is being planned? Johnson says he wants the widest possible support for what he is announcing. A total of 2,795 people have died in Scotland with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, according to the National Records of Scotland (NRS). Of these: - 59% died in care homes - 37% in hospitals - 4% in homes or non-institutional settings The percentage of deaths in care homes has increased for the second week in a row, up from 52% the previous week, but the number of deaths in care homes has gone down from 339 to 310. There were 523 deaths relating to Covid-19 registered between 27 April and 3 May, a decrease of 135 on those registered between 20-26 April. The figures are announced weekly and account for all deaths registered in Scotland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. They differ from the lab-confirmed coronavirus deaths announced daily by the Scottish government because they include suspected or probable cases of Covid-19. Starmer asks if the PM will come to the Commons on Monday to present his plan. Johnson says there will be a statement to the Commons on Monday. (He does not say he will give it.) He says he wants to introduce some of these measures on Monday. And he says the announcement is on Sunday so he can have the most up-to-date data before taking the final decision. Johnson says he wants some lockdown easing measures to come into force from Monday. UPDATE: Here is the quote from Johnson. I just want to explain to the house, as a courtesy, why it is happening on Sunday; I am sure that you would be interested to know that, Mr Speaker. The reason is very simple. We have to be sure that the data is going to support our ability to do this, but that data is coming in continuously over the next few days. We will want, if we possibly can, to get going with some of these measures on Monday, and I think it will be a good thing if people have an idea of what is coming the following day. Starmer says Johnson has admitted there was a capacity problem. He cites a survey about doctors having to buy their own PPE. This will get worse when people return to work. Can the PM assure people they won\u2019t be asked to return to work until a plan is in place? Johnson says he can. He says the PPE shortages have been \u201cenraging\u201d. There have been no national \u201cstock outs\u201d of any PPE item, he says. Johnson confirms he will set out details of his plan to start relaxing the lockdown on Sunday. Starmer welcomes the PM\u2019s decision to set a deadline for the 200,000 a day target. Why was contract tracing abandoned in mid-March? Johnson says the difficulty in mid-March was that the testing capacity could not meet demand. But now there will be a team in place that can trace hundreds of thousands of cases across the country. As I think is readily apparent Mr Speaker to everybody who studied the situation and I think as the scientists would confirm, the difficulty in mid-March was that the tracing capacity that we had, that had been useful as he rightly says in the containment phase of the epidemic, that capacity was no longer useful or relevant since the transmission from individuals within the UK meant that it exceeded our capacity then. Now the value of the testing, tracking and tracing operation that we\u2019re setting up now is that as we come out of the epidemic and as we get the new cases down, we will have a team that will genuinely be able to track and trace hundreds of thousands of people across the country and thereby to drive down the epidemic. To put it in a nutshell, it is easier to do this now, he says. Starmer says the testing numbers have fallen back since last week, when the government hit its 100,000-a-day target. What was so special about that day? Johnson says Starmer was right to pay tribute to the work done on this last week. He says the ambition is to get testing up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month, and then go even higher. Starmer says the government publishes comparative death figures every day. So it can\u2019t argue they don\u2019t count. He says the government has been too late on issues like testing and PPE. Why has it taken so long to improve the situation in care homes? Johnson says there has been a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes. Sir Keir Starmer starts by saying it is good to see the PM back in his place. Last week the PM talks about the \u201capparent success\u201d of the government\u2019s approach. But death numbers are the highest in Europe, and the second highest in the world. That\u2019s not a success. How on earth did it come to this? Johnson cites what Prof David Spiegelhalter wrote about comparing death rates in a Guardian article. He says of course there will be a time to look at what went wrong. Johnson hints that public inquiry will have to take place. Johnson says the government is supporting tourism in Devon. The priority is to suppress this disease, he says. He says that will help tourism everywhere. Boris Johnson starts by paying tribute to the 107 NHS workers and 29 care workers who have died. And he pays tribute to the staff who looked after him at St Thomas\u2019 hospital. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, opens PMQs by talking about VE day on Friday. There will be a wreath-laying ceremony in the Commons, he says. And he says the whole country will welcome Boris Johnson back. These are from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. From the Labour adviser Damian McBride Here is the \u201ccall list\u201d (pdf) of MPs down to ask a question at PMQs. A businesswoman has told the PA news agency she is too scared to return to work when lockdown measures are eased after being spat on during her commute. Jenny Pattinson, who is mixed race, said she was shaken and angry after the incident, which police were unable to investigate further as the CCTV footage had been overwritten. The 41-year-old, from Ascot, Berkshire, now does not feel safe in public without her husband, and will continue to work from home for a while once the lockdown is lifted. She told PA that racist behaviour and comments are \u201cjust a day-to-day reality for Chinese people and the pandemic has made it a lot worse\u201d. She said: It\u2019s escalated, it\u2019s immediately more threatening. I\u2019m a professional woman, I\u2019m 41 years old, I work in the City of London. I\u2019ve worked hard to get to where I\u2019ve got to, I was born here. But I feel scared now. Even if lockdown lifts, I\u2019m not going to be going back to work straight away because I feel quite scared without being with my husband, to be honest with you. And that\u2019s a feeling I have not experienced since when I used to get bullied at school, racist bullying when I was a kid, feeling that scared. Pattinson, whose has a Chinese mother and Scottish father, said she had also noticed other commuters avoiding her on the train before lockdown was imposed. Her mother, who is in her 70s, was sworn at and called \u201cfilthy\u201d on a flight in March, while her cousin, a frontline hospital worker, has also received abuse. Asked what she thinks will happen when lockdown measures are eased, she said: I think it\u2019ll be much worse. I\u2019ve seen what\u2019s on social media as well, the vitriol. Sometimes people have commented on news articles that are reporting about this virus, and just the amount of racism, the level of racism, the amount of stereotyping that\u2019s going on is absolutely horrific. Just seeing those things just make me feel more concerned and more worried and more scared actually, for myself and for my family members and friends. Pattinson said it is sad that there has been no high-level condemnation from the UK government, especially after comments from the US president Donald Trump about Covid-19 being a \u201cChinese virus\u201d. She urged Boris Johnson to speak out, adding: I think there needs to be somebody standing up and saying this isn\u2019t right. PMQs is about to start. It will be the first time Boris Johnson has faced Sir Keir Starmer across the dispatch box. In an article for City AM, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said that if social distancing rules remain in place, tube trains in the capital will only be able to run at 20% normal capacity, at most. And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says. Here is an extract. It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge. Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly. One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned. Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola. Reported experiences ranged from casual jokes to violent attacks and death threats, with people left too frightened to venture out alone and children ridiculed by their peers, 29 in-depth interviews with people of east Asian heritage revealed. Kandola told the PA news agency that some people who have lived in the UK their whole life are questioning \u201cwhether people of Chinese heritage will ever be accepted as British\u201d. Just over half of the 412 people surveyed said they had experienced an increase in discrimination during the Covid-19 outbreak. Three in 10 said they had witnessed or experienced discrimination at work, while 37% said they had experienced this outside the office. One woman, an NHS doctor who works in her local hospital\u2019s respiratory unit, said she has stopped her daily morning jog because of the abuse. Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him. One respondent told Kandola: Nearly every British-born Chinese person I\u2019ve spoken to is genuinely very shocked about what has happened. They are British, have lived all their lives in Britain and yet they feel like outsiders now. Prof Kandola said society has an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour when the UK eases lockdown measures. Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said: There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene. We are actually better than this. As a nation we are better than this. And there are a lot of people in this country who will be shocked about what is going on, and will do something about it. Here are some more lines from Matt Hancock\u2019s Q&amp;A on Sky News. I have already posted on what he said about Prof Neil Ferguson. (See 10.33am.) Hancock refused to accept figures suggesting the UK has the highest death rate from coronavirus in Europe. Asked about this data, Hancock said: I think we\u2019ve got to be very cautious with these data. I think we\u2019ve got to be really careful in how we describe it, because you\u2019ve got to take a lot of things into account. Firstly, we are one of the biggest countries in Europe and that matters, so there are smaller countries which naturally will have a lower death rate because they have got fewer people. Spain and Italy, for instance, don\u2019t include deaths outside hospital in their figures. We didn\u2019t used to, because it is harder to count deaths in the community and in care homes, and we now do ... If you talk to the statisticians and the chief medical officer, what they say is it\u2019s only afterwards, looking back and looking at the total number who have died during the peak, compared to the normal number - because you\u2019ve also got to take into account the age profile, factors like obesity. What Hancock is saying about Italy contracts what No 10 said in a caption to one of the slides shown at the daily press conference on 29 April. That said the Italian figure did include care home deaths. Hancock said that the restrictions imposed on the 1.5 million \u201cclinically extremely vulnerable\u201d people who have been told to stay at home for 12 weeks could be eased, even without a vaccine. Asked about this group, he said: We may well be able to release some of those measures before a vaccine is available if we can get the number of new cases right down. If we succeed in doing that we will be able to take clinical advice on whether it is safe for those who are shielded to, for instance, to hug their grandchildren. That is right at the front of my mind. He suggested that cafes may be able to open for customers sitting outside relatively soon. Asked by a viewer who wanted to know when their cafe could open, he replied: The business secretary is working on the rules for safe working so, when we get the rate of new infections down, we can work on how people can get back to work as safely as possible. And we are going to say more about that very shortly. There is strong evidence that outdoors the spread is much, much lower, so there may be workarounds that some businesses, for instance cafes, especially over the summer, may be able to put into place. He said it would too soon to say when schools would be allowed to open. Asked about this, he said: We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know because we have to see the progress of the disease and we don\u2019t know how people are going to behave in terms of the lockdown measures which are the thing that have the biggest impact on getting the disease down. I understand the frustration of people wanting to know the answer \u2013 will it be June, will it be September, for what age groups? We just don\u2019t yet have the data but I think we are coming to a position relatively soon. Hancock said the government could have explained the help available to care homes more effectively. Asked about problems with testing for people in care homes, Hancock said the government had to build the capacity for those tests to take place. Asked what he could have done differently, he said: I think it\u2019s very hard. I feel like we\u2019ve put a huge amount of effort and resources behind supporting care homes from the start, maybe we should have explained that more clearly. He claimed the UK was now a world leader on testing. He said: We invented the test in January. In February we got the number of tests up to 2,000 [a day]. In March we multiplied that by five times to 10,000. Then we set the 100,000 target. The Germans started with this enormous diagnostics industry. But if you look at other countries around the world we are miles ahead on testing and we are now one of the world leaders. It is true that Germany has a very high capacity \u2013 about the same as ours. So we have basically caught up with Germany that started with this massive capability. We are miles ahead of South Korea now. Absolutely. He said that he had not seen any evidence to support President Trump\u2019s claim that coronavirus was likely to have originated in a Chinese laboratory. Hancock refused to give himself 10 out of 10 for his handling of the crisis. Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood has said the programme\u2019s producers have \u201ccontingency plans\u201d to help ensure this year\u2019s series can go ahead despite the coronavirus disruption. He told ITV\u2019s Lorraine that he has his \u201cfingers crossed\u201d that it can go ahead, adding that there are \u201cways about it\u201d that could mean the programme does not have to be cancelled. Revel Horwood noted that not all routines \u201cmean you are dancing together\u201d and couples could \u201cremain two metres apart or whatever the rules might be at the time\u201d. A socially distanced series \u201ccould become something really quite special\u201d, he said. He added that the BBC \u201cdo not want to let the people down\u201d and that he is \u201cpretty much on board\u201d that the series is going to happen. At least two people a day have been using a free train travel scheme to escape domestic abuse during the coronavirus lockdown, figures reveal. A total of 53 people have used the Rail to Refuge scheme since 9 April, which offers free train travel to a safe refuge, the Rail Delivery Group said. More than half of people who booked through Rail to Refuge said they would not have travelled if the journey was not paid for, the RDG said. The scheme launched in September last year on Southeastern services and in March, GWR joined. It was extended to all train companies on 9 April amid warnings the pandemic was triggering a surge in domestic abuse cases. Southeastern recorded just seven uses of the scheme between September and 9 April so the take-up during the lockdown suggests an increase in demand. Nicki Norman, the acting chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid, said: Accessing money can be difficult for women experiencing domestic abuse, particularly if they are experiencing financial abuse. We know that this can stop women from travelling to safety and can be a huge barrier to support. We\u2019re delighted that our Rail to Refuge scheme is removing this barrier and is allowing women to travel to the safety of a refuge without the difficulty, and sometimes impossibility, of booking and paying for their own travel. Dozens of drug policy experts in the UK have urged the home secretary to enact laws which were amended last week to allow more flexible access to controlled medications during the pandemic. The Royal College of GP\u2019s has warned that Covid patients are experiencing \u201cunnecessary\u201d pain and distress in the final days and hours of their life due to strict bureaucratic hurdles governing the supply of controlled drugs such as morphine for which named prescriptions are required for its use. In a letter, about 50 prominent experts and campaigners called for the recent changes to laws controlling prescribable drugs to be put into place without delay. Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, who organised the letter, said: It is encouraging to see the Department of Health recognise the need to provide flexible arrangements for the supply and use of controlled drugs during the Covid pandemic. This is long overdue as some of the regulations place onerous restrictions on health care staff and pharmacists who are already stretched. The re-use of medicine like morphine is a sensible and pragmatic move which will not only be welcomed by health care workers but has the potential to ensure unnecessary suffering is avoided, as patients who are in pain or experience severe breathlessness can be treated in a timely and safe way. The call comes after the home secretary Priti Patel wrote to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs saying: \u201cI must be clear that these measures will not come into use with immediate effect. The government, in close liaison with the NHS service and devolved administrations, will carefully consider when to \u2018switch on\u2019 these measures.\u201d It is understood that the new flexibilities introduced by the Home Office would only be used if demand and workforce pressures during the pandemic put local health services at imminent risk of failing to fulfil their role or in the event of a serious national shortage of a specified controlled drug. Rory Stewart has abandoned his bid to become London mayor, saying that campaigning has become impossible after the election was delayed due to the coronavirus crisis. The former Tory cabinet minister said it had been an \u201cagonising decision\u201d but it was unfair on the unpaid volunteers working on his campaign. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has just started taking part in a Q&amp;A on Sky News. And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved. Asked by the presenter Kay Burley if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied: You can imagine what my views are. It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed. Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said: Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that. And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign. Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, which broke the story, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules. Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved. However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d. But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson. Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime. Perhaps it is just a ploy to get out of changing nappies? But it suits the photographers, and here are some pictures from today. And here he is with a dog in shot (but not his own, which doesn\u2019t seem to get invited out on the daily walk). Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. Here are the main items on the agenda. 9.30am: Executives from Heathrow, ABTA, the travel association, and the Airport Operators Association are among those giving evidence to the Commons transport committee. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, takes part in a Q&amp;A on Sky News. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. It will be the first time the two men have gone head to head in the Commons as party leaders. 12.30pm: The Scottish and Welsh governments are due to hold their daily briefings. After 12.30pm: Alok Sharma, the business secretary, answers an urgent Commons question on workplace safety when the lockdown gets lifted. 1.30pm: Downing Street holds its lobby briefing. 5pm: The UK government is due to hold its daily briefing. Ocado is continuing to profit from the Covid-19 pandemic. This morning it has reported a 40% surge in UK revenue so far this quarter, up from 10% growth in the first three months of 2020. Demand surged as the lockdown began, creating an \u201cunprecedented\u201d level of demand from customers keen to avoid venturing to the shops. It says: Growth in retail revenue in the second quarter to date is 40.4% up on last year, compared to 10.3% growth in the first quarter. The number of items per basket appears to have passed its peak but remains high, as more normal shopping behaviours have returned, and the share of fresh and chilled products in the mix, relative to ambient, is also returning to normal. For all business updates, do visit business live: The former prime minister Theresa May has criticised the global response to coronavirus, accusing world leaders of failing \u201cto forge a coherent international response\u201d. In an article in the Times that will be seen as implicit criticism of President Trump\u2019s administration in particular, she warned that lack of cooperation could lead to the world becoming more dangerous. Against a backdrop of populist politics in many countries, the search for political solutions to economic and social challenges has become a competition of absolutes. A polarised politics has taken hold. It views the world through a prism of winners and losers and sees compromise and co-operation as signs of weakness. Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good. In its place is a cynical calculus: \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re either with me or against me.\u201d This is the world that the pandemic hit. A highly infectious novel virus, life-threatening for many, might seem to be just the sort of thing countries would want to work together on. Instead, it has been treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone. Researchers and scientists may work together across the world but there is little evidence of politicians doing so ... There remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus \u2014 nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. This risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism which is emasculating the institutions that served us well over decades. A world in which a few \u201cstrong men\u201d square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one. James Brokenshire has also been speaking on BBC Breakfast, and pushed on the UK\u2019s death toll, which is now the highest in Europe, Brokenshire said after the pandemic there will be a chance to see \u201cwhat mistakes have been made\u201d. He told BBC Breakfast: It is an absolute tragedy for anyone to lose a loved one. And there will be, I\u2019m sure, plenty of reflection and time once we are through this terrible virus to be able to look at actions that have been taken and to see what lessons can be learned, what mistakes have been made. And every government I think will need to do that and we are no exception to that. The government has not yet confirmed that there will be a public inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus crisis once it is over, but Brokenshire\u2019s words may be the closest any minister has come to saying it\u2019s inevitable. Asked the government\u2019s lockdown plans, Brokenshire said there is likely to be a \u201ccareful\u201d, \u201ccautious and thoughtful\u201d approach: It does need to be done with that great care and thought, because the last thing that we need is another second surge, for the NHS to be overwhelmed and all of the issues that that would bring. Pushed on testing, Brokenshire said the government decided to stop testing and tracing for coronavirus in the community on March 12 due to a \u201cshift\u201d in expert advice. He said: We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this. There was a shift in terms of how testing was done - we\u2019ve already heard about some of the issues of overall capacity at that point of time and some of the evidence that (Sir) Patrick Vallance, our chief scientific officer (sic), has given. Asked whether, had there been the capacity, track-and-tracing should have continued, the Home Office minister said: Would there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes. The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April. Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday: I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial. And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen. I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer. It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly. Brokenshire defended the decision not to close UK borders in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said: I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time. Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak. It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact. Security Minister James Brokenshire has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: I\u2019m obviously saddened to hear this development and the actions Professor Ferguson has taken but, ultimately, I think it is the right course of action. I think Professor Ferguson has taken an appropriate course given the issues of ensuring there is clarity of message on upholding the rules and requirements on social distancing and just why that matters so much in terms of protecting our NHS and saving lives. It is a matter of regret but that guidance is unequivocal, it is there to protect all of us. Asked about reports that care home residents and staff are not being tested to determine if they are asymptomatic Covid-19 sufferers, Brokenshire said the government was working with the care sector on testing. He said: We are still very firmly discussing with the sector, with Public Health England and reaching out to ensure that capacity is reaching where it needs to be. That work still continues. We are obviously concerned about issues in care homes, ensuring there is that reach - it is there in terms of the capacity, having gone up - and how we ensure we can get that further, where it is needed, given the whole point of investing in that was to ensure that it can give that sense of reassurance. Will coronavirus spell the end of the party for Ibiza? My colleague Steven Morris has this report on the name change of the national assembly of Wales: There will be no fanfare and little ceremony but the body formerly known as the national assembly of Wales has a new name. From now it will be known as Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh parliament. It is expected that the rather bulky title will be commonly shortened to \u201cthe senedd\u201d. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the new name would send out a message that it was a \u201cfull-blown primary law-making institution\u201d. Also changing are the titles of the 60 elected members. They are now members of the senedd (MSs) as opposed to assembly members (AMs). Or aelod o\u2019r senedd (AS) in Welsh. Other changes introduced today include 16 and 17-year-olds having the right to vote in senedd elections. Drakeford said: I think it\u2019s important to send a message out to people in Wales that an institution which began with very modest powers has over 20 years developed into a full-blown primary law-making institution with far deeper powers and wider powers as well. The first minister said the immediate priorities for the senedd would be continuing to shape the laws governing the coronavirus lockdown. The name change has not been without controversy \u2013 many champions of the Welsh language have argued the new name should be Welsh only. This interview with Ellie Orton, the chief executive of NHS Charities Together (NHSCT), by the Guardian\u2019s David Brindle is fascinating. As a result of the Herculean fundraising efforts of Captain Tom Moore the charity has been propelled into the limelight. Orton says: In terms of income, the profile and the understanding of NHS trusts and boards that charity could be a key partner \u2013 well, instead of accomplishing that in five years as we had hoped under our strategic plan, it\u2019s pretty much been done in five weeks. But it is this paragraph that stands out: While [NHGS charities] all stress that they are supplementing taxpayer funding, and paying for extras rather than for basics such as personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers or ventilators for patients during the current crisis, the ground rules are not as clear as is commonly supposed. An official review in 2012 concluded that \u201cthere is no hard and fast rule that charities must not subsidise or replace public services\u201d. Read the full story here: Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has been speaking on BBC Breakfast this morning. Ashworth said the government needs to have a plan which should include more targeted testing and tracing to tackle the disproportionate number of deaths in poorer areas. He told BBC Breakfast: My worry is that Covid-19 is going to make these health inequalities in society even worse so I\u2019m calling on the government to have a plan to tackle these health inequalities so we don\u2019t see this widening gap in life chances and health outcomes. Asked about the coronavirus app, which began a trial on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, Ashworth said he will download it but urged the government to mobilise local experts \u201con the ground\u201d. He said: I will be downloading it because we want to see it succeed, although we\u2019ve got questions about whether it will succeed, whether privacy issues have been resolved. But I actually think to really successfully deliver the tracing service, we need boots on the ground, we need local government public health experts, you need your environmental health experts, we need to use our expertise in local primary care services because this is a very labour intensive job and they\u2019ve got experience. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is preparing to wind down the coronavirus wage-subsidy scheme for workers in the UK from July as part of government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures, reports my colleague Richard Partington. With almost a quarter of employees in Britain furloughed in the past fortnight, the chancellor is expected to announce that the Covid-19 job retention scheme will be steadily scaled back as restrictions on business activity are lifted. The Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy paid by the state to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration. Sources indicated that a final decision has yet to be made, but the Treasury was working closely with No 10 as Boris Johnson prepares to outline plans on Sunday to gradually lift lockdown restrictions. After more than a month of tight controls on social and business activity across Britain and in other countries around the world, the UK is on the brink of the deepest recession in living memory. Read the full story here: A very good morning to all UK readers coming to the liveblog this morning. As ever we really value your tips and comments, so please do get in touch. I\u2019m on alexandra.topping@theguardian.com and @lexytopping on Twitter. My DMs are open. Here is a round up of the biggest stories we have today: Britain has the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, official figures showed on Tuesday, prompting calls for an inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. The government\u2019s tally of fatalities across the UK reached 29,427 for those who tested positive for coronavirus, exceeding the 29,029 recorded in Italy \u2013 until now Europe\u2019s worst-hit country. Italy\u2019s total does not include suspected cases. Britain could exit the coronavirus lockdown by relaxing restrictions on more than half of the population and beefing up protection for those over 70 and vulnerable people, scientists have said. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling helped shape Britain\u2019s coronavirus lockdown strategy, has quit as a government adviser after flouting the rules by receiving visits from his lover at his home. Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns. The Resolution Foundation (RF) said that in the absence of action an extra 600,000 people under the age of 25 would swell dole queues, with a risk of long-term damage to their career and pay prospects.",

      "body": "<p>Leader of the opposition has always been one of the toughest jobs in politics and Keir Starmer has come to it in exceptionally tricky circumstances. His party has been out of government for a decade. Labour is united in wanting to set factional differences aside but without agreement on how to do it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is enjoying a prolonged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus\" title=\"\">honeymoon in opinion polls</a>. Partly that reflects natural gravitation of support to incumbents in a national crisis. Mr Johnson\u2019s critics might complain that his credentials as a reliable leader are unearned, but the complaint itself is unlikely to change voters\u2019 minds.</p> <p>Sir Keir\u2019s challenge is to assert the truth about government failings without appearing to undermine its pandemic response with excessive partisanship. That is the balance he struck in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/pmqs-verdict-floundering-johnson-meets-calm-and-focused-starmer\" title=\"\">first interrogation of Mr Johnson in parliament</a> on Wednesday. The questions were well calibrated to dismantle Downing Street\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has been a success. It has not, as the grim death toll \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\" title=\"\">the highest in Europe</a> \u2013 seems to indicate. Sir Keir\u2019s background as a barrister equips him well to build a case and present it in a way that discomforts the other side. Mr Johnson\u2019s typically blustering responses sounded doubly vacuous in a Commons hushed by the requirements of physical distancing.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the prime minister prefers to make announcements by televised address, and the Labour leader is right to demand that future policy changes be presented to parliament first. Mr Johnson is in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/24/johnson-avoiding-scrutiny-cancelled-appearances-says-senior-mp\" title=\"\">habit of evading such scrutiny</a> and is unlikely to relish routine questioning from a rigorous adversary.

      "bodyText": "Leader of the opposition has always been one of the toughest jobs in politics and Keir Starmer has come to it in exceptionally tricky circumstances. His party has been out of government for a decade. Labour is united in wanting to set factional differences aside but without agreement on how to do it. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson is enjoying a prolonged honeymoon in opinion polls. Partly that reflects natural gravitation of support to incumbents in a national crisis. Mr Johnson\u2019s critics might complain that his credentials as a reliable leader are unearned, but the complaint itself is unlikely to change voters\u2019 minds. Sir Keir\u2019s challenge is to assert the truth about government failings without appearing to undermine its pandemic response with excessive partisanship. That is the balance he struck in his first interrogation of Mr Johnson in parliament on Wednesday. The questions were well calibrated to dismantle Downing Street\u2019s claim that the UK\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has been a success. It has not, as the grim death toll \u2013 the highest in Europe \u2013 seems to indicate. Sir Keir\u2019s background as a barrister equips him well to build a case and present it in a way that discomforts the other side. Mr Johnson\u2019s typically blustering responses sounded doubly vacuous in a Commons hushed by the requirements of physical distancing. It is not surprising that the prime minister prefers to make announcements by televised address, and the Labour leader is right to demand that future policy changes be presented to parliament first. Mr Johnson is in the habit of evading such scrutiny and is unlikely to relish routine questioning from a rigorous adversary. But competence across the despatch box is only a small part of the project to persuade voters that the leader of the opposition is a potential prime minister. Most of that task is behind closed doors. It is the strategic mission to develop a clear argument about what is wrong with the country and a distinctive prescription for making it better.

It met frequently to address the pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings, but these came to be dominated by Trump often attacking the media, veering off topic or uttering disinformation, and sometimes lasted more than two hours.</p> <p>In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the president said that because of its success, \u201cthe Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. We may add or subtract people to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics.\u201d</p> <p>The pledge sowed confusion after both Trump and Pence indicated on Tuesday that the taskforce, which has begun to meet less frequently and had not held a press briefing in more than a week, was to be dismantled.</p> <p>Trump had told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we\u2019ll have a different group probably set up for that.\u201d</p> <p>He later added, according to a pooled report: \u201cI thought we could wind it down sooner. But I had no idea how popular the taskforce is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down. It is appreciated by the public.\u201d</p> <p>And Pence had said: \u201cI think we\u2019re having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the taskforce to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level.\u201d</p> <p>The surprise remarks drew comparisons with the premature \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner that hung on an aircraft carrier where George W Bush addressed troops during the early stages of the Iraq war. It raised fears that Trump, with an eye on November\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">election</a>, had all but abandoned health needs in favour of economic imperatives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"879f6f80ea553435b6e202164e14ce1f04146e65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/879f6f80ea553435b6e202164e14ce1f04146e65/0_150_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump at the mask factory in Phoenix on Tuesday night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump at the mask factory in Phoenix on Tuesday night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Touring a face mask factory in Arizona, where he defied guidelines by not wearing a mask himself and where the James Bond theme song Live and Let Die played over loudspeakers, the president admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d</p> <p>A strong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economy</a> has long been Trump\u2019s central argument for re-election, but stay-at-home orders during the pandemic have wreaked havoc and wiped out at least 30m jobs. Trump regards recovery as politically vital as a series of opinion polls show him trailing election opponent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>Undeterred by a coronavirus death toll already bigger than the US\u2019s in the Vietnam war, Trump has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and cheered on state governors who order reopenings in defiance of his own phased federal guidelines. Commentators suspect his strategy will be to claim credit for economic gains while shifting blame to governors for resurgences of the virus.</p> <p>Infection rates continue to increase outside New York, the hardest-hit state. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000.

      "bodyText": "The White House appeared to be in fresh disarray on Wednesday as Donald Trump insisted that his coronavirus taskforce would remain in place \u2013 less than 24 hours after suggesting it would be disbanded. The US president reversed course following a backlash against moves to wind down the taskforce even as the country reports about 30,000 new coronavirus cases a day and the death toll moves past 70,000, the highest in the world. But Trump did confirm a switch in focus to reviving America\u2019s devastated economy, fuelling anxiety that he has made a cold political calculation to put his re-election chances ahead of saving lives. The 22-member White House coronavirus taskforce was created in late January, and Mike Pence was named as chairman. It met frequently to address the pandemic and then explained its work in nightly press briefings, but these came to be dominated by Trump often attacking the media, veering off topic or uttering disinformation, and sometimes lasted more than two hours. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the president said that because of its success, \u201cthe Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. We may add or subtract people to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics.\u201d The pledge sowed confusion after both Trump and Pence indicated on Tuesday that the taskforce, which has begun to meet less frequently and had not held a press briefing in more than a week, was to be dismantled. Trump had told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re now looking at a little bit of a different form, and that form is safety and opening. And we\u2019ll have a different group probably set up for that.\u201d He later added, according to a pooled report: \u201cI thought we could wind it down sooner. But I had no idea how popular the taskforce is until actually yesterday when I started talking about winding down. It is appreciated by the public.\u201d And Pence had said: \u201cI think we\u2019re having conversations about that and about what the proper time is for the taskforce to complete its work and for the ongoing efforts to take place on an agency-by-agency level.\u201d The surprise remarks drew comparisons with the premature \u201cMission Accomplished\u201d banner that hung on an aircraft carrier where George W Bush addressed troops during the early stages of the Iraq war. It raised fears that Trump, with an eye on November\u2019s election, had all but abandoned health needs in favour of economic imperatives. Touring a face mask factory in Arizona, where he defied guidelines by not wearing a mask himself and where the James Bond theme song Live and Let Die played over loudspeakers, the president admitted: \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d A strong economy has long been Trump\u2019s central argument for re-election, but stay-at-home orders during the pandemic have wreaked havoc and wiped out at least 30m jobs. Trump regards recovery as politically vital as a series of opinion polls show him trailing election opponent Joe Biden. Undeterred by a coronavirus death toll already bigger than the US\u2019s in the Vietnam war, Trump has urged supporters to \u201cliberate\u201d states from pandemic restrictions and cheered on state governors who order reopenings in defiance of his own phased federal guidelines. Commentators suspect his strategy will be to claim credit for economic gains while shifting blame to governors for resurgences of the virus. Infection rates continue to increase outside New York, the hardest-hit state. On Monday, researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation almost doubled its previous US mortality model to more than 134,000. And a leaked internal White House report suggests that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 a day by June. The administration has also restricted coronavirus taskforce members from testifying before Congress unless they have \u201cexpress approval\u201d. The president said he stopped the infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci appearing before a House of Representatives committee because it is a \u201cset-up\u201d with a \u201cbunch of Trump-haters\u201d. But Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, said any attempt to sideline Fauci and response coordinator Deborah Birx was doomed. \u201cHe might try to marginalise them but the press isn\u2019t going to try to marginalise them. \u201cThey are the people with the data and with the expertise and nobody with data and expertise is going to be marginalised. It\u2019s going to be the politicians who don\u2019t listen to the scientists who are going to get marginalised.\u201d The White House suffered a further blow to its credibility this week when the New York Times reported that Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, turned to young and unqualified volunteers from consulting and private equity firms to help secure masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment for hospitals.",

The uneven progress of the virus means that places such as Minnesota, Nebraska and Puerto Rico are recording an alarming <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-caseloads-states-b24899a3-286e-4ea9-bd71-0e88ed645e68.html\">increase</a> in cases, with other states in the midwest and southwest also rising, such as Texas and Arizona, even as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have started to force infection rates slowly downwards.</p> <p>\u201cTypically pandemics occur in waves across different places, so people shouldn\u2019t think we are getting out of the woods just yet,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/ir2110\">Irwin Redlener</a>, a physician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of places haven\u2019t got the brunt of this yet. The worst is to come, it\u2019s inevitable. The public health restrictions make a difference and when you lift them you will see consequences. A premature opening will be a death sentence for people.\u201d</p> <p>The US has so far recorded more than 71,000 deaths as a result of Covid-19, the largest total of any country, with a leaked internal White House report projecting that deaths could climb to about 3,000 people a day by June.</p> <p>Despite this, the Trump administration\u2019s focus has shifted to restarting economic activity, a stance followed by several Republican-led states and cheered on by rightwing media, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida\">Florida</a> has reopened several beaches and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a> has allowed certain restaurants, hairdressers and nail salons to open, despite neither state experiencing a consistent decline in Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>While New York City has proven vulnerable to the spread of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1227248333871173632?s=20\">Covid-19</a> due to its dense population, more sparsely populated areas of the US are starting to see a surge in infections, leading to fears that under-resourced rural hospitals may struggle to cope with residents who are often older and less healthy than those in urban centres.</p> <p>The situation has proved a dilemma to governors who fret over economic collapse and a possible spate of suicides and mental health problems should lockdowns stretch indefinitely.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own response to the pandemic has included him dismissing concern over it as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-response-trump-us\">a hoax</a>, claiming erroneously it would vanish by April and then, in a stunning press conference, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">pondering</a> aloud the possible merits of injecting bleach into the lungs to treat the virus.</p> <p>Doctors and bleach manufacturers have strongly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-lysol-injection-claim-maker-hits-back\">urged</a> people not to take this highly dangerous action.</p> <p>From, at one point, calling himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d who would fight the virus, Trump has apparently withdrawn somewhat from the battlefield, conceding it is now \u201cpossible\u201d that many more Americans will die as public health restrictions are relaxed.</p> <p>The chaotic response to the pandemic was further highlighted by reports, confirmed by the US vice-president, Mike Pence, that the White House was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll\">planning</a> to winding down its coronavirus taskforce \u2013 only for Trump to say the following morning that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/trump-coronavirus-white-house-taskforce-covid-19\">the group will continue \u201cindefinitely\u201d</a>, but with a focus on reopening the economy. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the US government\u2019s top infectious disease official on the taskforce, has admitted that the testing regime has been lacking and that the lockdown of public activity came too late.</p> <p>The administration\u2019s greatest missteps, according to critics, have consistently centered around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-testing\">testing</a>. The US failed to develop and distribute an effective Covid-19 test in the early days of the outbreak and is now falling well short of the half a million tests <a href=\"https://globalepidemics.org/2020/04/18/why-we-need-500000-tests-per-day-to-open-the-economy-and-stay-open/\">experts say</a> is needed every day to safely allow people to tentatively resume the normal rhythms of life. There is also no systematic process to trace infected people in the US to help curb surges in new cases.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s painful to understand how badly we\u2019ve messed up the process of developing rapid tests in large numbers,\u201d said Redlener. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even close, less than 2% of the population has been tested, we don\u2019t even know the prevalence of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been nothing like the misinformation and incompetence we\u2019ve seen around Covid-19 in American history. Colleagues of mine overseas are in disbelief. I never thought I would long for the days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/richard-nixon\">Richard Nixon</a>, but here we are.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy of societal restrictions to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and opted instead to push for a restart of the US economy, a move that experts have warned is premature and risks handing a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to many Americans. The US president has praised governors of states that have started to loosen restrictions on social distancing and business activity, even though he has admitted that people will suffer as a result. \u201cWill some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d Trump said on Tuesday. \u201cBut we have to get our country open, and we have to get it open soon.\u201d Public health experts have pointed out that Covid-19 infections and deaths are mounting dangerously in much of the US. New York has drawn attention as a global hotspot for the virus but has now flattened its rate of infections whereas large parts of the country are still to reach their own peak. When New York is discounted, the US is still on an upward trajectory of new infections. More half of the 50 states are forging ahead with plans to reopen some businesses, even though none meet the White House\u2019s own key criteria of a steady decline in new cases over a 14-day period. The uneven progress of the virus means that places such as Minnesota, Nebraska and Puerto Rico are recording an alarming increase in cases, with other states in the midwest and southwest also rising, such as Texas and Arizona, even as New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have started to force infection rates slowly downwards. \u201cTypically pandemics occur in waves across different places, so people shouldn\u2019t think we are getting out of the woods just yet,\u201d said Irwin Redlener, a physician and director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness. \u201cA lot of places haven\u2019t got the brunt of this yet. The worst is to come, it\u2019s inevitable. The public health restrictions make a difference and when you lift them you will see consequences. A premature opening will be a death sentence for people.\u201d The US has so far recorded more than 71,000 deaths as a result of Covid-19, the largest total of any country, with a leaked internal White House report projecting that deaths could climb to about 3,000 people a day by June. Despite this, the Trump administration\u2019s focus has shifted to restarting economic activity, a stance followed by several Republican-led states and cheered on by rightwing media, including Fox News. Florida has reopened several beaches and Georgia has allowed certain restaurants, hairdressers and nail salons to open, despite neither state experiencing a consistent decline in Covid-19 cases. While New York City has proven vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19 due to its dense population, more sparsely populated areas of the US are starting to see a surge in infections, leading to fears that under-resourced rural hospitals may struggle to cope with residents who are often older and less healthy than those in urban centres. The situation has proved a dilemma to governors who fret over economic collapse and a possible spate of suicides and mental health problems should lockdowns stretch indefinitely. Trump\u2019s own response to the pandemic has included him dismissing concern over it as a hoax, claiming erroneously it would vanish by April and then, in a stunning press conference, pondering aloud the possible merits of injecting bleach into the lungs to treat the virus. Doctors and bleach manufacturers have strongly urged people not to take this highly dangerous action. From, at one point, calling himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d who would fight the virus, Trump has apparently withdrawn somewhat from the battlefield, conceding it is now \u201cpossible\u201d that many more Americans will die as public health restrictions are relaxed. The chaotic response to the pandemic was further highlighted by reports, confirmed by the US vice-president, Mike Pence, that the White House was planning to winding down its coronavirus taskforce \u2013 only for Trump to say the following morning that the group will continue \u201cindefinitely\u201d, but with a focus on reopening the economy. Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top infectious disease official on the taskforce, has admitted that the testing regime has been lacking and that the lockdown of public activity came too late. The administration\u2019s greatest missteps, according to critics, have consistently centered around testing. The US failed to develop and distribute an effective Covid-19 test in the early days of the outbreak and is now falling well short of the half a million tests experts say is needed every day to safely allow people to tentatively resume the normal rhythms of life. There is also no systematic process to trace infected people in the US to help curb surges in new cases. \u201cIt\u2019s painful to understand how badly we\u2019ve messed up the process of developing rapid tests in large numbers,\u201d said Redlener. \u201cWe aren\u2019t even close, less than 2% of the population has been tested, we don\u2019t even know the prevalence of the virus. \u201cThere\u2019s been nothing like the misinformation and incompetence we\u2019ve seen around Covid-19 in American history. Colleagues of mine overseas are in disbelief. I never thought I would long for the days of Richard Nixon, but here we are. It\u2019s frightening,\u201d he added.",

On Thursday the government is expected to formally extend the powers needed to continue the lockdown, but on Sunday the prime minister is likely to set out how the country might lift the strict measures that have paralysed the economy. What the government does and when will depend on safety considerations. Here we consider whether the government\u2019s five tests have been met. Test one: making sure the NHS can cope and continues to have sufficient capacity It is increasingly clear that the much-feared surge that had threatened to overwhelm the health service has been overcome. As far back as mid-April, NHS Providers was confident enough to say hospitals should be able to cope with a peak. Now cancelled operations are being restarted, as less than a third of critical care beds are occupied by people with Covid-19. In London, one of the first Nightingale hospitals set up to help meet demand is to be placed on standby and will no longer admit patients. Verdict: met. Test two: a \u2018sustained and consistent\u2019 fall in daily deaths Coronavirus deaths in hospitals have been falling and a peak has now been passed. However, as the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, Angela McLean, acknowledged on Tuesday, the UK is yet to \u201cget to grips\u201d with the number of deaths in care homes. The UK now has Europe\u2019s worst coronavirus death toll, having reached 29,427 on Tuesday, exceeding Italy\u2019s 29,029, which does not include suspected cases. McLean said the daily number of deaths had been falling steadily since the middle of April, though those in care homes were still rising in the week to 24 April. Verdict: being met.

He said the current estimate of the value of R was between 0.6 and 0.9. There are ongoing worries about increased transport usage, supported by government data. Verdict: not met. Test four: ensuring that supply of tests and personal protective equipment (PPE) can meet future demand An area where the government continues to face sustained criticism from the opposition and representative bodies for health and social care workers. On PPE, the pressure has lifted somewhat since 17 April, when hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies, but Boris Johnson conceded in parliament on Wednesday that there were continuing challenges. Operators of care homes complain that they are still struggling to source sufficient equipment and that staff are having trouble accessing testing. Testing remains an issue more broadly. While a programme for key workers has been ramped up, there are complaints that some testing centres are too far away from where they are needed and accessible only by car, while problems have arisen around delivery of home testing kits. As highlighted by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, the UK has fallen back below the 100,000 daily tests target reached at the end of last week, with only 69,463 carried out on Tuesday. The government also faces awkward questions about why it abandoned community testing early in March. Verdict: not met. Test five: avoiding a second peak that would risk overwhelming the NHS In the absence of a vaccine, which is not expected to be available until next year, this is potentially the most difficult test to overcome. At a basic level, the transformation of the NHS and creation of Nightingale hospitals at least give some degree of confidence that there are the beds and resources to avoid the health service being overwhelmed. But among other factors, meeting this test relies on the widespread and effective creation of a contact-tracing system. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has described this as a \u201chuge national undertaking of unprecedented scale and complexity\u201d, involving the rollout of the new NHS app and the recruitment of an army of contact tracers.

      "body": "<p>More than a month into coronavirus lockdown measures large parts of the British economy are now on life support. Nearly one in four UK workers have been furloughed in the past fortnight, with their wages subsidised by the state in an attempt to stop the unfolding economic crisis \u2013 already expected to be the deepest recession since 1709 \u2013 from getting even worse.</p> <p>So far the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme (CJRS) has protected 6.3m jobs at some 800,000 firms, with a price tag for the exchequer amounting to more than \u00a38bn by 3 May. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, as many as 4m redundancies have been avoided, but the workforce specialists have warned its \u201call or nothing\u201d format must be reviewed to help furloughed staff back into work.</p> <p>As the cost of running the furlough scheme spirals with much of the jobs market now being propped up by the state, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is weighing up his options over how best to wean Britain off emergency financial aid as lockdown controls are lifted.</p> <p>Under the current plan, workers who are furloughed have 80% of their wages paid by the government up to a ceiling of \u00a32,500 per month. At present, the CJRS wage subsidies are to remain in place until the end of June, although the chancellor is under mounting pressure to tell employers what he plans to do next.</p> <p>Providing firms with information before the end of next week about whether the scheme will carry on is crucial. This deadline exists because if there is no further support coming then firms may plan redundnancies and, if they are going to cut more than 100 jobs they must first run a 45-day consultation. As the scheme will close at the end of June without action, the deadline for that consultation to be launched is 18 May.</p> <p>Sunak\u2019s goal at the outset was to use the scheme to keep as many people as possible in their existing jobs. The theory was that there might be a V-shaped downturn and bounce back and the jobs subsidy would ensure workers would still be in place when the economy reopened.</p> <p>However, the costs have risen beyond the Treasury\u2019s initial expectations as the number of workers on the scheme has mushroomed. The bounce back is no longer expected to be swift, especially in businesses such as hospitality, leading a senior government source to warn the Times that Britain had grown \u201caddicted\u201d to the furlough scheme.</p> <p>In danger of costing the taxpayer as much as the NHS to run, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the CJRS could now cost \u00a342bn over three months if 8.3 million people are furloughed. If continually run at these levels, the Resolution Foundation predicts it would cost an additional \u00a312bn per month.</p> <p>Many within the Treasury regard the cost of inaction as far greater, with the priority to protect millions of jobs. In addition to harming personal lives and finances, stopping the scheme too soon could lead to a growing benefit bill, a weaker economy and greatly reduced tax revenue in future.</p> <p>Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said ministers needed to urgently adapt the scheme to align it with a phased restart of the economy.</p> <p>\u201cSupport must remain in place for firms that are not able to operate for an extended period and for those who face reduced capacity or demand for their services as a result of ongoing restrictions,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The options the chancellor has included:</p> <p><strong>Cliff edge</strong></p> <p>Business leaders warn the planned sudden end of the scheme in June could be a \u201ccliff edge\u201d that would trigger a huge number of redundancies without action. Sunak has promised to remove such a risk.</p> <p>There have been calls to extend the scheme until at least the autumn to help firms gradually restart their activities. According to a survey of more than 1,000 businesses by the CIPD, as many as 60% said that was the most important change Sunak could make.</p> <p>Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the CIPD, said: \u201cEven if the government extended for another month it would give them more breathing time to develop a scheme that is more flexible and provides employers with a timeline for weaning themselves off furlough and bringing people back to work.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is the cost: about \u00a34bn a week.</p> <p><strong>Sector approach</strong></p> <p>The government could take a gradual approach to restarting the economy by allowing some businesses to reopen before others. Those where there are higher risks of spreading infection, such as pubs and restaurants, could reopen last, and therefore need continuing taxpayer-funded wage support longest.</p> <p>Willmott said the government could maintain an 80% wage subsidy for hospitality firms, but cut it to 50%, or steadily roll back its support for other firms. \u201cSome sectors are being hit harder by the impact of the virus and demand in those parts of the economy will be slower to pick up,\u201d he added.</p> <p>There could however be challenges, as some activities do not fit neatly into a particular sector. In one example, some retailers have been able to stay open, while others have been forced to close.</p> <p><strong>Cutting the subsidy</strong></p> <p>The Treasury could reduce the level of the subsidy from 80% over time, although this could impose hardship for people if their companies did not top up their wages. It is understood that the Treasury is considering reducing the subsidy to 60%.</p> <p>Kate Bell, head of rights at the TUC, said subsidies would still be required for people who cannot go to work once lockdown has been lifted, such as people who still need to shield themselves for health reasons, or who would struggle to get their children to school.</p> <p>She said another option would be to ask businesses to set out jobs and wages plans on how theyare using the scheme to prevent redundancies, should they wish to continue receiving support.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies need to make a profit, but they need their workers to do that. Most people want a return to work, but you could see that some conditionality makes the scheme easier to operate,\u201d she added.</p> <p><strong>Flexible working on furlough</strong></p> <p>The government could allow some part-time working under the furlough scheme, topping up workers\u2019 salary payments. This could be used to ease businesses back to normal.</p> <p>Such a system could, however, be open to abuse. Some firms have forced staff to keep working while claiming public money to furlough them. The current breadth of the scheme, with limited flexibility on working time, was designed to reduce this risk, meaning tweaks and alterations could pave the way for further abuse.</p> <p><strong>Back to the 1970s</strong></p> <p>When Sunak first announced the scheme in March, he said it was for the \u201cfirst time in our history\u201d that the government was stepping in to help pay workers\u2019 wages.

      "bodyText": "The chancellor Rishi Sunak has held talks with nine of Britain\u2019s union leaders to try to reassure them plans to phase out the government\u2019s furlough scheme will be gradual and minimise the impact on unemployment. In the run-up to an announcement next week about the future of the wage subsidy scheme, Sunak sought to dampen union concerns that the coronavirus support package would be brought to an abrupt halt at the end of June. It comes as concerns grow in Westminster over the rising costs of the programme, with a cost to the public purse of between \u00a33bn and 4bn a week. There are fears it could match the level of spending on the NHS. Sunak told union leaders \u2013 including the TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady, the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey and the Unison general secretary Dave Prentis \u2013 that he was concerned the scheme was being abused by some companies, either because they did not need to furlough staff or because they were planning to go out of business when the subsidies came to an end. But he insisted that there would be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme and has been irked by stories \u2013 emanating from elsewhere in Whitehall \u2013 suggesting that workers were becoming \u201caddicted\u201d to wage top-ups worth up to 80% of monthly earnings up to a maximum of \u00a32,500. Unions have supported the furlough scheme since it was introduced just days after Britain went into lockdown in late March, seeing it as a way of preventing millions more workers being made unemployed. Sunak has also publicly thanked union bosses and business leaders for help in designing the job-retention scheme. Treasury officials are weighing up a range of options for the programme, which expanded quickly to cover more than 6 million workers within two weeks of being opened. During the virtual meeting, unions expressed anxiety about the furlough scheme being abused by employers planning to make redundancies anyway, and said there was a need for workers to be properly protected when they return to work as the economy comes out of lockdown. Discussions were also held about how the scheme could be made more flexible as the government begins the task of reopening the British economy after more than a month of tight controls on business and social life. A spokesman for the TUC said the unions had a constructive meeting with Sunak, discussing the job retention scheme and raising concerns about the government\u2019s back-to-work guidelines. \u201cWe repeated our call for employers to publish risk assessments to give workers the confidence they will be safe. And we pressed for ministers to beef up enforcement to ensure companies who flout the law face sanctions. \u201cIt is crucial government continues to consult with unions in the days ahead.\u201d With the furlough scheme costing an estimated \u00a314bn a month, the chancellor is keen to get the economy moving as soon as the health experts say it is safe to do so. Sunak made it clear he wanted to work with the unions so that when the government\u2019s five tests are met the public feel safe to return to work and the virus can be controlled effectively. Sources said he expressed concern on the call over the rising costs of the job retention scheme and that he wanted to keep working closely with unions and business leaders to shape the economic response to the coronavirus. The meeting was held to open fresh lines of communication between No 11 and unions as the government begins to lift lockdown restrictions. Relations during the Covid-19 outbreak have typically been through the TUC, although there was a desire to bring individual unions into direct dialogue to ease the reopening of the economy, including by involving those representing workers in some of the most heavily affected sectors, such as postal and retail employees. Alongside tailoring the job-retention scheme to fit with government plans to reopen the economy, Sunak is expected to update employers next week before a crucial deadline. Employers seeking to make more than 100 redundancies must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May is the last point they could start this process before the furlough scheme closes at the end of June. Among options believed to be under consideration for scaling back the support is allowing firms to cut workers hours to 15 a week with the taxpayer paying for the rest. Wage subsidies could be cut from 80% to 60% as an alternative, or subsidies could be kept for sectors where restrictions could be kept in place longer, such as for pubs and restaurants. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said it was vital to introduce a greater degree of flexibility to the scheme to support a phased return to work. Warning that switching off the scheme at the end of June would risk a flood of job losses, she said: \u201cI will continue to try to work with government to facilitate this, and ensure that jobs and incomes are protected.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Debenhams will permanently close a further five of its department stores, all located in shopping centres owned by the property firm Hammerson, putting 1,000 jobs at risk. The news came as Hammerson\u2019s deal to sell its retail parks to the private equity firm Orion also collapsed. Debenhams fell into administration for the second time in a year last month, as it sought to protect itself from legal action by its creditors during the pandemic. The latest closures to be announced, which include its stores in the Oracle shopping centre in Reading and in Birmingham\u2019s Bullring, means that 16 of its UK outlets will remain shuttered when lockdown restrictions are eased. Last month Debenhams said the so-called \u201clight touch\u201d administration, being handled by insolvency practitioners at FRP Advisory, aimed to \u201cget the business into a position to reopen and trade as many stores as possible again when restrictions are lifted\u201d. Since then, the retailer has been in negotiations with its landlords, and has reached agreement on 120 of its 142 sites, while the future of an additional six hangs in the balance. The majority of Debenhams\u2019 staff have been furloughed, although its website has continued to trade. Like other fashion retailers, the department store chain, which employed more than 20,000 people before administration, has been badly affected by the coronavirus lockdown. However, Debenhams was struggling with a \u00a3600m debt pile before the crisis led to the temporary closure of all of its stores. Its deteriorating finances resulted in administration in April 2019, which wiped out the firm\u2019s shareholders and transferred ownership to a group of financial investors including the US hedge funds Silver Point and GoldenTree. Debenhams has previously used an insolvency process employed by other struggling retailers, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), to enable it to cut rents and close unprofitable stores, including 19 shops which shut for good in January. Since the coronavirus lockdown it has written to landlords asking for a five-month rent holiday and written to its suppliers to inform them they would be getting their money a month later than expected as it seeks to conserve cash. Hammerson, one of Britain\u2019s biggest shopping centre owners, said in April that its rent takings had fallen by two-thirds as struggling retailers tried to cut costs. It reported it had received a flood of requests for rent deferrals or waivers as the majority of its tenants had been forced to close their stores during the lockdown. The company, which owns Brent Cross in London, will now be left with five vacancies in its malls which were previously occupied by Debenhams outlets. In a further blow to the property company, it said its \u00a3400m deal to sell seven retail parks to Orion had been scrapped, after the private equity firm said it would not complete the purchase. Hammerson said it would keep the \u00a321m deposit it had received from Orion. However, this was not enough to appease investors, and Hammerson\u2019s shares closed 14% lower on Wednesday.",

Meanwhile the continued high number of new Covid-19 cases \u2013 6,111 on Tuesday \u2013 is likely to deter ministers from more radical steps. Since the lockdown began six weeks ago, the public have been urged only to leave their homes to buy essentials such as food or medicine; to exercise once a day; or to go to work if they cannot do so from home. The restriction on exercise has seen police officers accused of overreach, for moving on lone sunbathers or scolding members of the public for taking a rest on a park bench. The government has been urging local authorities to keep parks open where possible, and confirmed that businesses such as DIY stores and garden centres can operate click-and-collect services, where goods can be picked up while observing social distancing. Significant changes in schools are also expected, with teachers and unions expecting that Johnson will on Sunday confirm the 1 June start date for schools to reopen, beginning with children aged 10 and 11 in year six. Other primary year groups are expected to follow shortly after, and then for years 10 and 12 \u2013 the first years for GCSE and A-level courses respectively \u2013 to also return to secondary schools. The decision means that pupils in England could return months before those in Scotland, after Nicola Sturgeon warned that Scottish schools may be shut until the end of the summer holidays. Scotland\u2019s school year ends on 24 June, three weeks before England. Questions remain about how schools in England will be expected to source personal protective equipment, especially for staff in reception classes where children as young as four require close attention. In a joint letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, the National Education Union and Parentkind \u2013 formerly the Parent-Teachers\u2019 Association UK \u2013 warned \u201cthere is a risk of chaos and a greater spread of the virus\u201d unless parents and staff were reassured about the safety of reopening. Other measures still under consideration include the creation of social \u201cbubbles\u201d, allowing households to mix with a limited number of others. Downing Street has not ruled out this option \u2013 though some ministers are sceptical about how it could be enforced in practice. One Whitehall source warned that if people failed to stick to the rules carefully, it could lead to \u201ca catastrophic epidemiological demonstration of the rule of six degrees of separation\u201d. Ministers are also keen to get more people back to work where it is impractical for them to work from home, though draft guidelines for safe working have prompted a furious backlash from unions this week. None of the changes announced on Sunday are likely to affect those with underlying health conditions, who have been asked to \u201cshield\u201d themselves from the virus by continuing to remain permanently at home. The relatively modest shift is likely to infuriate Conservative MPs who have criticised the impingement on the public\u2019s liberties and the economic costs of the lockdown. Chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, Graham Brady, has called for the lifting of \u201carbitrary rules and limitations on freedom as quickly as possible\u201d and suggested the public had been \u201ca little too willing to stay at home\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine if the denizens of Eyam had had smartphones. Imagine if medieval peasants had had Twitter (#BlackDeath1347) or Constantinople had had a WhatsApp group when the Plague of Justinian arrived. What we would have to pore over now.</p> <p>Our own pandemic, of course, is easily the best-recorded in history. Coronavirus scholars in generations to come will be swamped by the material available to study. As they sift and sort and weigh and analyse competing versions of competing truths, they will probably long for a return to simpler times when scarcity of evidence bedevilled a historian\u2019s attempts to discover the past, but you could at least marshal it all into a lever arch or two and know roughly where you stood.</p> <p>They may seize on the likes of <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/nhs-heroes-fighting-to-save-our-lives\">NHS Heroes: Fighting to Save Our Lives</a> (Channel 4) as ports in a storm \u2013 or perhaps anchors in an ever-swirling sea of potential knowledge. An assortment of medics (and one chief executive) at various hospitals in departments directly or indirectly affected by Covid-19 film themselves, talking directly to their smartphones about it in real time. Their eyewitness accounts are given from eerily empty institutional corridors (\u201cEverything we normally do has ceased to exist \u2026 it\u2019s just Covid\u201d) or PPE stations, as they don the flimsy plastic gear that they hope will stand between them and infection. It\u2019s as compelling as you would expect. Special mention must be made \u2013 probably with regard to every programme in whatever genre is made under lockdown conditions \u2013 to the editing team, whose ability to build a coherent narrative and well-paced piece from disparate sources is needed more than ever.</p> <p>The acuteness and particularity of the stresses frontline medical staff face are brought vividly home. Luke Sumner, a nurse leading a 20-strong team in Blackpool, talks about his conscience and the responsibility he would feel if any of them fell ill. He finds it hard not to take on the world\u2019s suffering. \u201cIt\u2019s really overwhelming. You go home feeling a bit guilty. It\u2019s hard to shake that feeling.\u201d The empathy that makes a good nurse can be the very thing that breaks them when there is nowhere to go and no time to recover.</p> <p>London ICU consultant Rony Berrebi conveys the scale and intensity of the crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a terrorist attack on the doorstep of your hospital twice a day, for weeks and months \u2026 I\u2019m quite a stable guy, but the magnitude is huge.\u201d Trainee paediatrician Kiran Rahim is transferred to her hospital\u2019s intensive care ward as a nursing assistant.

      "bodyText": "Imagine if the denizens of Eyam had had smartphones. Imagine if medieval peasants had had Twitter (#BlackDeath1347) or Constantinople had had a WhatsApp group when the Plague of Justinian arrived. What we would have to pore over now. Our own pandemic, of course, is easily the best-recorded in history. Coronavirus scholars in generations to come will be swamped by the material available to study. As they sift and sort and weigh and analyse competing versions of competing truths, they will probably long for a return to simpler times when scarcity of evidence bedevilled a historian\u2019s attempts to discover the past, but you could at least marshal it all into a lever arch or two and know roughly where you stood. They may seize on the likes of NHS Heroes: Fighting to Save Our Lives (Channel 4) as ports in a storm \u2013 or perhaps anchors in an ever-swirling sea of potential knowledge. An assortment of medics (and one chief executive) at various hospitals in departments directly or indirectly affected by Covid-19 film themselves, talking directly to their smartphones about it in real time. Their eyewitness accounts are given from eerily empty institutional corridors (\u201cEverything we normally do has ceased to exist \u2026 it\u2019s just Covid\u201d) or PPE stations, as they don the flimsy plastic gear that they hope will stand between them and infection. It\u2019s as compelling as you would expect. Special mention must be made \u2013 probably with regard to every programme in whatever genre is made under lockdown conditions \u2013 to the editing team, whose ability to build a coherent narrative and well-paced piece from disparate sources is needed more than ever. The acuteness and particularity of the stresses frontline medical staff face are brought vividly home. Luke Sumner, a nurse leading a 20-strong team in Blackpool, talks about his conscience and the responsibility he would feel if any of them fell ill. He finds it hard not to take on the world\u2019s suffering. \u201cIt\u2019s really overwhelming. You go home feeling a bit guilty. It\u2019s hard to shake that feeling.\u201d The empathy that makes a good nurse can be the very thing that breaks them when there is nowhere to go and no time to recover. London ICU consultant Rony Berrebi conveys the scale and intensity of the crisis. \u201cIt\u2019s like having a terrorist attack on the doorstep of your hospital twice a day, for weeks and months \u2026 I\u2019m quite a stable guy, but the magnitude is huge.\u201d Trainee paediatrician Kiran Rahim is transferred to her hospital\u2019s intensive care ward as a nursing assistant. Paediatrics, she notes, does not prepare you for a place in which your patients die each day. There were only a few passing mentions of the (un)availability of PPE, but one of them was quite something. Executive Caroline Shaw noted how its use in her hospital had doubled after one of the most beloved members of staff \u2013 Christine Emerson, a nurse for 20 years \u2013 died of coronavirus. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to challenge them for inappropriate use,\u201d she said. \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t have done it on a day a colleague died.\u201d As an illustration of the gulf in temperament and approach between administrators and medical personnel, it was as perfect as it was chilling. As the weeks wear on and the death toll mounts, testimonies become more exhausted and more tearful. Luke recounts how he held the hand of a patient who died without their family, and told him how peaceful the world is now that there are no cars on the road and everyone is at home, while the daughter of the man dying in the next bed told her father \u2013 via iPad \u2013 that his late wife was waiting for him. \u201cI pretty much filled my goggles with tears,\u201d he said. Three of Rony\u2019s colleagues have died. He is not alone in dreading the breakdown in mental health among frontline workers that is bound to come once the peak of the emergency passes. Anger too \u2013 and was there ever a more righteous kind? \u2013 begins to surface. \u201cWe work out of a sense of moral duty,\u201d says Kiran, \u201cand the government relies on that. But sooner or later it\u2019s going to run out.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 7 May. Top stories One in four Australians are afraid they will lose their job over the next year due to coronavirus. Australians have already suffered a $102bn blow to household income and more than 600,000 have lost jobs, with people aged 18-24 and women from non-English-speaking backgrounds the worst affected. As Scott Morrison begins to push to \u201cflatten the curve of unemployment\u201d, we look at what safe workplaces could look like. Meanwhile, Puerto Rico is facing an acute shortage of Covid-19 testing kits after a $59m deal with an obscure Australian medical company fell through. And Labor has asked the auditor general to examine commonwealth debt, accusing the Coalition of doubling gross debt since it took office in 2013. Spain has extended its state of emergency until 24 May, as leading European nations such as Germany begin to ease lockdown conditions. The successful vote to extend emergency status followed acrimonious scenes inside parliament in Madrid, on a day in which the World Health Organization director warned of the \u201cvery real\u201d threat of a return to lockdowns if transitions weren\u2019t carefully handled. Iran has recorded its highest one-day tally of new infections since 11 April, with 1,680 cases overnight after it relaxed restrictions on movement. The UK is set to announce an easing of restrictions next week, despite global criticism of its perceived mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Russia has recorded more than 10,000 new positive infections for a fourth consecutive day. And Donald Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy of societal restrictions to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and opted instead to push for a restart of the US economy, a move that experts have warned is premature and risks handing a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d to many Americans. Cedar Meats, the meat-processing plant in Victoria at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster, was not told it could be dealing with an outbreak of coronavirus for three days after someone connected to the facility was diagnosed, according to a spokeswoman for the company. The cluster at the processing plant has risen to 49 after an additional four cases were confirmed on Wednesday morning. Australia The NSW deputy premier John Barilaro has ignored his own advice for people not to travel during the coronavirus pandemic, revealing he visited his second property over the weekend \u2013 an act that saw arts minister Don Harwin resign last month and saw him fined under the state\u2019s lockdown laws. A community campaign to halt the clearing of bushland that had survived the recent bushfires crisis has been successful, with developers announcing a two-week suspension on the site on the south coast of NSW. Negotiations are now expected to consider potential alternatives to clearing the bushland. Sections of the child abuse royal commission report pertaining to Cardinal George Pell will be made public for the first time, more than two years after the report was delivered to parliament. The world An Egyptian film-maker, held without trial for more than two years, has died inside prison, with authorities saying the 24-year-old had mistakenly drunk hand sanitiser in his cell, thinking it was water. Shady Habash produced a music video that was critical of president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Airbnb has made a quarter of its global workforce redundant, with revenues forecast to be halved in 2020 by around $2.4bn amid what the company\u2019s co-founder called \u201cthe most harrowing crisis of our lifetime\u201d. Domestic bookings in some European countries have shown signs of recovery though, the accommodation platform reports. Indigenous leaders in Brazil\u2019s Amazon basin fear president Jair Bolsonaro is using the coronavirus pandemic as a smokescreen to extend land-grabbing practices. A new presidential decree before congress would allow farmers to legalise plots of up to 2,500 hectares claimed from within government reserves. Astronomers are hailing the discovery of the closest black hole to Earth yet, just 1,000 light years away. HR 6819 has a mass over four times the sun, and its composition and relation to nearby stars is said to be unlike other black holes previously identified. Recommended reads The closure of the Carriageworks arts precinct in Sydney is just the first of many major shutdowns, Australian art leaders have warned, unless there is \u201cenormous action\u201d. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing right across Australia is a total loss of self-generated income for galleries\u201d, writes Elissa Blake, and with major players such as the Museum of Contemporary Art losing 40% of its funding overnight, further closures beckon. Times are tough for everyone, but young workers have taken the economic hit hardest, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cYounger workers inevitably have less attachment to any job than older workers, they are usually less skilled and are therefore easier to replace when things pick up again. But while previous recessions have seen massive falls in the number of youth employed, nothing compares to what we are seeing now.\u201d If you\u2019re feeling short of a laugh, we have a new series for you: the funniest things on the internet. And kicking it off is one of our favourite Australian comics, Zo\u00eb Coombs Marr, sifting the webosphere for her top 10 giggles: from Terrible Tom the turkey to vintage French and Saunders. Listen The global race for face masks. When the coronavirus began spreading beyond China in January, the race to buy up any available personal protective equipment went global. In today\u2019s episode of Full Story, we look at the frenzy of buying and how the race to obtain masks shows no sign of slowing down. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Other media reports indicate the Houston Rockets are among those considering opening on Friday, with Texas\u2019s stay-at-home orders having expired. With much of the professional sports calendar on hold, many leagues across North America are considering whether and how their seasons could resume. Major League Soccer returned to training on Wednesday with strict rules in place, while Nascar plans to resume competition on 17 May without fans. The NBA was among the first to see its season impacted by the coronavirus outbreak, with games called off at the last minute after a Utah Jazz player tested positive for the coronavirus in March.",

      "body": "<p>What\u2019s the safest way for Rishi Sunak to wind down his wage-support furlough scheme? Well, start by finding the correct language. The imagery in the current political talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july\">\u201cweaning\u201d businesses off an \u201caddiction\u201d</a> is absurd.</p> <p>When the chancellor introduced the coronavirus job retention scheme on 20 March, he said it was to \u201cprotect, as far as possible, people\u2019s jobs and incomes\u201d. There will be trouble if, less than two months later and with lockdown still in place, companies and their workers are portrayed as needy infants or addicts who should know better.</p> <p>None of which is to deny that the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of wages for laid-up employees up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, will require reform when current arrangements expire at the end of next month.</p> <p>The Treasury cannot afford to spend \u00a310bn-plus a month indefinitely. On the other hand, it would be self-defeating, having spent so heavily already, to squander the benefits by withdrawing support overnight. Even more jobs would lost instantly. The sooner Sunak rules out the \u201ccliff-edge\u201d option, the better.</p> <p>Beyond that, though, the trade-offs are fiendishly difficult, as a few statistics from an Institute of Directors\u2019 poll of its members illustrate. Only half thought they could operate at pre-crisis levels under physical distancing rules. More than one in five thought they could work at less than half capacity. And 53% of firms thought it would take more than a month to return to pre-lockdown levels of activity even if lockdown ended and demand returned to normal.</p> <p>There is no painless way through that thicket, as Sunak understood when he placed the conditional \u201cas far as possible\u201d clause around his job-protection ambitions. Some sectors, such as the airline industry, will just emerge smaller and there\u2019s no point pretending otherwise.</p> <p>It should, however, be possible to ease transition elsewhere, even if the 80% rate of wage support has to be reduced gradually. The persuasive appeal from business is for flexibility. So allow full-time workers to return on a part-time basis with wages topped up by the state. And ditch the requirement for a furloughed worker to be rested for at least three weeks; companies may have little visibility on demand from one week to the next, so move to weekly or even daily arrangements.</p> <p>Those technical tweaks are relatively easy to adopt; they\u2019re open to abuse, but so is the current set-up. It is vital that Sunak gives details very soon on how a physically distant economy will be supported. Delay and uncertainty can also cost jobs.</p> <h2>JD Sports\u2019 grumble over Footasylum seems fair</h2> <p>Footasylum must be saved for the nation, or least for buyers of trainers and sportswear, says the Competition and Markets Authority. JD Sports, which bought its much-smaller rival for a mere \u00a390m last year, must undo its purchase and find a buyer.</p> <p>Peter Cowgill, the chairman of JD Sports, detected the influence of Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley at work.

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s the safest way for Rishi Sunak to wind down his wage-support furlough scheme? Well, start by finding the correct language. The imagery in the current political talk about \u201cweaning\u201d businesses off an \u201caddiction\u201d is absurd. When the chancellor introduced the coronavirus job retention scheme on 20 March, he said it was to \u201cprotect, as far as possible, people\u2019s jobs and incomes\u201d. There will be trouble if, less than two months later and with lockdown still in place, companies and their workers are portrayed as needy infants or addicts who should know better. None of which is to deny that the furlough scheme, which guarantees 80% of wages for laid-up employees up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month, will require reform when current arrangements expire at the end of next month. The Treasury cannot afford to spend \u00a310bn-plus a month indefinitely. On the other hand, it would be self-defeating, having spent so heavily already, to squander the benefits by withdrawing support overnight. Even more jobs would lost instantly. The sooner Sunak rules out the \u201ccliff-edge\u201d option, the better. Beyond that, though, the trade-offs are fiendishly difficult, as a few statistics from an Institute of Directors\u2019 poll of its members illustrate. Only half thought they could operate at pre-crisis levels under physical distancing rules. More than one in five thought they could work at less than half capacity. And 53% of firms thought it would take more than a month to return to pre-lockdown levels of activity even if lockdown ended and demand returned to normal. There is no painless way through that thicket, as Sunak understood when he placed the conditional \u201cas far as possible\u201d clause around his job-protection ambitions. Some sectors, such as the airline industry, will just emerge smaller and there\u2019s no point pretending otherwise. It should, however, be possible to ease transition elsewhere, even if the 80% rate of wage support has to be reduced gradually. The persuasive appeal from business is for flexibility. So allow full-time workers to return on a part-time basis with wages topped up by the state. And ditch the requirement for a furloughed worker to be rested for at least three weeks; companies may have little visibility on demand from one week to the next, so move to weekly or even daily arrangements. Those technical tweaks are relatively easy to adopt; they\u2019re open to abuse, but so is the current set-up. It is vital that Sunak gives details very soon on how a physically distant economy will be supported. Delay and uncertainty can also cost jobs. JD Sports\u2019 grumble over Footasylum seems fair Footasylum must be saved for the nation, or least for buyers of trainers and sportswear, says the Competition and Markets Authority. JD Sports, which bought its much-smaller rival for a mere \u00a390m last year, must undo its purchase and find a buyer. Peter Cowgill, the chairman of JD Sports, detected the influence of Sports Direct\u2019s Mike Ashley at work. He\u2019s probably wrong on that score because the CMA\u2019s boffins are quite capable of coming up with odd decisions under their own steam. Cowgill\u2019s substantive grumble seems fair. Yes, as the CMA said, Footasylum is \u201ca close competitor\u201d with JD in the sense that both chains operate in the same market. But the more obviously anti-competitive forces are Nike and Adidas, both now acting as suppliers and direct-to-consumer online retailers. Footasylum, remember, was struggling badly when JD swooped, so would-be buyers in the current Covid climate may be thin on the ground. If the only volunteer turns out to be Ashley, the CMA can hold yet another inquiry. This saga, though, seems a lot of fuss about very little. Ocado-style bonuses should now be off-limits The shareholder rebellion over boardroom pay at Ocado was 30% \u2013 a minority, but a significant minority. Indeed, it was bigger than last year\u2019s 25%. The online grocer has no intention of changing its ways on pay, as the chairman, Lord Rose, made clear in his peevish response. Since Ocado is currently the hottest stock in the FTSE 100 index, there will probably be zero consequences. But let\u2019s hope the broader message in the vote has been understood elsewhere: uncapped incentive schemes, such as the Ocado variety that paid \u00a388m to four directors, should now be off-limits at public companies.",

      "bodyText": "People with mental health problems are ending up in crisis and at higher risk of suicide because they cannot get their usual help from the NHS during the lockdown, a leading charity has warned. Those struggling with serious conditions have found it hard to cope because their appointments have been cancelled and they have had trouble getting support from their GP, the mental health charity Mind said. The lack of care increased the danger of them self-harming, it said. One in four people who have tried to access help to deal with mental health issues in the past two weeks have not been able to do so, the Mind survey found. Some reported being turned away by mental health crisis teams that support people who may be suicidal, while others said they could not get in touch with their local community mental health team. The findings show the impact of the huge changes NHS services have made in recent weeks, especially the halting of most face-to-face contact with outpatients to reduce the risk to staff and patients of coronavirus infections. The survey comes amid growing fear that the unprecedented restrictions on people\u2019s movements, and consequent isolation from family and friends, will lead to a sharp rise in anxiety and depression, especially for those who already have a psychological condition. Paul Farmer, Mind\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cA vast number of us have seen our mental health deteriorate during the coronavirus crisis. It is therefore deeply concerning that people are struggling to get the help that they urgently need. Evidence shows that when people do not get support early enough, they end up in crisis. \u201cPeople with mental health problems have been hit hard by the current situation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are particularly worried that some are being discharged too early from hospital, while others have been left languishing on mental health wards because of the current limited availability of community support. Being sent home at the wrong time can delay recovery and, at worst, puts people at high risk of suicide.\u201d People with acute mental health needs \u201cmust not be forgotten\u201d as a result of the NHS transformation to prioritise Covid-19 patients, Farmer said. The results are based on Mind\u2019s survey of 5,565 people with direct experience of mental health problems, of whom 3,895 had used mental health services. A fifth had sought help from NHS mental health services in the past fortnight, but a quarter could not get it. Among those, 24% said they had trouble contacting a GP or community mental health team, and 22% were uncomfortable using the telephone or video call technology to talk to their nurse, therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist. A fifth (22%) had had their appointment cancelled. Some of the respondents had sought help from a private health provider or charity. One respondent told Mind: \u201cMy mental health has got worse because there is no help anywhere. I went to A&amp;E suicidal and was told that there was nothing they could do. I contacted the crisis team and they said the same.\u201d Another said: \u201cI have schizoaffective disorder and have a fantastic support team. My community psychiatric nurse, support worker and GP have all pulled out of my care. I can only access them on the phone for very short periods.\u201d Andy Bell, the deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health thinktank, said: \u201cIt is worrying that large numbers of people with mental health difficulties are not able to get help at this time. It\u2019s really important that mental health services stay open for business as much as possible, but with proper protection for both staff and patients. \u201cWarnings that the pandemic may increase the number of people who tragically die by suicide also need to be taken seriously. It is not inevitable if we put in place the right support for people who feel suicidal, or who are at high risk of losing their lives.\u201d Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health, said people who needed help should seek it from NHS services. \u201cThe NHS is pulling out all the stops to respond to the biggest global health threat in a century, while also ensuring people can still safely access the mental health services they need, so our message to anyone experiencing poor mental health is: the NHS is here for you, please help us help you, and come forward for the care you need.\u201d In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

A reminder that you can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan. I\u2019ll be firing up a new blog soon, but in the meantime here is a summary of the most important developments from the last few hours: Trump said the White House coronavirus task force would \u201ccontinue on indefinitely,\u201d a reversal from his comments yesterday suggesting the group\u2019s work would be winding down. The president said today he \u201chad no idea how popular the task force is.\u201d Trump suggests more deaths a necessary price. US President Donald Trump has again suggested the country may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy.\u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 John Roberts when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d Coronavirus threatens eurozone\u2019s future, Brussels warns. The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU\u2019s economic commissioner warns. Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully. The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains \u2018emergency brake\u2019. The country\u2019s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month \u2013 one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week. The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d. Spain extends state of emergency after bitter political dispute. Pred Sanchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government secured an extension until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. Diplomatic split widens amid virus origin row and China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic. China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. China\u2019s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. The US-China relationship is one of disappointment and frustration, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said, highlighting the deepening rift between Washington and Beijing. Sweden nears 3,000 deaths. \u201cWe are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,\u201d Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country\u2019s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded; an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance. Iran warns of \u2018rising trend\u2019 as virus cases top 100,000. Iran records 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, taking its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country\u2019s apparent success in controlling the epidemic has gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days. \u2018More than 90,000 health workers infected worldwide\u2019. At least 90,000 healthcare workers globally are believed to have been infected, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) says, noting that the the true figure could be as much as twice that. It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records. Brazil\u2019s health ministry has announced 615 more deaths from coronavirus, with a total of 8,536 people now having died. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 125,218. An unidentified player at the Serie A club Torino has tested positive in the first round of testing before the side\u2019s planned return to training on Friday. Serie A teams have begun returning to training this week after Italy\u2019s eight-week lockdown, the longest in Europe, although there has still been no decision on when, or if, the season can start again. The club said: During the first medical examinations carried out on the players of Torino, a positive result emerged for Covid-19. The player, currently asymptomatic, was immediately placed in quarantine and will be constantly monitored. The spokesman for Brazil\u2019s far-right president has tested positive, the former\u2019s office has said, raising further questions about Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s own exposure to the virus. Ot\u00e1vio do R\u00eago Barros is quarantined in his home and has no symptoms, while his staff are awaiting test results in their own homes, his office added. The US-China relationship is one of disappointment and frustration, the White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has said, highlighting the deepening rift between Washington and Beijing. The remarks, delivered during a White House press briefing, come as China and the United States clash over the origins of the virus. Paris will hold a men\u2019s fashion week in virtual format from 9 to 13 July for the Men Spring/Summer collections 2021, organisers have said. A statement from the Federation de la Haute Couture et de la Mode read: This event will be structured around a dedicated platform. Each house will be represented in the form of a creative film/video. In late March, organisers said they had to cancel the men\u2019s and haute couture fashion weeks in Paris because of the pandemic. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 2,523 more deaths; taking the total in the world\u2019s worst-affected country to 70,802. The CDC said 22,303 new cases have been identified, making 1,193,813, overall. The former UK prime minister Gordon Brown has described the level of testing being carried out in the country as \u201calmost criminal\u201d. The British government is carrying out significantly fewer than the 100,000 tests per day it promised to be doing by now. Nevertheless, the current prime minister Boris Johnson is now claiming he wants to increase capacity, if not actual testing, to a potential 200,000 per day. But Brown has told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that that number \u2013 even if it represented actual completed tests \u2013 would still be insufficient. You\u2019ve got to do more than 200,000 and you\u2019ve got to over time be able to say to the one and a half million health service workers, the one and a half million in the care sector, 1.7 million in construction, three million in retail, one million that have got contact with the public \u2013 police, fire \u2013 teachers and everything else, you\u2019ve got to be able to say to them: \u2018We can reassure you that you\u2019ll go back to work because we are going to offer you the testing that will find out whether you\u2019ve got it or whether other people you are working with have got it so we can actually isolate those people that have it\u2019. Brown, who served as the most recent Labour prime minister from 2007 to 2010, added: You take old people\u2019s homes ... why is it the case that every resident and every care worker is not being tested? It seems to me almost criminal that you\u2019ve got to a stage where people are dying and where the only time that testing comes in apart from the random testing, is when people identify someone who\u2019s a carrier of the disease. You\u2019ve got to test before because people have no symptoms and they\u2019re passing on the disease. So you\u2019ve got to have prior testing, and every old people\u2019s home, every care worker, every health service worker, every person who\u2019s a frontline, making contact with the public, they\u2019ve got to be tested over the next few weeks. Scientists who advise the UK government on its coronavirus strategy have warned they are being drawn into politics after the leading infectious disease modeller Prof Neil Ferguson stepped down as one of the cabinet\u2019s most prominent advisers, Ian Sample, Kate Proctor and Rowena Mason write. Ferguson, the head of the Imperial College team whose modelling persuaded ministers that Britain needed to order a lockdown to prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, resigned from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Tuesday night. Ferguson left the position after it emerged his lover had visited his home on two occasions in March and April in a breach of the government\u2019s official guidance on social distancing. One scientific adviser to the government said Ferguson\u2019s resignation had created \u201can awful lot of concern\u201d and that the mood in the community was \u201cvery depressed\u201d. The events revealed how university academics who lent their advice to government were having to cope with an increasingly difficult situation, the adviser added. He\u2019s an academic researcher. He doesn\u2019t make decisions. He\u2019s not paid for any of this. We are being drawn into a political situation which is very unpleasant. Senior advisers to the White House on dealing with the pandemic, Dr Anthony Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, will continue to hold their positions on the coronavirus task force, Trump has said. The US president Donald Trump has again suggested the country may need to accept the reality of more deaths in order to start reopening the economy. \u201cWe have to be warriors,\u201d Trump told Fox News\u2019 John Roberts when asked if Americans should expect additional deaths as the country looks to reopen. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed down for years.\u201d The president added, \u201cHopefully that won\u2019t be the case ... but it could very well be the case.\u201d Trump similarly said yesterday while visiting a mask production facility in Arizona, \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d Mexico\u2019s president has claimed reports of violence against women have not increased during a nationwide lockdown, despite official data showing an increase in instances of physical abuse. Domestic violence is rising across Latin America, with strict limits on movement to curb the spread of the new coronavirus leaving many women isolated at home with abusive partners, rights groups say. Emergency calls reporting attacks on women in Mexico increased 20% in March compared to the previous month, according to government data seen by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters reports that Mexico\u2019s president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has claimed there has \u201cbeen no increase in complaints.\u201d The leftist leader said: Yes there\u2019s machismo but there\u2019s also a lot of family fraternity. Concern over domestic abuse has risen globally, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women increasing in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. Rights groups said L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s comments contradicted the government\u2019s own data. Tania Renaum, the executive director of Amnesty International Mexico, said: It\u2019s a very bad signal that the president says violence hasn\u2019t increased when the (hotline calls) gives clear, uncontroversial data. The White House appeared to be in fresh disarray on Wednesday as Donald Trump insisted that his coronavirus taskforce would remain in place \u2013 less than 24 hours after suggesting it would be disbanded. The US president reversed course following a backlash against moves to wind down the taskforce even as the country reports about 30,000 new cases a day and the death toll moves past 70,000, the highest in the world. But Trump did confirm a switch in focus to reviving America\u2019s devastated economy, fuelling anxiety that he has made a cold political calculation to put his re-election chances ahead of saving lives. For the fourth time in five days, Chile has reported a daily increase of more than 1,000 cases, representing an alarming uptick in the country\u2019s contagion rate. As recently as last week, the government had called for a \u201cgradual return to normality\u201d. However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d. According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive. Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases. But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns. Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital. Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies. Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune. Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason has said. We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland. However, it is extremely important to remain vigilant and minimise the risk of a renewed outbreak. A genetic study of samples from more than 7,500 infected people suggests the virus spread quickly around the world after it emerged in China sometime between October and December last year. Scientists at University College London\u2019s Genetics Institute have said they found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of SARS-CoV-2, which they said showed how it was adapting to its human hosts as it spread. In a study published in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, the research team co-led by Francois Balloux wrote: Phylogenetic estimates support that the Covid-2 pandemic started sometime around 6 October 2019 to 11 December 2019, which corresponds to the time of the host jump into humans. Balloux said the analysis also found that the virus was and is mutating, as normally happens with viruses, and that a large proportion of the global genetic diversity of the virus causing Covid-19 was found in all of the hardest-hit countries. That suggests SARS-CoV-2 was being transmitted extensively around the world from early on in the epidemic, he said. In the UK, a Cambridge University statistician has demanded that the prime minister stop citing his article as evidence that no international comparisons should be made. Speaking to the Commons today, Johnson quoted the piece by Prof David Spiegelhalter in the Guardian and added that there will be a time later to look at what went wrong. Spiegelhalter has tweeted: That\u2019s it for me today, I\u2019m handing over the blog to my colleague Kevin Rawlinson. Thanks to everyone who got in touch and as always, thanks for reading along. Coronavirus threatens eurozone\u2019s future, Brussels warns. The eurozone faces an existential threat if the economic recoveries of its 19 member states are insufficiently even, the EU\u2019s economic commissioner warns. Some countries are expected to suffer significantly more than others during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \u201cSuch divergence poses a threat to the single market and the euro area \u2013 yet it can be mitigated through decisive, joint European action,\u201d Paolo Gentiloni says. WHO warns of more lockdowns if transition not managed carefully. The director general of the World Health Organization warns of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus lists a series of steps needed before countries should lift restrictions, such as surveillance controls and health system preparedness. Germany eases restrictions but retains \u2018emergency brake\u2019. The country\u2019s top football league, the Bundesliga, is set to resume this month \u2013 one of various restrictions to be lifted as Germans are once again allowed to meet a limited number of friends and family and some shops are allowed to reopen. The country still has a long way to go, its chancellor, Angela Merkel, says, and its 16 states will each be able to operate an \u201cemergency break\u201d if faced with a surge in new infections. UK could start easing virus lockdown next week. The British government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, says, adding his hope that some measures could come into force the following day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson says \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d. Spain extends state of emergency after bitter political dispute. Pred Sanchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government secured an extension until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. China shrugs off US claims and calls for focus on beating pandemic. China will not invite international experts in to investigate the source of Covid-19 while the pandemic is still raging, its UN ambassador says. And, continuing the diplomatic back-and-forth between Beijing and Washington, China\u2019s foreign ministry says the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is wrong to claim he has evidence suggesting the virus originated in a Chinese lab. Sweden nears 3,000 deaths. \u201cWe are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,\u201d Sweden\u2019s state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, says. The country\u2019s public health agency reports that a total of 23,918 cases have been confirmed and 2,941 deaths recorded; an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. Rather than enforcing a lockdown, Sweden has allowed many businesses to remain open, while asking citizens to keep their distance. Iran warns of \u2018rising trend\u2019 as virus cases top 100,000.

It says more than 260 nurses have died amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, as it urges authorities to keep more accurate records. The United States has urged the World Health Organization to defy Chinese pressure and invite Taiwan to its annual meeting, which will discuss the coronavirus pandemic. The United States itself has yet to confirm its participation in the 18-19 May talks of the World Health Assembly, which comes after President Donald Trump vowed to slash funding for the UN body. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, told reporters: I want to call on all nations, including those in Europe, to support Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly and other relevant United Nations venues. I also call upon WHO Director-General Tedros (Adhanom Ghebreyesus) to invite Taiwan to observe this month\u2019s WHA, as he has the power to do, and as his predecessors have done on multiple occasions. China, which wields a veto on the UN Security Council, considers Taiwan a province awaiting reunification and fights to block it from all international institutions. China\u2019s defeated nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 but the island has evolved into a vibrant, self-ruling democracy. Taiwan has become a model for its swift response to the coronavirus outbreak, with just six deaths despite its close proximity and economic ties with China, and has donated masks and other supplies around the world. The US state department did not reply to questions on whether the United States would take part in the World Health Assembly, which sets global health policy and is generally attended by health ministers or other senior officials. Until Trump\u2019s announcement, the US was the top contributor to the WHO, giving more than $400m a year to help global efforts on fighting myriad illnesses including malaria and polio. The US president, Donald Trump, has said he will announce new members of his coronavirus taskforce by Monday, as its focus turns to medical treatments and easing restrictions on businesses and social life. The Republican president said at a White House event honoring National Nurses Day that he had thought he would be able to wind down the taskforce sooner, but had no idea how popular it was. Spain\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government has secured another extension of the state of emergency, which will now last until 24 May. Congress\u2019s approval for the latest extension of the crisis powers comes after days of bitter rowing and frantic negotiations. The conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the far-right Vox party had both opposed any extension, saying the state of emergency was no longer necessary or proportionate. They were joined by the pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party, which objects to the centralisation of powers under the emergency measures. However, the minority government managed to enlist the support of the centre-right Citizens party and other smaller, regional parties. The PP eventually abstained, allowing the government to win a simple majority - more yes votes that no - in Wednesday afternoon\u2019s vote. Addressing the country\u2019s 350-seat congress before the vote, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, said the measure were needed to help safeguard Spain\u2019s advances against the virus. He also dismissed suggestions that the continued lockdown was too drastic.The prime minister added: The disease is being controlled and Spain is beginning to recover, but we must be careful and we need the legal and constitutional tool of this state of emergency. To date, the virus has killed 25,857 people and infected more than 220,000 in Spain. The UK will only consider support for individual aviation firms as a last resort, the housing minister Robert Jenrick has said. British aerospace and aviation firms must look at existing government schemes and self-help measures before individual packages for companies are considered, he said. At a news conference about possible job cuts at engine-maker Rolls-Royce, Jenrick told reporters: We want to support the aviation sector in any way that we can. We\u2019ve said before that we\u2019re willing to consider situations where we would support individual firms, but obviously only when they\u2019ve worked through the existing government schemes and other ways in which they might be able to raise finance commercially, or through existing shareholders. The European Union is backing calls for a timely review of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic, including the World Health Organization\u2019s performance, according to a draft resolution. European diplomats said the United States and China have taken part in negotiations on the EU resolution, but gave no details of their input. A Chinese spokesman confirmed Beijing had been involved, but US officials declined comment. WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has defended the UN agency against fierce criticism by the US president, Donald Trump, but has promised a review of its performance after the pandemic eases, including by its independent oversight body. An initial draft of the EU resolution, to be debated by WHO health ministers meeting virtually on 18-19 May at the World Health Assembly, includes wording on \u201ccommending the WHO leadership\u201d but calls for \u201can evaluation ... at the earliest appropriate moment on lessons learnt from the international health response to Covid-19\u201d. The draft, seen by Reuters, says the evaluation should address the long-term consequences on health and \u201cgaps in pandemic preparedness\u201d and reminds the 194 WHO member states they must report outbreaks of disease in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d. \u201cNegotiations have begun. The Americans, Chinese and Europeans are taking part, almost everyone is. It\u2019s a very good sign that everyone is engaged,\u201d a European diplomat said. If confirmed, the US involvement in discussions about the text would signal that Washington is engaging in diplomacy at the WHO, despite suspending its funding for the agency last month, accusing it of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d and issuing bad advice. China has been consulted despite criticism by several countries, including the United States, that it mishandled the early stages of the pandemic and was slow to reveal the extent of the threat it posed. The United States will provide $225m in emergency aid to Yemen to support food programmes, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said, as aid groups in the country are forced to scale down operations due to Houthi interference and amid a spreading coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThis assistance will provide the UN World Food Program\u2019s emergency food operation in southern Yemen, as well as a reduced operation in northern Yemen, which the WFP was forced to scale down earlier this month because of the ongoing interference of (the) Iran-backed Houthis,\u201d Pompeo told a news conference. Yemen is already grappling with the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis caused by a war between the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore the internationally recognised government, and the Houthi movement that drove the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. Around 80% of Yemen\u2019s population, or 24 million people, rely on aid, and 10 million are facing famine. Yemen has the world\u2019s fourth highest internally displaced population and healthcare is scarce in rural areas. The country has reported a total of 26 coronavirus infections with six deaths but due to inadequate testing and a shattered health system aid groups fear a devastating outbreak. According to WHO only 200 tests with results have been delivered nationwide. France will discard 10m litres of beer - four Olympic-sized swimming pools full - due to expire undrunk, with consumers in coronavirus lockdown, the national brewers\u2019 association said. Most of the wasted brew is craft beer, which is often unpasteurised unlike traditional blonde lagers, and quicker to spoil, said the Brasseurs de France. \u201cThese are very hoppy beers, and if they are kept for too long, when they spend more than two to three months in storage, the olfactory and taste effects, the aroma, disappears,\u201d brewery association boss Maxime Costilhes told AFP. The body blamed the closure of cafes and restaurants, an abrupt halt to tourism and the cancellation of festivals and expos under France\u2019s strict lockdown for leaving more than 10m litres of beer unconsumed, most still in casks. The number was compiled from the association\u2019s 300-odd members, which represent 98% of beer production in France. It represents but a drop of the estimated 22.5m hectolitres of beer the country is set to produce in 2020, but nevertheless comes at a loss of millions of euros to producers. The country, better known for its wine, has seen beer sales soar in recent years, spurred by an increase in craft brewing. At a press conference today, Mike Pompeo was pressed on his claim on Sunday that there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d that the Sars-CoV-2 virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory, a claim that was in conflict with statements from Anthony Fauci, the top US scientific voice on the outbreak, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley. The secretary of state got a little testy telling a BBC reporter who had raised the inconsistencies: \u201cYour efforts to try and find, to spend your whole life trying to drive a little wedge between senior American officials, it\u2019s just false.\u201d He said everyone was singing from the same song sheet. Every one of those statements is entirely consistent. We\u2019re all trying to figure out the right answer. We\u2019re all trying to get to clarity. There are different levels of certainty assessed at different places. That\u2019s highly appropriate. People stare at datasets and come to different levels of confidence. Finally, after more questioning, he repeated his assertion that there was strong evidence of a lab accident, but not before becoming irritable again. He said: \u201cI\u2019m not sure what it is about the grammar that you can\u2019t get. We don\u2019t have certainty. There is significant evidence that this came from the laboratory. Those statements can both be true.\u201d For context, General Milley has said the evidence of the origins are inconclusive, but the \u201cweight of evidence seems to indicate natural\u201d evolution. Dr Fauci said: \u201cEverything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that it evolved in nature and then jumped species.\u201d Brazil has seen its largest daily increase in its coronavirus death toll, despite erroneous suggestions from its president, Jair Bolsonaro, that the worst of the crisis was over. Brazil \u2013 which is now considered a major global centre of the pandemic \u2013 reported 633 Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday, taking its total to nearly 8,000. Three of Brazil\u2019s 27 states this week announced the country\u2019s first official lockdown measures to try to slow the spread of the disease. But speaking to reporters outside his presidential palace on Tuesday afternoon, Bolsonaro suggested his country was passing its Covid-19 peak. I don\u2019t know yet if the number of deaths is less than yesterday. But if it is, if I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019ll be the sixth consecutive day in which the number of deaths has fallen. That\u2019s a sign that the worst is over, and I ask God for this to be true. It was not true. Just a few hours later, Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced that the number of reported deaths had in fact risen. Under-reporting and a lack of testing also means the true numbers are almost certainly much higher. British construction firms should restart work if it is safe to do so in order to help maintain and improve the country\u2019s infrastructure, housing minister Robert Jenrick said. \u201cWe want infrastructure and construction work to begin again wherever it\u2019s safe to do so,\u201d he told reporters. The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, said that he believes states reopening their economies while seeing growing rates of infections from Covid-19 are making a mistake. \u201cYou have states that are opening where you are still on the incline,\u201d Cuomo told a daily briefing. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake.\u201d The spread of Covid-19 in India has been catastrophic for millions of its poorest and marginalised residents who are bearing the brunt of the world\u2019s biggest shutdown. The Guardian\u2019s south Asia correspondent Hannah Ellis-Peterson tells us how coronavirus and the lockdown is further dividing the country along class and religious lines. The coronavirus pandemic threatens the future of the eurozone by creating huge economic divisions between its 19-member states during what is expected to be the deepest recession since the Great Depression, the European commission has warned. The EU\u2019s economic commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, said there was an urgent need to mitigate the inevitable exacerbation of existing social and economic fissures, as countries emerge at different speeds from the unprecedented economic downturn. The economic output of the eurozone is likely to shrink by a record 7.75% in 2020 and rebound by just 6.25% in 2021, with unemployment rising from 7.5% in 2019 to 9.5%. Gentiloni said economic activity in the EU as a whole had \u201cdropped by around one-third practically overnight\u201d owing to the lockdowns imposed by European governments. More than 1.1 million people have contracted the virus across Europe and more than 137,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The coronavirus pandemic is \u201cunder control\u201d in Turkey, the country\u2019s health minister said on Wednesday, but warned citizens they still needed to take the necessary precautions. The number of deaths per day in Turkey has fallen in the past week, remaining under 100 within a 24-hour period since 26 April. And new infections are sharply down on the peak of over 5,000 in one day last month. \u201cThe pandemic is under control but the realities of the virus have not changed. Your homes remain the safest place against the virus,\u201d health minister Fahrettin Koca said. He said Turkey had \u201ccompleted the first phase in the fight against the coronavirus\u201d but said people must now have a \u201ccontrolled social life\u201d. Koca warned that the \u201csecond phase\u201d would only be successful if people followed rules when outside such as wearing masks and practising social distancing. Shopping centres will reopen on 11 May with only a limited number of people allowed inside, but Koca stressed that restaurants and cafes inside the malls will not open. Barbers and hairdressers will also be allowed to open but weekend lockdowns will continue in 31 cities including Ankara and Istanbul. Turkey has so far recorded 3,520 coronavirus deaths and nearly 130,000 confirmed infections. The Netherlands will begin a phased easing of its almost two-month-long coronavirus lockdown on Monday, according to a report by the national broadcaster NOS. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, is set to announce the reopening schedule in a live TV broadcast at 5pm GMT on Wednesday evening, the NOS said, citing anonymous sources. From next week, elementary schools will reopen, with classes split and rotated to enable greater distancing. Beauty salons and hairdressers will also be allowed to reopen, and non-contact outdoor sports such as tennis will be permitted, the NOS said. Public transport will resume normal schedules from 1 June, but with just 40% of seats available to allow for social distancing, and with the wearing of face masks compulsory. High schools will also reopen in June. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 232 to 41,319 on Wednesday, with 36 new deaths for a total of 5,204, the National Institute for Health said in its daily update. Britain\u2019s Covid-19 death toll has risen by 649 to 30,076, according to figures announced by government minister Robert Jenrick. The figures, which reflect deaths in all settings following positive tests for coronavirus, cover the period up to 4pm GMT on Tuesday. Deaths from the Covid-19 epidemic in Italy climbed by 369 on Wednesday, against 236 the day before, while the daily tally of new infections also rose, increasing by 1,444 against 1,075 on Tuesday. The total death toll from the outbreak now stands at 29,684, the Civil Protection Agency said. The number of confirmed cases amounts to 214,457. The number of those currently infected fell sharply to 91,528 from a previous 98,467, while there were just 1,333 people in intensive care on Wednesday against 1,427 the day before. Of those originally infected, 93,245 were declared recovered compared with 85,231 on Tuesday. Many of the newly recovered patients came from Lombardy and the region said the revised number reflected data from several days and not just the last 24 hours. The agency said 1.55 million people had been tested for the virus against 1.51 million the day before, out of a population of around 60 million. The head of the World Health Organization has warned of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions \u201cextremely carefully and in a phased approach\u201d. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, listed a series of steps countries should take before lifting measures to control the spread of Covid-19, such as surveillance controls and health system preparedness. He said at a virtual briefing in Geneva: The risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully and in a phased approach. He also said it was not possible to return to business as usual when the pandemic eventually ebbs, stressing the need for investment in health systems. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic will eventually recede but there can be no going back to business as usual,\u201d he said. Brazil airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes said on Wednesday its planes were nearly as full in April as they were a year ago despite the coronavirus crisis, bucking an industry trend of empty planes. Gol said in its monthly traffic report that its planes had been 80% occupied on average during the month, compared with 81% in April 2019. Like most airlines around the world, Gol is operating minimal flights while keeping most of its fleet grounded. Still, reports in the United States and elsewhere have highlighted empty flights that sometimes carry just one passenger, despite similar capacity reductions. Gol\u2019s results were in sharp contrast with those of Aeromexico, the region\u2019s only other airline to have reported April traffic figures. Aeromexico said its planes were 48% occupied in April, compared with 82% a year ago. Gol said it operated about 39 flights a day in April, 94% fewer takeoffs and landings than a year ago. In a conference call with investors earlier this week, Gol said government officials were over represented in its flights compared to normal times. Gol\u2019s chief executive, Paulo Kakinoff, said he was aware that there could be a spike in coronavirus cases within the company, but that \u201cit is not happening so far\u201d. \u201cAnd most of our crew members are still being exposed every single day,\u201d Kakinoff said, noting there were eight coronavirus cases at Gol. The French government has taken down a Covid-19 \u201cfake news\u201d page after accusations that it had overstepped its constitutional role and infringed press freedoms. A page called Desinfox \u2013 a play on the word desintox (detox) \u2013 appeared on the government\u2019s website last week. It claimed to be busting disinformation about coronavirus in the French media. After the country\u2019s journalists\u2019 union reported the government to the Conseil d\u2019\u00c9tat, the highest administrative court in the country, France\u2019s culture minister, Franck Riester, announced that the page would be removed. The Syndicat National des Journalists (SNJ) had filed an emergency appeal with the court requesting that a judge order the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, to delete the page and \u201cput an immediate stop to the serious and manifestly illegal attack on the principles of pluralism in the expression of opinions and on the neutrality of public authorities\u201d. The union\u2019s lawyers argued that while claiming to fight disinformation, \u201cthe government is making a selection of information considered reliable and that which could be considered fake news\u201d. They said the Desinfox page created \u201ca confusion between the media who deserve to be cited by the government, at the risk of introducing into the mind of the reader suspicions over the relations between the press and the political world\u201d. Dozens of patients marched out of an isolation centre in north-east Nigeria yesterday, protesting against their conditions under quarantine. The patients, who had tested positive for Covid-19 in Gombe State, streamed out of the facility, blocking a local major highway and mixing with nearby residents. The incident has raised fears that Covid-19 cases could further spread within communities in Gombe, the fifth most affected state in Nigeria, with 98 of the country\u2019s 2,950 cases. Angry patients told local media they had been poorly looked after and largely abandoned by medical staff since being quarantined. Some said they were poorly fed and were frustrated that they were being forced to quarantine as they were not showing symptoms and felt physically fine. The state government said the patients did not fully understand the procedures and asymptomatic patients didn\u2019t need treatment but were being isolated to prevent community spreading. The situation lays bare the challenge the country\u2019s authorities are facing in clearly communicating the threat of Covid-19, and the struggle to effectively contain the outbreak. In Lagos, where half of Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 infections have occured, and in the capital, Abuja, health procedures, testing and tracing have been largely effective. Yet in poorer states, with weaker health systems and large rural populations, containment has been more challenging. Gombe does not have a testing laboratory meaning samples have had to be transported outside the state, delaying results by days. Cases in Nigeria have doubled in under a week, while just 21,000 tests have been administered; 481 people have recovered and 98 people have lost their lives. Three hundred and seventy-six mafia bosses have been released from prisons across Italy and placed under house arrest due to the risk of Covid-19 infection, sparking a row in the country. Since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, Italian judges have set free ageing mobsters suffering from specific illnesses because they are \u201cat risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection\u201d. Prosecutors, anti-mafia associations and parties have protested against the judges\u2019 decisions, fearing mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release. Mobsters recently released from prison and placed under house arrests include Cosa Nostra\u2019s influential boss Francesco Bonura, 78, who was serving a 23-year sentence, and alleged \u2019Ndrangheta bosses Vincenzino Iannazzo, 65, and Rocco Santo Flipppone, 72. Judges feared that a Covid-19 infection could be lethal for Filippone since he suffers from serious cardiovascular disease. Another Cosa Nostra mafia boss, Franco Cataldo, 85, was released on Monday. Cataldo was among those convicted of kidnapping 15-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo, son of informant Santino Di Matteo. The boy was later strangled and dissolved in acid at the orders of superboss Giovanni Brusca. The justice minister, Alfonso Bonafede, clarified last week that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and on Monday called for a new norm to revise rules on releasing mafia bosses to house arrest. As Canada\u2019s first province prepares to re-open schools, measures to protect students and staff portend a dramatically different classroom experience. Under new guidelines issued in Quebec, students will not have the opportunity to take music, art or drama classes, nor will they have physical education lessons. Class sizes will be capped at 15 students and any activities outside will require students to maintain two metres of physical distancing. School buses will only be permitted shuttle a maximum of 12 students at a time. Any person with fever, coughing or a sudden loss of taste or smell will be prevented from entering a school. Some students may not return to the same teacher or class: the government has suggested staff over the age of 60 temporarily refrain from returning to schools. \u201cThis reality will be difficult for both the teachers and the students,\u201d Ann Marie Matheson, the director of the English Montreal school board told families in a letter, acknowledging that the return to schools \u201cwill not be normal\u201d with the looming threat of the coronavirus. \u201cIt is important that all parents understand and accept this reality when making their decision to send their child back to school or not.\u201d Quebec has experienced the worst outbreak of Covid-19 in the country, with Montreal at its centre. The province has recorded 2,398 deaths from the virus and 33,400 cases. While elementary schools are slated to open next week, premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault has also signalled he may push back the date if worries persist. No other Canadian province has indicated it will attempt re-open schools in the coming months. Angela Merkel has agreed with premiers of Germany\u2019s 16 states that they will each operate an \u201cemergency break\u201d if faced with a surge in new infections locally, she said on Wednesday. If new infections rise to above 50 people in every 100,000 in a district over a seven-day period, then it will be up to the local authority in the affected area to reimpose restrictions. \u201cWe are following a bold path,\u201d said Merkel. \u201cWe can afford to be a bit bold but we must remain cautious.\u201d The chanceller said there will be a lot more contact between people in the next phase of the coronavirus response in the country, and authorities are completely reliant on people cooperating. Agreed easing of restrictions includes: People from two households will be able to meet and eat together Elderly residents in nursing homes and facilities for disabled people will be allowed visits from one specific person All restrictions on shops will be lifted, although masks must be worn and social distancing maintained Schools will reopen gradually this term The German football league, the Bundesliga, has been given the green light to kick off for the first time since March, with a decision on the exact date being made by football authorities on Thursday. Games (without spectators) could start from mid-May providing players undergo a two week quarantine in the form of a training camp. Kenya\u2019s health minister announced on Wednesday that one suburb of the capital Nairobi, as well as a part of the port city of Mombasa, will be cordoned off due to skyrocketing cases of coronavirus in those areas. Cases of the virus have crept up slowly in Kenya, as in many other African countries, however in recent days it has become clear the virus is fast spreading in several hotspots. Eastleigh, a suburb in Nairobi with a large Somali population, has recorded 68 cases, while Mombasa\u2019s Old Town has 64 infections, out of a total 582 cases in the country. There have been 26 deaths nationwide. The health minister Mutahi Kagwe said that from Wednesday, for the next 15 days, \u201cthere shall be cessation of movement\u201d in and out of Eastleigh and Mombasa\u2019s Old Town. Let me be clear, there will be no movement to or out of the two places from 7pm (1600 GMT) today. Within those areas people are free to move but we encourage people to stay in their houses. No such measures were announced for the informal settlement Kawangware, where 24 cases of the virus have been recorded. Kenya has stopped short of ordering a full lockdown, like many of its neighbours. Observers have warned to do so would be a disaster for the millions of urban poor who live hand to mouth in slums in the capital. The country has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew and blocked movement in and out of Nairobi, three coastal towns, and the north-eastern county of Mandera, as well as two refugee camps housing some 400,000 people. As the coronavirus pandemic eats its way into the Amazon, raising fears of a genocide of its vulnerable indigenous tribes, the government of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and its supporters are dismantling rules shielding protected reserves. Key environment officials have been sacked, and environmentalists and indigenous leaders fear the pandemic is being used as a smokescreen for a new assault on the rainforest. They say a presidential decree awaiting congressional approval and new rules at the indigenous agency Funai effectively legalise land grabbing in protected forests and indigenous reserves. Alessandra Munduruku, an indigenous leader from Par\u00e1 state, said: The indigenous peoples are alone and we have to fight against the virus, the loggers and the wildcat miners. We don\u2019t know which is worse. Bolsonaro, notorious for racist remarks about indigenous people and a nationalist argument in favour of developing the Amazon, is popular among farmers, wildcat miners, loggers and land grabbers. He said the Yanomami indigenous reserve \u2013 Brazil\u2019s largest \u2013 was too big and attacked environment agencies for fining people for environmental crimes. Swedish officials said the country, which has taken a softer approach to curbing the spread of the coronavirus, was nearing 3,000 deaths from Covid-19. The country\u2019s Public Health Agency reported that a total of 23,918 cases had been confirmed and 2,941 deaths had been recorded, an increase of 87 deaths from the day before. \u201cWe are starting to near 3,000 deceased, a horrifyingly large number,\u201d state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell told a press conference. Sweden has not imposed the kind of extraordinary lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe, instead opting for an approach based on the \u201cprinciple of responsibility\u201d. The Scandinavian country has allowed schools for under-16s, cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses to stay open while urging people and businesses to respect social distancing guidelines. The Swedish approach has received criticism both domestically and internationally as its death toll has leapt much higher than its Nordic neighbours, which have all instituted more restrictive containment measures. Sweden\u2019s virus death rate of 291 per million inhabitants is far higher than Norway\u2019s death rate of 40 per million, Denmark\u2019s rate of 87, or Finland\u2019s rate of 45. In the United States, which has suffered the most coronavirus deaths, the toll per million inhabitants is lower than Sweden\u2019s at 219. Swedish officials have nonetheless insisted their plan is sustainable in the long-term, rejecting drastic short-term measures as too ineffective to justify their impact on society. On Tuesday, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency published a survey showing that most Swedes had changed their behaviour and were sticking to those changes. \u201cAlmost nine in ten respondents (87%) state that they are keeping a greater distance from other people in shops, restaurants and on public transport this week, compared with 72%,\u201d the agency said in a statement. China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the world by being more transparent about the coronavirus, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has said. Pompeo told reporters: China could have spared the world a descent into global economic malaise. They had a choice but instead China covered up the outbreak in Wuhan. China is still refusing to share the information we need to keep people safe. A US federal judge has dismissed a worker advocacy group\u2019s lawsuit accusing Smithfield Foods, the world\u2019s largest pork processor, of failing to adequately protect employees from coronavirus at a plant in Missouri. Smithfield is already taking many of the steps called for by the Rural Community Workers Alliance (RCWA), including screening production-line workers for symptoms and installing barriers between them, US district judge Greg Kays said in his ruling on Tuesday. Kays also said that under president Donald Trump\u2019s executive order in April requiring meatpacking plants to remain open during the pandemic, the federal government, and not the courts, were responsible for overseeing working conditions. Virginia-based Smithfield, which is owned by China\u2019s WH Group Ltd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. David Muraskin, a lawyer for the advocacy group, said the decision was disappointing but that the lawsuit had spurred Smithfield to make changes in response to workers\u2019 concerns. \u201cWe wish that Smithfield would do more, but the decision shows that workers can organize and move companies to make changes, and that\u2019s a really important development,\u201d Muraskin said. Smithfield has closed other pork-processing plants in Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota after outbreaks of coronavirus cases among workers. Companies like Tyson Foods, Cargill and National Beef Packing have also shut US meat plants during the pandemic. Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a range of steps agreed with Germany\u2019s 16 federal state leaders to ease the coronavirus lockdown, saying the first phase of the pandemic had passed, although there is still a long way to go. Merkel said I think we can safely state that the first phase of the pandemic is behind us. But we need to be very much aware we are still in the early phases and we\u2019ll be in it for the long haul. We are at a point where our goal of slowing the spread of the virus has been achieved and we have been able to protect our health system ... so it has been possible to discuss and agree on further easing measures. People from two households will be allowed to meet and more shops will open, provided hygiene measures are in place, but guidelines on keeping a distance of 1.5 metres apart and wearing mouth and nose masks on public transport remain. Belgium\u2019s prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, has said a limited increase in socialising will be allowed from this weekend, as she gave further details of the easing of the national lockdown. From Sunday 10 May, a household can welcome up to four people into their home for repeat visits, as long as they are the same four people. Guests must keep to the approved 1.5m distance and it is suggested meetings happen (if possible) in gardens or on terraces, rather than indoors. From the same day, people will also be allowed to go for a walk or run with up to two other people, whereas currently outings are only permitted with those who live under the same roof. Wilm\u00e8s said: \u201cMonitoring these rules is very complicated, but we are counting on your civic-mindedness and sense of responsibility.\u201d As planned, non-essential shops can reopen from Monday, as long as they don\u2019t get too crowded. Government guidance recommends no more than one customer per 10 square metres, apart from adults with children. Wearing masks will be compulsory on public transport, but is only recommended in shops. However the Brussels commune of Etterbeek, a large central district next to the EU quarter, is mandating the wearing of masks in some public spaces, such as popular shopping streets. The latest details emerged as daily admissions to hospital for patients with Covid-19 returned to levels not seen since Belgium went into lockdown on 18 March. The most recent figures showed there were 116 new arrivals in hospital on Tuesday, compared to 290 patients who were discharged. In the last 24 hours, 110 new deaths were recorded, sharply lower than previous weeks, bringing the total to 8,339. France has drawn up a plan to reintroduce the lockdown if there is a spike in coronavirus cases after restrictions are eased on 11 May. With days to go to the end of the strict lockdown measures imposed on 17 March, French ministers have repeatedly warned the end of the national \u201cconfinement\u201d could be put back if there is not a sufficient drop in the number of Covid-19 infections. On Wednesday, Jean Castex, who is in charge of drawing up the official end of lockdown plan and has been nicknamed \u2018Monsieur Deconfinement\u2019, told French senators he had also made provision for a reintroduction of measures in areas. He said: If the virus begins to circulate again intensively, we need to give ourselves the means locally to act immediately. I have proposed to also have ready an eventual plan for locking down again. We have learned from the acute phase of the crisis. We will have a (reconfinement) plan ready, but that\u2019s not my goal. Castex said the government\u2019s coronavirus maps that show the departments where the virus is circulating and the pressure on hospital intensive care units would be a vital element in identifying new clusters. French departments have been divided into \u201cred\u201d, \u201corange\u201d and \u201cgreen\u201d depending on how many new coronavirus cases are being reported and how the hospitals are coping. On Thursday, a definitive map will be published on which the easing of the end of lockdown restrictions will be based. Orange departments will become either red, in which there are stricter restrictions or green, where the lockdown is more relaxed. \u201cProgressive is the key word,\u201d Castex told the S\u00e9nat. He said the behaviour of the French people in respecting social distancing and barrier measures like washing hands, was \u201cthe key to the success of the fight against the pandemic\u201d. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve seen people letting go a little, which is not good. If we don\u2019t respect the barrier gestures\u2026we risk a relapse,\u201d he said. Russian president Vladimir Putin has said he supports proposals by Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin to gradually ease some restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of coronavirus. Sobyanin said some businesses could return to work from 12 May, but urged citizens to continue observing self-isolation measures where possible. Donald Trump has announced over Twitter that the White House coronavirus taskforce will \u201ccontinue on indefinitely\u2019, despite the vice-president\u2019s comments yesterday that it would start to wind down in the coming weeks. In a tweet thread this morning, the president said the taskforce had done a \u201cfantastic job\u201d addressing the coronavirus crisis. \u201cBecause of this success, the Task Force will continue on indefinitely with its focus on SAFETY &amp; OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWe may add or subtract people \u2026 to it, as appropriate. The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines &amp; Therapeutics.\u201d Follow all the latest developments in the US in more detail with our US live blog, headed by my colleague Joan Greve. Norwegian Cruise Line has raised over $2.2bn through debt and equity offerings, giving the cash-strapped cruise operator much-needed funds to survive extended voyage suspensions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company warned on Tuesday that it might not have funds to keep its business running for the next 12 months. With the new fund raising, the company now expects to have $3.5bn in liquidity, enough to last it for more than 12 months of voyage suspensions. The pandemic has halted international travel and effectively shut down the cruise ship and airline industries, with companies now bleeding cash and scrambling for new funds to ride out the slowdown that could last longer than expected. Norwegian previously said it planned to restart cruise operations on 1 July. Uber will cut about 3,700 full-time jobs and CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will forgo his base salary for the remainder of the year, the company said, as the Covid-19 pandemic decimates its ride-hailing business. The company said the layoffs included its customer support and recruiting teams, and it expects to incur about $20m in costs for severance and related charges. Uber and rival Lyft have already withdrawn their full-year financial outlooks as demand for app-based rides dropped sharply across the world after governments imposed stay-at-home orders to curb the transmission of the coronavirus. But Uber, which operates in more markets around the world than Lyft, could recover some lost revenue with its food delivery business. On Monday, Uber\u2019s Middle East business Careem said it was cutting 536 jobs this week, 31% of the Dubai-headquartered company\u2019s workforce. Lyft will report its quarterly results on Wednesday and Uber is expected to report earnings on Thursday. Uber shares opened 3% lower on Wednesday. The Bundesliga is set to get the go-ahead to resume in the second half of May after a meeting involving the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and state premiers. Under the plan, the league (DFL) will be able to choose the appropriate date for games in the first and second divisions to restart and and matches will be held behind closed doors. Clubs in Germany\u2019s top division have been training for around a month amid Covid-19 testing and the DFL has been keen to finish the season by the end of June, when contracts expire. The push to resume has not been universally welcomed. The DFL said on Monday there had been 10 positive tests for coronavirus among 36 clubs in the Bundesliga and second division, adding that 1,724 tests were carried out over two rounds among players and staff. Cologne last Friday reported three positive cases. The tests were part of the DFLs hygiene concept, which says teams will also undertake a mandatory training camp under quarantine conditions before a return to playing. This week, Salomon Kalou was suspended \u201cwith immediate effect\u201d by his club Hertha Berlin after posting a video on Facebook of him breaking physical distancing rules with his teammates. Economic activity in Russia has fallen 33% when compared with levels before lockdown measures were imposed to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, economy minister Maxim Reshetnikov said. Businesses across the country have been forced to temporarily close or work remotely in an effort to reduce coronavirus infections since late March. Hundreds of Indian police have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days, raising alarm among an over-stretched force as it attempts to enforce the world\u2019s largest lockdown. The 3 three million-strong force is trying to ensure that the vast majority of India\u2019s 1.3 billion population stays home, with TV footage early in the crisis showing police beating back migrant workers as they tried to board city buses to reach their villages. India has been under lockdown since 25 March and has confirmed nearly 50,000 coronavirus cases and some 1,694 deaths. A senior officer in the western state of Maharashtra said the number of cases had nearly doubled in the police force there in the last week. Maharashtra, the hardest-hit state, has reported a total 15,525 cases as of Tuesday. \u201cMore than 450 people from the state police force have now tested positive and four have died due to the virus,\u201d the officer said on condition of anonymity. Control rooms were being set up exclusively to deal with health issues faced by police in Maharashtra, according to the state\u2019s home minister, Anil Deshmukh. Six senior police in at least six states said dozens of police in their states were seeking sick leave, fearing becoming infected. An official with India\u2019s home ministry said it was aware of the matter and was monitoring the situation. \u201cPatrolling and crowd control in Covid-19-affected areas is becoming more dangerous than fighting criminals,\u201d said Salunkhe, a Mumbai policeman who agreed to be quoted using his last name. \u201cAt least in those cases we can see the enemy.\u201d In Gujarat, at least 155 police and some paramilitary personnel had been infected, according to a senior official. At least 90,000 health care workers worldwide are believed to have been infected with Covid-19, and possibly twice that, amid reports of continuing shortages of protective equipment, the International Council of Nurses (ICN) said. The disease has killed more than 260 nurses, it said in a statement, urging authorities to keep more accurate records to help prevent the virus from spreading among staff and patients. \u201cThe figure for health care workers infections has risen from 23,000 to we think more than 90,000, but that is still an underestimation because it is not (covering) every country in the world,\u201d Howard Catton, ICN\u2019s chief executive officer, told Reuters. The 90,000 estimate is based on information collected on 30 countries from national nursing associations, government figures and media reports. The ICN represents 130 national associations and more than 20 million registered nurses. Catton, noting that 3.5 million cases of Covid-19 have been reported worldwide, said: \u201cIf the average health worker infection rate, about 6% we think, is applied to that, the figure globally could be more than 200,000 health worker infections today.\u201d He added: The scandal is that governments are not systematically collecting and reporting on this information. It looks to us as though they are turning a blind eye which we think is completely unacceptable and will cost more lives. The World Health Organization, which is coordinating the global response to the pandemic, says that its 194 member states are not providing comprehensive figures on health worker infections. The WHO last said on 11 April that some 22,000 health workers were thought to have been infected. A Bangladeshi cartoonist was among 11 people charged on Wednesday for \u201cspreading rumours\u201d on social media about the coronavirus outbreak in the country, where experts say official figures likely understate the scale of the health crisis. Police have arrested at least 40 people in recent weeks under controversial digital security laws that activists say are being used to suppress criticism of the government\u2019s handling of the contagion. The impoverished South Asian nation has reported 11,719 virus cases and 186 deaths so far, but experts say limited testing by authorities means the true figures could be much higher. The 11 have been charged with \u201cspreading rumours and misinformation on Facebook about the coronavirus situation,\u201d Dhaka metropolitan police assistant commissioner Shamim Ahmed told AFP. They are also accused of \u201cundermining the image\u201d of the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of current prime minister Sheikh Hasina and the nation\u2019s founding leader. Two of the 11 were cartoonist Ahmed Kabir Kishore and writer Mushtaq Ahmed. Kishore was working on a \u201cLife in the Time of Corona\u201d cartoon series that included caricatures of ruling party leaders and allegations of health sector corruption. Ahmed has been a vocal online critic about the alleged shortage of protective gear for doctors. They were charged under the Digital Security Act passed in 2018 which critics say is a serious threat to freedom of expression in the nation of 168 million people. \u201cIt is seen as an assault to freedom of expression, to the right to life and livelihood,\u201d human rights activist Rezaur Rahman Lenin told AFP after the latest charges. \u201cThe government should instead nurture a free press... which can greatly help in curbing the pandemic.\u201d China has hit back at the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, over his claims that the coronavirus originated in a lab in Wuhan, saying he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any\u201d evidence. Washington and Beijing have clashed repeatedly over the virus, which emerged in China late last year. Conspiracy theories that the virus came from a maximum-security virology lab in Wuhan have swirled since earlier this year, but were brought into the mainstream last month by US government officials. Pompeo said on Sunday there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d to show that coronavirus originated in a Chinese lab. At a regular press briefing, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: I think this matter should be handed to scientists and medical professionals, and not politicians who lie for their own domestic political ends. Mr Pompeo repeatedly spoke up but he cannot present any evidence. How can he? Because he doesn\u2019t have any. Most scientists believe the new virus jumped from animals to humans, with suspicion around a market in Wuhan that sold wildlife for meat. US president Donald Trump has been increasingly critical of China\u2019s management of the outbreak, saying last week he had seen evidence linking the virus to the Wuhan lab and threatening new trade tariffs against Beijing. Beijing has accused the US of trying to divert attention from its domestic handling of the outbreak. Hua said: We urge the US to stop \u2026 shifting the focus to China. It should handle its domestic affairs properly first. The most important thing now is to control the US\u2019 domestic pandemic spread and think of ways to save lives. The US is the worst-hit country in the world, with more than 70,000 deaths from coronavirus. The German government and the 16 federal states agreed at a meeting on Wednesday to extend until 5 June social distancing measures designed to help fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, two participants said. The sources said chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of the states had agreed to loosen the restrictions, with members of two households to be allowed to meet. The Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, warned that abruptly ending nearly eight weeks of lockdown would be \u201cunforgivable\u201d as he sought parliamentary approval to re-extend the state of emergency. \u201cIgnoring the risk posed by the epidemic and lifting the state of emergency very quickly would be absolutely wrong, a total, unforgivable error,\u201d he told parliament as he sought support for a fresh extension of the measure, which has been rejected by his rightwing opponents. In place since 14 March, the state of emergency has allowed the leftwing coalition government to order a strict confinement of nearly 47 million Spaniards under one of the tightest lockdowns in the world, that has only recently been slightly eased. Extended three times as Spain has sought to fight a virus that has now killed 25,857 people and infected more than 220,000 in the country, the current measures are to expire at midnight on Saturday. The latest daily death toll on Wednesday showed a slight increase, rising to 244 after three days when it stayed below 200 - a far cry from the 950 deaths of 2 April when the epidemic peaked. \u201cWe are progressing very well. It would be very sad if through leaving the lockdown faster than recommended we lost everything we\u2019ve worked for,\u201d warned Fernando Simon, who heads the health ministry\u2019s emergencies department. Earlier this week, Spain\u2019s main opposition Popular Party said it would not support any extension of the state of emergency. The coronavirus crisis seems to be encouraging belief in radical change, writes Timothy Garton Ash. What kind of historical moment will this turn out to be, for Europe and the world? It could lead us to the best of times. It could lead us to the worst of times. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 232 to 41,319 on Wednesday, with 36 new deaths, health authorities said. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 5,204, the National Institute for Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The RIVM cautioned that it only reports confirmed cases, and actual numbers are higher. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said his government will set out details of its plan to ease lockdown on Sunday, hoping that some measures could come into force the next day. Speaking in parliament for the first time since being hospitalised with Covid-19, Johnson said that \u201cevery death is a tragedy\u201d, calling the statistics \u201cappalling\u201d, but said there was not yet enough data to make international comparisons. In particular, he said he \u201cbitterly regrets\u201d the deaths in care homes, which stand at more than 6,000, but added that there had been a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in the last few days. The wider death rate is coming down, six weeks after the government imposed stay-at-home orders to stem the rate of infection, and the lockdown measures are up for review on Thursday, after which the government will produce a plan for easing restrictions. \u201cWe will of course be setting out the details of that plan on Sunday,\u201d Johnson told parliament after being asked by opposition Labour leader, Keir Starmer, about people returning to work. He added: The reason for that (setting out the plan on Sunday) is very simply that we have to be sure that the data is going to support our ability to do this, but that data is coming in continuously over the next few days. We\u2019ll want if we possibly can to get going with some of these measures on Monday. I think it would be a good thing if people had an idea of what is coming However, the government has previously stressed that measures would only be lifted gradually. Johnson repeated on Wednesday: \u201cIt would be an economic disaster for this country if we were to pursue a relaxation of these measures now in such a way as to trigger a second spike.\u201d Russia\u2019s culture minister, Olga Lyubimova, has tested positive for Covid-19, Reuters reports. Lyubimova has mild symptoms and is continuing to work remotely, conducting meetings online, her press secretary Anna Usacheva said, according to the TASS news agency. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said earlier on Wednesday that the number of cases had risen by more than 10,000 for a fourth consecutive day and now stood at 165,929. Even as the state endured its largest increase in coronavirus cases on Monday, Missouri\u2019s Republican governor, Mike Parson, decided to press ahead with his plan to allow businesses to reopen and to lift restrictions on social gatherings imposed as the pandemic crept closer six weeks ago. But for all the fury of gun-toting protests against lockdowns and stay-at-home orders in some parts of America, only a smattering of Liberty\u2019s shops and restaurants opened their doors. While many people were pleased to see the restrictions eased, some also harbored doubts about whether it might lead to a resurgence of Covid-19, with Missouri recording more than 8,700 confirmed cases and a total of 358 deaths by Monday, and projections that 3,000 people a day could be dying across the US in a month. China\u2019s coronavirus prevention and control still faces great uncertainty, president Xi Jinping was quoted as saying on Wednesday, as the cabinet plans more measures to alleviate firms\u2019 tax burdens and boost credit support. In a separate cabinet meeting led by premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday, the government said it will support banks to issue more unsecured loans, while extending loan and interest payment forbearance for firms who keep staff, state television reported. Slovakia reopened restaurant terraces, hotels, all shops outside large malls and other businesses on Wednesday, expediting plans to revive the economy thanks to better-than-expected progress in containing the coronavirus outbreak. The government, which opened small shops on 22 April, also gave the green light for religious services and weddings to take place with a limited number of guests. Wednesday\u2019s moves, under which hairdressers could also return to work, came after tests showed 11 consecutive days of single-digit growth in new infections. The latest figures showed 1,429 cases in total, with 25 deaths, and more than half of those infected already recovered. The central European country of 5.5 million people has recorded far fewer cases of Covid-19 than its neighbours after acting faster than most to shut borders and impose other tough measures to curb contagion. Slovakia was one of the first countries in Europe to ban international passenger travel. It imposed a compulsory 14-day quarantine in state-run centres for people returning from abroad and ordered compulsory wearing of face masks in public. The prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, has said the next stage will be launched at the earliest on 20 May and allow shopping malls, theatres and cinemas to return to business. The final stage would include reopening schools and kindergartens while allowing mass public and sporting events. The Slovak economy is expected to record its worst-ever performance this year due to the virus-induced lockdown. The central bank last week predicted the gross domestic product would shrink by between 5.8% and 13.5% in 2020. The number of international visitors to Spain plunged 64.3% in March from the same month a year ago, as hotels and apartments emptied of guests due to the coronavirus pandemic. Spain, which had recorded seven consecutive years of record tourist arrivals and ranks as the world\u2019s second most popular holiday destination, received just 2 million visitors in March, the national statistics office said on Wednesday. In turn, tourist spending also collapsed 64% year-on-year to \u20ac2.2bn ($2.4bn) in March, the data showed. Tourism is one of the most important pillars of Spain\u2019s economy, contributing around 12% of economic output and millions of jobs. After Spain declared a state of emergency on 14 March in response to the outbreak, hotels and other tourist accommodation were shut down and borders closed as the government banned non-essential travel. Airlines also cancelled flights. Spain\u2019s economy shrunk by 5.2%, its biggest amount on record, in the first three months of 2020 and official forecasts say it could shrink as much as 9.2% this year. Holiday islands such as the Balaeric Islands are desperate to reopen, even if in a reduced capacity, and hotels are lobbying government for solutions like allowing limited travel between Germany and Mallorca. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will later on Wednesday hear details of a government plan to gradually ease restrictions imposed over the coronavirus crisis, the Kremlin said. The country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said earlier on Wednesday that the number of cases had risen by more than 10,000 for a fourth consecutive day and now stood at 165,929. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was looking into more financial aid for the country\u2019s arts and culture sectors that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, including the closure of museums and the postponement of major events. Macron said he also wanted to \u201cdefend European creativity\u201d in the face of competition from areas such as the US and China. India will begin flights on Thursday to bring home some 400,000 citizens stranded overseas by travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, prompting concerns that imported infections could fuel contagion in the country. India\u2019s coronavirus cases totaled 49,390 as of Wednesday, with 1,694 deaths, and there is still no sign of the curve in new cases flattening despite a stringent, weeks-long lockdown in the world\u2019s second most populous country. But responding to the distress among India\u2019s huge diaspora, the government has asked national carrier Air India to provide aircraft to bring back Indians who want to return from the Middle East, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The Indian Navy has also been asked to help by sending two ships to evacuate citizens from the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean. Migrant workers, students and business people were left with no way home after India suspended air travel in March, just before entering a nationwide shutdown that remains in force until 17 May. There have been numerous tales of hardship, both financial and emotional, from people desperate to see sick relatives and attend funerals or births, while others have lost their jobs and are running out of money stranded abroad. \u201cPriority will be given to workers in distress, elderly people, urgent medical cases, pregnant women, as well as to other people who are stranded in difficult situations,\u201d the Indian consulate general in Dubai said. The first round of evacuations would bring back around 200,000 people by the middle of May and then by mid-June a total of 350,000-400,000 would be flown back, a foreign ministry official said. \u201cBy then, we are hopeful that foreign travel will be re-opened,\u201d the official said. Four of the ten flights that Air India will operate on Thursday will bring back people from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Doha and all into the southern state of Kerala, according to a seven-day flight plan released by the government. Nearly 300,000 have signed up for the flights from the Middle East for which Air India is charging a little less than a normal commercial fare. Passengers will be screened at the departing airport and only those who are asymptomatic will be allowed to board. Once they land, they will be quarantined for two weeks, the government said. China will not invite international experts to investigate the source of Covid-19 until after securing the \u201cfinal victory\u201d against the virus, Beijing\u2019s UN ambassador in Geneva said. China\u2019s priority is first beating the pandemic - and countering the \u201cabsurd and ridiculous\u201d politicisation of the coronavirus, Chen Xu told reporters in an online briefing. The World Health Organization says it is waiting on an invitation from China to take part in its investigations into the animal origins of the virus, first reported in the city of Wuhan in December. Asked when the WHO could expect an invitation, Chen replied: The top priority, for the time being, is to focus on the fight against the pandemic until we win the final victory. We need the right focus and allocation of our resources. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we are allergic to any kind of investigations, inquiries or evaluations,\u201d he said, as they could aid international efforts to prepare for future public health emergencies. He added: We need to race with time to save lives as much as we can. For whether or how the invitation will take place, we need to have the right priority setting at this moment, and on the other hand, we need the right atmosphere. A host of celebrities and scientists including Madonna, Robert de Niro and a clutch of Nobel Prize winners have called for radical change in the world rather than \u201ca return to normal\u201d after the coronavirus lockdowns. Hollywood stars Cate Blanchett, Jane Fonda, Marion Cotillard and Monica Bellucci also added their names to the open letter published in the French daily Le Monde pleading for an end to unbridled consumerism and a \u201cradical transformation\u201d of economies to help save the planet. \u201cWe believe it is unthinkable to \u2018go back to normal\u2019,\u201d said the letter which was also signed by Nobel laureates for medicine, chemistry and physics as well as peace prize winner Muhammad Yunus. They said the pandemic was a tragedy but it was a chance for humanity to \u201cexamine what is essential\u201d. \u201cAdjustments are not enough. The problem is systemic,\u201d the letter added. It said: The ongoing ecological catastrophe is a meta-crisis. Unlike a pandemic... a global ecological collapse will have immeasurable consequences. The 200 signatories said it was time for leaders \u201cto leave behind the unsustainable logic that still prevails and to undertake a profound overhaul of our goals, values, and economies. The pursuit of consumerism and an obsession with productivity have led us to deny the value of life itself: that of plants, that of animals, and that of a great number of human beings. Pollution, climate change, and the destruction of our remaining natural zones has brought the world to a breaking point. Professor Salim Abdool Karim, the South African government\u2019s chief adviser, has been talking to foreign journalists this morning about the country\u2019s much-praised effort to tackle the threat posed by the pandemic. Karim said South Africa had been on a similar trajectory to the UK for three weeks before its epidemic \u201ctook a different turn\u201d. President Cyril Ramaphosa moved rapidly and decisively to impose one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in late March. Authorities also rolled out a very proactive screening and testing programme which has meant the country of 56 million has suffered just 148 deaths and has just over 7,000 confirmed cases. \u201cWe put 30,000 community health workers on the ground and decided to actively go out and look for outbreaks, and stem the tide before cases reached hospitals,\u201d he said. The biggest challenges for South Africa have been in crowded, poor townships where around a third of the population live and where social distancing measures are impractical. Karim, a globally respected epidemiologist, said he expected to see continuing outbreaks in prisons, hospitals, pharmacies, bakeries and \u201call over\u201d because of the \u201cnature of South African society\u201d but that health authorities would \u201cdeal with it and resolve the problems\u201d when they came up. The peak of the outbreak in South Africa will come between July and early September, Karim said, with different mathematical models suggesting different timescales. The relatively low number of cases across Africa have prompted speculation that populations were less vulnerable to Covid-19 for some so far unclear reason. This was unlikely, Karim said though the lower proportion of elderly might mean lower fatality rates. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any special characteristic that we have [in South Africa]. There\u2019s no way we can escape this\u201d. The total confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Africa are now approaching 50,000, with nearly 2,000 deaths - though there is plenty of evidence that large numbers of victims are going uncounted in many countries. Turkish Airlines plans a gradual resumption of flights from June and will take four months to return to near full operation, a draft plan seen by Reuters showed, as the economy reopens following a slowdown in coronavirus cases. The flag carrier, which flew to 126 countries before the coronavirus outbreak but was forced to shut down all international passenger flights, will fly to just 19 countries next month, the April-dated plan proposed. It plans to gradually build up the number of destinations to 99 countries in September, according to the plan, which the company told Reuters may be subject to change in line with developments. Turkish Airlines, which carried more than 74 million passengers last year, has suspended passenger flights until 28 May after borders were shut down to stem the spread of Covid-19. It plans to resume 60% of domestic flights in June, according to the draft plan. Ankara has launched efforts to gradually revive the economy from late May after the spread of the virus slowed over the past two weeks. Turkey has about 130,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the highest total outside western Europe, the United States and Russia. Fake news laws and political interference along with growing financial pressures has left many independent media groups in developing countries fighting to survive during the pandemic. News outlets around the world have faced measures to muzzle critical reporting in an environment that has already seen dozens of journalists harassed, arrested and censored by governments, according to editors and press freedom groups. Press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, which has launched a dedicated tracker to record the impact of coronavirus on journalism, has reported abuses in more than a dozen countries, including Iran, Egypt and Brazil. In the group\u2019s annual global report on press freedom last week, secretary general Christophe Deloire said the pandemic had given countries the chance \u201cto take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times\u201d. Ibiza welcomes more than three million visitors during the summer months, pumping billions into its economy. Close to 75% of the island\u2019s 147,000-plus population get their income from tourism, directly and indirectly \u2013 besides the fabled nightclub scene, there\u2019s the hotels, Airbnbs, restaurants, bars, shops, taxis, and other businesses that exist because of the pull of the clubs. As clubs on the White Isle start to cancel their events, workers who survive on summer income are facing disaster. Pete Tong and others explain what happens next. Iran warned of a \u201crising trend\u201d in its coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday as it said 1,680 new infections, the highest daily figure since 11 April, took its overall caseload beyond the 100,000 mark. The country\u2019s success in bringing Covid-19 under control appears to have gone into reverse, with a sharp rise in the number of new daily infections over the past four days. The rise has coincided with a relaxation of Iran\u2019s restrictions on movement, and also some new ways of collating statistics from hospitals. \u201cWe are witnessing a rising trend in the past three or four days, which is significant,\u201d health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a televised news conference. The rise was \u201cbased on our behaviour, especially in the past two weeks, considering that a part of society has apparently had a change of attitude,\u201d he added. The number of new infections had been falling steadily reaching 802 five days ago, but that number has now nearly doubled over the past four days. Iran\u2019s leadership has been struggling to balance the conflicting demands for a return to work, and those warning the disease is not yet under control. In its latest batch of statistics published on Wednesday, Iran\u2019s ministry of health said the total number of infections now stands at 101,650 and the total death toll has risen to 6,418, with 78 dying in the past 24 hours. Out of those hospitalised, 81,587 had recovered and were discharged, while 2,735 were in critical condition. One of the worst renewed outbreaks is in Khuzestan, a south western province bordering Iraq. Local health officials in the province have blamed non-compliance with health protocols, and warned offices will be closed again if necessary. In white cities, those declared largely virus free, the government is planning to allow the reopening of mosques for individual prayers. Hairdressers were reopening in many towns this week. Traffic restrictions have been widely lifted, and although social distance requirements exist in reopened workplaces, they are enforced haphazardly, including on overcrowded public transport. Restrictions are also being imposed on Iranians returning from abroad. Schools remain closed. A genetic analysis of samples from more than 7,500 people infected with Covid-19 suggests the virus spread quickly around the world late last year and is adapting to its human hosts. A study by scientists at University College London\u2019s (UCL) Genetics Institute found almost 200 recurrent genetic mutations of the coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 - which the researchers said showed how it may be evolving as it spreads in people. Francois Balloux, a UCL professor who co-led the research, said results showed that a large proportion of the global genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is found in all of the hardest-hit countries. That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. Balloux said: All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected. So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious. Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained: A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run. The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. A study by French scientists published earlier this week found a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. The World Health Organization said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to investigate any other early suspicious cases. Twitter said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in Britain. Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. \u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. Facebook and Google have also taken steps to counter misinformation about Covid-19 on their platforms. However, the tech companies have been criticised for not doing enough to counter misinformation. Representatives from all three were questioned by lawmakers last Thursday about the steps they had taken. The chairman of the UK parliament\u2019s digital and media committee, Julian Knight, said the position they had adopted was \u201cdeeply unhelpful and failed in clarifying what they are doing to tackle the threat posed by record levels of misinformation and disinformation online about Covid-19, some of it deadly\u201d. Facebook recently removed the official page of the British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who has promoted the 5G theory, for violating its policies on harmful misinformation. Google terminated Icke\u2019s YouTube channel for the same reason. The lead US airport security agency is weighing the possibility of requiring masks or face coverings for passengers who pass through checkpoints, Reuters reports. The move is part of a broader rethinking of how to limit the spread of the Covid-19 during air travel, an effort that could bring some of the most significant changes to the industry since the 11 September 2001 attacks. Travellers passing through US Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints will see other changes, including additional barriers to protect security officers, more extensive cleaning regimes and upgraded screening equipment to speed travellers through lines faster, according to current and former US officials and industry experts familiar with the plans. TSA officers are allowed to wear masks at checkpoints but are not required to do so. The agency is considering such a requirement, sources said. News of potential changes came as the Senate Commerce Committee was set to hold a hearing Wednesday on the state of the aviation industry. The number of US air travellers plunged by 95% in March as lockdowns went into effect across the country. But with restrictions ending in some states, US officials, airports and airlines are grappling with how air travel must change to operate more safely. Nearly every major US airline said in the past week they will require passengers to wear face masks onboard flights. The San Diego international airport and San Francisco international airport already require face coverings. Russian soldiers and medical workers providing coronavirus assistance in Italy will start returning to Russia from Thursday, the Interfax news agency cited defence minister Sergei Shoigu as saying on Wednesday. Russia began sending doctors, nurses and medical equipment to disease-stricken Italy in late March in a goodwill operation that Moscow dubbed \u201cFrom Russia with love\u201d. Despite a decade-old financial crisis that decimated its hospitals, Greece appears to have handled the coronavirus pandemic well, with a far lower death toll than many other European nations. Dr Yota Lourida, head of the Covid-19 clinic at Sotiria hospital in Athens, explains how her department dealt with the crisis, and the steps taken by the country to mitigate against potentially catastrophic outcomes. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Jessica Murray here, I\u2019ll be running the live blog for the next few hours as we follow the latest coronavirus developments around the globe. As always, I\u2019m keen to hear your own comments and experiences, so feel free to email me at jessica.murray@theguardian.com, or contact me via Twitter (@journojess_) If you\u2019re looking for UK-specific coronavirus and politics news, my colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Lucy Campbell are heading up the UK live blog, covering the fallout from yesterday\u2019s news that Professor Neil Ferguson stepped down after breaking lockdown rules. Good news from Cyprus where the country\u2019s leading virologist says he believes the novel virus is on course to being eradicated. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of time now,\u201d university professor Leontios Kostrikis was quoted as telling the Politis 107.6 radio station, saying once epidemics have completed their cycle they disappear. The virologist, who has gained international recognition in the field of HIV and Aids, also said he did not think there would be another big outbreak in the winter, but rather small flare-ups that would be manageable. The Mediterranean island has one of the lowest per capita death rates of any EU member state after its government, deferring to medical advice, enforced draconian lockdown measures, including a night curfew, early on. Thus far, 878 coronavirus cases have been confirmed by health ministry officials in Cyprus\u2019 internationally recognised Greek-run south where an estimated 7,333.3 tests are carried out for every 100,000 of the population. On Monday retail stores opened and the construction sector was allowed back to work as the restrictions gradually began being reversed. The death toll rose to 15 on Tuesday after it was announced that a 56-year-old man, who had contracted coronavirus, had died although the fatality was linked to underlying causes. The island\u2019s breakaway Turkish- run north has reported 108 cases and four deaths with no new infections being announced for almost two weeks. Pope Francis has urged employers to respect the dignity of workers, particularly migrants, in the face of economic difficulties brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at the end of his general audience, held from the papal library instead of St Peter\u2019s Square because of Italy\u2019s lockdown, he said: It\u2019s true that the crisis is affecting everyone but the dignity of people must always be respected.\u201d He said he had received a series of messages about labour problems on May 1, the day most countries celebrate workers\u2019 rights. Francis said he wanted to defend \u201call exploited workers and I invite everyone to turn the crisis into an occasion where the dignity of the person and the dignity of work can be put back at the centre of things.\u201d He highlighted the exploitation of farmworkers in Italy, the majority of whom are migrants. It comes after a series of arrests in recent weeks of farm owners and gangmasters in Italy who recruit and supervise field workers. Last week, three farm owners and a Gambian migrant were arrested on charges of exploiting about 50 migrant farmworkers in the southern Puglia region. According to Reuters, in another recent case three Albanians who worked as gangmasters for a winery in northern Italy were arrested on charges of forcing migrants to work for up to 10 hours a day without a break and paying them low wages. Baseball fans will be let back into Taiwanese stadiums this week as the government begins relaxing some controls implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Taiwan has been relatively successful at controlling the virus, with 439 cases to date and six deaths, and 100 active infections, thanks to early prevention and detection efforts. The island has never gone into total lockdown, though the government has promoted social distancing and face masks. Both the baseball and football seasons got under way in Taiwan last month, but without spectators, providing rare live action for fans at home at a time when the pandemic has shut down most professional sport around the globe. The health minister, Chen Shih-chung, told reporters that 1,000 spectators would be allowed in to baseball matches on Friday in Taipei and the central city of Taichung. \u201cStarting from the eighth, fans will be allowed in for professional baseball games,\u201d said Chen. Europe will experience a recession this year of a depth unmatched since the Great Depression and the UK will be one of the hardest hit, the European commission has said. Economic forecasts provided by commission on Wednesday suggest that the UK will experience an 8.3% drop in gross domestic production by the end of the year, with investment down by 14% and a doubling of unemployment. In terms of the drop in GDP \u2013 the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a year \u2013 only Italy, Greece, Spain and Croatia among the EU member states will endure a bigger loss to the economy. The commission said that the coming recession will be of historic proportion. The EU economy is forecast to contract by 7.5% in 2020 and grow by around 6% in 2021. But countries will be impacted and find they are able to recover to greater and lesser degrees. Valdis Dombrovskis, commissioner for the economy, said: At this stage, we can only tentatively map out the scale and gravity of the coronavirus shock to our economies. While the immediate fallout will be far more severe for the global economy than the financial crisis, the depth of the impact will depend on the evolution of the pandemic, our ability to safely restart economic activity and to rebound thereafter. This is a symmetric shock: all EU countries are affected and all are expected to have a recession this year.\u201d The UK\u2019s GDP is predicted to bounce back by 6% by the end of 2021, according to the commission\u2019s predictions, although this presumes the continuation of the status quo between Britain and the EU in its trading relationship. Teenagers in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, have returned to school wearing masks and walking in single file past thermal scanners. In 121 schools, older pupils were back in classrooms \u2013 sitting at individual desks spaced a metre apart \u2013 for the first time on Wednesday since the city was forced into shutdown in January. Returning pupils had to navigate thermal scanners at school gates, with anyone displaying a high temperature barred from entry. It is the latest step in the return to normal life for the city, which reopened last month after being locked down for 76 days while it battled the virus. According to AFP, only the province\u2019s oldest students, vocational students and seniors who are due to take the make-or-break university entrance exams, were present on Wednesday. Officials in Wuhan say students and staff must all have had virus tests before going back to school, and campuses have been disinfected and cleaned. In preparation for reopening, some schools spaced out their desks and organised smaller class sizes, according to local media. State-run China Daily said some places arranged staggered arrival times for teachers and students. Armed police officers were seen standing guard at the entrance of Wuhan No 17 Middle School, with officers also pictured outside other schools around the province. Elsewhere in China, schools that have been closed or online-only since January began gradually reopening last month, with Beijing and Shanghai letting some students return last week. Spain looks set to extend its state of emergency for two more weeks as it eases Covid-19 lockdown measures, with the country\u2019s prime minister expected to secure enough parliamentary votes today to make the move. Prime minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s weak coalition government has the support of the regional Basque nationalist party PNV, as well as the centre-right Ciudadanos party, which said last night it would back an extension to the state of emergency set to expire on Saturday. In an increasingly fraught politicial government, it means the government will guarantee enough votes to approve the state of emergency decree. It comes after the government lost the support of opposition conservatives, the People\u2019s party (PP), for any further extensions. Small businesses such as hairdressers started to open this week with restrictions while Spaniards, under strict confinement since mid-March, are now allowed out of their houses for exercise under timetables. The decree will be the fourth two-week extension to the state of emergency which Sanchez says is necessary to restrict movement as the country tentatively emerges from what was one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns. The coronavirus epidemic has killed more than 25,000 people in Spain, where the economy shrunk by its biggest amount on record, 5.2%, in the first three months of 2020 due to the impact of the crisis. In Russia, the number of new Covid-19 cases surged by 10,559 over the past 24 hours, bringing the countrywide tally to 165,929, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre has announced. It is the fourth consecutive day that cases have risen by more than 10,000. The crisis response centre also reported 86 new coronavirus deaths, meaning the death toll in Russia has reached 1,537. Afghanistan has asked for international to help fight the pandemic, as number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths has passed 100 in the war-torn country amid continued surge of transmission in the capital Kabul. Wahid Majroh, the country\u2019s deputy health minister, has requested international donors to \u201chelp with Afghan people and its government in this critical stage as the nation needs more cooperations\u201d. He confirmed 168 new coronavirus cases and nine deaths over past 24 hours, pushing the total number of infections to 3,392 and death toll to 104. Most of new infections confirmed in Kabul which is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 909 confirmed cases, 68 reported today. In Herat, which borders Iran and recorded first case of Covid-19 in the country, there were 32 new cases and five deaths recorded overnight. More than 250,000 Afghans have returned home from neighbouring Iran since the beginning of the year, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. The number of new infections has slowed down in Kandahar compared with recent days as 14 new cases were reported in the province. Majroh has warned that the threat of the coronavirus is currently at its \u201chighest level\u201d and asked the people to cooperate with health workers and stay at home. The Afghan government pledged to distribute bread to poor people via Kabul bakeries and started doing so over the weekend, but the health ministry warned it may worsen the situation. \u201cSome bread is being distributed in the bakeries, but more people gathering. It has more disadvantages than advantages because the virus is spreading rapidly,\u201d said Wahidullah Mayar, a spokesman for the health ministry. The Kabul municipality distributed bread to 250,000 families across Kabul city via 2,500 bakeries, but some poor residents say that wealthy people are also included on the list to receive bread. Meanwhile, war intensified across the country, as the defense ministry said insurgents carried out attacks in around 20 provinces on Tuesday as the Taliban rejected multiple offers of ceasefire. A delayed rotation of US marines to a defence base in Australia will now go ahead but with strict adherence to Covid-19 measures including the troops undergoing a 14-day quarantine, Australia\u2019s defence minister has announced. Up to 2,500 U.S. Marines had been scheduled to arrive in the country\u2019s northern city of Darwin in April, in a major defence alliance cooperation exercise but the move was postponed in March because of the pandemic. The remote northern territory, which has recorded just 30 coronavirus cases, closed its borders to international and interstate visitors in March, and any arrivals must now undergo mandatory quarantine for 14 days. Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said in a statement that she and US secretary of defense Mark Esper had agreed a modified rotation could proceed, with marines required to undergo the 14-day quarantine and comply with other COVID-19 requirements. The U.S. rotation may be reduced in size or duration upon advice from health authorities, Reynolds\u2019 spokeswoman added. Immunity to Covid-19 is only building very slowly in the Czech Republic and probably does not cover more than 4-5% of the population, the country\u2019s health ministry has said. The preliminary figures came from a mass testing for antibodies that started in April, the ministry added. According to figures compiled by John Hopkins University, there have been 7,896 confirmed cases and 257 Covid-19 deaths so far in Czech Republic. The country, which has a population of 10.7 million, was one of the swiftest in Europe to impose curbs on travel and border crossings and shut most shops and restaurants in March. The preliminary results from the study found immunity levels were likely lower in the two biggest cities of Prague and Brno. Overall, it found 107 positive cases after testing 26,549, making it one of the largest studies in Europe. The study estimated the number of people infected by the virus but not showing symptoms could range from 27-38%. In Germany, all shops will reopen and amateur outdoor sports restart under certain conditions as part of an easing of lockdown measures, the federal government and states have agreed according to a draft document. The paper seen by Reuters was prepared by federal chancellery chief Helge Braun and the heads of the regional chancelleries for a telephone conference Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold with premiers of the 16 states later today. Dated 5 May, the document shows that based on infection levels, states will decide on their own about a gradual opening of universities, restaurants, bars, hotels, trade fairs, cosmetic studios, brothels, theatres, fitness studios, cinemas and discos all under certain hygiene and distancing concepts. States will also decide on limiting contact between people, it adds. It comes as Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in containing the virus\u2019 spread, with 164,807 cases and 6,996 deaths. Though it is unclear from the document when Germany\u2019s top-flight football league, the Bundesliga, will restart, some states want it to kick off again on 15 May. Two people familiar with the preparations have told Reuters it is probably set to be given the green light to restart then. The draft document says the start of matches must be preceded by two weeks of quarantine, possibly at a training camp. In a bid to prevent a second widespread coronavirus outbreak, the federal and state governments agreed in preliminary talks that if the number of new infections rises after restrictions on public life are eased, local restrictions should be reintroduced immediately. The plan is for this threshold to be set at \u201cmore than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the last seven days\u201d in districts. If there is a limited outbreak, such as in a nursing home, restrictions might only be applied there, the paper showed. \u201cIf there is a dispersed regional outbreak and infection chains are unclear, general restrictions, such as those in force in Germany before 20 April, must be consistently reintroduced regionally,\u201d the paper says. This would include restricting travel to and from these regions, it added. Morning folks, it\u2019s Simon Murphy here in the UK taking over the global live blog for the next few hours to keep you updated with events across the world as they unfold. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Here are the most important developments from the last few hours: Global confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak. White House wants to wind down Covid-19 taskforce. Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly looking to wind down the coronavirus taskforce in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Meanwhile, at least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the US, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world. Donald Trump says it\u2019s time to reopen businesses. Speaking in Arizona at a factory manufacturing medical masks, Trump said it was time to reopen businesses. \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d he said. New York subway shuts for cleaning. New York City\u2019s subway system went silent in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as part of a plan for the normally round-the-clock system to shut down for train cleaning. The trains, which had been running on a reduced schedule since late March, are now going to be stopped from 1am to 5am each day, AP reports. Asia Pacific nations push to end lockdown. Several Asia Pacific countries are aiming to ease their lockdowns and kickstart their economies, including South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong. Vietnam is also easing its restrictions but the country\u2019s economy, in which tourism plays a major role, faces a severe test. Record daily deaths in Brazil. According to the country\u2019s health ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Meanwhile, the capital of tropical Maranh\u00e3o state ground largely to a halt on Tuesday, becoming the first major Brazilian city to enter a lockdown in the hopes of preventing the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming the health care system of one of the country\u2019s poorest states. UK youth unemployment may reach 1 million. Youth unemployment in Britain will reach 1 million over the coming year, a thinktank has warned, saying Britain faces the risk of a \u201cdole queue\u201d future for young people unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education. Covid-19 lockdown risks 1.4 million extra TB deaths by 2025: study. The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a \u201cdevastating\u201d surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world\u2019s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed on Wednesday. New Zealand reports one new case after two days with no cases. After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, New Zealand reported one new case of the virus on Wednesday, and one new death. The pandemic has cost Walt Disney US$1.4bn in the last three months. Walt Disney will kick off its strategy next week to begin restoring its lucrative parks business that has suffered $1bn in lost profits from the coronavirus-led shutdown. Disney said on Tuesday it will reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on 11 May but severely limit the number of guests and enforce strict social distancing measures on rides and in restaurants. New York City\u2019s subway system went silent in the early morning hours of Wednesday, as part of a plan for the normally round-the-clock system to shut down for train cleaning. The trains, which had been running on a reduced schedule since late March, are now going to be stopped from 1am to 5am each day, AP reports. Fewer trains would be running in the overnight hours anyway, but the shutdown allows for daily cleanings and for city workers to move homeless people who have been more visible in subway cars during the coronavirus. The New York Police Department has assigned more than 1,000 officers to secure many of the system\u2019s 472 stations, as fewer than 200 can be physically locked up. Outreach teams made up of officers and nurses are being sent to 29 end-of-line stations to roust homeless people from trains that are headed out of service for cleaning, Chief of Department Terence Monahan said Tuesday. New York City normally has the country\u2019s busiest public transit system, with a weekday ridership of more than 5 million. But the impact of the coronavirus and people staying at home has been severe, with overall mass transit use dropping more than 90% in the past several weeks. Here\u2019s a look at this morning\u2019s front pages: In Australia, representatives of an international group that calls itself a \u201chealing church\u201d and promotes industrial bleach as a cure for coronavirus say they should be allowed to continue selling the potentially toxic \u201cmiracle\u201d solution on religious freedom grounds. The ABC reported on Tuesday the Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing is selling chlorine dioxide \u2013 marketed as Miracle Mineral Solution \u2013 online. The website selling the product in Australia states the solution is the formulation \u201capproved\u201d by church founder, Jim Humble, who has published claims that people with Covid-19 recovered after taking MMS. Guardian Australia spoke with an Australian representative of the church\u2019s MMS Australia Foundation, which is selling the solution online and operates from an address in Hervey Bay, Queensland. The man would not identify himself due to \u201chate mail and hate phone calls\u201d received in recent days. \u201cDo you go into the Catholic church and question them about the wine or the bread that they serve in the Eucharist? No, so why doesn\u2019t the world leave us alone?\u201d he said. \u201cThese are our sacraments and we should be free to use it and teach other people to use it.\u201d Global report: nations in Asia-Pacific pass Covid-19 peak and plot return to work Countries across the Asia-Pacific region have announced plans to cautiously reopen for business as governments around the world race to reboot economies devastated by the coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong, South Korea and Australia have all vowed to get their residents back to school and work in the coming days as Covid-19 infection rates slow. Financial markets have become caught between concern about cratering economies and rising US-China tension, and the prospect of more countries reopening for business: Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Chinese youngsters in the global virus epicentre of Wuhan filed back to class on Wednesday, wearing masks and walking in single file past thermal scanners, AFP reports. Senior school students in 121 institutions were back in front of chalk boards and digital displays for the first time since their city \u2013 the ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 shut down in January. \u201cSchool is finally reopening!\u201d posted one user of Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like short messaging platform. \u201cThis is the first time that I\u2019m so happy to go back to school, although I have to sit a monthly examination on the 8th.\u201d Teenagers sat at individual desks spaced a metre apart, seeing their teachers in the flesh after months of distance learning. Wednesday\u2019s back-to-school was the latest step in a gradual normalising of life in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. Return dates have not yet been confirmed for junior and middle school students. Officials in Wuhan say students and staff must all have had virus tests before going back to school, and campuses have been disinfected and cleaned. Thermal scanners greeted everyone walking through school gates, and anyone with a high temperature was not allowed in. Elsewhere in China, schools that have been closed or online-only since January began gradually reopening last month, with Beijing and Shanghai letting some students return last week. Global confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,656,644 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,736 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak. US death toll surpasses 70,000. At least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the USA, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world. Britain\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has passed Italy\u2019s to become the second-highest worldwide after the United States, and most impacted in Europe. The White House is looking to wind down its coronavirus task force. Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly looking to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Donald Trump said it\u2019s time to reopen businesses. Speaking in Arizona, he said, \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d he said. Record daily deaths in Brazil. According to the Health Ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns. Top UK adviser resigns over lockdown breach. Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist credited with convincing the UK government to abandon thoughts of pursuing herd immunity in favour of physical distancing has resigned amid allegations he breached lockdown rules. Covid-19 lockdown risks 1.4 million extra TB deaths by 2025: study. The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a \u201cdevastating\u201d surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world\u2019s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed Wednesday. New Zealand reports one new case, after two days in a row with no cases. After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, on Wednesday New Zealand reported one new case of the virus, and one new death. Mexico\u2019s government and the auto industry have drafted protocols to prepare for an easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, a lobby group said on Tuesday, as President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador signaled some factories could open in coming weeks. The pandemic has cost Walt Disney US$1.4bn in the last three months as it shut down its theme parks around the world and halted film and TV productions, the company has announced. Italy records lowest increase in cases for two months. Deaths in Italy climb by 236 on Tuesday, against 195 the day before, while the daily tally of new infections stands at 1,075, against 1,221 on Monday. It is the lowest number of new cases for two months. WHO urges investigation of possible early cases. The recent discovery that a man in France was possibly infected before the virus was even reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) by Chinese authorities has prompted the body to investigate other suspicious cases. The WHO said the findings were not surprising but gave a \u201cwhole new picture on everything\u201d. Major foreign travel to be limited this summer \u2013 Macron. It is unlikely French people will be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer and even trips within Europe may have to be limited to reduce the risk of a resurgence of the epidemic, said the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Face masks should be worn on flights in future. The International Air Transport Association, which represents global airlines, says it is recommending the wearing of masks on flights, though normal seat allocation can be maintained. Virgin Atlantic to cut jobs and quit Gatwick. Virgin Atlantic 28plans to cut more than 3,000 jobsand shut its operations at Gatwick airport. Majority of new Spain cases among medics. More than 70% of new cases detected in Spain over the past 24 hours are among medical staff, the health ministry says. With the epidemic receding after peaking more than a month ago, Spain has begun moves to ease out of the lockdown. Israel and Netherlands studies claim progress in antibody trials. Separate studies in Israel and the Netherlands claim to have created antibodies that can block the infection, a potential future treatment touted as a game-changer until a vaccine becomes available. No guarantee Tour de France will go ahead. \u201cMany people are begging me to keep the Tour even behind closed doors,\u201d French sports minister, Roxana M\u0103r\u0103cineanu told France television. \u201cI hope it will take place but I am not sure. We do not know what the epidemic will be like after lockdown.\u201d Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand\u2019s Covid response makes it a \u2018safe haven\u2019 for businesses New Zealand\u2019s success in curbing the coronavirus has given it a \u201csafe haven\u201d advantage, allowing the country to be open for investment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday. With just two new infections this week, New Zealand has held down community spread of the virus after a strict lockdown brought social and economic activity to a standstill for more than a month. Economic activity is slowly resuming, though many social restrictions remain, and Ardern will decide next week on further easing. \u201cWe are ready to welcome quality investments and offer a safe place for operations in both the health and business sense,\u201d Ardern told a news conference. \u201cBy tackling the virus we have positioned our economy to be able to rebuild ahead of many others globally...that is our safe haven strategic advantage.\u201d The comments came after Microsoft Corp announced plans to set up its first datacentre region in New Zealand. Ardern welcomed the move, saying New Zealand was open to similar strategic investments, with her government making more efforts to spread the word. \u201cNew Zealand\u2019s brand has always been that we are a sound, high-quality and reliable place to invest,\u201d she added. \u201cI would like to think our response to this health crisis only further underpins that approach.\u201d Podcast: will my allergies make a difference when it comes to Covid-19? As hay fever season approaches, Nicola Davis asks Prof Stephen Durham about the differences between the immune response to an allergen, such as pollen, and a pathogen, like Sars-CoV-2. Should those with allergies should be concerned about Covid-19? Are fewer Australians than usual dying during the coronavirus pandemic? The Australian Bureau of Statistics will examine the impact of Covid-19 and social distancing measures on the overall death rate, amid suggestions fewer people than normal may have died during the lockdown period. While Australia has seen 97 deaths related to Covid-19, doctors and nurses are reporting that emergency departments have been quieter overall, with people spending longer indoors, causing reductions in sport and work-related injuries. Royal Melbourne hospital confirmed its emergency department was seeing about 80% of the presentations it would usually, but this fell to 60% earlier in the pandemic. Mental health and drug and alcohol presentations are back up close to normal. Here\u2019s a video of Trump touring battleground state Arizona while flagging a wind down of the coronavirus task force: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease director who has at times openly contradicted Trump\u2019s assertions about the pandemic, has become a lightning rod of scorn from the president\u2019s supporters on the far right. Before departing the White House on Tuesday, Trump was asked by a reporter why he would allow Fauci to testify next week before a committee of the Republican-controlled US Senate but not the Democratic-majority House of Representatives. \u201cBecause the House is a setup. The House is a bunch of Trump haters,\u201d the Republican president answered. \u201cThey, frankly, want our situation to be unsuccessful, which means death, which means death, and our situation is going to be very successful.\u201d Trump, who had staked his November re-election bid on a robust US economy before the pandemic struck, said Democrats \u201cwant us to fail so they can win an election, which they\u2019re not going to win.\u201d US President Donald Trump on Tuesday accused Democrats of hoping his coronavirus response fails \u201cso they can win the election,\u201d as the Republican governor of Texas moved to further relax business shutdowns aimed at quelling the pandemic, Reuters reports. Trump\u2019s latest partisan commentary on the public health crisis and resulting economic meltdown engulfing his presidency came hours before he visited a face-mask factory in Arizona. At the plant, Trump said he planned to wind down the White House coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence as the country shifts into a new phase focusing on the aftermath of the outbreak. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep our country closed for the next five years,\u201d Trump said, when asked why it was time to wind down the task force. He said two leading medical experts who have played prominent roles on the task force \u2013 Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx \u2013 would stay on as advisers after the group was dismantled. Mexico\u2019s government and the auto industry have drafted protocols to prepare for an easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, a lobby group said on Tuesday, as President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador signaled some factories could open in coming weeks. Working with officials, three of Mexico\u2019s auto-sector lobbies have drawn up guidelines that companies should follow as a prelude to being able to relaunch production, according to an industry document published on Tuesday. The auto industry is the backbone of Mexico\u2019s manufacturing sector and is heavily integrated with the rest of North America. US business leaders and politicians have pushed their government to press Mexico to synchronise its restart with the United States so as not to disrupt key supply chains. Detroit automakers could restart vehicle production in the United States on 18 May, after a major labor union gave the green light on Tuesday. No date has yet been set for reopening Mexico\u2019s auto sector, although Lopez Obrador aims to relax containment measures in some regions from 17 May and nationwide at the end of the month. The president said on Tuesday that Mexico would gradually reopen construction sites, mines, auto factories and then tourist hot spots as the curbs are eased in line with medical advice. US airlines are collectively burning more than US$10bn in cash a month and averaging fewer than two dozen passengers per domestic flight because of the coronavirus pandemic, industry trade group Airlines for America said in prepared testimony seen by Reuters ahead of a US Senate hearing on Wednesday. Even after grounding more than 3,000 aircraft, or nearly 50% of the active US fleet, the group said its member carriers, which include the four largest US airlines, were averaging just 17 passengers per domestic flight and 29 passengers per international flight. Net booked passengers have fallen by nearly 100% year-on-year, according to the testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee. The group warned that if air carriers were to refund all tickets, including those purchased as nonrefundable or those canceled by a passenger instead of the carrier, \u201cthis will result in negative cash balances that will lead to bankruptcy.\u201d Separately, Eric Fanning, who heads the Aerospace Industries Association, will ask Congress to consider providing \u201ctemporary and targeted assistance for the ailing aviation manufacturing sector,\u201d in testimony made public by the group. China reported 2 new coronavirus cases for 5 May and 20 new asymptomatic cases, data from the national health authority showed on Wednesday. This compared with 1 new coronavirus case and 15 new asymptomatic cases reported a day earlier. The two new cases were so-called imported cases involving travellers from overseas, compared with one such case a day earlier. China\u2019s total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 82,883, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,633, the National Health Commission said in a statement. Hong Kong authorities are preparing to give every resident a specially-designed reusable mask. Called the CuMask+, it contains several layers of materials and small quantities of copper \u201ccapable of immobilising bacteria, common viruses and other harmful substances\u201d, the government website says. The mask serves as \u201can effective barrier to droplets\u201d and will last for 60 washes before needing a replacement filter. People with Hong Kong ID cards can register online to receive them within two weeks. The news has been received wryly by some Hong Kongers, coming as it does when the city\u2019s virus figures are at such low levels that social distancing measures are being relaxed. Hong Kong suffered major shortages in face masks as far back as February, with reports of thousands of people queuing overnight for shops to restock. In mid February private firms were handing out free masks to residents in need, as anger towards the government grew. Chief executive Carrie Lam said her government had sought help from China\u2019s Central Government, RTHK reported at the time. The government-issued masks also come six months after the government passed a law banning masks (in response to mass protests), and which it has continued to defend in court.

Podcast: Protecting domestic violence victims in lockdown Kate, a call handler for a domestic violence charity, discusses the challenges of trying to deal with the rising number of calls during lockdown. Guardian reporter Helen Pidd has been reporting on the domestic violence cases being heard at Manchester magistrates court over the past few weeks: Walt Disney Co will kick off its strategy next week to begin restoring its lucrative parks business that has suffered $1bn in lost profits from the coronavirus-led shutdown. Disney said on Tuesday it will reopen its Shanghai Disneyland park on May 11 but severely limit the number of guests and enforce strict social distancing measures on rides and in restaurants. The plans provide a glimpse at how the company - which in previous quarters generated a third of its revenue from parks, experiences and consumer products - will recover from the pandemic. In case you missed it, here is my colleague Dominic Rushe on the coronavirus pandemic costing Walt Disney $1.4bn in the last three months: After two consecutive days of zero new corona cases reported, on Wednesday New Zealand reported one new case of the virus, and one new death, a woman in her 60s with underlying health conditions from the Rosewood rest home in Christchurch. 88% of people infected with the virus have now recovered. Director-general of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said New Zealand wasn\u2019t out of the woods yet and needed to stay the course. \u201cWe need everyone to stick to the plan and follow the rules.. not doing so risks undoing all of the good work we\u2019ve done so far. Do not give it an inch\u201d Dr Ashley Bloomfield said. Australia\u2019s magazine industry is in crisis with more than 200 staff losing their jobs and seven fashion, lifestyle and celebrity magazines dropping out of circulation in less than a week. On Monday, days after acquiring Seven West Media\u2019s magazine publishing arm Pacific Magazines for $40m, Bauer Media laid off 60 of the 160 staff it inherited and stood down a further 15 without pay or access to jobkeeper. Staff were told via Zoom that several of the magazines, believed to be InStyle, Men\u2019s Health and Women\u2019s Health, would cease printing until further notice. The company has refused to comment on which titles it is suspending or to confirm the numbers of people affected. The global lockdown caused by Covid-19 risks a \u201cdevastating\u201d surge in tuberculosis cases, with nearly 1.4 million additional deaths from the world\u2019s biggest infectious killer by 2025, new research showed Wednesday. TB, a bacterial infection that normally attacks patients\u2019 lungs, is largely treatable yet still infects an estimated 10 million people every year, AFP reports. In 2018, it killed around 1.5 million people, according to the World Health Organization, including more than 200,000 children. Since effective medication exists, the world\u2019s TB response is centred on testing and treating as many patients as possible. But as Covid-19 forces governments to place populations on lockdown, new disease models showed that social distancing could lead to a disastrous rebound in TB infections - the effects of which are set to persist for years. This is because social distancing will make it impossible for health care workers to test vulnerable populations and for patients to access ongoing treatments. Youth unemployment in Britain will reach the 1 million mark over the coming year unless the government provides job guarantees or incentives for school leavers and graduates to stay on in education, a thinktank warns. The Resolution Foundation (RF) said that in the absence of action an extra 600,000 people under the age of 25 would swell dole queues, with a risk of long-term damage to their career and pay prospects. The thinktank\u2019s report said the \u201ccorona class of 2020\u201d \u2013 the 800,000 school leavers and graduates due shortly to join the labour market \u2013 was the most exposed age group to the likely unemployment surge caused by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that 408,000 people in the 18-24 age group were unemployed. Trump heads to Arizona mask plant to make case for reopening US Donald Trump used his first cross-country trip since the pandemic began to visit an Arizona plant manufacturing medical masks, seeking to demonstrate America\u2019s readiness to reopen the economy even as public health experts warned it was too soon. His visit to the battleground state on Tuesday came as the White House signalled a desire to wind down the coronavirus taskforce in the coming weeks despite a continued threat from the virus. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything is perfect,\u201d Trump told reporters in Arizona. \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d The visit is meant to underscore the administration\u2019s efforts to nudge a cautious nation, still grappling with economic and public health disasters inflicted by the virus, to return to a more normal way of life. Trump has cheered moves by some governors to reopen their economies, despite a failure to meet guidelines for lifting safety restrictions issued by the White House and concern from public health officials that states are acting too quickly. Mexico registered 1,120 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Tuesday and 236 new deaths, a health official said, bringing the total in the country to 26,025 known cases and 2,507 deaths. However, Mexico has conducted a very low number of tests. The government said on Sunday that the real number of cases was above 104,000, according to a statistical model. Vietnam crushed the coronavirus outbreak, but now faces severe economic test Chris Humphrey reports for the Guardian from Hanoi: Vietnam didn\u2019t just flatten its coronavirus curve, it crushed it. No deaths have been reported, official case numbers have plateaued at just 271, and no community transmissions of the virus have been reported in the last two weeks. On 23 April, the nation eased lockdowns in its major cities and life is gradually returning to normal. It is a stark contrast to many other nations including the US, where more Americans have died from Covid-19 than during the entire Vietnam war. Kidong Park, the World Health Organisation\u2019s representative to Vietnam, has praised the country\u2019s response to the crisis. Quarantining tens of thousands in military-style camps and vigorous contact tracing procedures have helped Vietnam to avoid the disasters unfolding in Europe and the US. After testing over 213,000 people, the nation has the highest test-per-confirmed-case ratio of any country in the world. A creative public information campaign featuring viral handwashing songs and propaganda-style art helped, but it was decisive early action \u2013 hastened by a government praised for its response to Sars in 2003 \u2013 that proved most effective. The capital of tropical Maranh\u00e3o state ground largely to a halt Tuesday, becoming the first major Brazilian city to enter a lockdown in the hopes of preventing the coronavirus pandemic from overwhelming the health care system of one of the country\u2019s poorest states. Some 1.5 million people in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and three neighboring cities have been confined to their homes, except for a handful of essential tasks, like buying groceries and visiting pharmacies. The vast majority of businesses have been shuttered, as have schools and public transport. Parks are closed, and residents cannot go out to exercise. Hours after the order went into effect, Maranh\u00e3o state\u2019s health secretary said the capital city looked like a ghost town. Almost no one was on the main streets, according to Carlos Eduardo Lula. Police manned roadblocks on the main avenues, and those wishing to pass through had to prove that they held essential jobs or had a receipt from a supermarket or pharmacy run. The decree from Governor Fl\u00e1vio Dino will last 10 days to begin with and applies to one-fifth the states population. The order comes despite President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s insistence that only the elderly and other high-risk populations should stay home. The president and his followers have repeatedly criticized local leaders who imposed more stringent restrictions in the face of surging coronavirus cases. European Union leaders host a summit on Wednesday with their six Balkan counterparts whose praise for Chinese and Russian support during the coronavirus crisis has ruffled feathers in the bloc, officials and diplomats said. The EU says it has not been given enough credit for the \u20ac3.3bn ($3.6bn) it is providing, which officials said outweigh medical supplies Beijing and Moscow sent to Serbia and Bosnia in the early phase of the epidemic, Reuters reports. The summit, planned for the Croatian capital Zagreb 20 years after the first ever EU-Balkan gathering, will take place via video, linking the heads of Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia with the 27 EU leaders. Still scarred by 1990s wars, all six countries aspire to join the EU, though the response to the Covid-19 disease is likely to dominate. \u201cThe summit itself is the message, to say: we want you to join,\u201d said a senior EU diplomat involved in preparing the summit. \u201cBut we will also say that you cannot pander to the Chinese and the Russians when it suits you.\u201d China and Russia flew doctors and medical supplies to Bosnia and Serbia in March to help halt spreading of the coronavirus at a time when the EU\u2019s initial response was slow. The United States and Britain launched formal negotiations on a free trade agreement on Tuesday, vowing to work quickly to seal a deal that could counter the massive drag of the coronavirus pandemic on trade flows and the two allies\u2019 economies, Reuters reports. The talks, to be conducted virtually, will involve over 300 US and UK staff and officials in nearly 30 negotiating groups, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and UK trade minister Liz Truss said in a joint statement. The first round of talks began as new US data showed a record drop in US. exports and a contraction in the vast US service sector for the first time in over a decade. It is Washington\u2019s first major new trade negotiation in 2020. London has also been working out trade terms with the European Union following its exit from the bloc in January. US President Donald Trump also urged China to be transparent about the origins of the novel coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than a quarter of a million people since it started in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Speaking before leaving on a trip to Arizona, Trump said the United States would release a report detailing the origins of the virus, but gave no details or timeline. \u201cWe will be reporting very definitively over a period of time,\u201d Trump told reporters. While taking aim at China as the source of the outbreak and warning that it would be held to account, Trump and officials in his administration have expressed differing levels of confidence about the exact origin of the virus. Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000 Donald Trump is preparing to wind down the White House coronavirus taskforce even as the US death toll has topped 70,000 and experts warn that the worst is yet to come. Mike Pence, the vice-president and taskforce chair, said on Tuesday that coordination of the pandemic response could be transferred back to federal agencies in late May or early June. But in the wake of a leaked internal White House report suggesting that the daily US death toll will climb to 3,000 per day by June, the move is likely to fuel concerns that Trump has all but abandoned a public health strategy in favour of economic imperatives. The Guardian\u2019s Dan Collyns has this report: The Siekopai, an indigenous Amazon tribe in Ecuador numbering just 744 members, has confirmed 15 cases of Covid-19 after two elders were suspected to have died from the virus. Their case has struck alarm among the 500,000 indigenous peoples belonging to eleven nations in the small Latin American country, as a dozen more cases have been confirmed in other communities. Almost all indigenous Amazon peoples are in self-isolation fearing the worst. The case of the Siekopai comes as a stark reminder of their vulnerability after the first cases emerged in Brazil at the beginning of last month, as reported in The Guardian. Siekopai community members raised the alarm in mid-April following the death of one of their elders who had coronavirus symptoms including fever and coughing. They were finally offered tests for the virus at the end of the month. \u201cWe can\u2019t be excluded from medical attention,\u201d said Justino Piaguaje, the Siekopai\u2019s leader. \u201cIn the 19th century, we were already victims of this type of disease. Today, we do not want to see history repeat itself.\u201d On Monday, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights called on the Ecuadorian State to urgently \u201cadopt efficient measures to protect the right to health and the integrity of the Siekopai people, as well as other peoples facing similar risks during this pandemic.\u201d A regional network called the Indigenous Organisations of the Amazon Basin, or COICA, which represents 4 million peoples from the Amazin basin, is appealing for contingency funds faced with a threat of a Covid-19 \u201cethnocide\u201d. Brazil confirmed its highest daily coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, indicating that the nation is still in the thick of its battle against the virus, even as some areas of the country are beginning to open up, Reuters reports. According to the Health Ministry, there have been 6,935 new cases of the novel coronavirus in Brazil since Monday evening and 600 new deaths. The previous record of 474 deaths came on 28 April. The nation has now tallied 114,715 confirmed cases of the virus and 7,921 deaths, the ministry said, making it by far the hardest-hit country in Latin America. New cases increased roughly 6.4% from Monday evening, while deaths increased roughly 8.2%. Hello, and welcome to today\u2019s live coronavirus news blog with me, Helen Sullivan. You can get in touch with me at any time on Twitter @helenrsullivan. As US deaths passed 70,000, accounting for more than a quarter of deaths worldwide, President Donald Trump said while visiting a mass-production facility in Arizona that it was time for businesses to reopen. \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes,\u201d he said. Meanwhile US daily coronavirus deaths are reportedly projected to double to 3,000 by June. Meanwhile in the UK more people have died than anywhere else in Europe. More people have lost their lives in the country than anywhere in Europe, and it is the second-worst affected worldwide after the US. Global confirmed cases exceed 3.65 million. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University say at least 3,651,010 people have been infected since the outbreak began, while at least 256,239 are known to have died. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak. US death toll surpasses 70,000. At least 70,847 people are now known to have died in the USA, according to the data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That represents more than a quarter of all pandemic-linked deaths reported across the world. Britain\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has passed Italy\u2019s to become the second-highest worldwide after the United States, and most impacted in Europe. The White House is looking to wind down task force. Mike Pence has confirmed that the Trump administration is reportedly looking to wind down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks, even as the rate of new infections continues to rise across most of the US. Donald Trump said it\u2019s time to reopen businesses. Speaking in Arizona, he said, \u201cWill some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon.\u201d he said. Top UK adviser resigns over lockdown breach. Professor Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist credited with convincing the UK government to abandon thoughts of pursuing herd immunity in favour of physical distancing has resigned amid allegations he breached lockdown rules. The pandemic has cost Walt Disney US$1.4bn in the last three months as it shut down its theme parks around the world and halted film and TV productions, the company has announced.
