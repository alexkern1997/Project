The number of coronavirus deaths in the US are expected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC. Researchers warned the Iowa governor, Kim Reynolds, that reopening the state could cause more deaths from coronavirus in early May. Businesses reopened across the state on Friday anyway. The US House passed temporary changes on Friday that will allow members to vote remotely for the first time in its 231-year history. Retailer JC Penney filed for bankruptcy on Friday, making it the latest business to hit bottom amid the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Retailer JC Penney filed for bankruptcy on Friday, making it the latest business to hit bottom amid the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. US retail sales tumbled by a record 16.4% from March to April as business shutdowns caused by the coronavirus kept shoppers away, threatened the viability of stores across the country and further weighed down a sinking economy. The Covid-19 fallout represented a final blow to the company, which had been struggling for some time. Many brick-and-mortar retailers are struggling, according to a report from the Associated Press. In the past two weeks, J Crew, Neiman Marcus and Stage Stores have filed for bankruptcy protection. JC Penney with its 850 stores and almost 90,000 workers followed them on Friday into bankruptcy. UBS estimates that roughly 100,000 stores could shutter over the next five years. \u201cThe whole economic model is unraveling,\u201d Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail told the Associated Press. \u201cThis is going to be very painful.

Now legislators will be able to cast roll-call votes in the House and participate in committee hearings remotely. The final vote on the change was 217-189. It comes as Congress attempts to adjust its responsibilities to the global coronavirus pandemic. Weeks ago researchers at University of Iowa warned the governor, Kim Reynolds, that reopening the state would increase the spread of coronavirus, documents released Friday showed, as the state proceeded to lift closures this week. Researchers, including some of the state\u2019s top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, found that even if businesses remained closed, hundreds of residents would likely die through the end of May. They said reopening restaurants and churches would exacerbate the problem, documents released Friday show. \u201cEvidence shows that Covid-19 will continue to spread in Iowa, likely at an increasing rate,\u201d the team led by Dr Joseph Cavanaugh, the head of the university\u2019s biostatistics department, concluded in a 4 May paper. Reynolds has downplayed such models as she continues her push to reopen the economy, despite surging numbers of deaths this week. Restaurants, gyms, barber shops and salons reopened Friday in 22 counties, including the state\u2019s largest metropolitan areas, where they had been closed for two months. She on Friday she is relying on real-time data from hospitals and testing to manage the state\u2019s pandemic response and warned that not reopening the state would have a \u201csocial cost\u201d, including high unemployment, rising domestic abuse and food insecurity. The Iowa Department of Public Health had asked experts at the UI College of Public Health for technical assistance forecasting the pandemic\u2019s severity in Iowa. In a paper dated 4 May, the researchers found that the virus was still likely spreading in Iowa communities. They said that school and business closures and ban on gatherings of more than 10 people had strongly mitigated the amount of infection but nonetheless were not \u201csufficient to prevent uncontained spread\u201d by themselves. \u201cThe State of Iowa is sufficiently interconnected that we expect continued growth of Covid-19, even in the absence of any measures to relax social distancing or to reopen previously closed businesses and religious institutions,\u201d they wrote. \u201cImportantly, even though much of the recent spread in Iowa has been attributed to clusters (eg, workplaces, long-term care facilities), continued increase in community spread is expected.\u201d The researchers said the state\u2019s observed deaths, which jumped by 18 to 336 on Friday, closely tracked their projections from an earlier paper. That research forecast a median outcome of 747 deaths by 28 May. The number of deaths in the US from coronavirus are projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC director, Robert Redfield. The agency came to this conclusion through tracking 12 different forecasting models, which all forecast at least 100,000 deaths. Trump previously said the number would be lower than 100,000 deaths, a claim these models counter. Deborah Birx of the White House coronavirus task force has repeatedly asserted the number of deaths by 1 June will be between 100,000 and 240,000 \u2013 if mitigation strategies continue. National Football League teams can begin to reopen their facilities starting 19 May, a memo from the commissioner Roger Gooddell obtained by the Washington Post stated. NFL teams must be in compliance with local and state laws as well as league protocols, the memo said. There had been speculation the NFL season, which generally starts in early September, would be postponed or cancelled. According to the memo, \u201ccoaches and players not permitted to be in teams\u2019 facilities, at this point, even if they reopen beginning May 19\u201d. It is unclear when fans would be allowed back in stadiums to view games. Trump took the trucker protest today as a sign of support, saying as the sounds of horns honking wafted into the Rose Garden today, \u201cThose are friendly truckers. They\u2019re on our side. It\u2019s almost a celebration in a way.\u201d CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale responds: Unveiling the flag for his new space force in the Oval Office on Friday, Donald Trump said the US was developing a \u201csuper duper missile\u201d to outpace military rivals including Russia and China, writes the Guardian\u2019s Martin Pengelly: \u201cWe have no choice, we have to do it with the adversaries we have out there. We have, I call it the super duper missile and I heard the other night [it\u2019s] 17 times faster than what they have right now,\u201d the president said, sitting at the Resolute desk. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the defense secretary, Mark Esper, standing to Trump\u2019s right. \u201cYou take the fastest missile we have right now,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou heard Russia has five times and China\u2019s working on five or six times, we have one 17 times and it\u2019s just got the go-ahead.\u201d Hello, readers! Kari Paul here in sunny Oakland, California, to bring you the news over the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. Thanks for tuning in for the day\u2019s US politics and coronavirus news so far. The Guardian\u2019s Kari Paul is taking the over the blog from the west coast now, to cover developments over the next few hours. The White House just wrapped another rose garden event and Donald Trump is headed to Camp David. Here are the main events so far today: Truckers on their 15th day of protest about insufficient working conditions disrupted Donald Trump\u2019s afternoon press conference by blasting air horns throughout the Rose Garden ceremony. Despite an FDA alert warning the coronavirus testing kit used in the White House may be providing false positives, Donald Trump said it is a \u201cgreat test\u201d. Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth has entered the veep race after being backed by a veteran\u2019s group. Duckworth, a veteran, is the first senator to give birth while in office. Never Trump Republicans are holding a rival gathering during the Republican National Convention this year, reports the Washington Post. A man accused of making credible death threats against Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer and state attorney general Dana Nessel has been charged on a terrorism count, the Wayne County prosecutor\u2019s office said this afternoon. Robert Tesh made the threats via a social media message to an acquaintance on April 14 and authorities concluded the message amounted to \u201ccredible threats to kill,\u201d prosecutor Kym Worthy said Friday in a news release, the AP reports. Worthy didn\u2019t provide any detail about the threats or how they were determined to be credible. Further details will be presented during court proceedings, she said. Detroit police officers arrested the 32-year-old man the same day at his home. He was arraigned April 22 on a threat of terrorism charge. If convicted, Tesh could face up to 20 years in prison. \u201cEmotions are heightened on all sides now,\u201d she told the Associated Press. \u201cThese threats ... they are not funny. They are not jokes. There is nothing humorous about it. Even if you don\u2019t carry it out, we\u2019re going to charge you criminally.\u201d The threats from Tesh were not specific to Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home order issued in March in an effort to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the state, according to Maria Miller, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor\u2019s office. Whitmer has been the target of protests and rallies over her executive order which shut down most businesses in the state. The order is effective at least until May 28. \u201cThe alleged facts in this case lay out a very disturbing scenario,\u201d Worthy said. \u201cWe understand that these times can be stressful and upsetting for many people. But we will not and cannot tolerate threats like these against any public officials who are carrying out their duties as efficiently as they can. Protests in Lansing yesterday were led by Michigan United for Liberty, a conservative activist group that has sued Whitmer and organized or participated in several rallies since early April. During a rally last month, some armed protesters entered the Capitol building. Tesh was released from jail on April 29 after posting a $50,000 bond. He has been placed on a GPS tether. Comment has been sought from his attorney. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran writes in about Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey announced that he will donate $10 million for computers and internet access to help close the digital divide in Oakland: Dorsey dropped the news after Oakland mayor Libby Schaaf tweeted a video of one of the estimated 25,000 students who lack access to the internet. \u201cEvery student deserves the ability to learn from home\u201d, wrote Schaaf. The mayor also spotlighted a $12.5M plan \u201cto close the digital divide for good.\u201d @jack quickly answered the call. Roughly two months into the switch from brick-and-mortar schools to online education, millions of families with school-aged children still remain offline. The need persists even in the shadow of Silicon Valley. As schools shut down, and educators hustled to equip students with devices, the need for internet access was often unmet. Back orders mounted, compounding wait times for unconnected students. The same families without internet often face food scarcity or unstable living conditions \u2014 both of which have been exacerbated with businesses closed and parents out of work. Dorsey\u2019s donation, by itself, won\u2019t be enough to close the digital divide in Oakland. But will certainly help. Schaaf called Dorsey\u2019s announcement a \u201cgame changer\u201d. Long-haul trucking industry website, The Trucker, has a deeply reported look at the truckers\u2019 protest movement, which has been active for 15 days. The protest was thrust into the global spotlight on Friday, when trucker\u2019s air horns provided a disruptive soundtrack to Donald Trump\u2019s afternoon press conference. Trump said the horns were a show of support \u2013 \u201cThey love their president,\u201d he said \u2013 but he was wrong. Truckers began a protest in Washington DC at the beginning of the month. They have not received targeted support in any stimulus package and have said they don\u2019t have adequate access to protective equipment and healthcare. They have also voiced serious concerns about the rates they are getting through brokers who connect them with people needing to ship goods. On Wednesday, White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, met with the protestors for nearly 15 minutes. The Trucker said this gave some people enough hope to return to work, though many also decided to return to work simply because they can\u2019t afford to take more unpaid leave. The Trucker\u2019s report from Wednesday detailed the meeting with Meadows and Michael Landis, founder and CEO of the United States Transportation Alliance, who acted as a spokesman for the group: Meadows offered his personal email and promised that if Landis puts together a list of priorities and sends it to him, Meadows will act. The wary Landis, who has personally heard years of promises of action from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and others in Washington, responded, \u201cWe\u2019d like to hear that from the president.\u201d Meadows was unfazed by the comment and accompanying jeers, responding, \u201cLet me just tell you, having the (president\u2019s) chief of staff come out with my security detail and everything else is something that really doesn\u2019t normally happen. So, I promise you I\u2019m speaking on behalf of the president of the United States.\u201d Debate is underway for the $3tn House stimulus bill \u2013 the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or HEROES Act. Members have two hours to discuss the bill, after they spent the morning voting on rules. The bill includes assistance to state and local governments, hazard pay for frontline health care workers, forgiveness of student debt and boosts to the health insurance programs, Medicaid and Medicare. Trump has threatened to veto the bill, but more progressive Democrats have also said they would vote against it. A reporter asked McEnany why Donald Trump accused Barack Obama of committing a crime this week and asked McEnany to name the crime. After listing issues with people in office while Obama was president, she said it was reporters responsibility to \u201canswer the question\u201d of what Obama did that was against the law. She ignored the reporter pointing out it is the White House press secretary\u2019s duty to respond to questions about something the president said. White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany began today\u2019s White House briefing with a theatrical dismissal of the pandemic plans Barack Obama\u2019s administration left the Trump White House. McEnany is responding to questions about gaps in the Trump administration\u2019s readiness by criticizing the Obama administration. A reporter asks about one of today\u2019s top issues - that the FDA has issued concerns about the type of test kit being used in the White House. McEnany said the issue raised about the kits, false negatives, have been tied to user error and that if people get a negative but are presenting symptoms like fever or coughing, they will be tested again. Never Trump Republicans are holding a rival gathering during the Republican National Convention this year, reports the Washington Post. It will take place in the same city as the RNC \u2013 Charlotte, North Carolina \u2013 and happen on the same days: The Convention on Founding Principles grew out of an event Trump critics held at the National Press Club this year, concurrent with the Conservative Political Action Conference. Organizers were pleasantly surprised when more than 300 people attended their counter-conference, prompting a move to a larger room. The August event, said McMullin, would more closely resemble an actual political convention. There will be debates and voting on a statement of the attendees\u2019 principles, and a vote on whether they supported a particular candidate for president \u2014 presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, or a \u201cwell-known third-party candidate.\u201d (Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, who is seeking the Libertarian Party\u2019s nomination for president, has been praised by many anti-Trump conservatives.) Add a new name to the list of possible running mates for Joe Biden. The VoteVets pac has floated Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth as their pick for the vice presidency. Duckworth, a veteran, is the first senator to give birth while in office. \u201cWe seem to have this view that paid family leave is some sort of touchy-feely women\u2019s only policy,\u201d Duckworth told the Guardian in 2018. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just an entitlement. It\u2019s really an economic imperative for our nation.\u201d Thanks to Guardian senior politics correspondent, Lauren Gambino, for the tip. Her insights on the Veep race from earlier this month, here: If you would like to experience the sound of a trucker protest, Newsday White House correspondent Laura Figueroa Hernandez has you covered: And NBCNews White House Correspondent, Geoff Bennett, shared a photo of the impressive line-up of trucks near the White House. Donald Trump says he \u201cassumes\u201d the reported coronavirus death toll in the US is accurate. A reporter asked if he was worried it could be higher, and he said \u201cor lower.\u201d But, despite concerns Trump would try and downplay the death toll, he said the number should be accurate. Then, he launched into a tirade against China. \u201cI\u2019d be happier if they were lower... this should never have happened ... this came from China.\u201d Trump is now taking questions from the press. He\u2019s insisting the US has \u201cno ego\u201d when it comes to vaccine trials and that the US will work with other countries to create a vaccine. Other countries have said this is not happening. A reporter asks if the president is concerned about the Abbott Labs\u2019 coronavirus test, which is being used in the White House but has been reported to show false positives. He says it\u2019s a \u201cgreat\u201d test and is not concerned. Trump says he gave his task force the option to where masks, which is why some of them are wearing them and some are not. He noted they are outside and standing at a distance from each other. During the president\u2019s remarks, a low hum can be heard on the video feed. Trump said the sound was truckers \u201cshowing support,\u201d but the honking may have actually been a protest. Earlier this month, a convoy of trucks in Washington DC blasted their air horns to protest low shipping rates, which truckers say threaten their livelihoods. The Washington Post covered the protests earlier this month: Just two weeks ago, President Trump had personally extended his gratitude to truckers, welcoming representatives of the industry to the White House and calling truckers \u201cthe foot soldiers\u201d in the war against the novel coronavirus. But now, \u201cthe American truck driver needs help, and we need it now,\u201d said Santiago, a 21-year veteran of the industry from New Jersey. \u201cThis is our distress call to our commander in chief to address the problems we are facing. He has called us heroes \u2014 his heroes need his help now.\u201d Trump is talking about Operation Warp Speed. He compared it to the Manhattan Project, the US government project which produced the first atomic bombs. Trump is drumming up the US government\u2019s work to support vaccine trials, but is short on specifics. He says the operation is \u201crisky, it\u2019s expensive\u201d but assures people the vaccine has to be tested and approved before it is distributed. \u201cThey\u2019d better come up with a good vaccine, because we\u2019re ready to deliver it,\u201d Trump said. He says the US is going to emerge from the coronavirus stronger than ever before. Trump said: \u201cWe are going to have a tremendous year, next year.\u201d Donald Trump has arrived at the White House rose garden. Members of the coronavirus task force, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci, are standing behind the president with masks on. The president doesn\u2019t have a mask on. We\u2019re minutes away from Donald Trump\u2019s remarks on an attempt to secure a vaccine (while we wait, I strongly recommend this brilliant piece about vaccines by the Guardian\u2019s Tom McCarthy). Before Trump takes the stage, here\u2019s a look what has happened so far today: The House is set to vote on a $3tn, 1,800-page stimulus package which has been criticized by the right as well as progressives. At the moment, members are still voting on procedural aspects of the bill vote. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the Covid-19 testing kit used at the White House may be missing positive cases. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he was wrong earlier this week when he claimed Barack Obama\u2019s administration did not leave a plan for Donald Trump on how to handle a pandemic. There is also this excellent read from correspondents across the globe writing on how the US response to coronavirus is viewed from abroad: The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt has examined how figures on the right are denying the country\u2019s rising coronavirus death toll. And how Donald Trump could soon formally join their ranks. Trump is said to be questioning whether the death toll is lower than officially stated. He has stopped short of saying so in public, but in April he retweeted a man who mused of Democrats: \u201cDo you really think these lunatics wouldn\u2019t inflate the mortality rates by underreporting the infection rates in an attempt to steal the election?\u201d Trump has consistently under-predicted how many people will die from the virus. In February he said there would soon be \u201cclose to zero\u201d cases. On 20 April, he suggested \u201c50 to 60,000\u201d could die. The US passed that figure nine days later. More than 85,000 have now died. In fact, epidemiologists including Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert, say more people have died from coronavirus than has been reported. The situation is beginning to resemble the other major disaster his administration failed to respond adequately to: Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico. While numerous studies pin the number of deaths from the hurricane at nearly 3,000 people - Trump has consistently disputed the figure. An editorial in the prominent medical journal, The Lancet, called for Americans to vote Donald Trump out of the White House in November because of his response to the coronavirus crisis. The editorial highlighted how the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the country\u2019s premier public health agency, has been sidelined in the response: The Administration is obsessed with magic bullets\u2014vaccines, new medicines, or a hope that the virus will simply disappear. But only a steadfast reliance on basic public health principles, like test, trace, and isolate, will see the emergency brought to an end, and this requires an effective national public health agency. The CDC needs a director who can provide leadership without the threat of being silenced and who has the technical capacity to lead today\u2019s complicated effort. The Trump administration\u2019s further erosion of the CDC will harm global cooperation in science and public health, as it is trying to do by defunding WHO. A strong CDC is needed to respond to public health threats, both domestic and international, and to help prevent the next inevitable pandemic. Americans must put a president in the White House come January, 2021, who will understand that public health should not be guided by partisan politics. Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he was wrong earlier this week when he claimed Barack Obama\u2019s administration did not leave a plan for Donald Trump on how to handle a pandemic. \u201cI was wrong \u2014 they did leave behind a plan. So I clearly made a mistake in that regard,\u201d McConnell said in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier on Thursday. \u201cAs to whether or not the plan was followed and who\u2019s the critic and all the rest, I don\u2019t have any observation about that because I don\u2019t know enough about the details of that, Bret, to comment on it in any detail.\u201d In a YouTube interview on Monday with Trump 2020 senior adviser Lara Trump, McConnell said the Obama administration \u201cdid not leave to this administration any kind of game plan for something like this.\u201d His comments were criticized by former members of the administration, including Obama\u2019s former deputy national security advisor, Ben Rhodes. Nearly six in 10 people who are working outside their homes despite the lockdowns said they were concerned that they could be exposed to coronavirus and infect the people they live with, according to a Washington Post-Ipsos poll. The survey of more than 8,000 US adults in late April and early May painted a broader picture of the Americans still at work. For black and Hispanic workers, seven in 10 were concerned about this issue. Of the people still going to work, 13% said they lack health insurance. And more than one third of those going to work said they our a household member had a serious, chronic illness. A slew of Guardian correspondents from across the globe to report on how the US response to coronavirus is seen abroad. It\u2019s not good. Views of the US handling of the coronavirus crisis are uniformly negative and range from horror through derision to sympathy The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the Covid-19 testing kit used at the White House may be missing positive cases. The agency issued the formal warning on Thursday after New York University researchers found the Abbot Labs\u2019 test kit was missing a third to almost half of positive cases. Their study was not peer-reviewed and the FDA said it would find other methods of testing the kits accuracy. \u201cWe are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,\u201d said Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at the FDA, in a statement. Abbott Labs refuted the NYU study in a statement. \u201cWhile we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run,\u201d the company said Thursday. Hello and happy Friday, The House is set to vote on a $3tn, 1,800-page stimulus package today. If it makes it through, however, it is unlikely to get much support in the Senate. Donald Trump has also threatened to veto the bill if it gets through Congress. This has left Democratic leadership in the House with the job of convincing their members to vote for a bill that won\u2019t become a law. Buried in the 1,800 pages are also points in the bill progressive members of the party don\u2019t think go far enough. House majority leader, Nancy Pelosi, said the bill was a \u201cstarting point\u201d for negotiations. It includes provisions such as allowing undocumented immigrants, who pay billions in taxes each year, to collect a $1,200 government stimulus check and funding for the beleaguered US Postal Service. While Congress bickers over the bill, Trump is due to make remarks at two events this afternoon, including a noon briefing about the development of a coronavirus vaccine.",

      "bodyText": "Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, has announced that he will donate $10m toward computers and internet access for public schools in Oakland, a city where half of students lack reliable access to either. Dorsey dropped the news after the Oakland mayor, Libby Schaaf, tweeted a video of one those 25,000 students without access to the technology. \u201cEvery student deserves the ability to learn from home,\u201d wrote Schaaf. @jack quickly answered the call. City officials say the funding will immediately help fill a need for Oakland\u2019s 50,000 public school students. David Silver, the mayor\u2019s director of education, said Dorsey\u2019s gift was particularly timely. About two months ago, when coronavirus prompted widespread school closures, Oakland schools distributed about 20,000 Chromebooks, Silver said. But because students would have to return them when school resumed, a shortage remained. \u201cJack\u2019s gift allows us to put a device in the hand of every single kid in Oakland. And because it came in now, we can order the computers, clean them up, and by the time kids come back to school in the fall, they\u2019re ready,\u201d Silver said.

      "bodyText": "In the TikTok videos going viral across social media, the voices are familiar: a rambling presidential whine, or a patronising prime minister. But the people apparently speaking are altogether \u2013 and hilariously \u2013 different. In uncannily calibrated lipsyncs, Donald Trump is shown as a hectoring schoolteacher or drunken clubgoer, while Boris Johnson reads a bedtime story to a petulant Theresa May. As unsettling as the effect may be, the videos are enormously popular \u2013 and the women behind them are at the forefront of a boom in self-produced political comedy on both sides of the Atlantic, highlighting the limits to our leaders\u2019 authority by making them look ridiculous. \u201cI look at it as taking off the emperor\u2019s clothes,\u201d explains Sarah Cooper, the US comedian behind a series of Trump videos highlighted by the Guardian earlier this week. \u201cI\u2019ve basically taken away the podium and the suit and the people behind him nodding \u2026 That\u2019s why it highlights how ridiculous his words are.\u201d In the UK, after lockdown was renewed last Sunday, the actor and voice artist Meggie Foster presented Boris Johson as reading a bedtime story (revealed to be George Orwell\u2019s 1984) to May, representing the British public reacting with dismay to the news that they would be stuck at home for the foreseeable future. Foster has also delved into the pre-lockdown era to recreate a sharply personal political disagreement between the Labour MPs Caroline Flint and Emily Thornberry as a teenage bust-up. In the US, Trump\u2019s characterisation of Covid-19 as a \u201cgerm that has gotten so brilliant \u2026 [people] end up dying from problems\u201d, in mid-April, caught Kylie Scott\u2019s attention. \u201cI was like, \u2018He sounds wasted\u2019,\u201d says the 26-year-old film student from California. The clip of her lipsyncing Trump\u2019s quasi-scientific ramblings with a glass in hand, apparently mid-drunken lecture at a nightclub, racked up 1.2m views on TikTok alone. \u201cDrunk in the club after Covid\u201d was Scott\u2019s first foray into comedy. Her subsequent \u201c#DrunkTrump\u201d videos \u2013 heaping slurred blessings on \u201cthe Palestinians\u201d with a drooping pizza slice; giving the glad-eye over a clip of the president praising Elton John\u2019s \u201corgan\u201d (\u201cflirting in the club\u201d) \u2013 have also racked up six-figure views. People are more tuned into politics now than they were pre-Covid, says Scott \u2013 and desperate for light relief. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to wrap our head around the fact that this is reality: that these aren\u2019t things being said by a drunk person in the club, that this is someone leading our country. It also makes it bearable, to be able to laugh about it for a second.\u201d Trump \u2013 who would, presumably, particularly hate being presented as a woman \u2013 is almost beyond being satirised, having made reality unbelievable, says Cooper, 35, whose mostly presidential lipsyncs have been widely praised. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get into the realm of fake news by making something up \u2013 the beauty of this is I\u2019m taking his exact soundbite.\u201d Her first clip, performing Trump\u2019s suggestion of sunlight and disinfectant as potential coronavirus cures with a dead-eyed stare, was posted on Twitter within three hours of the press conference and went past 15m views. \u201cA lot of people saw my parody before they saw the real thing.\u201d While the lipsyncers have hit on something particularly arresting with clips that so sharply cut through their subjects\u2019 gravitas, they are far from the only female comedians capitalising on the age of pandemic politics \u2013 and on social media\u2019s natural affinity with home-made content. For many in the UK, Cara Saccomando neatly summed up the official advice: dressed half in her work uniform, half in pyjamas, stepping in and out of her house as the comedian Matt Lucas\u2019s send-up of Boris Johnson repeats \u201cdon\u2019t go to work. Go to work\u201d. Saccomando, a transport worker and model in Sheffield, posted the clip on social video platform TikTok; within two days it had been viewed nearly 2m times. Not all of the commentary has been critical. Abbie Chatfield, a runner-up in the TV show The Bachelor, posted a video of herself lovingly stroking a picture of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern; the Kiwi comedian Melanie Bracewell gained a following for her TikTok takes on Ardern during lockdown; while Laura Daniel expressed her \u201cstrictly professional\u201d desire for the New Zealand director-general in a saucy music video. (The former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard\u2019s famous \u201cmisogyny\u201d speech was also given a glambot twist for TikTok\u2019s #bosschallenge.) Lipsyncing is definitely having its moment. For the 28-year-old character actor and comedian Maria DeCotis, the motivation is to highlight the moments of humanity that have emerged during the pandemic, such as New York governor Andrew Cuomo finding the \u201csilver lining\u201d of social distancing in spending more time with his 22-year-old daughter. Enacted by DeCotis, a furiously chain-smoking Cuomo is haunted by the thought of losing his \u201cbaby\u201d daughter to her deadbeat boyfriend. The high-concept clip has had 1.2m views on Twitter and attention from Stephen Colbert and Alec Baldwin. DeCotis had been \u201criveted\u201d by the governor\u2019s \u201cmini-breakdown\u201d during a press briefing last month. \u201cI\u2019m not really commenting on his politics. It\u2019s more this human moment he had in this international crisis.\u201d Her aim is to entertain, not score political points, she says. \u201cIf I poke fun at this, maybe we can all relax a little and breathe.\u201d The Cuomo clips have given DeCotis new purpose: \u201cI was feeling, \u2018Why should I even get up? No one needs anything from me\u2019. But people still need to laugh.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Politicians and police have urged the public to stay away from Loch Lomond after it emerged thousands of people had breached the lockdown around the beauty spot in recent weeks. Police data shows the district which includes the villages of Balloch and Luss on the banks of the loch had the highest number of lockdown breaches of any in Scotland, with police ordering 2,291 people to go home in just 30 days. Shopkeepers in Balloch, the centre of the loch\u2019s tourism industry, said there was a rush of visitors at weekends and on sunny days. \u201cIt\u2019s been really mad,\u201d said John Gray at Lomond Stores, close to the village\u2019s railway station. \u201cEven on a normal summer\u2019s day it\u2019s not as busy as it has been these last few weeks. It\u2019s partly the weather, and also people getting sick of lockdown. People are out with their pals as if there\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d House painter Robin Rankin said: \u201cWe saw the riot squad in the park and the police were turning people back at the station.\u201d West Dunbartonshire, the police subdivision which also includes the towns of Clydebank and Dumbarton, accounted for 11% of the 21,487 lockdown breaches since Police Scotland began recording data by subdivision on 6 April, and the highest number of \u00a360 fines issued (167). The data shows breaches at weekends and on sunny days have increased. On Wednesday 6 May officers dispersed nearly 190 people \u2013 the highest number on any day in any subdivision since the lockdown began on 23 March. Similar problems have emerged in Stirling, the largely rural and mountainous subdivision that covers the eastern and northern shores of Loch Lomond, as well as the Trossachs, a popular climbing and walking area. In the 30 days from 6 April to 6 May, 1,164 dispersal orders and 71 fines were issued there, making it the fourth busiest area in Scotland. Glasgow South East has the second highest figures (1,938), with two other subdivisions in Glasgow also in the top five. In the weeks before Police Scotland recorded lockdown breaches by subdivision, the Argyll and West Dunbartonshire division regularly recorded the highest number of daily breaches, even though it is heavily rural. Bruce Crawford, the Scottish National party MSP for Stirling, and Jackie Baillie, the Labour MSP for the neighbouring Holyrood seat of Dumbarton, said the police had been trying hard to dissuade people from converging on local beauty spots. Baillie said local officers in Balloch were often overstretched, and both MSPs said residents had complained about the influxes into their villages. \u201cI think the police need to reinforce the message from the Scottish government that people shouldn\u2019t be travelling to Loch Lomond to take their exercise; they should stay away,\u201d Baillie said. \u201cI hope our stunning locations can be open for business soon, but getting there will mean stronger compliance with social distancing for a bit longer so that it will be safe to do so,\u201d Crawford said. Janet Moore, who sells takeaway hot drinks and food from Scoops cafe in Balloch, has covered up the signs advertising ice creams after attracting long queues of customers. She has had abuse from locals and silent phone calls. \u201cBut if I was doing anything wrong, I\u2019d have been closed down by now,\u201d said Moore. \u201cI can\u2019t tell people what to do, but we\u2019re trying to do everything we can. A lot of people are still working and they need hot food. We give free drinks to key workers and take cakes up to the hospital.\u201d Police Scotland said the force had consistently tried to dissuade people from heading to beauty spots, including beaches in Ayrshire such as Ayr and Troon, issuing appeals through the press and on the force\u2019s social media accounts. Ch Supt John Paterson, the West Dunbartonshire commander, said his officers had also been on patrol 24 hours a day trying to dissuade people from visiting the area. \u201cIn these messages, I have made it clear that while we are fortunate to have some areas of outstanding beauty across the division, this is not the time to visit these places,\u201d he said. The force is also helping an independent panel chaired by John Scott QC, a human rights lawyer, to study its lockdown enforcement in Glasgow. The three Glasgow subdivisions in the top five \u2013 South East, North West and North \u2013 accounted for 4,590 dispersal orders in those 30 days \u2013 21% of Scotland\u2019s total \u2013 and 120 fines.",

The teaching buildings are closed and the university has released all of its tenants from paying rent this term. Yet their hall of residence, run by Collegiate, a private developer, is demanding \u00a31,700 from each of its residents to cover the summer term.</p> <p>While students at most university-owned accommodation do not have to pay rent for the third term, Brown and Ruiz are among thousands of students trapped in expensive contracts with private hall operators.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8650a05c5e410b0aa9af3fe142b177e75687265a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8650a05c5e410b0aa9af3fe142b177e75687265a/6_264_1852_1111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nizar Ruiz and Eleanora Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nizar Ruiz and Eleanora Brown, students at Notttingham Trent University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nizar Ruiz</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brown\u2019s father, Russell, says: \u201cAs Eleanora is in lockdown at our family home and will not be returning to NTU for lessons, she asked if Collegiate would cancel her tenancy contract for the final term. It has refused to do this.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it morally corrupt that the government, through Student Finance England, loans Eleanora money which she has to pay to Collegiate and top up with her own money for accommodation she is no longer living in, and for facilities that are no longer available to her. She has to repay her student loan while Collegiate and the building owners (whoever that may be) get to keep the profits.\u201d</p> <p>Collegiate says its halls have remained open, and it has offered to let all students defer their next rent payment until August. It says NTU has not cancelled teaching \u201crather changed from face-to-face to online \u2026 all their students\u2019 education is continuing as is all financial support in terms of loans and grants\u201d.</p> <p>Steve Denton, the NTU chief operating officer, says: <em>\u201c</em>We urge Collegiate to reconsider their position. Students are staying away to respect government advice. They should not be penalised financially for being responsible citizens.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not just Collegiate that is still sending rent demands to students. Last week Emily Smith received a bill for \u00a31,287 from The Apollo Works, her hall of residence at Coventry University (operated by a company called Host) to cover the third term of this academic year. Yet Coventry shut its campus in March, Smith has been at home in Hertfordshire since then, and the hall of residence is, she says, virtually empty.</p> <p>Host operates 12,000 student beds in 22 cities across the UK and Ireland, but has no single policy on early cancellation. In Plymouth, it operates six student halls of residence, and has allowed students at four to terminate their contracts early. But that is not an option at its two other blocks in the city.</p> <p>It\u2019s a mixed picture across privately owned halls. The good news is that Unite, the biggest private provider of student accommodation, has agreed to let students <a href=\"https://www.unitestudents.com/the-common-room/health-and-wellbeing/coronavirus-student-faqs#leaving\" title=\"\">surrender tenancy agreements</a> and is giving refunds to those who paid in advance. But Fresh Student Living has <a href=\"https://freshstudentliving.co.uk/2020/03/20/covid-19-coronavirus-your-questions-answered/\" title=\"\">warned</a> its 18,000 tenants that they may not be released early from their contracts.</p> <p>More than 1,600 students have <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/allow-students-to-suspend-rent-agreements-at-fresh-student-living?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\">signed a petition against Fresh</a>, which says: \u201cIt is categorically unfair and greedy to charge students for rent if they are unable to live in their accommodation.\u201d</p> <p>Fresh says it only operates the buildings and is not the underlying owner. In those owned by its parent company, Watkin Jones, students who have left can claim a credit for the final rent instalment. It adds: \u201cA number of owners have agreed to offer credits or refunds to students. Unfortunately, not all owners have been able to agree some form of refund.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the landlords refusing to cancel rents are based in offshore tax havens.</p> <p>At Host\u2019s Apollo Works in Coventry, where Smith rents, the landlord named on her contract is not Host but two firms called BR Student Housing Nominee 1 Ltd and BR Student Housing Nominee 2 Ltd. These are based in Jersey, with documents naming shareholders as BlackRock (Channel Islands) and BNP Paribas (Jersey). Both are giant international investment companies, with BlackRock controlling assets worth more than $7tn (\u00a35.64tn). </p> <p>Smith is not alone in her anger. A petition, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/blackrock-make-black-rock-release-students-from-rent?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\">Make</a> Black Rock<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/blackrock-make-black-rock-release-students-from-rent?source_location=topic_page\" title=\"\"> Release Students from Rent</a>\u201d, says: \u201cStudents are vulnerable targets of private companies who want to make a financial gain, especially in this particularly hard time.

      "bodyText": "Notttingham Trent University students Eleanora Brown and her boyfriend Nizar Ruiz are in lockdown at home in Norwich, with no prospect of returning to campus any time soon. The teaching buildings are closed and the university has released all of its tenants from paying rent this term. Yet their hall of residence, run by Collegiate, a private developer, is demanding \u00a31,700 from each of its residents to cover the summer term. While students at most university-owned accommodation do not have to pay rent for the third term, Brown and Ruiz are among thousands of students trapped in expensive contracts with private hall operators. Brown\u2019s father, Russell, says: \u201cAs Eleanora is in lockdown at our family home and will not be returning to NTU for lessons, she asked if Collegiate would cancel her tenancy contract for the final term. It has refused to do this. \u201cWe think it morally corrupt that the government, through Student Finance England, loans Eleanora money which she has to pay to Collegiate and top up with her own money for accommodation she is no longer living in, and for facilities that are no longer available to her. She has to repay her student loan while Collegiate and the building owners (whoever that may be) get to keep the profits.\u201d Collegiate says its halls have remained open, and it has offered to let all students defer their next rent payment until August. It says NTU has not cancelled teaching \u201crather changed from face-to-face to online \u2026 all their students\u2019 education is continuing as is all financial support in terms of loans and grants\u201d. Steve Denton, the NTU chief operating officer, says: \u201cWe urge Collegiate to reconsider their position. Students are staying away to respect government advice. They should not be penalised financially for being responsible citizens.\u201d It\u2019s not just Collegiate that is still sending rent demands to students. Last week Emily Smith received a bill for \u00a31,287 from The Apollo Works, her hall of residence at Coventry University (operated by a company called Host) to cover the third term of this academic year. Yet Coventry shut its campus in March, Smith has been at home in Hertfordshire since then, and the hall of residence is, she says, virtually empty. Host operates 12,000 student beds in 22 cities across the UK and Ireland, but has no single policy on early cancellation. In Plymouth, it operates six student halls of residence, and has allowed students at four to terminate their contracts early. But that is not an option at its two other blocks in the city. It\u2019s a mixed picture across privately owned halls. The good news is that Unite, the biggest private provider of student accommodation, has agreed to let students surrender tenancy agreements and is giving refunds to those who paid in advance. But Fresh Student Living has warned its 18,000 tenants that they may not be released early from their contracts. More than 1,600 students have signed a petition against Fresh, which says: \u201cIt is categorically unfair and greedy to charge students for rent if they are unable to live in their accommodation.\u201d Fresh says it only operates the buildings and is not the underlying owner. In those owned by its parent company, Watkin Jones, students who have left can claim a credit for the final rent instalment. It adds: \u201cA number of owners have agreed to offer credits or refunds to students. Unfortunately, not all owners have been able to agree some form of refund.\u201d Some of the landlords refusing to cancel rents are based in offshore tax havens. At Host\u2019s Apollo Works in Coventry, where Smith rents, the landlord named on her contract is not Host but two firms called BR Student Housing Nominee 1 Ltd and BR Student Housing Nominee 2 Ltd. These are based in Jersey, with documents naming shareholders as BlackRock (Channel Islands) and BNP Paribas (Jersey). Both are giant international investment companies, with BlackRock controlling assets worth more than $7tn (\u00a35.64tn). Smith is not alone in her anger. A petition, \u201cMake Black Rock Release Students from Rent\u201d, says: \u201cStudents are vulnerable targets of private companies who want to make a financial gain, especially in this particularly hard time. This has affected tenants of not only Apollo Works, Coventry, but also Hope Street Apartments, Liverpool, The Old Dairy, Plymouth and Frobisher House, Plymouth. All of which are under the same landlord, BR Student Housing Unit Trust.\u201d Host says: \u201cDecisions on the cancellation policies of contracts are outside of our control and made by the individual building owners. In respect of The Apollo Works, we have been advised by the building\u2019s owner that it will not be possible to terminate the contracts of those residents who have decided to leave their accommodation.\u201d But halls of residence make up only a part of the student rental market, catering mostly for first-year students. The larger rental market is second and third-year students who move out of halls. Many are also finding that while their university has closed, their landlords are still demanding full rents. Ruth Day, a third-year maths and philosophy student at Bristol University, faces a \u00a31,320 rent bill for her final term even though she has vacated the property. \u201cAll of us are in a tight money spot right now, be that because we\u2019ve lost jobs or because of the uncertainty of when we\u2019ll next get money and it seems unreasonable that our landlord, who appears to be very wealthy, is so unsympathetic to our situation,\u201d she says. She has decided to join a rent strike with 130 other students in Bristol, with a campaign targeting local lettings agency, Digs. It is just one of a wave of rent strikes by students across the UK. Digs says it has suggested to all of its landlords a number of ways in which they could support tenants who were finding it difficult to pay their rent. \u201cMany landlords have released tenants early, some have offered zero rent, some have offered half rent, some have agreed other arrangements,\u201d it says. \u201cSome, usually those who heavily rely on the rent, are still requesting full rent as is their legal right.\u201d Legal experts say whether or not students must continue to pay rent during the lockdown will depend on the type of accommodation and their tenancy agreement. Daniel Fitzpatrick, a housing partner at law firm Hodge Jones &amp; Allen Solicitors told Guardian Education that students could try arguing that the contract has been frustrated by the Covid-19 outbreak. There may also be a break clause allowing them to terminate the contract before the end of the fixed term after providing the required notice. But students are generally advised to negotiate with their landlord immediately, as the obligation to pay rent will continue in accordance with their contract, and they could remain liable for any rent due up to the expiry of the notice period. Also worth considering is what happens in September when the new academic year begins. Should students and their parents be locking themselves into 12-month rental contracts to secure accommodation for the year ahead, when there is a possibility that campuses may not physically reopen this year? The National Union of Students vice-president (welfare), Eva Crossan Jory, says: \u201cMost students start looking for second and third year accommodation over the summer, with some even asked to pay holding fees, which we are against. \u201cBut there is no government guidance about what will be happening in September or what happens if universities say you can\u2019t come back to campus for the first term. \u201cWe are looking for much better public health guidance about whether it\u2019s going to be possible for millions of students to criss-cross the country in September.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I withdrew \u00a3200 from an ATM in mid-March \u2013 and I still have \u00a3160 left collecting dust in my wallet. Even one of the last reasons to keep a stock of coins in my car has gone, because the local supermarket has unchained the trolleys that previously needed a \u00a31 coin. Coronavirus is wiping out cash in the UK, and it will probably never return.</p> <p>Should we be bothered? Maybe. On my trip to the supermarket on Monday I also saw a lonely, frail and nervous gentleman, who looked to be in at least his 80s, taking cash out of the ATM. He probably shouldn\u2019t have been out, but clearly this was something he felt he really had to do. Never has there been a bigger gap between those of us who are abandoning cash, and those who still see it as crucial to their life.</p> <p>The Age UK boss, Caroline Abrahams, says it\u2019s deeply worrying that some older people are telling the charity that their cash supplies have run out and they are worried about how they will pay for their shopping.</p> <p>The good news is that the elderly gentleman I saw bent double over that ATM may not need to go back, if someone lets him and others like him know that the Post Office, and some banks, may deliver cash to their door.</p> <p>If you have a Post Office card account and are deemed vulnerable, that can be as much as \u00a32,500. NatWest, Barclays and Tesco Bank will also deliver to your door if you are a vulnerable customer.</p> <p>NatWest will generate a code over the phone for those over 70 to give to a friend or neighbour so they can withdraw an agreed amount from an ATM within the following three hours.</p> <p>But let\u2019s not fetishise cash usage. It\u2019s striking how many older people have switched to online banking and contactless payments since the lockdown began. Halifax says the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63%, and their use of contactless has also soared.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the increase in the UK of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/24/limit-for-contactless-spending-to-rise-to-45-at-beginning-of-april\">contactless limit to \u00a345 </a>at the start of April has made cash all but redundant for most. Either tap-and-go, or tap in four numbers for spending above \u00a345. Why bother to use an ATM, which will soon become a curiosity, a bit like a BT phone box. Around 250 disappear every month from our streets and malls, and not that many people even notice.</p> <p>A cashless society is cheaper (it costs billions every year to distribute notes), more honest (no more tax cheating from cash-in-hand payments) and safer (not much for muggers to steal or for drug dealers to do business in). Above all, for smartphone-wielding millennials, it\u2019s just far more convenient.</p> <p>The drawbacks? Bad news for everyone from buskers to beggars to churches that rely on cash donations.

      "bodyText": "I withdrew \u00a3200 from an ATM in mid-March \u2013 and I still have \u00a3160 left collecting dust in my wallet. Even one of the last reasons to keep a stock of coins in my car has gone, because the local supermarket has unchained the trolleys that previously needed a \u00a31 coin. Coronavirus is wiping out cash in the UK, and it will probably never return. Should we be bothered? Maybe. On my trip to the supermarket on Monday I also saw a lonely, frail and nervous gentleman, who looked to be in at least his 80s, taking cash out of the ATM. He probably shouldn\u2019t have been out, but clearly this was something he felt he really had to do. Never has there been a bigger gap between those of us who are abandoning cash, and those who still see it as crucial to their life. The Age UK boss, Caroline Abrahams, says it\u2019s deeply worrying that some older people are telling the charity that their cash supplies have run out and they are worried about how they will pay for their shopping. The good news is that the elderly gentleman I saw bent double over that ATM may not need to go back, if someone lets him and others like him know that the Post Office, and some banks, may deliver cash to their door. If you have a Post Office card account and are deemed vulnerable, that can be as much as \u00a32,500. NatWest, Barclays and Tesco Bank will also deliver to your door if you are a vulnerable customer. NatWest will generate a code over the phone for those over 70 to give to a friend or neighbour so they can withdraw an agreed amount from an ATM within the following three hours. But let\u2019s not fetishise cash usage. It\u2019s striking how many older people have switched to online banking and contactless payments since the lockdown began. Halifax says the numbers of over-65s signing up for online banking has jumped by 63%, and their use of contactless has also soared. Meanwhile, the increase in the UK of the contactless limit to \u00a345 at the start of April has made cash all but redundant for most. Either tap-and-go, or tap in four numbers for spending above \u00a345. Why bother to use an ATM, which will soon become a curiosity, a bit like a BT phone box. Around 250 disappear every month from our streets and malls, and not that many people even notice. A cashless society is cheaper (it costs billions every year to distribute notes), more honest (no more tax cheating from cash-in-hand payments) and safer (not much for muggers to steal or for drug dealers to do business in). Above all, for smartphone-wielding millennials, it\u2019s just far more convenient. The drawbacks? Bad news for everyone from buskers to beggars to churches that rely on cash donations. More importantly, some people will lose track of their spending, unable to budget wisely. Society\u2019s most marginalised, those not formally within the banking systems, could almost become non-persons. The banks love the switch to a cashless society, which should be a cause for concern in itself. A handful of giant players, such as Visa and Mastercard, will control the entire payments infrastructure \u2013 until one or both fall over, which even if it is only temporary, has the potential to freeze the entire financial system. Then there\u2019s the \u201cbig brother\u201d implications of having every penny of our spending logged and traceable. These drawbacks sound worse than the benefits, but they will be largely ignored as the convenience of contactless wins out. And as any millennial will tell you, budgeting is actually much better using the tools of an app rather than relying on the purse strings. Coronavirus is simply hastening the inevitable end of cash and coins. There was an enormous hullabaloo when the banks set a date for withdrawing cheques, and they hurriedly backtracked.

For the last three days, I have followed the tank\u2019s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece.</p> <p>The continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim.</p> <p>It has one final leg, a short hop from Athens to the island of Crete. But today is Greek Independence Day, a national holiday, and so all through Wednesday and long into Thursday the sperm waits at the depot. I call the courier company. All planes being grounded, it will travel to its destination by boat, the handler says brightly. \u201cIt is very urgent,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s for a <em>medical procedure</em>.\u201d She is reassuring but noncommittal. What I do not tell her is that, on Friday, I will have my eggs collected at a fertility clinic on Crete, and it is crucial that the sperm of the engineering student be there to meet them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>My life has been rich and rewarding, but the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Undergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone; my local health authority does not treat single women.</p> <p>With its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion\u2019s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered. I let myself into my rental apartment, ate the kalitsounia left by my host, and wondered what on earth I was doing.</p> <p>For some reason it is always taxi drivers who ask the question, though I imagine they are only voicing what others wonder: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have children?\u201d I suspect many assume I didn\u2019t want to be a mother, that I was too caught up in my career, that I left it too late. None of this is true. Having multiple miscarriages over many years, for which no medical investigation could find a cause, has been an exhausting, distressing and intensely lonely experience. And though my life has been rich and rewarding in many ways, the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys.</p> <p>***</p> <p>When I wake, it is to the sound of wood pigeons, and piano practice, and Sunday church bells. The day is bright and warm, and for some time I wander the city\u2019s empty, sunlit streets. The supermarket is closed, but I find a minimarket to buy a few groceries. Bread, feta, tomatoes. The owner regards me darkly across the counter, locking eyes as he sanitises his hands.</p> <p>So far there are only a handful of cases of the virus on the island. Soon there will be the first death: <a href=\"https://www.thenationalherald.com/archive_coronavirus/arthro/young_german_academic_dies_in_greece_from_coronavirus_complication-266579/\" title=\"\">a German professor</a> visiting the university for a conference. There is no room for tourists now. The swingers\u2019 festival has been cancelled; the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I hear IVF clinics around the world are closing, treatments being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with gratitude</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port. It takes 20 minutes to walk there in the rain, a fierce wind whipping in off the water. At the reception desk, I am told to stand behind a line as they fire a thermometer gun at my head, then permit me to ring the fertility centre doorbell. I fold the sleeve of my jumper over my thumb to press the buzzer.</p> <p>I will admit that I have not read up extensively on IVF. I have taken a strictly need-to-know approach, avoiding online message boards and support groups, spurning offers to bond with friends-of-friends over their own experiences. Each person is different, I have argued, each body is different. Still, as I stand waiting at the door, I realise that this means I have little idea of what to expect.</p> <p>A foreign clinic is disorienting when you are accustomed to another medical system: the rhythms are subtly different, the smells, the light all wrong. I notice the cigarette smoke on the senior nurse\u2019s breath, the junior who chews gum behind her mask as she draws my blood. Even the tourniquet strapped around my arm feels flimsier than back home. \u201cTake a breath,\u201d the nurse says solemnly, as she inserts the needle. She leaves a small trail of blood along my skin, then dispenses the contents of the large syringe into several containers; a spring-like gurgling sound that I find oddly hopeful.</p> <p>I walk home along the backstreets, past ageing stucco apartments and the sound of a couple arguing through an open window. When you are not familiar with a culture or a language, your senses become heightened \u2013 the colours louder, the sounds and scents more pronounced. I try to notice the details: the hover of wasps over the bowls of water left out for street cats. A snail on a bright blue wall. The firebug on an orange tree. It stops my mind from spiralling. I stop by the supermarket, where they are already limiting the number of customers, and plastic gloves are mandatory. But the shelves are full and no one is stockpiling.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I am used to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. I know that the grief will come later</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The following day, I return to the clinic. My blood test results have proved heartening and my consultant tells me he hopes for 15 or 16 eggs. He chatters warmly as he performs my ultrasound: about his time living in London in the days of disco, the fact that English women never cook. \u201cI like to cook,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhat do you cook? Sandwiches?\u201d he asks, then reels off the measurements of my ovaries to his assistant. When I leave, the senior nurse gives me a face mask, ties it tightly so that it covers my nose, and rubs my back with a kind of tenderness. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she says. \u201cMake sure you wear it.\u201d</p> <p>There is little new I can tell you about IVF medication. The basic protocol is to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, which are then removed, fertilised and returned; a further array of drugs help make the pregnancy sustainable. And so for the weeks to come my days are measured out in injections, pills and pessaries, in the fiddliness of mixing powders and solutions, of needles and small glass vials. Soon my stomach is puffy and bruised; my body feels distorted and misshapen.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I follow news of the pandemic on my laptop. I look at graphs and statistics. I listen to the BBC. Mostly I watch the UK with horror: its slow route to lockdown, the mad rush at the supermarkets, the people who flock to pubs and parks and jostle over toilet roll. There is none of that here. Rather, people move with a kind of quiet obedience. When my flight home is cancelled, I feel something like relief. I feel safe here.</p> <p>On 23 March, Greece grounds all flights to the UK and docks all boats to the islands. I can now only leave the house for an hour each day: to buy groceries, seek medical treatment or take exercise, and must first text the government for permission. A strange serenity settles over these days of confinement: I sleep well and long, read, work, take afternoon walks down to the waterfront. I do not return phone calls from well-meaning friends; texts and emails go unanswered. I feel beholden to nothing besides my own body, feed it yoghurt and oranges and sesame snaps. One day I read that IVF clinics around the world are closing, that treatments are being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with a great swell of gratefulness.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a talent for choosing unsupportive men who will find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected; he now hopes for five eggs.</p> <p>I am accustomed to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing.</p> <p>That I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men. I have a particular talent for choosing unsupportive partners, men who will ask you to choose between your baby and them, who will miss hospital appointments, and find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage.</p> <p>Last summer, I sat in my GP\u2019s surgery and told her I wanted to pursue solo IVF. I pressed my fingernails into my palm to steady myself as I spoke. She was supportive and kind, and made a referral to the fertility department at the local hospital.</p> <p>I was not technically single at the time, but two weeks later I left my boyfriend of four years. Some months earlier I had learned that he had cheated on me, constantly, for the entirety of our relationship, including while I was pregnant. I had loved him more than I had loved anybody, and perhaps this was the reason I had tried to make things work, but the days had soon settled into a kind of mute despair.</p> <p>It was liberating to feel in charge of my own destiny again, and for the three months while I waited for my first appointment with the fertility clinic, I felt thrillingly alive. When it came, that appointment was dispiriting: the nurse explained my local health authority\u2019s policy on treating single women. She was sympathetic, ordered a range of fertility tests, cautioned against using a donor I knew, and suggested I look at clinics abroad. \u201cGreece,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have some good clinics there.\u201d</p> <p>There followed several months of waiting \u2013 for test results, for a round of MMR vaccinations (my GP had no record of my ever having had them). The new year turned and it was almost spring. I told the clinic in Heraklion, chosen for its impressive success rates and peaceful location, that I would come in March. I had not heard of coronavirus then, though already in China the disease was spreading. It seemed very far away. I focused instead on the small, steady world I had created, of fertility acupuncture, sobriety and sperm selection.</p> <p>It is easy to get lost in the process of choosing a sperm donor, to dwell upon academic qualifications, professions, favourite pastimes. The more you pay, the more you know: baby photos, adult photos, voice notes, family medical histories. Some cryobanks will supply handwriting samples and outline drawings of your donor\u2019s face in profile; this can have the strange effect of making everyone look like a criminal.</p> <p>Above all, I decided, let him be kind. From hundreds of donors, I whittled it down to two: the mechanical engineering student whose profile was somewhat restrained, but about whom the staff appraisal spoke glowingly; and a Danish musician with wavy hair who talked about his love of nature and art. \u201cHe sounds like the kind of man I would date,\u201d I told my friends. This was not necessarily a good thing, they pointed out. That night I lay in bed and imagined their profiles being read in the voices of my very worst boyfriends. I chose the engineer.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Friday morning, the day of my egg retrieval, and the donor sperm has not arrived. The courier office can tell me only that it has left Athens. I take the coast road to the clinic, walk slowly through the uncertain morning, and try not to think about the catastrophe before me. The air is sweet and soft, the sea a searing blue. I am watching the light play on the waves when, just beyond the port, I see the daily cargo boat approaching the shore, bringing supplies from the mainland: food and medicine and a nitrogen tank of donor sperm.</p> <p>In the days that follow, I like to think of my eggs in the laboratory, cells dividing, happily gathering into blastocysts. It makes me feel less alone. I await news from the embryologist, sleeping, eating, taking long walks. One morning, I wake to a ruffling sound beyond my bedroom curtains. It is a bird, I think, that has flown into my courtyard. But when I look I find it is rain: heavy, plump drops on the corrugated iron roof and the broad leaves of the potted plants. That day the embryologist calls: transfer will be in two days\u2019 time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant. There was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another flight is cancelled. Getting home will now take some 42 hours, several changes of plane, and hundreds of pounds. \u201cDo I need to come and rescue you?\u201d an ex-boyfriend emails. I tell him he should know by now that I am not someone who takes well to rescuing. Perhaps if I did, I would not be here doing IVF alone in a foreign country in the first place.</p> <p>I am worried about the pigeons. The square outside the cathedral, in normal times surrounded by busy restaurants, lies quiet; deprived of their usual scraps, the birds seem bewildered. They flock near the cathedral steps, as if hoping for mercy. I take to feeding them: crusts of bread and old kalitsounia that brings them flocking around my ankles, burbling and fluttering as they eat. I feed the cats, too, their thin little bodies winding against my calves.</p> <p>I am the only patient at the clinic on the morning of my embryo transfer. The number of treatments is dwindling as no one can travel and there is too much uncertainty. My consultant, the junior nurse, the embryologist and I gather in the operating theatre. The embryologist plays Mozart through her phone to drown out the whirr of the generator. It is a simple procedure \u2013 the embryo being transferred to the womb via a catheter. \u201cThere!\u201d the consultant says. On the screen I watch a small dot make its way across the darkness and then settle.</p> <p>For the next two weeks it will become the pale white dot upon which I live. I think about my tiny speck of hope as I follow the growing bleakness of the world: nurses in London wearing bin bags and scuba masks, the want of ventilators in New York City, the death toll in Italy that rises and rises. I try not to think about how I will get home, about the potential dangers of travelling across a continent, newly pregnant, in a pandemic.</p> <p>In my isolation chamber I feel like a Russian doll, inside me another smaller me, confined in her own small isolation. I have been pregnant enough times that this state feels familiar: all-engulfing, electric. And yet I have miscarried enough to know that nothing is certain. I have often thought that the two-week wait between conception and pregnancy test is like being alone in a strange house: every sound, every shadow, can convince you that someone is there.</p> <p>For a week I feel truly pregnant. And then suddenly I do not. One day I wake to feel a tangible distance between the synthetic hormones and my own body. I do not tell anyone. Instead I walk down to the water, stay out far beyond the mandated hour. I marvel at the flicker of tiny fish moving between the boats in the harbour. I look at the bright yellow tangle of fishing nets, the deep pink of wooden shutters, the distant mountains, snow-peaked against the bluest sky.</p> <p>I walk on beside the sea, past young couples, hands entwined, and think of how clinical and lustless the IVF process is. Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once.</p> <p>On the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself; I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/babysitting-embryo-carry-child-for-friend-surrogacy\">\u2018She said she\u2019d be babysitting our embryo\u2019: what\u2019s it like to carry a child for a friend?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/01/in-your-prime-older-wiser-happier-india-knight-review\" title=\"\">In Your Prime</a>, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives diverge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots.

And sometimes, too, when all seems lost, a small patch of blue sky above a courtyard in Greece.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is 7.53am, the last Wednesday in March, and at a courier depot in Athens, the sperm of a Bermudian mechanical engineering student arrives, carried in a nitrogen tank. For the last three days, I have followed the tank\u2019s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece. The continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim. It has one final leg, a short hop from Athens to the island of Crete. But today is Greek Independence Day, a national holiday, and so all through Wednesday and long into Thursday the sperm waits at the depot. I call the courier company. All planes being grounded, it will travel to its destination by boat, the handler says brightly. \u201cIt is very urgent,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s for a medical procedure.\u201d She is reassuring but noncommittal. What I do not tell her is that, on Friday, I will have my eggs collected at a fertility clinic on Crete, and it is crucial that the sperm of the engineering student be there to meet them. Undergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone; my local health authority does not treat single women. With its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion\u2019s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered. I let myself into my rental apartment, ate the kalitsounia left by my host, and wondered what on earth I was doing. For some reason it is always taxi drivers who ask the question, though I imagine they are only voicing what others wonder: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have children?\u201d I suspect many assume I didn\u2019t want to be a mother, that I was too caught up in my career, that I left it too late. None of this is true. Having multiple miscarriages over many years, for which no medical investigation could find a cause, has been an exhausting, distressing and intensely lonely experience. And though my life has been rich and rewarding in many ways, the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys. *** When I wake, it is to the sound of wood pigeons, and piano practice, and Sunday church bells. The day is bright and warm, and for some time I wander the city\u2019s empty, sunlit streets. The supermarket is closed, but I find a minimarket to buy a few groceries. Bread, feta, tomatoes. The owner regards me darkly across the counter, locking eyes as he sanitises his hands. So far there are only a handful of cases of the virus on the island. Soon there will be the first death: a German professor visiting the university for a conference. There is no room for tourists now. The swingers\u2019 festival has been cancelled; the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness. The clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port.

When I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected; he now hopes for five eggs. I am accustomed to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing. That I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men.

Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once. On the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself; I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry. Some years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, In Your Prime, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives diverge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots. For those caught up in the business of parenthood, she wrote, \u201cthere is no especial pleasure to be had in a single and/or childless person banging on about the minutiae of their small, unpeopled little life\u201d. The phrase has stuck with me. As my friends have paired off and become parents, I have seen them less, travelled more, grown quieter. I cannot hope to understand the dramatic shifts and expansions in their lives, just as they are unlikely to understand the reduction of my own. And as the weeks of lockdown rolled on, that phrase has returned to me anew; I came to think how all our lives have grown small and unpeopled. How we have come to find pleasure in the minutiae: the slow drift of days, the unfurling of blossom, a street filled with clapping on a warm spring evening. And sometimes, too, when all seems lost, a small patch of blue sky above a courtyard in Greece.",

      "bodyText": "More than half of pregnant women who were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in the UK were from a black and minority ethnic background, a study has found, prompting experts to issue guidance for midwives to remain on high alert and lower the threshold for diagnosis by medical professionals. The study found that 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1 March to 14 April were from a BAME background. The findings show women from a BAME background were four times more likely to be hospitalised with coronavirus than white women. The study suggests that for pregnant women, being from a BAME background is a stronger predictor of the likelihood of being hospitalised with coronavirus than age and obesity. The \u201ctroubling\u201d data prompted the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) to develop new guidance for midwives and maternity support workers to ensure that they are aware of the increased risks for BAME women and that there is a lower threshold for investigating symptoms and advising them on whether they need to be seen by a medical professional. The impact of the coronavirus has shone a light on longstanding maternal health disparities, experts said. The study follows findings from an inquiry published last year, which showed that black women were five times more likely to die from complications surrounding pregnancy and childbirth than white women, while Asian women were twice as likely to die. The RCM has also launched a targeted campaign to raise awareness of the increased risk to BAME women and reassure pregnant mothers that help is available. \u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that there are big disparities in maternal health according to ethnicity,\u201d Prof Marian Knight, the lead researcher of the study at Oxford University, said, \u201cbut what is surprising is the extent of the imbalance.

      "body": "<p>We have built a world where parents need the childcare provided by the school system. In some families parents are working at night, or rising at 5am to sustain a struggling business before their children wake up. They may more urgently feel the need for schools to reopen than those who can happily juggle a few hours of homeschooling with working from home.</p> <p>But think about what primary teachers are facing with the prospect of suddenly going back to school with gaggles of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/11/headteachers-raise-concerns-over-reopening-of-english-primary-schools\">five- and six-year-olds</a>. As one infant teacher said on the radio this week: \u201cWe\u2019ll have six classes back, so we need at least 12 classrooms, but only have nine. The government has admitted we can\u2019t socially distance, so they\u2019re playing with our health. We are taking the children\u2019s toys away, because they have to be constantly cleaned, what will they do all day? I\u2019ve got four pages of issues like this!\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, a headteacher on the same show said: \u201cSitting around saying it\u2019s too hard is no model for our young people.\u201d Solutions had to be found.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/like-the-open-university-we-now-need-an-open-school-for-the-whole-country\">Like the Open University, we now need an Open School for the whole country | Tim Brighouse and Bob Moon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Schools are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/17/covid-19-reveals-the-alarming-truth-that-many-children-cant-wash-their-hands-at-school\">hurriedly buying washing troughs</a> and putting up sanitiser stations. Marking parent drop-off areas. Deep-cleaning canteens. Children will play in chalked circles on playgrounds. For a moment it sounds doable. But then, a child coughs in a narrow corridor; another falls and hurts his knee. He\u2019s crying, it\u2019s bleeding. A child with special needs requires help with feeding and there is no protective equipment. And what happens if there\u2019s a fight?</p> <p>Now imagine: it\u2019s your daughter, your husband, or your best friend who is teaching. Are you happy for them to jump into these situations? It is too easy to be dismissive about low potential harm unless it\u2019s your loved one taking the risk. It is vital that trade unions question hard and push for the safest possible conditions before schools can reopen.</p> <p>Certainty on safety is not possible, though. The virus is still mysterious and new complexities may yet arise. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/dont-bet-on-vaccine-to-protect-us-from-covid-19-says-world-health-expert\">experts have admitted</a> a vaccine may never come.

Your heart\u2019s calculator may now calibrate the risks differently. Schools reopening, at least in some form, would be a lifeline.

      "bodyText": "We have built a world where parents need the childcare provided by the school system. In some families parents are working at night, or rising at 5am to sustain a struggling business before their children wake up. They may more urgently feel the need for schools to reopen than those who can happily juggle a few hours of homeschooling with working from home. But think about what primary teachers are facing with the prospect of suddenly going back to school with gaggles of five- and six-year-olds. As one infant teacher said on the radio this week: \u201cWe\u2019ll have six classes back, so we need at least 12 classrooms, but only have nine. The government has admitted we can\u2019t socially distance, so they\u2019re playing with our health. We are taking the children\u2019s toys away, because they have to be constantly cleaned, what will they do all day? I\u2019ve got four pages of issues like this!\u201d On the other hand, a headteacher on the same show said: \u201cSitting around saying it\u2019s too hard is no model for our young people.\u201d Solutions had to be found. Schools are now hurriedly buying washing troughs and putting up sanitiser stations. Marking parent drop-off areas. Deep-cleaning canteens. Children will play in chalked circles on playgrounds. For a moment it sounds doable. But then, a child coughs in a narrow corridor; another falls and hurts his knee. He\u2019s crying, it\u2019s bleeding. A child with special needs requires help with feeding and there is no protective equipment. And what happens if there\u2019s a fight? Now imagine: it\u2019s your daughter, your husband, or your best friend who is teaching. Are you happy for them to jump into these situations? It is too easy to be dismissive about low potential harm unless it\u2019s your loved one taking the risk. It is vital that trade unions question hard and push for the safest possible conditions before schools can reopen. Certainty on safety is not possible, though. The virus is still mysterious and new complexities may yet arise. The experts have admitted a vaccine may never come. But imagine: it is your home at risk because you can\u2019t work, or your sanity dwindling from the 57th day of home schooling, or your six-year-old sobbing because they miss their friends. Your heart\u2019s calculator may now calibrate the risks differently. Schools reopening, at least in some form, would be a lifeline. We need to be smart about this. In Italy, Spain and Ireland schoolchildren will not return until autumn at the earliest. Wales and Scotland are leaning the same way. Yet, in England, politicians are putting their efforts into fighting with the unions for an early return \u2013 and one that initially offers just three year groups a poor, socially distanced, in-a-school-but-not-really-school experience for, at best, six weeks before the end of term. Meanwhile, many parents will still be unable to work because they have a child in another year group stuck at home but now have the added complexity of a heavily sanitised school run on top of it all. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary in England, should stop looking for fights. Instead, he should pause, and focus schools on doing distance learning really well by setting minimum standards for the remainder of the academic year. It seems right, for example, that every child should speak with a teacher at least once a week and receive meaningful feedback on work they have completed during that time. Meanwhile, schools could survey which parents need childcare, and gradually those children could be integrated alongside the 2% of children still at school each day because their parent is a key worker or they are considered vulnerable. With appetites low for schooling, it is likely demand would be manageable. Why this approach has been missed is not clear. The Department for Education\u2019s own scientific adviser admits he hasn\u2019t seen any modelling around reopening schools and says the evidence on transmission is mixed. Is this about getting people back to work, or is it a classic Conservative trick of fuelling union strife to divert public attention from government failings and aim it towards a profession with a well-protected salary? Whatever it is, it doesn\u2019t seem to be about safety or learning. There are no easy answers but Williamson can find smarter solutions. The question is whether he has the courage.",

But the retail group has told the City that its clothing and homewares business had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/28/marks-spencer-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic\">\u201cseverely constrained during lockdown\u201d</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/next\">Next</a>, one of the high street\u2019s strongest performers, which banked profits of \u00a3600m last year, has warned that it could suffer losses of \u00a3150m on the back of the shutdown.</p> <p>Already, Topshop, Miss Selfridge and French Connection are offering discounts of up to 50% online, Debenhams up to 30% while New Look and Moss Bros have discounts of at least 25%.</p> <p>Sofie Willmott, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cAll the stock has been sitting in stores since the end of March gathering dust and some of it won\u2019t have been brand-new then. Retailers are going to want to shift that. They are going to have to reduce the amount of stock in stores.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe level of discounts is going to be massive [when stores open]. There were lots of discounts going on before the lockdown and there are discounts going online now.\u201d</p> <p>She suggested that brands such as Ted Baker and Moss Bros might face a particular challenge because they were focused on smart clothing for events and office wear which are now far less in demand as many people work from home and weddings are cancelled.</p> <p>John Lewis is poised to launch another round of fashion discounts in the coming days even though the department store chain has only just finished a 30%-off deal. Heavy discounts on fashion brands such as Joules, Hobbs and Reiss are already available on its website.</p> <p>Industry insiders believe Primark is planning to mark its return to the high street with massive discounts, which could include buy-one-get-one-free bonanzas.</p> <p>One senior fashion insider said some retailers would suffer more than others: \u201cIt depends how much stock you bought and we still have June, July and August. But we have missed the best two months of the season and there will be no high season or holiday shop \u2013 because there will be no holidays.\u201d</p> <p>The stock mountain was just part of the grim picture on the high street, the executive said: \u201cThe problem is not now. It is how you reopen and pay all your bills. If 25% of fashion retailers were in turmoil before [coronavirus], it has got to be 60%-70% now. At the time we locked down, fashion businesses had just stocked up. If you have got some good stuff, you can box it up, but not if you need the cash to pay your suppliers. Then you have to turn it into cash and you will get a lower margin for it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said: \u201cI think there will be wall-to-wall promotions for the rest of the year.\u201d He estimated that \u00a310bn\u2013\u00a315bn worth of spring and summer clothes were sitting in shops and warehouses and said the tough economic backdrop meant \u201cpersuading people to part with their money would be really hard\u201d.</p> <p>Non-essential stores are expected to start opening next month, but retailers will have to balance managing social distancing with trying to clear the decks. They also fear government-imposed limits on discounting. In Spain, where some non-essential retail outlets were allowed to open earlier this month, the authorities blocked retailers from any discounting activity that might draw a crowd. </p> <p>It is also not clear how keen shoppers will be to return to the high street. Analysts say retailers had been buoyed by stronger than expected sales in countries, such as Germany, which had reopened shops in recent weeks, but UK shoppers may not be so bold. </p>",

One industry insider told the Guardian that warehouse storage space is more than 90% full and some retailers have been storing container-loads of summer fashion in locations such as railway sidings and on former Ministry of Defence land due to the lack of space and the exploding cost of storage in ports \u2013 from about \u00a320 per container a day to more than \u00a3100. M&amp;S has dressed up its price cuts, which start at 50%, as a \u201crainbow sale\u201d \u2013 and is handing 10% of takings to NHS charities. But the retail group has told the City that its clothing and homewares business had been \u201cseverely constrained during lockdown\u201d. Next, one of the high street\u2019s strongest performers, which banked profits of \u00a3600m last year, has warned that it could suffer losses of \u00a3150m on the back of the shutdown. Already, Topshop, Miss Selfridge and French Connection are offering discounts of up to 50% online, Debenhams up to 30% while New Look and Moss Bros have discounts of at least 25%. Sofie Willmott, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: \u201cAll the stock has been sitting in stores since the end of March gathering dust and some of it won\u2019t have been brand-new then. Retailers are going to want to shift that. They are going to have to reduce the amount of stock in stores.\u201d \u201cThe level of discounts is going to be massive [when stores open]. There were lots of discounts going on before the lockdown and there are discounts going online now.\u201d She suggested that brands such as Ted Baker and Moss Bros might face a particular challenge because they were focused on smart clothing for events and office wear which are now far less in demand as many people work from home and weddings are cancelled. John Lewis is poised to launch another round of fashion discounts in the coming days even though the department store chain has only just finished a 30%-off deal. Heavy discounts on fashion brands such as Joules, Hobbs and Reiss are already available on its website. Industry insiders believe Primark is planning to mark its return to the high street with massive discounts, which could include buy-one-get-one-free bonanzas. One senior fashion insider said some retailers would suffer more than others: \u201cIt depends how much stock you bought and we still have June, July and August. But we have missed the best two months of the season and there will be no high season or holiday shop \u2013 because there will be no holidays.\u201d The stock mountain was just part of the grim picture on the high street, the executive said: \u201cThe problem is not now. It is how you reopen and pay all your bills. If 25% of fashion retailers were in turmoil before [coronavirus], it has got to be 60%-70% now. At the time we locked down, fashion businesses had just stocked up. If you have got some good stuff, you can box it up, but not if you need the cash to pay your suppliers. Then you have to turn it into cash and you will get a lower margin for it.\u201d Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said: \u201cI think there will be wall-to-wall promotions for the rest of the year.\u201d He estimated that \u00a310bn\u2013\u00a315bn worth of spring and summer clothes were sitting in shops and warehouses and said the tough economic backdrop meant \u201cpersuading people to part with their money would be really hard\u201d. Non-essential stores are expected to start opening next month, but retailers will have to balance managing social distancing with trying to clear the decks. They also fear government-imposed limits on discounting. In Spain, where some non-essential retail outlets were allowed to open earlier this month, the authorities blocked retailers from any discounting activity that might draw a crowd. It is also not clear how keen shoppers will be to return to the high street. Analysts say retailers had been buoyed by stronger than expected sales in countries, such as Germany, which had reopened shops in recent weeks, but UK shoppers may not be so bold.",

Some of the accusations have been deeply racialized, from the questioning of Obama\u2019s intelligence to talking about how much basketball he plays to questioning his birthplace and citizenship.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has shredded many norms, including that of presidents maintaining a respectful contact with their predecessors. He has dismissed the idea of seeking Obama\u2019s input during the coronavirus pandemic. For his part, Obama has carefully chosen his moments to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/01/obama-condemns-trump-paris-climate-accord\">condemn certain decisions</a> or policies without mentioning Trump by name.</p> <p>But tensions flared last week when a tape leaked of Obama on a private conference call with about 3,000 alumni of his administration, describing Trump\u2019s leadership in the pandemic as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d.

Critics suggest that the president is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-s-obamagate-comments-barr-s-flynn-meddling-suggest-troubling-ncna1204856\">weaponise the justice department</a> for electoral gain.</p> <p><a href=\"https://vianovo.com/people/matthew-miller\">Matthew Miller,</a> a former director of the office of public affairs at the department, said: \u201cIn terms of any real action against Barack Obama, he obviously doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about.

      "bodyText": "President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump once sat together in the Oval Office. \u201cI was immediately struck by Trump\u2019s body language,\u201d wrote journalist Jon Karl in his memoir Front Row at The Trump Show. \u201cI was seeing a side of him I had never seen. He seemed, believe it or not, humbled.\u201d It was November 2016 and, just for once, Trump was not in charge of the room, Karl recalls. Obama was still president, directing the action and setting the tone. His successor \u201cseemed a little dazed\u201d and \u201ca little freaked out\u201d. What the two men discussed in their meeting that day, only they know. But what became clear in the next three and a half years is that Obama remains something of an obsession for Trump; the subject of a political and personal inferiority complex. Observers point to a mix of anti-intellectualism, racism, vengeance and primitive envy over everything from Obama\u2019s Nobel peace prize to the scale of his inauguration crowd and social media following. Ben Rhodes, a former Obama national security aide, tweeted this week: \u201cTrump\u2019s fact-free fixation on Obama dating back to birtherism is so absurd and stupid that it would be comic if it wasn\u2019t so tragic.\u201d \u201cBirtherism\u201d was a conspiracy theory that Trump started pushing in 2011 (\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate. He may have one but there is something on that birth certificate \u2013 maybe religion, maybe it says he\u2019s a Muslim, I don\u2019t know.\u201d) . Nine years later, he has come full circle with \u201cObamagate\u201d, which accuses his predecessor of working in league with the \u201cdeep state\u201d to frame Trump for colluding with Russia to win the 2016 election. There is zero evidence for this claim. Indeed, a case could be made that the supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d did more to help Trump than hurt him when the FBI reopened an investigation into his opponent, Hillary Clinton, just before election day. When questioned by reporters, Trump himself has struggled to articulate what \u201cObamagate\u201d means. Ned Price, a former CIA analyst, dubbed it \u201ca hashtag in search of a scandal\u201d. But his allies in the Republican party and conservative media are stepping up to build a parallel universe where this is the big story and Obama is at the center of it. Sean Hannity, a host on Fox News, demanded: \u201cWhat did Barack Obama know and when did he know it?\u201d Over the past week, the channel\u2019s primetime shows have devoted more coverage to the bogus crimes of \u201cBarack Hussein Obama\u201d than to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 and Trump\u2019s mishandling of it. Tara Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: \u201cDonald Trump always needs a foil. This riles up his base because they cling to anything that diverges responsibility for anything from Donald Trump over to someone else. And in this case Barack Obama is the boogeyman of the month.\u201d Beyond political expediency, there is a more profound antipathy at work. From the Iran nuclear deal to the Trans Pacific Partnership, from environmental regulations to the Affordable Care Act, Trump has always seemed to be on a mission to erase his predecessor\u2019s legacy. With few deep convictions of his own, Trump found a negative reference point in Obama. Between 22 November 2010 and 14 May 2020, he tweeted about Obama 2,933 times, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. There are a few reasons, argues Setmayer, host of the Honestly Speaking podcast. \u201cFirst off, Donald Trump has a problem where I think he\u2019s just jealous of the fact that President Obama is still so admired. Number two, I think he has a problem with people of color who are in authority that don\u2019t do the kind of song and dance that he wants them to do. \u201cBarack Obama is not a \u2018shuck and jive\u2019 person of color, and those are the kinds of people that Donald Trump seems to be attracted to if you look at who he surrounds himself with as far as minorities are concerned.\u201d Third, Setmayer points to the 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner, where Trump sat stony-faced and humiliated as Obama lampooned the Celebrity Apprentice host\u2019s nascent political ambitions. Obama even pointed to a photoshopped image of a Trump White House with hotel, casino, golf course and gold columns. \u201cA lot of people think that this is where this all started,\u201d Setmayer continued. \u201cPresident Trump does not have a sense of humor, he\u2019s not self-deprecating, and the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner is a fun event where people make fun of each other, especially in politics.\u201d Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group, said: \u201cThis obsession, of course, is absolutely rooted in racism. Some of the accusations have been deeply racialized, from the questioning of Obama\u2019s intelligence to talking about how much basketball he plays to questioning his birthplace and citizenship.\u201d Trump has shredded many norms, including that of presidents maintaining a respectful contact with their predecessors. He has dismissed the idea of seeking Obama\u2019s input during the coronavirus pandemic. For his part, Obama has carefully chosen his moments to condemn certain decisions or policies without mentioning Trump by name. But tensions flared last week when a tape leaked of Obama on a private conference call with about 3,000 alumni of his administration, describing Trump\u2019s leadership in the pandemic as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d. He also warned a justice department move to drop charges against Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, indicates that \u201cthe rule of law is at risk\u201d. Trump has described Flynn as a wronged \u201chero\u201d and argued that Obama and his vice-president, Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for November\u2019s election, should \u201cpay a big price\u201d for supposedly derailing the retired general\u2019s career. Critics suggest that the president is seeking to weaponise the justice department for electoral gain. Matthew Miller, a former director of the office of public affairs at the department, said: \u201cIn terms of any real action against Barack Obama, he obviously doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about. But when you look at what\u2019s happened at the justice department with the complete politicisation of that department, I think it\u2019s quite possible that they\u2019re going to be coming after people from the Obama administration, using the criminal justice process any way they can.\u201d It would be one of the gravest consequences of Trump\u2019s Obama obsession. Miller added: \u201cThere\u2019s some racism there but, most of all, it\u2019s driven by the fact that Obama has the thing that Trump has always craved but never achieved, and that\u2019s respect. I\u2019ve always thought that the respect that Barack Obama gets from people in this country and around the world is something that just eats Trump alive inside.\u201d Obama issued a tweet on Thursday that contained one word: \u201cVote.\u201d He is expected to campaign vigorously for Biden, wooing voters who crave a return to what they saw as the dignity and stability of his era. But his presence is also likely to be inverted by Trump to rally his base with dark warnings that, like Clinton before him, Biden would effectively represent a third term of Obama. The 2016 rally chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d might be replaced by \u201cLock him up!\u201d The 2020 election could yet turn into a final showdown between Obama and Trump, even if only one of their names is on the ballot. It will be a clash of opposites: one a mixed-race cerebral lawyer who has been married to the same woman for nearly three decades and publishes annual lists of his favorite books; the other a white billionaire and reality TV star who wed three times and measures success in TV ratings. Where one is renowned for elegant turns of phrase and shedding tears after mass shootings, the other serves up jumbled word salads and schoolboy spelling errors and has struggled to show empathy for the coronavirus dead. Michael D\u2019Antonio, a political commentator and author of The Truth About Trump, said: \u201cThere\u2019s so much that separates them, it\u2019s hard to imagine two presidents more different.

      "body": "<p>Every day during the coronavirus lockdown, the government has hammered home the need for the public to take daily exercise. The irony is that the UK\u2019s more than 7,000 gyms and leisure centres are shut, leaving the population to improvise with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over\">Joe Wicks</a> on YouTube and cobbled-together workouts in the park.</p> <p>More than 10m memberships were effectively put on ice when gyms closed in March, and we now know gyms will be among the last businesses to reopen come the summer.

But will Britons ever want to sweat en masse again, and with restrictions in place, do the numbers add up for gym operators any more?</p> <p>\u201cWe had a couple of bad days at the end of March when a lot of people started to cancel,\u201d recounts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/sep/17/humphrey-cobbold-wiggle-interview\">Humphrey Cobbold</a>, chief executive of PureGym, the UK\u2019s biggest chain. \u201cWe froze our memberships instantly so nobody had a reason to cancel and when we researched why they were \u2026 nearly half were just cancelling all their direct debits saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want any money going out\u2019.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8d2ad17794f4f9d3dd700b15194a174a053035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f8d2ad17794f4f9d3dd700b15194a174a053035/146_0_4386_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wicks has taught the nation DIY keep-fit routines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Wicks has taught the nation DIY keep-fit routines.

With 10.4m memberships, it is an \u00a38bn-a-year industry that employs around 190,000 people \u2013 double that, if the likes of personal trainers are included.</p> <p>The industry had enjoyed several buoyant years as no-frills chains such as PureGym and its listed rival The Gym Group gained momentum. Now expansion plans are on hold and businesses face an altered landscape.</p> <p>David Minton, director of the Leisure Database Company, a market intelligence firm, sees tough times ahead in the short term with about 300 struggling sites vulnerable to permanent closure. He predicts about one in five people will ditch memberships. \u201cAll the sites that have been losing money will not reopen so that will be the first area of shrinkage,\u201d he suggests.</p> <p>There will also be a clearout of \u201csleepers\u201d \u2013 a lucrative group who pay a membership fee for a service they never use. Around 12%, or 1.2 million, of the country\u2019s gym members fall into this group, Minton says, but their monthly payments will have been stopped by clubs during the pandemic, effectively making the decision for them.</p> <p>The other factor to consider is the \u201cJoe Wicks effect\u201d, Minton adds: \u201cHave people actually got into a habit, and will that prevent them from going back into a gym where they may not necessarily feel safe?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a801e0970c8770e6b9ae19f73ba110276cf1c37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a801e0970c8770e6b9ae19f73ba110276cf1c37/0_173_5222_3136/1000.jpg\" alt=\"a woman works out with weights on a street corner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DIY workouts are taking place anywhere and everywhere in the UK, except in the gym.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ukactive, the industry\u2019s trade body, <a href=\"https://www.ukactive.com/covid-19/\">has drawn up guidelines</a> to help gyms get back to work.

      "bodyText": "Every day during the coronavirus lockdown, the government has hammered home the need for the public to take daily exercise. The irony is that the UK\u2019s more than 7,000 gyms and leisure centres are shut, leaving the population to improvise with Joe Wicks on YouTube and cobbled-together workouts in the park. More than 10m memberships were effectively put on ice when gyms closed in March, and we now know gyms will be among the last businesses to reopen come the summer. In the meantime, the industry is designing a new fitness regime to address the health warning hanging over shared treadmills, dumbbells and exercise mats. But will Britons ever want to sweat en masse again, and with restrictions in place, do the numbers add up for gym operators any more? \u201cWe had a couple of bad days at the end of March when a lot of people started to cancel,\u201d recounts Humphrey Cobbold, chief executive of PureGym, the UK\u2019s biggest chain. \u201cWe froze our memberships instantly so nobody had a reason to cancel and when we researched why they were \u2026 nearly half were just cancelling all their direct debits saying, \u2018I don\u2019t want any money going out\u2019.\u201d At last count the UK had 7,239 gyms, with around two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf. With 10.4m memberships, it is an \u00a38bn-a-year industry that employs around 190,000 people \u2013 double that, if the likes of personal trainers are included. The industry had enjoyed several buoyant years as no-frills chains such as PureGym and its listed rival The Gym Group gained momentum. Now expansion plans are on hold and businesses face an altered landscape. David Minton, director of the Leisure Database Company, a market intelligence firm, sees tough times ahead in the short term with about 300 struggling sites vulnerable to permanent closure. He predicts about one in five people will ditch memberships. \u201cAll the sites that have been losing money will not reopen so that will be the first area of shrinkage,\u201d he suggests. There will also be a clearout of \u201csleepers\u201d \u2013 a lucrative group who pay a membership fee for a service they never use. Around 12%, or 1.2 million, of the country\u2019s gym members fall into this group, Minton says, but their monthly payments will have been stopped by clubs during the pandemic, effectively making the decision for them. The other factor to consider is the \u201cJoe Wicks effect\u201d, Minton adds: \u201cHave people actually got into a habit, and will that prevent them from going back into a gym where they may not necessarily feel safe?\u201d Ukactive, the industry\u2019s trade body, has drawn up guidelines to help gyms get back to work. The advice includes spacing exercise equipment 2 metres apart or marking every other machine as out of order. A gym\u2019s maximum capacity should be based on 3 square metres per person with the same maths applied to swimming pools. Markings could be drawn in a studio to ensure socially distanced zumba classes. But most importantly, it describes the need for a cleaning rota that would put Mrs Hinch to shame. It will not be easy. Private equity-backed PureGym is trying to figure out a viable plan for a business which has a \u00a3760m debt pile after buying European rival Fitness World this year. Its 269 gyms closed and with 1.1m UK memberships in limbo, it has zero revenue. When PureGym first reopens, Cobbold says, classes will be off the menu. \u201cI think it\u2019s true to say that studio operators who are purely about classes will struggle to break even at anything that\u2019s consistently less than 50% occupancy,\u201d he says. Huffing and puffing come with the territory in a gym. \u201cThere is inevitably an amount of sharing of equipment and people are doing exercise so they\u2019re breathing sometimes quite heavily,\u201d says Cobbold. High-use areas will be cleaned every couple of hours with PureGym\u2019s premises closing at night for deep cleans. The purchase of expensive robot cleaners that use light beams to zap surfaces is also being weighed up, he says. Gym goers will also have to become more hygiene-conscious. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get a discipline established in members,\u201d says Cobbold. \u201cYou wipe down [equipment] before, you wipe down afterwards. If they are sensible, members will want to do that.\u201d Wearing face masks is also on the cards. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got an obligation to not transmit the virus to other people, then I think that\u2019s a direction we\u2019ll probably end up going in,\u201d he adds. The financial crisis triggered by the pandemic is also testing the partnerships between local authorities and leisure operators, typically charitable trusts, who run gyms and swimming pools on their behalf. Community Leisure UK, which represents such trusts, says some are at risk of going under after falling between the cracks of the state support schemes. Huw Edwards, the chief executive of Ukactive, is concerned some contracts will end up being cancelled, which would mean leisure centre closures: \u201cThe government needs to provide ring-fenced funding to prevent communities losing their public leisure provision.\u201d For some sports, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district \u2013 the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha \u2013 had burst their banks.</p> <p>\u201cI realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,\u201d Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. \u201cI ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,\u201d she says.</p> <p>That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6cbd3263f739da27b3e06bd75f23c28b3dd5d340\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cbd3263f739da27b3e06bd75f23c28b3dd5d340/0_0_3672_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy Masika and her son\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dorothy Masika and her son cook at their makeshift home in Kilembe</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Okiror</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t sleep on the hill.

The water destroyed and swept away everything,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.\u201d</p> <p>A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. \u201cI have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,\u201d says Baluku.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don\u2019t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation.</p> <p>\u201cAll my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.\u201d</p> <p>The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital.</p> <p>The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this.

      "bodyText": "It was about 1am last Thursday when Dorothy Masika was woken by the rumble of water and boulders as they crashed down Mount Rwenzori. Then came the alarms raised by those living in the hilltop areas, those who could run, racing down to warn people along the valley and lowlands to run. A torrent of water was on its way down the mountain. Four rivers in Kasese district \u2013 the Nyamwamba, Mubuku, Nyamughasana and Lhubiriha \u2013 had burst their banks. \u201cI realised a disaster was coming. It was a matter of life and death,\u201d Masika, 34, tells the Guardian. \u201cI ran back to the house to wake up my husband and children. I knocked and alerted our neighbours. The floods and stones are coming to kill us,\u201d she says. That night heavy rains in the area of western Uganda swept away homes, schools, submerged farms, cut off bridges and left several roads inaccessible, affecting 24,760 houses and an estimated 173,000 people, according to a disaster committee interim assessment report. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t sleep on the hill. It was so cold. The children were crying. There was nothing I could do,\u201d says Masika as she lights a fire to cook at a makeshift home in Kilembe, about 10km north-west of Kasese town. \u201cWe came back in the afternoon after the water had receded and saw the great devastation of the floods. The water destroyed and swept away everything,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have been left homeless and very desperate. Where do we start from? We need urgent assistance.\u201d A few kilometres down the road of this tourist region, Philly Donald Baluku, a travel guide, said the impact was a disaster. \u201cI have been working as a tour guide on a contract basis. The tourism sector closed because of Covid-19 restrictions. The floods have rendered me homeless now,\u201d says Baluku. \u201cWhat do I do? I have nine dependents. My brother has offered us a single room to stay. But we don\u2019t have bedding and food. We are living in a very hopeless and desperate situation. \u201cAll my property, banana plantations, vanilla and crops which I was supposed to harvest in September were swept away.\u201d The floodwater destroyed the Nyamwamba hydroelectric power station, and overran the wards, mortuary and drug stores of Kilembe Mines hospital. The villages of Kyanjuki, Bulembia and Katiri are now buried under mud and huge stones that were propelled down the mountain. Homes on lower land are submerged in water. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything like this. I\u2019m seeing for the first time where everything has been run down,\u201d says Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda\u2019s National Emergency Coordination and Operations Centre, on a visit to Kasese town. \u201cThe infrastructure has been damaged.

Two-year-old Damai, a former pet, arrived at the Forest School this month, intercepted before he could be dumped by his owner \u2013 it is thought, over fears of Covid-19 transmission.</p> <p>Against such odds, some may question spending finite energy and resources on just a few individuals. But in giving them the best possible prospects for survival, Preuschoft aims to protect not just these lucky few but their habitat, and the many species that depend on it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"adfe59476090df2b3d6eb63631d15dbbe76793ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adfe59476090df2b3d6eb63631d15dbbe76793ae/0_0_2667_4000/667.jpg\" alt=\"Signe Preuschoft with Baby Gonda in the forest school.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signe Preuschoft with Baby Gonda in the forest school.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Mepham/Jejak Pulang/Four Paws</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her hope is that by using the immediate need of the orangutans in her care as leverage, she can secure long-term protection for a precious patch of rainforest for their release. They can then serve as an \u201cumbrella species\u201d, fostering the biodiversity of that ecosystem.</p> <p>She calls this strategy \u201crestorative conservation\u201d, combining animal welfare with broader conservation goals.</p> <p>\u201cI worry that I am being overambitious, but I don\u2019t know how to make it work in a less complex way,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cIf we fiddle a bit here and there, it\u2019s not going to do the job.\u201d</p> <p>Preuschoft studied psychology in her native Germany before realising that apes interested her more than humans did. She continued her studies in Utrecht and Atlanta, then from 2001 was based in Vienna, helping former lab chimps recover from trauma.</p> <p>She has lived in East Kalimantan since 2009, overseeing the orangutan rehabilitation initiatives of the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws, <a href=\"https://www.four-paws.org.uk/campaigns-topics/topics/help-for-orangutans\">which funds Jejak Pulang</a>.</p> <p>Preuschoft usually returns to Germany to visit family a few times a year, but is otherwise entirely dedicated to her orangutan \u201cchildren and grandchildren\u201d. \u201cI follow the apes,\u201d she says. Like humans, orangutans have long \u201cchildhoods\u201d, remaining reliant on their mothers \u2013 even breastfeeding \u2013 until they are seven or eight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65525327c83e245257853e77e62327b2056b6f95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65525327c83e245257853e77e62327b2056b6f95/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orangutans Eska and Cantik\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eska and Cantik in the forest school of Jejak Pulang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Signe Preuschoft/Jejak Pulang/Four Paws</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When a young ape arrives at Jejak Pulang, the circumstances of their separation, or how long they have spent in captivity, are usually unclear. Gerhana arrived at eight months, close to death from starvation, but already knowing how to drink from a bottle. Kartini, just over a year old, was completely wild, refusing to eat any food that had not been harvested from the forest. \u201cWe had to tame her in order to save her life,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cSometimes it is so absurd \u2013 you have to teach them things you hope they never have to learn.\u201d</p> <p>Under supervision in a 100-hectare (247-acre) area of government-protected forest, the orangutans are taught how to forage for food, build nests, navigate the forest canopy, and other survival skills.</p> <p>Jejak Pulang\u2019s strategy is to \u201corangutise the humans, not humanise the orangutans\u201d, which means training for the staff in tree climbing (from professional arborists), how to weave nests from twigs and knowledge of forest fruits.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes years before the caretakers accumulate the essential knowledge,\u201d says Preuschoft. This balance \u2013 the orangutans must learn from humans, but only the right lessons \u2013 can be challenging to strike.</p> <p>Kartini has recently developed an aversion to eating protein-rich larvae that suggests to Preuschoft a caretaker once betrayed their own disgust: \u201cIf your mother is phobic of spiders, you will also not like spiders.\u201d</p> <p>The four \u201cbabies\u201d have also learned to give food simply from being given it themselves, popping morsels (\u201cnormally the ones they like less\u201d, Preuschoft observes) straight into their caretakers\u2019 mouths.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The similarities that intrigue us, and intrigue the orangutans in the same way \u2013 that is the very thing that can endanger their lives</p> <footer> <cite>Signe Preuschoft</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They would never learn to do this from an ape mother, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really a friendly gesture, part of the human language that they have adopted.\u201d</p> <p>But identifying with humans over other apes could prove fatal in the wild. After Kartini was was first tamed to learn, she then had to be made wild again.</p> <p>As the babies grow, input from their caretakers is minimised to encourage their independence and their progress towards release is measured against benchmarks set by wild apes.

      "bodyText": "They were the lucky ones: Robin, Amalia, Eska; three orphaned orangutans unrelated but by circumstance, rescued from a private zoo in the East Kalimantan province of Indonesian Borneo in early 2017. A wealthy businessman had amassed an extensive collection of animals \u2013 sun bears, gibbons, reptiles, birds of prey \u2013 then run into trouble. When staff from the local orangutan rescue centre, Jejak Pulang, arrived on site, the zoo was already being dismantled, with animals boxed up for transit to uncertain fates. Four-year-old Eska \u2013 small enough to sit on someone\u2019s lap \u2013 and his fellow apes made the 50km journey to Jejak Pulang\u2019s base in Samboja village, where staff had worked into the night to finish quarantine facilities in time. Within 12 months of those first arrivals, the organisation received five more orphaned orangutans, bringing the number at its Four Paws Forest School to eight. Over the past two years, primatologist Dr Signe Preuschoft and her team have been painstakingly teaching these young apes how to survive in the rainforest ahead of their eventual return to the wild. Orangutans are classified as critically endangered, their decline driven by habitat destruction and increased conflict with humans. Conservationists put the number left in the wild on Borneo at between 70,000 and 100,000. About 350,000 hectares of primary forest continues to be lost across Indonesia every year. More recently, coronavirus has thrown up a new threat, with concerns that it might affect great apes as well as humans. Two-year-old Damai, a former pet, arrived at the Forest School this month, intercepted before he could be dumped by his owner \u2013 it is thought, over fears of Covid-19 transmission. Against such odds, some may question spending finite energy and resources on just a few individuals. But in giving them the best possible prospects for survival, Preuschoft aims to protect not just these lucky few but their habitat, and the many species that depend on it. Her hope is that by using the immediate need of the orangutans in her care as leverage, she can secure long-term protection for a precious patch of rainforest for their release. They can then serve as an \u201cumbrella species\u201d, fostering the biodiversity of that ecosystem. She calls this strategy \u201crestorative conservation\u201d, combining animal welfare with broader conservation goals. \u201cI worry that I am being overambitious, but I don\u2019t know how to make it work in a less complex way,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cIf we fiddle a bit here and there, it\u2019s not going to do the job.\u201d Preuschoft studied psychology in her native Germany before realising that apes interested her more than humans did. She continued her studies in Utrecht and Atlanta, then from 2001 was based in Vienna, helping former lab chimps recover from trauma. She has lived in East Kalimantan since 2009, overseeing the orangutan rehabilitation initiatives of the international animal welfare organisation Four Paws, which funds Jejak Pulang. Preuschoft usually returns to Germany to visit family a few times a year, but is otherwise entirely dedicated to her orangutan \u201cchildren and grandchildren\u201d. \u201cI follow the apes,\u201d she says. Like humans, orangutans have long \u201cchildhoods\u201d, remaining reliant on their mothers \u2013 even breastfeeding \u2013 until they are seven or eight. When a young ape arrives at Jejak Pulang, the circumstances of their separation, or how long they have spent in captivity, are usually unclear. Gerhana arrived at eight months, close to death from starvation, but already knowing how to drink from a bottle. Kartini, just over a year old, was completely wild, refusing to eat any food that had not been harvested from the forest. \u201cWe had to tame her in order to save her life,\u201d says Preuschoft. \u201cSometimes it is so absurd \u2013 you have to teach them things you hope they never have to learn.\u201d Under supervision in a 100-hectare (247-acre) area of government-protected forest, the orangutans are taught how to forage for food, build nests, navigate the forest canopy, and other survival skills. Jejak Pulang\u2019s strategy is to \u201corangutise the humans, not humanise the orangutans\u201d, which means training for the staff in tree climbing (from professional arborists), how to weave nests from twigs and knowledge of forest fruits. \u201cIt takes years before the caretakers accumulate the essential knowledge,\u201d says Preuschoft. This balance \u2013 the orangutans must learn from humans, but only the right lessons \u2013 can be challenging to strike. Kartini has recently developed an aversion to eating protein-rich larvae that suggests to Preuschoft a caretaker once betrayed their own disgust: \u201cIf your mother is phobic of spiders, you will also not like spiders.\u201d The four \u201cbabies\u201d have also learned to give food simply from being given it themselves, popping morsels (\u201cnormally the ones they like less\u201d, Preuschoft observes) straight into their caretakers\u2019 mouths. They would never learn to do this from an ape mother, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s really a friendly gesture, part of the human language that they have adopted.\u201d But identifying with humans over other apes could prove fatal in the wild. After Kartini was was first tamed to learn, she then had to be made wild again. As the babies grow, input from their caretakers is minimised to encourage their independence and their progress towards release is measured against benchmarks set by wild apes. Only Robin \u2013 the eldest of those founding three, who has spent most of his life in captivity \u2013 has been judged unfit for release. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t learn to be an orangutan, it means that he can never unlearn the things we call \u2018humanised\u2019,\u201d says Preuschoft. The risk is too great that he would gravitate back to civilisation. Years ago, Preuschoft was called three times to rescue an orangutan from a logging camp where he had gone to socialise with humans, be fed, and even have coffee. The third time she picked him up, he had a broken jaw. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous affinity,\u201d she says. \u201cThe similarities that intrigue us, and I\u2019m sure intrigue the orangutans in the same way \u2013 that is the very thing that can endanger their lives.\u201d The threats to their survival can seem overwhelming at times, Preuschoft admits, from the big picture of consumerism and loss of connection to nature to the more immediate dangers, like land clearing for mines and roads, plantations and poaching. More challenges keep emerging. Last year the government announced its plan to relocate Indonesia\u2019s bureaucratic centre from Jakarta to the relatively wild East Kalimantan \u2013 and with it an estimated 1.5 million civil servants. Now coronavirus has forced additional precautionary measures, such as washing the orangutans\u2019 food, stockpiling cleaning materials and splitting their caregivers into smaller groups \u2013 lest they pass the virus on to their vulnerable charges. Human contact with the orangutans in the forest school has always been strictly limited to their surrogate mothers, because of the risk of transmission between species. But \u201cthe younger ones still need loving contact, and comforting when they are scared\u201d, says Preuschoft.

Before the pandemic, Preuschoft had hoped that they would \u201cgraduate\u201d early this year to \u201cForest Academy\u201d, living with some oversight in the protected area where they will eventually be released.

      "body": "<p>For about five weeks, the mayhem of coronavirus rendered the political mayhem of the previous four years irrelevant and dated. The divisive, petty, mendacious battles that had been waged in the name of Brexit suddenly appeared for what they were all along: conflicts conjured out of thin air by newspaper editors and their friends in the Conservative party. The era of digital \u201cfake news\u201d and memes was replaced by the sobriety of daily press conferences. Ministers broke their childish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">veto of the BBC\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\">Today</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\"> programme</a>. Boris Johnson ran for cover behind civil servants and academics. All eyes turned towards the cold objectivity of statistics.</p> \n<p>We can date the opening of this window with some precision. Johnson\u2019s general election honeymoon (which included holidays to Mustique and Chevening) came to a halt when he attended his first Cobra meeting on coronavirus on 2 March. We can only imagine the shock and disappointment Johnson must have felt, as it dawned on him that his premiership would not be remembered for Brexit at all. There followed weeks of earnest policy analysis, and when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">lockdown finally arrived</a>, it was accepted as the authoritative decision of experts.</p> \n<p>We can date the closing of this window with equal precision. On 6 April it was announced that the prime minister had been taken into St Thomas\u2019s hospital with Covid-19, and the next day he was moved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/boris-johnson-moved-to-intensive-care-after-his-condition-worsens\">into intensive care</a>. By the time <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">Johnson had re-emerged</a> on 12 April with a video thanking the NHS staff who had saved his life, the mood had changed. Led by certain newspapers, the sense of measured proportionality that had governed public debate over the course of March was now lost, and an impassioned Covid nationalism was born.</p> \n<p>For the press, with whom Johnson has always been so intimate, the prime minister\u2019s illness was an opportunity to abandon the concern with aggregate mortality rates which had dominated the news for the previous month. The body of the leader now provided a symbol to focus on. \u201cMay Boris and Britain get through this battle,\u201d intoned Charles Moore sombrely in the Telegraph. \u201cYour health is the health of the nation,\u201d Allison Pearson pleaded to Johnson. Britain has now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">lost more lives to Covid-19</a> than any nation in Europe, but its hero has survived. With the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy\">arrival of a new Johnson baby</a>, followed by the 75 anniversary of VE Day, the Johnson administration spotted a path to reprieval. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb54d3cda7aa83ac545191f5b94b2aed6378654/995_907_2499_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Red Arrows over London on the 75th Anniversary of VE Day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uk Ministry of Defence/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fact that Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings are in Downing Street at all is down to their intuitive grasp of symbolism and messaging, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron\">floored their opponents in June 2016</a> and again <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/bombastic-boris-johnson-wins-huge-majority-on-promise-to-get-brexit-done\">in December 2019</a>. During the hiatus of March 2020, as the government scrambled desperately for a position on coronavirus, this skill seemed to desert them. Messages were all over the place, to the point where scientists were liberated to throw around jargon about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/the-guardian-view-on-herd-immunity-yes-it-was-part-of-the-plan\">\u201cherd immunity\u201d</a>. But when a line was found, it stuck: \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d</p> \n<p>The status of the NHS here is interesting, and not a little troubling. As soon as horror stories started to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-italy-for-weeks-before-it-was-detected\">emanate from Lombardy in February</a>, it was clear that the worst possible nightmare on Britain\u2019s horizon was of the NHS being faced with far more Covid patients than it could treat. The phrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/flatten-the-curve-why-predicting-coronavirus-infections-and-deaths-is-so-tricky\">\u201cflatten the curve\u201d</a> means specifically reducing the peak to within hospital capacity. But over time, the ambition to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d has taken on such momentum, it has come to overshadow the third part of the slogan, \u201csave lives\u201d.</p> \n<p>The video that Johnson released on exiting hospital made the extraordinary gambit of elevating the defence of the NHS above the defence of the public:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset \u2013 our National Health Service. We understood and we decided that if together we could keep our NHS safe, if we could stop our NHS from being overwhelmed, then we could not be beaten, and this country would rise together and overcome this challenge, as we have overcome so many challenges in the past.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This was an ingenious piece of political rhetoric, sidelining the methodical and morbid question of body counts, and replacing it with a national story of collective identity and sacrifice. Where a standard utilitarian logic might presuppose that health policy should be judged in terms of outcomes for human welfare, now Johnson was suggesting that human welfare was a price worth paying to preserve a cherished symbol of health policy. Such rhetorical acrobatics were all the more impressive from a man who had been at death\u2019s door only five days earlier.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The symbol of the NHS has become entangled with other national icons that hark back to the second world war</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The draping of the union jack across the NHS has produced some sickly results. The gratitude that is felt towards health and care professionals has been profoundly moving to experience and witness, and the weekly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/video/2020/may/07/doctor-calls-for-ppe-from-roof-as-uk-claps-for-carers-video\">\u201cclap for carers\u201d</a> is one of its many valuable expressions. But over the weeks, this spirit of spontaneous solidarity has thickened into something more forceful and censorious, potentially something angrier. Johnson\u2019s supporters in Westminster have turned on journalists for probing the government\u2019s performance too critically, as if any criticism was a sign of disloyalty to the national effort. Challenged in parliament by the Labour MP and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan about the shortage of available PPE, health secretary Matt Hancock suggested <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/05/matt-hancocks-career-continues-to-win-the-battle-with-his-conscience\">she change her \u201ctone\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>As the weeks have passed, the symbol of the NHS has become entangled with a host of other national British icons, many of which hark back to the second world war. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/capt-tom-moore-thanks-people-for-support-on-his-100th-birthday\">100th birthday of Captain Tom Moore</a>, who raised an astonishing \u00a330m for NHS charities by walking around his garden, was celebrated with a flyover by two fighter planes from the era, a video message from the PM and a promotion to the rank of colonel by the Queen. Moore revealed that he\u2019d received a letter of congratulations from 103-year-old Dame Vera Lynn, whose song \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d had topped the charts, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/08/we-will-meet-again-when-a-monarch-brings-comfort-with-a-song\">Queen referenced the famous wartime number</a> in her televised lockdown address to the nation.</p> \n<p>As much as the left might wish otherwise, the NHS has always been available as a potential nationalist icon. As David Edgerton details in <em>The Rise and Fall of the British Nation</em>, the invention of \u201cBritain\u201d as a post-imperial nation state, defined as a national economy with a single people, was initially a project of the Labour party more than the Conservatives. Edgerton points out that the manifesto on which Clement Atlee won the 1945 election, and that set out plans for an NHS, contained the words \u201csocialist\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d three times, but the words \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cnational\u201d nearly 50 times. Years before wartime mythology and nostalgia took off in the 1970s and 80s, it was Labour \u2013 and not the Tories \u2013 who did most to create a sense of \u201cBritain\u201d as a single imagined community.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The litany of care workers who have died could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A more extreme version of health nationalism has been bubbling away on the far right for some years. The alleged problem of \u201chealth tourism\u201d, of foreigners exploiting the generosity of the NHS, has been repeatedly referenced by Nigel Farage, and is a common trope among English nationalists such as Tommy Robinson. Governments have occasionally indulged this sentiment, with Hancock accusing Labour of giving a \u201cfree rein to health tourism\u201d during the election campaign. Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d migration policy (the cause of the agonising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">Windrush scandal</a> that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/apr/20/the-week-that-took-windrush-from-low-profile-investigation-to-national-scandal\">broke in 2018</a>) also sought to deploy the NHS as an instrument for deterring immigrants from settling in the UK. A <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\" title=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0038026120914177\">new sociological paper</a> by Des Fitzgerald, Amy Hinterberger and John Narayan examines how Vote Leave seized on the NHS as a symbol of shared British \u201cheredity\u201d, the means through which the nation reproduces itself culturally and biologically. The vision of free healthcare, for the people and by the people, is a seductive part of Britain\u2019s national mythology.</p> \n<p>As the Covid crisis has confirmed in the starkest possible terms, the everyday reality of health and care services in the UK flies in the face of this jingoism. The litany of those who have died in the course of their professional care work could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters, where expertise and basic humanity are concerned. This could, of course, be a basis on which to reset the story of \u201cBritain\u201d, in ways that take stock of its globally connected, porous nature. But at the moment, that story is losing the battle for column inches with false memories of the second world war.</p> \n<p>With the government lashing itself to the NHS, and then lashing the NHS to Dame Vera Lynn, a new facet of populism looms into view, in which critics and statisticians become tarred as useless naysayers. The possible political benefits to Johnson (who is born to this style of fact-free leadership) are obvious, but the potential consequences for policy are quite terrifying. It emerged during April that the UK\u2019s true death-toll was at least twice as high as the government was insisting, once care homes were taken into account. According to an investigation by Reuters, a decision was made in mid-March to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-britain-elderly-sp/special-report-in-shielding-its-hospitals-from-covid-19-britain-left-many-of-the-weakest-exposed-idUSKBN22H2CR\">transfer 15,000 patients out of hospitals</a>, back into the community, including many who had tested positive for Covid and would return to care homes. So desperate was the effort to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d and free up capacity, it seems that infections were being released into the care sector. Still the government\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d tally of deaths only counts those which have occurred in hospitals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80190013-6673-49ce-b5f1-7bdbd26e9fb8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gNuL1wgTVYU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson has never been as popular as he was during his hospitalisation. Like most national leaders, his approval ratings have risen as a result of this crisis, and the Conservatives have been consistently polling at around 50%. Having the worst death toll in Europe clearly counts for less in the eyes of the public than the rallying around of our resolutely <em>National</em> Health Service. The style of politics that Johnson mastered over the previous four years has returned, and it is delivering for him, just so long as the accumulation of deaths can be slotted into a narrative of sacrifice and community.</p> \n<p>But as with previous nationalisms, the communities doing the narrating are not the same as those doing the grieving. It\u2019s here that the cultural politics of Brexit potentially resurfaces. Study a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/coronavirus-uk-latest-deaths-confirmed-cases-and-which-regions-are-hardest-hit\">map of where Covid-related deaths</a> have been concentrated, and the eye is immediately drawn to major cities: London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow. A lower concentration of mortality sweeps up the middle of the country, from the south-east, through the West Midlands, up to the north-west and on towards Scotland. But the east and west of the country are far less affected. It\u2019s not a perfect fit by any means, but the map loosely resembles a more familiar one: the 2016 referendum result. The virus presents the greatest risks to those inner city urban areas, such as Hackney and Stockport, which voted remain. </p> \n<p>This overlap is scarcely surprising. The remain vote was clustered in centres of international connectivity and intense commercial activity, both rich and poor. The choice to remain was a choice very often connected to the larger international world of global capitalism, travel and urban life. It is these same things that allow a virus to spread. Conversely, the disconnection experienced by rural leave voters also reduces their risk of infection. The interests of rural, car-driving England are not necessarily those of the inner cities, though the stakes are now of course far higher than just culture. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f14ae8e3fc9c3d317a530a5750bb529effd09dd/154_308_3564_2138/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Vote Leave bus parked outside the Houses of Parliament in Westminster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The continuity between coronavirus Britain and Brexit Britain is greater than we might have imagined, and certainly greater than it appeared during those five weeks before Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 was elected to office on the back of an anti-metropolitan, anti-liberal cultural platform. Johnson\u2019s core vote is predominantly outside of those Covid danger zones of the inner cities and clusters of prosperity. Johnson, like Donald Trump, represents people who believe in the value of hard work, but don\u2019t do very much of the really unpleasant hard work themselves, either for reasons of wealth or age. They believe in \u201cunleashing\u201d the economy, less in a macroeconomic sense, and more in the sense of ditching all the red tape and political correctness that comes from government administrators and universities.</p> \n<p>This is how opposition to the European Union can shift seamlessly into opposition to the current lockdown. Some have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of rightwingers who gave not a hoot for GDP when it came to Brexit, suddenly expressing their concern for Britain\u2019s economy when it comes to coronavirus. But there is more consistency here than initially appears. Theirs is a worldview that cares little for statistical aggregates, whether that be GDP or Covid-related deaths. It pays scant attention to economists or epidemiologists, claiming to know what\u2019s in the public interest, indeed it sets little store by the very idea of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the first place.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/national-emergencies-britain-government-health-covid-19-1940s-and-50s\">When it comes to national emergencies, Britain has a tradition of cold calculation | David Edgerton</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Instead, the purpose of the economy, from this conservative perspective, is to inculcate independence, both at an individual and a national level. The national economy should be self-reliant, manufacture its own goods, and employ its own people. It\u2019s this national economy that globalisation, Brussels and lockdown all inhibit, and therefore need overturning. For the inner-city cleaner or hospitality worker, whose life would now be put at risk by a newly \u201cunleashed\u201d economy, the injunction would be to take more care, change jobs or take out life insurance. But it\u2019s not the government\u2019s problem, and it\u2019s certainly not the problem of the typical Tory donor whose investment portfolio is currently under the cosh.</p> \n<p>Johnson may not hold this worldview personally, but it is the one that propelled him to power, thanks to the victories of 2016 and 2019, masterminded by Cummings. Voices in favour of this libertarian economic nationalism have grown steadily louder since the lockdown began, and their vision of Britain is crystallising: fewer Chinese imports, fewer universities, lower immigration, more indigenous manufacturing and put the young and unemployed to work in the fields. No pain, no gain. It\u2019s not an ideology commonly held by people who work in the genuinely wealth-producing centres of British capitalism, nor by the generations who will pay the greatest financial cost for this crisis over the coming decades. And the lockdown retains remarkably widespread public support. But it is an ideology to which Johnson will keep on nodding, and which is being drip-fed to the public by rightwing newspapers, Tory backbenchers and opaquely funded thinktanks. His confusing televised statement on Sunday night, which urged people back to work without any clarity around how this should occur, was clearly crafted partly to please conservative hardliners who are appalled by the current scale of state interventions.</p> \n<p>Even with the most metropolitan and internationalist party in power, the coronavirus would force some reassertion of the nation state, as a legally binded entity with a common historical trajectory. There is no use trying to imagine Britain out of the story that we are living through. The question is whether a version of Britain can be imagined and described that avoids the worst nationalist excesses that are now stirring, as the death toll climbs, the NHS becomes a political shield and the wartime nostalgia tightens its grip.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For about five weeks, the mayhem of coronavirus rendered the political mayhem of the previous four years irrelevant and dated. The divisive, petty, mendacious battles that had been waged in the name of Brexit suddenly appeared for what they were all along: conflicts conjured out of thin air by newspaper editors and their friends in the Conservative party. The era of digital \u201cfake news\u201d and memes was replaced by the sobriety of daily press conferences. Ministers broke their childish veto of the BBC\u2019s Today programme. Boris Johnson ran for cover behind civil servants and academics. All eyes turned towards the cold objectivity of statistics. We can date the opening of this window with some precision. Johnson\u2019s general election honeymoon (which included holidays to Mustique and Chevening) came to a halt when he attended his first Cobra meeting on coronavirus on 2 March. We can only imagine the shock and disappointment Johnson must have felt, as it dawned on him that his premiership would not be remembered for Brexit at all. There followed weeks of earnest policy analysis, and when the lockdown finally arrived, it was accepted as the authoritative decision of experts. We can date the closing of this window with equal precision. On 6 April it was announced that the prime minister had been taken into St Thomas\u2019s hospital with Covid-19, and the next day he was moved into intensive care. By the time Johnson had re-emerged on 12 April with a video thanking the NHS staff who had saved his life, the mood had changed. Led by certain newspapers, the sense of measured proportionality that had governed public debate over the course of March was now lost, and an impassioned Covid nationalism was born. For the press, with whom Johnson has always been so intimate, the prime minister\u2019s illness was an opportunity to abandon the concern with aggregate mortality rates which had dominated the news for the previous month. The body of the leader now provided a symbol to focus on. \u201cMay Boris and Britain get through this battle,\u201d intoned Charles Moore sombrely in the Telegraph. \u201cYour health is the health of the nation,\u201d Allison Pearson pleaded to Johnson. Britain has now lost more lives to Covid-19 than any nation in Europe, but its hero has survived. With the arrival of a new Johnson baby, followed by the 75 anniversary of VE Day, the Johnson administration spotted a path to reprieval. The fact that Johnson and his adviser Dominic Cummings are in Downing Street at all is down to their intuitive grasp of symbolism and messaging, which floored their opponents in June 2016 and again in December 2019. During the hiatus of March 2020, as the government scrambled desperately for a position on coronavirus, this skill seemed to desert them. Messages were all over the place, to the point where scientists were liberated to throw around jargon about \u201cherd immunity\u201d. But when a line was found, it stuck: \u201cStay home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.\u201d The status of the NHS here is interesting, and not a little troubling. As soon as horror stories started to emanate from Lombardy in February, it was clear that the worst possible nightmare on Britain\u2019s horizon was of the NHS being faced with far more Covid patients than it could treat. The phrase \u201cflatten the curve\u201d means specifically reducing the peak to within hospital capacity. But over time, the ambition to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d has taken on such momentum, it has come to overshadow the third part of the slogan, \u201csave lives\u201d. The video that Johnson released on exiting hospital made the extraordinary gambit of elevating the defence of the NHS above the defence of the public: We are making progress in this national battle because the British public formed a human shield around this country\u2019s greatest national asset \u2013 our National Health Service. We understood and we decided that if together we could keep our NHS safe, if we could stop our NHS from being overwhelmed, then we could not be beaten, and this country would rise together and overcome this challenge, as we have overcome so many challenges in the past. This was an ingenious piece of political rhetoric, sidelining the methodical and morbid question of body counts, and replacing it with a national story of collective identity and sacrifice. Where a standard utilitarian logic might presuppose that health policy should be judged in terms of outcomes for human welfare, now Johnson was suggesting that human welfare was a price worth paying to preserve a cherished symbol of health policy. Such rhetorical acrobatics were all the more impressive from a man who had been at death\u2019s door only five days earlier. The draping of the union jack across the NHS has produced some sickly results. The gratitude that is felt towards health and care professionals has been profoundly moving to experience and witness, and the weekly \u201cclap for carers\u201d is one of its many valuable expressions. But over the weeks, this spirit of spontaneous solidarity has thickened into something more forceful and censorious, potentially something angrier. Johnson\u2019s supporters in Westminster have turned on journalists for probing the government\u2019s performance too critically, as if any criticism was a sign of disloyalty to the national effort. Challenged in parliament by the Labour MP and A&amp;E doctor Rosena Allin-Khan about the shortage of available PPE, health secretary Matt Hancock suggested she change her \u201ctone\u201d. As the weeks have passed, the symbol of the NHS has become entangled with a host of other national British icons, many of which hark back to the second world war. The 100th birthday of Captain Tom Moore, who raised an astonishing \u00a330m for NHS charities by walking around his garden, was celebrated with a flyover by two fighter planes from the era, a video message from the PM and a promotion to the rank of colonel by the Queen. Moore revealed that he\u2019d received a letter of congratulations from 103-year-old Dame Vera Lynn, whose song \u201cWe\u2019ll Meet Again\u201d had topped the charts, after the Queen referenced the famous wartime number in her televised lockdown address to the nation. As much as the left might wish otherwise, the NHS has always been available as a potential nationalist icon. As David Edgerton details in The Rise and Fall of the British Nation, the invention of \u201cBritain\u201d as a post-imperial nation state, defined as a national economy with a single people, was initially a project of the Labour party more than the Conservatives. Edgerton points out that the manifesto on which Clement Atlee won the 1945 election, and that set out plans for an NHS, contained the words \u201csocialist\u201d and \u201csocialism\u201d three times, but the words \u201cnation\u201d and \u201cnational\u201d nearly 50 times. Years before wartime mythology and nostalgia took off in the 1970s and 80s, it was Labour \u2013 and not the Tories \u2013 who did most to create a sense of \u201cBritain\u201d as a single imagined community. A more extreme version of health nationalism has been bubbling away on the far right for some years. The alleged problem of \u201chealth tourism\u201d, of foreigners exploiting the generosity of the NHS, has been repeatedly referenced by Nigel Farage, and is a common trope among English nationalists such as Tommy Robinson. Governments have occasionally indulged this sentiment, with Hancock accusing Labour of giving a \u201cfree rein to health tourism\u201d during the election campaign. Theresa May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d migration policy (the cause of the agonising Windrush scandal that broke in 2018) also sought to deploy the NHS as an instrument for deterring immigrants from settling in the UK. A new sociological paper by Des Fitzgerald, Amy Hinterberger and John Narayan examines how Vote Leave seized on the NHS as a symbol of shared British \u201cheredity\u201d, the means through which the nation reproduces itself culturally and biologically. The vision of free healthcare, for the people and by the people, is a seductive part of Britain\u2019s national mythology. As the Covid crisis has confirmed in the starkest possible terms, the everyday reality of health and care services in the UK flies in the face of this jingoism. The litany of those who have died in the course of their professional care work could scarcely be more ethnically and nationally diverse \u2013 a testimony to how little nation matters, where expertise and basic humanity are concerned. This could, of course, be a basis on which to reset the story of \u201cBritain\u201d, in ways that take stock of its globally connected, porous nature. But at the moment, that story is losing the battle for column inches with false memories of the second world war. With the government lashing itself to the NHS, and then lashing the NHS to Dame Vera Lynn, a new facet of populism looms into view, in which critics and statisticians become tarred as useless naysayers. The possible political benefits to Johnson (who is born to this style of fact-free leadership) are obvious, but the potential consequences for policy are quite terrifying. It emerged during April that the UK\u2019s true death-toll was at least twice as high as the government was insisting, once care homes were taken into account. According to an investigation by Reuters, a decision was made in mid-March to transfer 15,000 patients out of hospitals, back into the community, including many who had tested positive for Covid and would return to care homes. So desperate was the effort to \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d and free up capacity, it seems that infections were being released into the care sector. Still the government\u2019s \u201cofficial\u201d tally of deaths only counts those which have occurred in hospitals. Johnson has never been as popular as he was during his hospitalisation. Like most national leaders, his approval ratings have risen as a result of this crisis, and the Conservatives have been consistently polling at around 50%. Having the worst death toll in Europe clearly counts for less in the eyes of the public than the rallying around of our resolutely National Health Service. The style of politics that Johnson mastered over the previous four years has returned, and it is delivering for him, just so long as the accumulation of deaths can be slotted into a narrative of sacrifice and community. But as with previous nationalisms, the communities doing the narrating are not the same as those doing the grieving. It\u2019s here that the cultural politics of Brexit potentially resurfaces. Study a map of where Covid-related deaths have been concentrated, and the eye is immediately drawn to major cities: London, Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow. A lower concentration of mortality sweeps up the middle of the country, from the south-east, through the West Midlands, up to the north-west and on towards Scotland. But the east and west of the country are far less affected. It\u2019s not a perfect fit by any means, but the map loosely resembles a more familiar one: the 2016 referendum result. The virus presents the greatest risks to those inner city urban areas, such as Hackney and Stockport, which voted remain. This overlap is scarcely surprising. The remain vote was clustered in centres of international connectivity and intense commercial activity, both rich and poor. The choice to remain was a choice very often connected to the larger international world of global capitalism, travel and urban life. It is these same things that allow a virus to spread. Conversely, the disconnection experienced by rural leave voters also reduces their risk of infection. The interests of rural, car-driving England are not necessarily those of the inner cities, though the stakes are now of course far higher than just culture. The continuity between coronavirus Britain and Brexit Britain is greater than we might have imagined, and certainly greater than it appeared during those five weeks before Johnson\u2019s hospitalisation. It shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that Johnson \u2013 like Donald Trump \u2013 was elected to office on the back of an anti-metropolitan, anti-liberal cultural platform. Johnson\u2019s core vote is predominantly outside of those Covid danger zones of the inner cities and clusters of prosperity. Johnson, like Donald Trump, represents people who believe in the value of hard work, but don\u2019t do very much of the really unpleasant hard work themselves, either for reasons of wealth or age. They believe in \u201cunleashing\u201d the economy, less in a macroeconomic sense, and more in the sense of ditching all the red tape and political correctness that comes from government administrators and universities. This is how opposition to the European Union can shift seamlessly into opposition to the current lockdown. Some have pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of rightwingers who gave not a hoot for GDP when it came to Brexit, suddenly expressing their concern for Britain\u2019s economy when it comes to coronavirus. But there is more consistency here than initially appears. Theirs is a worldview that cares little for statistical aggregates, whether that be GDP or Covid-related deaths. It pays scant attention to economists or epidemiologists, claiming to know what\u2019s in the public interest, indeed it sets little store by the very idea of a \u201cpublic interest\u201d in the first place. Instead, the purpose of the economy, from this conservative perspective, is to inculcate independence, both at an individual and a national level. The national economy should be self-reliant, manufacture its own goods, and employ its own people. It\u2019s this national economy that globalisation, Brussels and lockdown all inhibit, and therefore need overturning. For the inner-city cleaner or hospitality worker, whose life would now be put at risk by a newly \u201cunleashed\u201d economy, the injunction would be to take more care, change jobs or take out life insurance. But it\u2019s not the government\u2019s problem, and it\u2019s certainly not the problem of the typical Tory donor whose investment portfolio is currently under the cosh. Johnson may not hold this worldview personally, but it is the one that propelled him to power, thanks to the victories of 2016 and 2019, masterminded by Cummings. Voices in favour of this libertarian economic nationalism have grown steadily louder since the lockdown began, and their vision of Britain is crystallising: fewer Chinese imports, fewer universities, lower immigration, more indigenous manufacturing and put the young and unemployed to work in the fields. No pain, no gain. It\u2019s not an ideology commonly held by people who work in the genuinely wealth-producing centres of British capitalism, nor by the generations who will pay the greatest financial cost for this crisis over the coming decades. And the lockdown retains remarkably widespread public support. But it is an ideology to which Johnson will keep on nodding, and which is being drip-fed to the public by rightwing newspapers, Tory backbenchers and opaquely funded thinktanks. His confusing televised statement on Sunday night, which urged people back to work without any clarity around how this should occur, was clearly crafted partly to please conservative hardliners who are appalled by the current scale of state interventions. Even with the most metropolitan and internationalist party in power, the coronavirus would force some reassertion of the nation state, as a legally binded entity with a common historical trajectory. There is no use trying to imagine Britain out of the story that we are living through. The question is whether a version of Britain can be imagined and described that avoids the worst nationalist excesses that are now stirring, as the death toll climbs, the NHS becomes a political shield and the wartime nostalgia tightens its grip.",

Obviously in a garden this size you can\u2019t swing a club too much, so it\u2019s about practising my short game.\u201d He is also a keen gardener and is pleased others, keen to grow their own veg, have been asking his advice. \u201cIt\u2019s important to stress the therapeutic aspect,\u201d he says. \u201cNo matter how small your garden, you can do a lot with it.\u201d * * * \u2018Harley spends a lot of time eating mud\u2019 James and Stefanie Bligh with Bennie, three, and Harley, one James and Stefanie managed to finish their garden, which Stef designed, just in time, before many shops closed. \u201cSince then the emphasis on the garden has been significant,\u201d James says. \u201cBeing stuck indoors with a three- and one-year-old \u2013 when it gets a bit stressful, the back doors fly open and out they go.\u201d James is seriously into food (he Instagrams at @saltbyjames) and has been cooking anything he can get his hands on, while the kids have been using the play area. They\u2019ve all been gardening. Well, Harley \u201cspends a lot of time eating mud and pulling flowers\u2019 heads out\u201d. Bennie loves spraying the hosepipe: \u201cWe told him the apple tree was his, and that\u2019s the only one he cares about.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve planted a whole bunch of seeds and are trying to grow vegetables. We\u2019ve been engaged in when things are growing a lot more than we usually would. The apple tree got flowers this morning and it was exciting for all of us.\u201d * * * \u2018Our sons are young enough to think this is just normal\u2019 Kat Hayes with Ben, five, and Morris, two \u201cIt was meant to be with their help,\u201d Kat says of the rainbow she was painting when the photograph was taken. Her family have done \u201cloads\u201d of rainbows, and keeping her sons occupied has been going well, though they are a bit hyper. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand. They are young enough to think this is just normal.\u201d The family lives in a flat and though their access to the garden is round a corner and down an alley, they are grateful for it. \u201cIt feels like a luxury,\u201d Kat says, conscious that some neighbours have no alternative to crowded parks. Since lockdown began, they have been growing tomatoes, chillies and sunflowers. \u201cIt really resets you to get outside when you\u2019ve been stuck indoors all day,\u201d Kat says. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for the boys to spend so much time together \u2013 Ben would normally be at school. Everything has just slowed down.\u201d * * * \u2018They\u2019re bouncing around, just trying to stay active\u2019 Sue Evans with Sam, 17, and Dan, 15 \u201cSam\u2019s just left school and is a little bit lost, and Dan is a little bit lost because he\u2019s suddenly not doing any exams,\u201d Sue says. She has been teaching online during lockdown, and has used it as an opportunity to get the garden sorted. The boys have been tidying it, and she\u2019s been weeding. \u201cI\u2019m going to try to plant some herbs. Going to the shops, they\u2019re not always easy to get hold of.\u201d The boys have been using the outdoor space every day. \u201cSam\u2019s been doing sit-ups and Dan\u2019s been bouncing around all over the place. They\u2019re just trying to stay active.\u201d Dan, who is into parkour, usually has the whole city at his disposal, to jump, climb and run on. \u201cHe trains on a Saturday, but walks to school and back most days \u2013 well, bounces. Suddenly he can\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cIt was quite a shock,\u201d Dan says. \u201cI\u2019m used to having so many different spots with different challenges and I\u2019ve gone to being very restricted. I\u2019m having to be quite resourceful.\u201d He\u2019s been using the trampoline and garden fence instead. \u201cIt\u2019s given me a good opportunity to take care of my knees and do stretches. When I go back, I won\u2019t be really stiff.\u201d * * * \u2018Friends would say I juggle because I\u2019m a bit of a clown\u2019 Kenny McIntosh \u201cFriends would say I juggle because I\u2019m a bit of a clown,\u201d Kenny says. \u201cBut colleagues say it\u2019s because of all the number juggling.\u201d Kenny is chief financial officer of an ethical energy company, People\u2019s Energy; he and his wife Galya, a translation manager he met while working in Kazakhstan, are both working from home. \u201cDuring lockdown, juggling has been a fun thing to go out and do, to move about and get some fresh air,\u201d he says. Especially as the room he works in has no windows. As for the kids, \u201cThey have been out there kicking footballs. There\u2019s a basketball net. And a trampoline. They\u2019ve been on that nonstop.\u201d * * * \u2018Praying outside under the sky is natural and preferable\u2019 Shabbir and Rohina Hussain with their daughter Fizza, brother-in-law Zia, and grandsons Ayaat, 15, and Nayil, 12 \u201cWe\u2019ve been praying in the garden when the weather is good enough, which isn\u2019t very often,\u201d says Shabbir. \u201cPraying outside under the sky is regarded as natural and preferable, but in this country people are often embarrassed to do so,\u201d he says. \u201cWe pray for the ill to be cured as routine, but now especially for Covid-19. Coronavirus is the first subject of everyone\u2019s prayers on the daily Ramadan programmes on TV and online.\u201d When the weather is poor, they have the cabana. \u201cMy children and grandchildren sometimes sit in it. Edinburgh\u2019s weather is very unpredictable. It\u2019s either too rainy or too windy. We only get a few days of summer, but we try and make the best of it.\u201d Out in the garden, they admire the cherry blossom from their three trees, and the apple blossom across the road. It\u2019s going to be a much quieter Ramadan this year. \u201cI organise a mosque. We would normally be ending the fast there after the 30 days of Ramadan. That has had to be cancelled: we can\u2019t go any more, at least not in any numbers.\u201d At some meals there would be more than 100 people, he says. Instead, the mosque has set up programmes on Facebook and Zoom so that worshippers can watch Qur\u2019anic recitations, prayers and lectures on religion. \u201cOur priests travel about a lot, for seminars and talks across Europe, and now they are locked down. They will have problems earning their living if they can\u2019t travel. They are dependent on the local community for their income.\u201d This is tricky because money isn\u2019t coming in. \u201cPeople are not attending mosques, so there won\u2019t be any collections. Everything\u2019s come to a halt. People\u2019s jobs have come to a halt. We will have to change our lives quite a bit.\u201d \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

New South Wales and Victoria have some of the highest per capita testing rates in the world.</li> \n   <li>Health authorities warned that while restrictions are starting to be eased, the pandemic is not over. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, expressed concern some people were not observing social distancing requirements while they were out.</li> \n   <li>Victoria recorded 11 new cases, two linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak and one to the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner outbreak. NSW recorded three new cases. South Australia and the ACT again recorded no new cases. Tasmania broke its seven-day run of no new cases, recording one confirmed Covid-19 infection in the past 24 hours.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow morning.

Here are the key events: Some states and territories have begun easing some restrictions, with pubs, clubs and cafes reopening to limited numbers of patrons. The number of coronavirus tests conducted in Australia passed the 1m mark on Saturday. New South Wales and Victoria have some of the highest per capita testing rates in the world. Health authorities warned that while restrictions are starting to be eased, the pandemic is not over. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, expressed concern some people were not observing social distancing requirements while they were out. Victoria recorded 11 new cases, two linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak and one to the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner outbreak. NSW recorded three new cases. South Australia and the ACT again recorded no new cases. Tasmania broke its seven-day run of no new cases, recording one confirmed Covid-19 infection in the past 24 hours. Thanks for joining us, we\u2019ll be back again tomorrow morning. In the meantime, you can keep up to date with the Guardian\u2019s global coronavirus liveblog. Take care. Sydney will host the resumption of the coronavirus-affected Supercars calendar, with racing planned to return next month. Supercars have not held a complete race meet since the season-opening Adelaide 500 in February. The Supercars website revealed Sydney Motorsport Park will be the venue of the long-awaited two-day second round on 27-28 June, albeit without fans. The full revised calendar is expected to be released later this weekend. Sydney had been scheduled to run as a night event in late August but the Covid-19 pandemic prompted a change of approach. \u201cWe\u2019ll be running at daytime only,\u201d the Supercars CEO, Scott Seamer, said. \u201cOn the basis that we are chartering the teams in and out on tight turnaround times, the night racing doesn\u2019t work and obviously they need a bit more time to complete the (permanent) light towers.\u201d But there are signs some things are returning to normal... AAP reports that police are praising NSW residents for exercising restraint in the first two days of eased restrictions for pubs, bars and clubs. Dining venues were from Friday able to take up to 10 patrons if they maintain social distancing, including alcohol table service with a meal at pubs and clubs. The NSW police assistant commissioner, Joe Cassar, told reporters on Saturday police would continue to work with venue proprietors as patrons return to their local haunts. He admitted rainy conditions in Sydney on Friday night had suppressed the number of people seeking tables, with 10-person limits and distancing requirements easier to implement. \u201cWe\u2019ve got early feedback from our police on the ground there\u2019s an acceptance conditions have been relaxed and there\u2019s been compliance with the new conditions,\u201d Cassar said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very positive situation with low numbers being recorded and just ask members of the community to continue to comply with those conditions.\u201d NSW Labor has criticised the Berejiklian government for taking too long to announce relief measures for stranded international students. On Friday, the state government announced a $20m relief package that includes funding for temporary crisis accommodation through approved student accommodation or homestay providers. It will also fund a 24-hour advice line on rental, medical, legal and mental health support issues. Labor\u2019s tertiary education spokesman, Clayton Barr, said the package failed to address serious cost of living pressures for students who have lost work and are ineligible for both jobkeeper and jobseeker. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to students who have had to walk up to 8km each way for the one meal that they have each day. They can\u2019t afford food, they can\u2019t afford transport,\u201d Barr said. \u201cThe Berejiklian government simply hasn\u2019t done enough. This package pales in comparison to the relief measures announced by Victoria, which made sure international students had money to feed themselves with.\u201d International students and other temporary visa holders locked out of federal government support are relying on food banks and restaurants giving away free meals to survive during the coronavirus pandemic. Images of long lines outside emergency relief services have emerged in the international student hubs of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as smaller cities including Darwin. AAP reports that South Australia is preparing in case there is a second coronavirus wave and expanding its paediatric emergency department capability, despite having no new or active cases. The portable ward at the Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s hospital in Adelaide will make way for nine new beds to respond to any surge in cases or other respiratory illnesses in children during the coming months. The premier, Steven Marshall, said he hoped the site does not needed to be activated. He said there were a number of places around the world that were in the same situation as SA, having no or low Covid-19 cases, only to have a spike weeks later. \u201cWe have worked so hard to get to where we are at the moment and we have to continue,\u201d Marshall said on Saturday. The extension will be connected to the hospital via an external corridor. No infections were reported in South Australia on Saturday, with only one new case confirmed over the past 24 days. The state\u2019s total remains at 439. Royal Adelaide hospital has been SA\u2019s main coronavirus facility with 18 people admitted to its intensive care unit. One person remains in hospital but is no longer infectious. It was announced on Friday that the state no longer had any active cases, but it was wrong to be considered \u201ccoronavirus-free\u201d. That\u2019s where I\u2019ll leave you for the day. I am passing over the live blog to Lisa Cox to take you through the rest of the afternoon. Take care. One of the two cases from WA is from a cruise ship. She was sick on the cruise ship six weeks ago, and tested negative when she returned to WA. The other one was a close contact of another case who also tested negative. When they both had blood tests, it showed they\u2019d had coronavirus. The Western Australian health minister, Roger Cook, says those two additional cases in WA are historical cases, so there are no new cases technically. This is why the two additions were not included in the active cases tally. Kidd says the commonwealth will be getting a report from the state and territory chief health officers next week about the use of the Covidsafe app. Back to the app, Kidd is asked whether it\u2019s unlikely many people using the app will test positive. Kidd points to 20 cases across Australia and says it\u2019s not surprising the app hasn\u2019t been used in Victoria yet, but he says it remains an important tool for contact tracers. \u201cWhat we hope is the measures we have in place in Australia will not result in a resurgence in Australia of Covid-19,\u201d Kidd says on people being complacent. He says some people do feel relaxed, but we need to remain vigilant. Kidd is asked whether the Covidsafe app is being used yet. He says the commonwealth has no view over whether the data is being used yet, by design of who can access the data \u2013 ie just the contact tracers. We are now up to 5.7m downloads for the Covidsafe app, Kidd says. Again, I repeat, downloads are not active users. Kidd says people who are over 70, immune compromised or have other health conditions should stay home. It\u2019s essential that healthy people take care of those less well and maintain social distancing, Kidd says. \u201cThis is a very tricky virus,\u201d he says. The symptoms can be mild for one person, and life-threatening for another. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Michael Kidd, says there are 20 new cases of coronavirus nationally. As of 3pm today, 1,015,652 tests for coronavirus have been conducted in Australia. In the Senate committee hearing on the Covidsafe app earlier this month, Senator Rex Patrick, a former engineer, asked a lot of pointed technical questions about the development of the contact tracing app, including asking the Digital Transformation Agency to provide the test data it had on the app working on Android and iPhone devices. They didn\u2019t provide the test data, but did reveal 179 functional tests were conducted including Bluetooth encounters between a variety of Android and iPhone devices in various states including phone locked and unlocked, app open and not open. \u201cAll tests satisfied the baseline design requirements. Performance tests were also conducted against the technical requirements,\u201d the DTA said. \u201cIn these tests, the system met and sustained the requirements and remained stable through the testing process.\u201d Those technical requirements: The app should be able to achieve targeted registration volumes of 3 million per hour and 5,000 per second, and achieve 9 million registration API requests per hour and 2,500 per second as a minimum. The app should be able to achieve encounter upload volumes of 5,700 per hour and 1.58 per second, and achieve 34,200 API requests per hour and 9.5 per second. The app should be able to achieve temporary ID both volume and API requests of 18 million per hour and 5,000 per second. The app response times should be less than 0.5 milliseconds at 95th percentile. Central Queensland Hospital and Health will move 35 of the less frail North Rockhampton Nursing Centre residents from the centre to Mater and Hillcrest hospitals in Rockhampton after a nurse tested positive to Covid-19 on Thursday night. Since then, 193 staff and residents have tested negative, including all 114 residents, but moving those residents will allow quarantining of all residents if required. It\u2019s a temporary move, the Queensland chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said. \u201cThe system has prepared for this, our staff are prepared for this and Central Queensland has planned for this,\u201d Young said. \u201cSafety of every single one of our aged care residents is our top priority.\u201d Community football can also return to training in groups of 10 on Monday week in Victoria and Tasmania. Via AAP: Clubs will ease back into modified training sessions, but are no closer to knowing when games can get under way. \u201cAFL Victoria will release its return to train protocols early next week and is endorsing a return to club sanctioned training from 25 May,\u201d AFL Victoria community football head Stephen O\u2019Donohue said. \u201cEach state government is responsible for determining what level Australian football is in their state and approving when we can transition into the next stage. \u201cWe will continue to work with the state government to ensure alignment with their advice.\u201d Ten players will be able to train together in Victoria and Tasmania, with coaches and support staff not included as part of the total. Two groups can train on a ground at the same time, but players will need to keep to their designated areas. Despite training bans being lifted, extreme doubt lingers if any senior community leagues will stage games this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Country and suburban leagues and clubs have made it clear it would be financially impossible to operate if crowds are barred. The Northern Territory will allow crowds at competitive sport from 5 June, but most states have conceded it is likely fans will be locked out of games until at least late in the year. Without gate takings, as well as revenue from food and drink sales, most clubs would run at a significant loss if games went ahead. In Western Australia, community football training will be allowed from 18 May under \u201cset conditions and protocols\u201d. South Australian clubs will be able to resume on Monday in groups of 10. Some more information on the Tasmanian case. It ends a seven-day streak for the state. The person who tested positive is a close contact of another confirmed case, and also travelled on the Ruby Princess. He was in quarantine during the infectious period. As coronavirus restrictions begin to ease, Australians have started venturing back to weekend activities such as dining out, going to the beauty salon and attending birthday parties while observing social distancing rules. According to Western Australia\u2019s handy snapshot tool, the state recorded two cases of coronavirus overnight, after not reporting any cases on Friday. The total in the state is 556 cases, with six currently active cases, and no hospitalisations. I\u2019m sure we will get an update from the state about the origins of those cases some time this afternoon. An interesting read from The Conversation on the whole \u201clet it rip\u201d versus the \u201cshut it down\u201d model we\u2019ve been living under. \u201cIn the cold calculus of cost-benefit analysis, a highly pessimistic view of the economic costs of Australia\u2019s shutdown comes to around $90 billion. It is a small price to pay compared to the statistical value of lives the shutdown should save, around A$1.1 trillion. It produces a simple message. The shutdown wins.\u201d Tasmania has reported one new case of coronavirus in the state, taking the Apple Isle\u2019s total to 226, with 18 cases active. There were 357 tests conducted in the past 24 hours in the state. More than 1,200 AFL players and officials have tested negative for Covid-19 as the game prepares for players to begin training from Monday. Via AAP: AFL chief Gillon McLachlan has been receiving a daily log of test results to ensure the league operates under a strict set of health and safety measures before games restart on 11 June. Players face daily health checks and twice-weekly Covid-19 tests, and their movement with the community outside football\u2019s bubble will be limited. \u201cOver the last two months I\u2019ve been getting updates every single day. I\u2019ve got a log of anyone who checked in with a symptom that has been tested,\u201d McLachlan told Fox Footy on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s over 1,260 tests that have been done and they\u2019re all negative. \u201cThe players have been unbelievably cooperative and demonstrated great leadership on this.\u201d McLachlan said it would be decided on a case-to-case basis what would happen if there was a positive coronavirus test in AFL ranks. \u201cBroadly, that player will be sat out, and anyone who has had close contact in the 24 or 48 hours leading up will determine anyone else who has to be stood down,\u201d he said. \u201cThen it will be a question for the doctors about the scale and the implications.\u201d Players or officials caught breaching restrictions will be charged under the AFL\u2019s new \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d rules and face stiff penalties. McLachlan said the unique nature of the 2020 season meant this year\u2019s premiership would be more than memorable. \u201cWhoever wins, they\u2019re going to have had a different set of circumstances to clearly anything they\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said. \u201c[For] whoever wins the premiership this year, it\u2019s going to be an amazing, amazing thing.\u201d None of the three new cases of coronavirus in NSW were in the Newmarch House aged care facility. In total in NSW, 101 people are being treated for coronavirus, six of those in intensive care. Three of those people are on ventilators. It is a little quieter today, as you\u2019d expect, so maybe it\u2019s time to do a bit of a rundown on where things stand with the Covidsafe app: Around 5.5 million Australians have downloaded and registered to use the app. It\u2019s important to note this does not reflect people using the app. The government has not released data on active users, just people who went through the initial stage of downloading and registering. Legislation for the app passed parliament this week, making it a crime to force people to use the app, move data from the app out of Australia, and access data from the app for any reason other than administrative or contact tracing purposes. There are concerns that Amazon, which secured the $709,000 contract to host the data, could be subject to US law and could hand over the data to US law enforcement. The government insists that\u2019s not an issue because it\u2019s against our law, but it\u2019s unclear what would happen if the two came into conflict. An update was issued last week that could appear to resolve some of the Bluetooth issues with the iPhone version of the app (meaning less need to keep it open and unlocked) but the government hasn\u2019t been too upfront about its updates so we\u2019re not entirely sure yet. That update also fixed some of the security issues that had been raised by developers. State contact tracers were supposed to be able to access the data this week, but the Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said they\u2019d not used any yet. The ACT health department says there have been no new cases of Covid-19 confirmed in the last 24 hours, meaning the total number of cases in the territory stays at 107. There were 361 test results returned in the past 24 hours. Josh Taylor back again for the next few hours. Thanks to Lisa Cox for allowing me to go have my hour\u2019s exercise outdoors on this fine Melbourne day. The NSW director of health protection, Jeremy McAnulty, is speaking. There were three new Covid-19 cases confirmed in NSW in the past 24 hours. One was a returned traveller who had been in quarantine, another was a close contact of another confirmed case. The third case is under investigation in western Sydney. Three cases is a small number, McAnulty says, but \u201cwe do know that the virus is bubbling underneath the surface, and the really important message is that people get tested if they have any symptoms at all\u201d. Hazzard is talking about the easing of restrictions in NSW. He\u2019s encouraging people to enjoy some of the new freedoms with cafes, pubs and restaurants open under strict conditions. But he is concerned some people are not adhering to social distancing when they are out. \u201cFrom what I have seen, there are a lot more people out, but there are also a lot of people who are not actually adhering to the social distancing message,\u201d Hazzard says. \u201cI know that even in my local area this morning I saw a group of bicycle riders obviously getting the Saturday morning exercise, and sitting quite close together.\u201d The main message from Hazzard: \u201cSocial distancing at all times. Basically, treat yourself and others as if they have Covid-19,\u201d he says. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, is speaking. He is reminding anyone with any symptoms at all, whether it\u2019s a cough, cold or runny nose, to get tested for Covid-19. He says in the 24 hours to 8pm Friday there were 9,892 tests but the government wants more. \u201cWe would like to see people coming forward,\u201d Hazzard says. He says there are 101 cases currently being treated by NSW Health. South Australian artists, bands and live music venues hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic will receive state government support with a $1m package. AAP reports the Music Development Office project will help musicians who write and perform original music as well as local businesses who support those artists\u2019 development, delivery or production. Grants up to $5,000 are available to artists while music businesses can apply for up to $20,000. Applications will be assessed by an industry panel and successful candidates will be announced before the end of the financial year. The innovation and skills minister, David Pisoni, said on Saturday the creative sector as a whole was important to the state\u2019s economy and social and cultural structure. It contributes about $170m and employs more than 2,300 people. \u201cWe recognise the enormous economic challenges facing the live music industry,\u201d Pisoni said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything we can to ensure our talented acts and wonderful venues get through this period and emerge stronger.\u201d I am going to hand over to my colleague Lisa Cox for the next hour or so. The Australian Medical Association president, Dr Tony Bartone, has warned people to not relax their social distancing and to keep vigilant as restrictions ease. Via AAP: \u201cIf we do the wrong things, we risk undoing all the gains that we\u2019ve made so far, Dr Bartone told the ABC on Saturday. \u201cSo, the message is, yes, appreciate all the efforts, appreciate the opportunity to release some of those measures, but let\u2019s not have a party, let\u2019s not go to town.\u201d He said people must still maintain social distance, cough etiquette, washing hands regularly and staying away from others if they are unwell. \u201cThose messages are really the backbone as we progressively lift those restrictions,\u201d he said. The ongoing tensions between Australia and China have farmers worried it might spread beyond the current disputes over beef and barley, via AAP: China is threatening to slap a large tariff on its barley imports from Australia following an anti-dumping investigation, while it has blocked beef imports from four Australian abattoirs. Such actions have come within weeks of Australia calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, sparking a furious response from China. But National Farmers\u2019 Federation president Fiona Simson is quick to point out the investigation into barley dumping has been in place for 18 months, while on beef she said it is a technicality around labelling, something that has been an issue in the past. \u201cIt is sometimes tricky to work through some of the differences and makes it harder when we can\u2019t just jump on a plane and talk to people face-to-face,\u201d she told the ABC on Saturday. Even so, \u201cfarmers are worried\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a big market, not just for beef and barley, but for a number of other commodities as well,\u201d she said. Commodities like wool, cotton and seafood depend on the Chinese market. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s concerning if these sorts of shockwaves and threats do actually start to come,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so we need to make sure that the government is continuing to invest, continuing to talk, continuing to work through these difficulties.\u201d Prime minister Scott Morrison says the push for an independent inquiry into the Covid-19 crisis is \u201ccompletely unremarkable\u201d and Australia will stand its ground. But China\u2019s foreign minister Wang Yi has lashed out at foreign politicians for politicising the epidemic. On the Rockhampton nurse, the state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says the nurse had been sick for some time before getting tested, and it\u2019s vital people get tested as soon as they start showing any symptoms. Young says there are 2,000 contact tracers in the state, which should help trace outbreaks going forward. \u201cThe other thing that everyone can do to help us in terms of contact tracing is to download the Covidsafe app. That will help us. It\u2019s an additional tool. It\u2019s not instead of what we\u2019ve been doing, it will just give us more information. Because as we know, people will start going about their normal lives, which is what we all want.\u201d Queensland health minister Steven Miles is holding a press conference, and has confirmed one new case of coronavirus overnight. The state is testing over 3,000 people per day, and the new cases tend to be largely people who have returned from overseas, he says. \u201cThat gives us great confidence going into today, the next round - that step one of easing of restrictions, more substantial easing of restrictions.\u201d On the case of the nurse from the North Rockhampton reported yesterday, 42 contacts including 39 staff and three members of the community have been identified: 193 people have been tested, including 114 residents, and all tests have come back negative. An interesting profile on CMO Brendan Murphy in the Herald Sun today, revealing, among other things, his new-found celebrity status. \u201cIt\u2019s quite disconcerting,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cPeople are almost invariably nice and positive, but it is an unusual phenomenon for someone like me to be recognised in public.\u201d Sutton: \u201cI would encourage everyone to download the [Covidsafe] app.\u201d He says it will be easier to identify people like, say, in a queue who you won\u2019t know. He says it\u2019s less important to have the app in a school setting because contact tracing in a school setting would test those close contacts in classrooms, so it\u2019s easier to identify than in the broader population. Mikakos says it is \u201cinevitable\u201d there will be have more coronavirus outbreaks. The risk is there. She says while people can go do more things now, they should consider whether they should go do those things. Sutton says it only takes one case in a setting where transmission can occur. Testing is key, he says, and outbreaks need to be cracked down on as soon as they\u2019re identified. Sutton reveals that Victoria has not had any confirmed cases of coronavirus where the person with coronavirus was using the Covidsafe app, so contacts could be traced via the app. It\u2019s only this week that state health officials have been able to access the data, and I am guessing it will be a while before we get a case where the data could be used because of our low infection rate currently, and because there\u2019s only 5.5m people with the app. Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton says if a clean has been done of the McDonald\u2019s to the satisfaction of the local council, then it is OK to open, and evidence suggests there is minimal risk of coronavirus being transferred via food. Mikakos confirms 10 cases of coronavirus now confirmed at the McDonald\u2019s in Fawkner. All the close contacts have been contacted and are isolating, and 101 employees at the store have now been tested There\u2019s one case of an employee at a Cragieburn McDonald\u2019s with coronavirus, but Mikakos said the employee is a relative of someone who works at the Fawkner McDonald\u2019s. The Craigieburn McDonald\u2019s staff are isolating, but the restaurant may open with staff from another McDonald\u2019s. There\u2019s also a salmonella outbreak at the Lincoln Bakery Cafe in Carlton in Victoria, with 36 people diagnosed. The shop has been closed since 8 May, pending further investigation with the Victorian health department and City of Melbourne. Mikakos said there was hope that by the end of June, elective surgeries in Victoria could be back to 75% of the normal load, and by the end of July, back to normal. Surgeries would be back up to 50% by the end of this month, but it would take some time to get surgeries and lists ready, and to make sure there was enough PPE, she said. Mikakos said teachers in Victoria could now get tested for coronvirus ahead of school going back, regardless of whether they had symptoms or not. So far 1,200 teachers have been tested, but Mikakos said she couldn\u2019t say what the results of those tests were at this stage. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, is holding a press conference. She says there are 11 new cases of coronavirus in the state, bringing the total confirmed to 1,554 in the state. Two of those are linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, and another four previously reported cases have now been linked to that outbreak, bringing the total at that cluster to 98, including 64 staff and 34 close contacts. There are 110 active cases, and 158 cases as a result of community transmission, up by four from yesterday. Mikakos says Victoria has now conducted 324,000 tests, and this week since Monday the state has conducted more than 56,000 tests, putting Victoria at the highest testing rate per capita in the country at 4,887 per 100,000. Queensland can have up to 10 people dine-in in restaurants and cafes, now, and AAP has the latest on what the experience has been like for restaurants and cafes opening today\u201d Coffee Club in the leafy inner-city Brisbane suburb of Ascot was among the many cafes that opened their doors to customers early on Saturday. \u201cIt is great to see some familiar faces returning,\u201d manager Kaili Yang told AAP. Regular Peter Lepper joked it had been a long 10 weeks being locked out of his favourite cafe as he tucked into bacon and eggs. \u201cIt will be nice to begin returning to our normal routines,\u201d he said referring to the lifting of some social distancing restrictions that were imposed to control the spread of the virus. A maximum of 10 people can now also attend a wedding, while up to 20 people are permitted at indoor funerals, and 30 at those held outside. Road trips are also back on the agenda from Saturday with residents allowed to travel up to 150km from home, increasing to 500km for those in the outback. However, 115 residents and 180 workers at an aged care facility in central Queensland are being tested for Covid-19 following the diagnosis of a nurse. Chief health officer Jeannette Young said it was \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d the woman went to work at the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre while she was unwell. \u201cWe\u2019re clarifying what exactly happened there,\u201d she said on Friday. Health minister Steven Miles said the last active case of coronavirus in Rockhampton was believed to have been resolved on 1 May. \u201cThis just serves to underline that even after cities have long periods of time without active cases, things can turn very, very quickly,\u201d he said on Friday. Meanwhile in the Netherlands: Single men and women are being advised to organise a seksbuddy (sex buddy) after criticism of rules dictating that home visitors maintain a 1.5-metre distance from their hosts during the coronavirus lockdown. The Australian Banking Association has revealed today that one in 14 mortgages have had payments deferred, adding up to $153.5bn. That\u2019s 429,000 mortgages in total. The ABA said banks have hired 1500 new staff during the coronavirus pandemic, and have redeployed 2200 staff to call centres and other frontline areas to meet the surge in demand for support. Employment minister Michaelia Cash is excited. AFL players are returning to training on Monday, and the AFL Players\u2019 Association doesn\u2019t want people to be trying to catch AFL players out in breaching restrictions, stating it would amount to a witch hunt. They\u2019ll be tested for coronavirus twice a week, and then once a week once the season recommences. Those found to breach the rules will face stiff penalties. AFL Players\u2019 Association chief Paul Marsh told AAP he hoped the players were not being set up to fail. \u201cPlayers won\u2019t set out to breach the restrictions here - they\u2019ll attack this trying to do the right thing,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cI just hope we don\u2019t have a witch-hunt trying to find players who may get things slightly wrong throughout this journey. \u201cHopefully we won\u2019t have players who get anything wrong, but they\u2019re human beings.\u201d The exact details of restrictions on players are still being negotiated between the AFL and AFLPA, but will be finalised in the coming days. West Coast, Fremantle, Adelaide and Port Adelaide players face even tighter restrictions as they restart the season in Gold Coast quarantine hubs. A bit more on what it\u2019s been like for NSW residents having restrictions eased, via AAP: Bartenders have relished the \u201cphenomenal\u201d feeling of pouring a beer into a glass pint and diners have embraced a glimmer of normality as NSW restaurants and bars reopened after an easing of Covid-19 restrictions. The state\u2019s restaurants, cafes, pubs and clubs are now able to have up to 10 patrons if they maintain social distancing after the NSW government wound back several restrictions from Friday. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned Covid-19 case numbers will inevitably rise as rules are eased, but punters on Friday night seemed comfortable returning to their favourite bars and eateries. In Sydney\u2019s inner west, Shannah Baichoo was among the first to return to popular Summer Hill bar The Rio, resuming what was once a regular Friday night ritual with her husband. \u201cIt\u2019s like a signifier of life becoming normal again. It feels amazing,\u201d Baichoo told AAP. Nearby, Lisa Polsek said visiting the bar offered a bit of normality but \u201cbaby steps\u201d were important. \u201cThe worst thing would be is if we all have to go back again,\u201d she said. For The Rio\u2019s operational manager Fabrizio Culici, pouring his first beer into a glass pint felt \u201cphenomenal\u201d after weeks of take-aways and deliveries. \u201cThe sense of relief is just fantastic,\u201d Culici said. \u201cWe just hope ... that this is certainly not going to be a short-lived thing and we go back to deliveries, because it\u2019s going to be very hard to survive if that happens.\u201d A couple of doors down at The Temperance Society, co-owner Alex Fensham shared similar concerns about having to wind back again. He welcomed having people back at the bar but said they were \u201cpretty nervous\u201d about opening trade for just 10. \u201cIt took an enormous shift and it actually cost us a lot of money to shift at short notice from being a bar to a take-away,\u201d Fensham told AAP. \u201cWe\u2019re all feeling pretty happy to have people in here now, but whether it actually works out financially, I don\u2019t know yet. It\u2019s worth a shot.\u201d Under eased restrictions, outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people are now permitted and up to five people, including children, can visit another NSW household. Religious gatherings and places of worship can welcome up to 10 people, and 10 guests are also allowed at weddings, 20 at indoor funerals and 30 at outdoor funerals from Friday. Outdoor equipment including gyms and playgrounds can now be used with caution, with people encouraged to wipe down the equipment, while outdoor pools are open with restrictions. Another instance of supermarket violence, via AAP: A man has allegedly beaten a woman over the head with a bottle after she asked him to physically distance in a southwest Sydney supermarket queue. The pair were standing in line for the supermarket checkout in Miller on Friday morning. The 59-year-old woman said the man stood closely behind her and she asked him to step back. He later allegedly approached her from behind and hit her over the head with a bottle, which did not break, and fled the store. The woman was treated by paramedics and taken to Liverpool hospital as a precaution. The man was not located by police. Speaking of medical transfers, we learned the other day that Australia had made an agreement with Nauru to allow its citizens to travel to Australia for medical treatment, despite the international travel ban. I asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade about whether this meant Nauruans travelling to Australia would be held in detention similar to the asylum seekers coming from Nauru. The department indicated that the travel and accommodation was organised by Nauru, not the Australian government \u2013 so in short, no. Nauruan citizens, like other foreign nationals in the region, can access urgent or critical medical treatment in Australia (including medical evacuations) on a case-by-case basis, with the agreement of relevant commonwealth and state and territory agencies. In the context of Covid-19 travel restrictions, Australia has advised Nauru that existing arrangements would continue to be honoured. This will be done in strict accordance with medical and quarantine protocols to ensure the health and safety of Nauruans and Australians. Two more refugee activists were fined $1,334 each for protests at Kangaroo Point in Brisbane yesterday. They\u2019re protesting against the 120 asylum seekers being held in the hotel there. They were transferred to Australia for medical treatment and have not returned, or been allowed to leave the hotel. The protesters are planning to return at 4.30pm this afternoon. Good morning and welcome to the coronavirus live blog for Saturday 16 May. I\u2019m Josh Taylor and I\u2019ll be taking you through the morning. Here\u2019s some of the global news on coronavirus as we head into Saturday: China has now gone a whole month without any new coronavirus deaths announced Germany has gone into a recession after reporting two consecutive quarters of economic contraction Germany is also easing rules for travellers from the EU and the UK, and Italy will allow free travel within its country from 3 June. You can follow our global live blog here. Locally, in Queensland, restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs have been allowed to open with 10 sit-down customers. Pubs have also reopened in the NT. ACT and NSW are also easing restrictions, and Victoria is having its first weekend of being able to have up to five visitors at a person\u2019s home. It\u2019s still a while before we are expecting Victoria to ease restrictions on restaurants and cafes in line with other states.",

Restrictions ease across the country States and territories are beginning to ease some of the restrictions brought in as part of the successful bid to flatten the curve of the coronavirus spread. Pubs, clubs and cafes were allowed to reopen in Queensland, and pubs reopened in the Northern Territory, while cafes and restaurants opened up in New South Wales. Victoria still has no plans to follow the other states until at least the end of the month. Victoria records 11 new cases Victoria recorded 11 new cases of coronavirus overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 1,554. Two of the cases were linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak, while one was linked to the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner outbreak. A staff member who tested positive at the Craigieburn McDonald\u2019s has a family connection to a staff member at the Fawkner McDonald\u2019s, and staff at the Craigieburn outlet are self-isolating while awaiting test results. Victoria has the highest per capita testing rate in the country, and one of the highest in the world. Tasmania records one new case Tasmania broke its seven-day streak of no new cases, with one new case reported.

      "bodyText": "The Peak District national park has urged the public not to visit as its car parks began to fill up on the first weekend since coronavirus lockdown measures were partially eased in England. The park authority said the Langsett area at its north-eastern edge was \u201cextremely busy\u201d on Saturday morning, making physical distancing difficult. Visitors flocked to the area despite people being asked to \u201cthink carefully\u201d before visiting national parks and beaches. Peak District park bosses tweeted on Saturday morning: Elsewhere in England, tourism chiefs cautiously opened their doors to visitors at some other national parks and beaches, but warned that people may be turned away if hotspots become too busy. Good weather is expected to draw many people to their favourite beauty spots over the weekend after the UK government allowed unlimited travel for outdoor exercise or sunbathing. While some parks, including the Lake District, have repeatedly urged visitors to stay away, others were warily welcoming them back. The South Downs national park, on the south coast of England, said people could enjoy its rolling hills and chalk cliffs but that they must \u201cobserve the three Rs by exercising restraint, responsibility and respect\u201d. It urged people to avoid the popular hotspots and to stay 2 metres away from anyone not in the same household. The National Trust, which oversees 500 historic houses, castles, parks and gardens in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and nearly 800 miles of coastline, was preparing to reopen its larger car parks in England next week after opening more than 250 smaller ones since Wednesday. Hilary McGrady, its director general, said it was taking \u201cbaby steps\u201d to reopen its properties, but urged people to enjoy local attractions instead of travelling long distances this weekend. \u201cThere are lots of beautiful green spaces close to people, within a half-hour drive time, but this is about respect and people taking care of themselves and care of each other,\u201d she said. In Devon, a number of council-run car parks were set to reopen to allow people to enjoy beaches in the South Hams. However, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said there would be no lifeguards at any of the 240 beaches it normally patrols this weekend, and called for people to think carefully before going near or into the water. In Yorkshire, tourism bosses were expecting an increase in visitors to its most popular countryside walks in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors, where car parks and some public toilets were reopening this weekend. James Mason, the chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire, said it would be \u201cfoolish\u201d not to anticipate a rise in visitors but added that it was \u201cnot yet safe\u201d or advisable for people to flock en masse to their favourite spots. He said: \u201cOur advice would be clear: think twice about why you\u2019re going [and] think twice about the experience that you\u2019re going to have. It won\u2019t be the same experience that you would have had in the past. \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to just maybe modify their thinking and find natural beauty on your doorstep, and wait until we\u2019re encouraging you back in the next few months.\u201d In the seaside towns of Whitby, Scarborough and Filey, which have attracted day-trippers for more than a century, local leaders urged people to stay away on Friday, warning that roads would be closed if they became too busy. Richard Leafe, the chief executive of the Lake District national park, said on Friday its message was: \u201cDon\u2019t rush back to the Lake District.\u201d He added: \u201cNormally at this time of year we could expect around 2 million people coming to the national park. If people come in those numbers, that\u2019s going to cause real concern in the communities that live and work in Cumbria about an increase in transmission of the disease.\u201d The tourism service Visit Weston-super-Mare has changed its promotional slogan to \u201cdon\u2019t visit Weston-super-Mare\u201d on social media and urged people not to visit the seaside town in Somerset. In a video posted on Twitter on Wednesday, it told people: \u201cJust because you can, doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d In Brighton, the local council is asking people to stay away from its seafront. Carmen Appich, the chairwoman of Brighton and Hove city council\u2019s tourism, equalities, communities and culture committee, said: \u201cIf thousands of people travel to our city on a sunny day and don\u2019t or are unable to maintain safe physical distancing because of overcrowding, this increases the risk of a Covid outbreak and puts everyone at risk.\u201d Meanwhile, authorities in Wales have been reminding the public that lockdown measures are different there and people should avoid all non-essential travel.",

      "bodyText": "The last time V\u00edctor Calder\u00f3n saw his son, Miguel, alive was on the eve of Venezuela\u2019s coronavirus shutdown in mid-March. Seven weeks later he saw a photograph of Miguel\u2019s bullet-riddled body displayed on a police computer alongside dozens of fellow prisoners at Los Llanos prison in the western state of Portuguesa. Two days later, Calder\u00f3n was handed back his child\u2019s remains \u2013 one of at least 47 inmates killed during one of the worst prison massacres in recent Venezuelan history. \u201cI want to speak out so the world knows about this injustice,\u201d the 49-year-old electrician said. \u201cThey slaughtered our children.\u201d Confusion still surrounds what exactly happened at Los Llanos prison on 1 May, and why. There is even doubt over the true number of deaths: Calder\u00f3n said his son\u2019s body had been returned marked with the number 128 \u2013 making him suspect the death toll was higher than officially announced. But the episode is one of a spate of disturbances in Latin America\u2019s overcrowded and underfunded prisons where the coronavirus pandemic appears to have played at least some role. In late April nine people were killed and dozens injured during a prison riot in Peru\u2019s capital, Lima, sparked by the death of two prisoners from Covid-19 \u2013 and fears the disease would spread. Days later prisoners rebelled in the Brazilian city of Manaus \u2013 where mass graves have been dug for Covid victims \u2013 reportedly because of fears wardens might bring the coronavirus into the jail. In Mexico \u2013 where a jailed senior leader of the Zetas cartel died of Covid-19 last week \u2013 prisons have also suffered a wave of pandemic-related unrest, with inmates reportedly rebelling against Covid restrictions, including the banning of family visits. Colombian authorities have quashed two attempted jailbreaks linked to the coronavirus, including one that left 23 prisoners dead, while Argentina has also seen uprisings including one in which inmates hoisted a banner reading \u201cWe refuse to die in prison\u201d. The conditions in Los Llanos, like in many gang-controlled Latin American prisons, were dire well before the pandemic. A Reuters report on the massacre claimed some inmates had been so desperate they had eaten a cat. \u201cWe live among the shit and the trash,\u201d Miguel Calder\u00f3n, 27, told his father in a voice message from inside the prison. With authorities unable to feed them, the prisons estimated 4,000 inmates relied on food brought in by relatives. \u201cIn prisons, like everywhere in Venezuela, there is hunger,\u201d said Tamara Taraciuk, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy director in the Americas. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t provide adequate food \u2013 it\u2019s that they don\u2019t provide food.\u201d But visits were outlawed in March because of the quarantine ordered by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \u2013 and the situation appears to have come to a head on 1 May when troops opened fire on demonstrating prisoners.

It\u2019s not good. Now I realise that whenever I want to cry, I cry. There\u2019s no shame. And if you want to laugh, you laugh. I try not to cry in front of people that might get very emotional.

He nods in acknowledgement when I ask if his past as a footballer prevented him from expressing his emotions before cancer turned his life inside out. \u201cYes. We portrayed ourselves as tough guys that could deal with anything without showing any weakness.

Vialli\u2019s outlook on life has clearly changed over the past three years \u2013 while he has endured two separate nine-month spells of chemotherapy, which eventually led to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/13/former-chelsea-player-gianluca-vialli-given-pancreatic-cancer-all-clear\">being declared cancer-free last December</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is my personal view,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cBut my friends, people who eventually knew about my condition, said: \u2018Come on, you\u2019re going to win this fight.

I felt this is a journey. It\u2019s about the right therapies and the right doctors. It\u2019s about travelling with an unwanted travel companion until hopefully it gets bored and dies before me.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/11/richie-sadlier-i-thought-id-better-find-out-where-my-abuser-was-millwall-ireland\">Richie Sadlier: 'I thought I'd better find out where my abuser was'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Vialli is in a philosophical mood as we discuss <a href=\"https://www.headline.co.uk/titles/gianluca-vialli/goals/9781472274885/\">his new book, Goals</a>, which features 90 stories about inspirational sportsmen and women who overcame adversity. They range from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/15/42-jackie-robinson-brooklyn-dodgers-mlb\">Jackie Robinson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.donaldmcrae.com/book-in-black-white-about.php\">Jesse Owens</a> to Billie Jean King and <a href=\"https://howtheyplay.com/individual-sports/Natalie-du-Toit-First-Disabled-Athlete-who-Qualified-To-Compete-Against-Able-bodied-Athletes\">Natalie du Toit</a>, Alex Zanardi and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2016/apr/27/today-we-die-a-little-writing-the-story-of-emil-zatopek\">Emil Zatopek</a> to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope.</p> \n<p>Before we read about Zanardi, the Italian motor racing driver <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/18/motorracing\">who lost both his legs after a terrible crash</a> in 2001, the quote attached to his story reads: \u201cLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react it.\u201d Once he had got used to his prosthetic legs Zanardi returned to Formula One as a test driver and won races in the European Touring Car series. As a Paralympic hand cyclist, Zanardi then won two gold medals at London 2012 before matching the feat four years later in Rio.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s the key mantra,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could\u2019ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don\u2019t always see it that way, but that\u2019s my aim.\u201d</p> \n<p>The book ends with the most compelling story \u2013 as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. \u201cI found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I\u2019d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: \u2018Operation? When? You\u2019re discharging me? When? Then I\u2019m starting chemo? For how long?\u2019 For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. \u201cWe thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s nothing sinister.\u2019 I found out then. It was back.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9f5ca66ab413b5339bf5ce21884b839e137f0d5e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f5ca66ab413b5339bf5ce21884b839e137f0d5e/0_0_3543_2045/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sampdoria fans with a banner in tribute to Vialli at their game against Bologna in December 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sampdoria fans with a banner in tribute to Vialli at their game against Bologna in December 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paolo Rattini/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Vialli leans closer to the screen. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?\u2019 The second time was definitely tougher because it\u2019s the cumulative effect. I wasn\u2019t so strong and there was some despair. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, this guy is back.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Another nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. \u201cThey call it NED,\u201d he explains. \u201cNo evidence of disease. I\u2019m perfectly aware it will take a while before I\u2019m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place. I hope to stay in a good place until I die of old age.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3c387973-310d-4b96-876e-3b883c4ed1d1\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Vialli has anxious days when he worries if the cancer will return. But he spends more time talking about gratitude. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I\u2019m very grateful to many wonderful people \u2013 my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They\u2019re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you\u2019re going through and there\u2019s a great deal of empathy. I\u2019m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It\u2019s an amazing hospital.\u201d</p> \n<p>Has it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? \u201cFor me it has been hard because I come <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/travel/italy-cremona-violin.html\">from Cremona</a>. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It\u2019s a tragedy.</p> \n<p>\u201cStaying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it\u2019s great to be with them 24/7. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it\u2019s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.\u201d</p> \n<p>What does Vialli think of the Premier League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/single-failed-covid-19-test-spells-quarantine-for-premier-league-squads\">trying to resume next month</a>? \u201cIn times of grief, and when you\u2019re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it. So if football could be a tool to give people some relief then I look forward to its return.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThat said, I can only imagine what the players are feeling. I could advise them about injury or when they fall out with the manager. I can share my experiences with them. But in this situation I wouldn\u2019t know what to tell them. This is unprecedented. If I was still a player, I would probably find it difficult to focus on football because people are still dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>Since last October he has <a href=\"https://www.football-italia.net/146336/vialli-honoured-help-mancini\">worked alongside Roberto Mancini</a>, his former Sampdoria teammate, who now manages Italy. \u201cI have started this new chapter as the head of the Italian national team football delegation. I am so happy I\u2019ve ended up working with my best friend. It feels great to be able to help Roberto and I love trying to inspire the players. My contract runs to the end of the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. We are carrying on and trying to do as much as possible.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0861bd01ecf93d4cc1d3c00eb04eb8b214d68f42\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0861bd01ecf93d4cc1d3c00eb04eb8b214d68f42/0_258_1748_2435/718.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of Goals, Gianluca Vialli's new book\" width=\"718\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goals, Gianluca Vialli\u2019s new book.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Gianluca Vialli</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It seems fitting that Vialli should express his optimism before we say goodbye. \u201cI must think positively,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also got to acknowledge when I have some negative thoughts. Acknowledge, separate and challenge them. Yes, I am positive personally. I am also positive about the world. The crisis will pass. What I\u2019d like to see next is that we do not forget these lessons.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you look at climate change we have a chance to do something about it. We are now saying health is the most important thing. Great. Why, once the virus is gone, would we go back to living in a place where the air is so polluted? Why don\u2019t we prevent people getting sick and dying from pollution? Surely we should be prepared to give up a little bit of our wealth, our so-called quality of life, for a safer and healthier planet? I feel very strongly about this kind of future.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Goals: Inspirational Stories to Help Tackle Life\u2019s Challenges by Gianluca Vialli is published by Headline</em></p>",

It\u2019s about travelling with an unwanted travel companion until hopefully it gets bored and dies before me.\u201d Vialli is in a philosophical mood as we discuss his new book, Goals, which features 90 stories about inspirational sportsmen and women who overcame adversity. They range from Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens to Billie Jean King and Natalie du Toit, Alex Zanardi and Emil Zatopek to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope. Before we read about Zanardi, the Italian motor racing driver who lost both his legs after a terrible crash in 2001, the quote attached to his story reads: \u201cLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react it.\u201d Once he had got used to his prosthetic legs Zanardi returned to Formula One as a test driver and won races in the European Touring Car series. As a Paralympic hand cyclist, Zanardi then won two gold medals at London 2012 before matching the feat four years later in Rio. \u201cThat\u2019s the key mantra,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could\u2019ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don\u2019t always see it that way, but that\u2019s my aim.\u201d The book ends with the most compelling story \u2013 as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. \u201cI found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I\u2019d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: \u2018Operation? When? You\u2019re discharging me? When? Then I\u2019m starting chemo? For how long?\u2019 For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.\u201d Vialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. \u201cWe thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s nothing sinister.\u2019 I found out then. It was back.\u201d Vialli leans closer to the screen. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?\u2019 The second time was definitely tougher because it\u2019s the cumulative effect. I wasn\u2019t so strong and there was some despair. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, this guy is back.\u2019\u201d Another nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. \u201cThey call it NED,\u201d he explains. \u201cNo evidence of disease. I\u2019m perfectly aware it will take a while before I\u2019m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place. I hope to stay in a good place until I die of old age.\u201d Vialli has anxious days when he worries if the cancer will return. But he spends more time talking about gratitude. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I\u2019m very grateful to many wonderful people \u2013 my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They\u2019re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you\u2019re going through and there\u2019s a great deal of empathy. I\u2019m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It\u2019s an amazing hospital.\u201d Has it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? \u201cFor me it has been hard because I come from Cremona. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It\u2019s a tragedy. \u201cStaying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it\u2019s great to be with them 24/7. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it\u2019s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.\u201d What does Vialli think of the Premier League trying to resume next month? \u201cIn times of grief, and when you\u2019re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it. So if football could be a tool to give people some relief then I look forward to its return. \u201cThat said, I can only imagine what the players are feeling. I could advise them about injury or when they fall out with the manager. I can share my experiences with them. But in this situation I wouldn\u2019t know what to tell them. This is unprecedented. If I was still a player, I would probably find it difficult to focus on football because people are still dying.\u201d Since last October he has worked alongside Roberto Mancini, his former Sampdoria teammate, who now manages Italy. \u201cI have started this new chapter as the head of the Italian national team football delegation. I am so happy I\u2019ve ended up working with my best friend. It feels great to be able to help Roberto and I love trying to inspire the players. My contract runs to the end of the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. We are carrying on and trying to do as much as possible.\u201d It seems fitting that Vialli should express his optimism before we say goodbye. \u201cI must think positively,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also got to acknowledge when I have some negative thoughts. Acknowledge, separate and challenge them. Yes, I am positive personally. I am also positive about the world. The crisis will pass. What I\u2019d like to see next is that we do not forget these lessons. \u201cIf you look at climate change we have a chance to do something about it. We are now saying health is the most important thing. Great. Why, once the virus is gone, would we go back to living in a place where the air is so polluted? Why don\u2019t we prevent people getting sick and dying from pollution? Surely we should be prepared to give up a little bit of our wealth, our so-called quality of life, for a safer and healthier planet? I feel very strongly about this kind of future.\u201d Goals: Inspirational Stories to Help Tackle Life\u2019s Challenges by Gianluca Vialli is published by Headline",

Our web browsing and search histories contain the most intimate personal information.

A second privacy-focused amendment to the Patriot Act \u2013 one that garnered far less coverage but is potentially even more substantive \u2013 did pass overwhelmingly on Wednesday night. Because <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/senate-browsing-histories-fisa-254970\">the substance of the amendment was much harder to fit into a headline</a>, it received a fraction of the attention. But it may be because the vote on web browsing histories sparked immediate outrage on Twitter, politicians from both parties felt the need to accept it.</p> <p>The amendment, known as the Leahy-Lee amendment \u2013 named after its bipartisan co-sponsors Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee \u2013 reforms the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court in a significant way. The Fisa court, which authorizes national security and foreign intelligence surveillance on US soil, first came to the general public\u2019s attention <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/09/snowden-fisc/\">during the Snowden disclosures</a>.</p> <p>The court, for decades, would listen to the government\u2019s side of an argument for new surveillance powers in complete secrecy, and almost never heard from the civil liberties perspective. The court was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests\">known to rubber-stamp virtually anything the FBI or NSA asked for</a>. This one-sided system, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html\">the New York Times reported at the time</a>, carved out classified exceptions to the fourth amendment and \u201ccreated a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans\u201d without the public knowing about it.</p> <p>After the Snowden disclosures, Congress was forced to create an amicus curiae \u2013 or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d \u2013 position, which at very limited times and at the court\u2019s discretion, would be allowed to resist the government\u2019s arguments. Even though the position was extremely restricted, over the past several years,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/fbi-fisa-court.html\"> it has been shown to work</a> on the few occasions it\u2019s been used.</p> <p>The Leahy-Lee amendment significantly strengthens the amicus position, giving the court\u2019s civil liberties representative much more latitude to access classified information and broadens their ability to weigh in on virtually all cases that may infringe upon the civil liberties of Americans.</p> <p>And here\u2019s where it gets interesting.

      "bodyText": "In a shameful vote this week as part of an extension of the dreaded and controversial Patriot Act, the Senate handed William Barr and the Trump administration the ability to spy on Americans\u2019 web browsing and internet search histories without a warrant. The vote on a bipartisan amendment to protect this information from government surveillance sparked immediate outrage online \u2013 and deservedly so. Our web browsing and search histories contain the most intimate personal information. Any administration \u2013 let alone the draconian Trump justice department \u2013 should be required to comply with the fourth amendment before trawling through it. Depressingly, the amendment failed to pass the 60-vote threshold by exactly one vote, 59-37, with two Democratic caucus members, including Bernie Sanders, failing to show up. \u201cAs far as I can tell we lost because there were some people absent,\u201d Ron Wyden, who co-sponsored the bill with Republication senator Steve Daines, told Politico. Even worse, 10 Democrats \u2013 including Dianne Feinstein, Sheldon Whitehouse and Mark Warner \u2013 sided with Mitch McConnell and the Trump administration and voted against the provision. Time and again, when it comes to privacy and civil liberties issues some Democrats have consistently sided with the Trump administration, despite portraying the president as lawless and unaccountable on a variety of subjects. It never ceases to be infuriating. But lost in the mix of this damaging loss for privacy, and perhaps even because of it, was some very good news. A second privacy-focused amendment to the Patriot Act \u2013 one that garnered far less coverage but is potentially even more substantive \u2013 did pass overwhelmingly on Wednesday night. Because the substance of the amendment was much harder to fit into a headline, it received a fraction of the attention. But it may be because the vote on web browsing histories sparked immediate outrage on Twitter, politicians from both parties felt the need to accept it. The amendment, known as the Leahy-Lee amendment \u2013 named after its bipartisan co-sponsors Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee \u2013 reforms the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court in a significant way. The Fisa court, which authorizes national security and foreign intelligence surveillance on US soil, first came to the general public\u2019s attention during the Snowden disclosures. The court, for decades, would listen to the government\u2019s side of an argument for new surveillance powers in complete secrecy, and almost never heard from the civil liberties perspective. The court was known to rubber-stamp virtually anything the FBI or NSA asked for. This one-sided system, as the New York Times reported at the time, carved out classified exceptions to the fourth amendment and \u201ccreated a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans\u201d without the public knowing about it. After the Snowden disclosures, Congress was forced to create an amicus curiae \u2013 or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d \u2013 position, which at very limited times and at the court\u2019s discretion, would be allowed to resist the government\u2019s arguments. Even though the position was extremely restricted, over the past several years, it has been shown to work on the few occasions it\u2019s been used. The Leahy-Lee amendment significantly strengthens the amicus position, giving the court\u2019s civil liberties representative much more latitude to access classified information and broadens their ability to weigh in on virtually all cases that may infringe upon the civil liberties of Americans. And here\u2019s where it gets interesting. The House passed a different version of a Patriot Act extension back in March, so now the Senate\u2019s version has to go back to the House, so the bills can match up. It gives privacy advocates another opportunity to get through even more robust changes, like the Wyden amendment protecting our Google search data. This issue is not the same partisan fight that we have become so accustomed to in Washington. Instead of a Republican-Democrat split, like so many issues in recent years, the fight over privacy and the Patriot Act has pitted a bipartisan left-right coalition against the moderate, pro-national security state establishment of both parties. Many Republicans crossed the line to vote with the majority of Democrats, while 10 Democrats sided with Barr and the Trump administration to hand them this power. While it\u2019s incredibly depressing Congress has failed to protect online privacy as it has become this generation\u2019s seminal issue, the fight is not over. Especially if representatives hear loud and clear how much this issue means to Americans. Trevor Timm is executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation",

It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called <a href=\"https://discovernorthernireland.com/Big-Dog-Forest-Big-Dog-Walk-P23397/\">Big Dog</a>. \u201cWhen I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated.

His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). \u201cRemoving\u201d himself from Big Dog \u201cwas devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes\u201d \u2013 the mountain range close to his new home \u2013 \u201cand everything became fine again.\u201d Was his recovery as simple as that? \u201cNo, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.\u201d</p> <p>Writing was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. \u201cAll my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,\u201d says McAnulty. But R\u00f3is\u00edn says she wouldn\u2019t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. \u201cAlthough it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.\u201d </p> <p>Rewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to \u201cre-experience\u201d memories both traumatic and joyful. \u201cI uncovered things about myself along the way. It\u2019s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We see a problem and we need to fix it. So when politicians seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>After his breakdown, he started at a new school.

He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation\u2019s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. \u201cWe see a problem and we need to fix it.

      "body": "<p>Teaching unions say they are willing to work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely, amid concerns about a renewed coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The debate over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to return some primary pupils to classrooms on 1 June has grown increasingly acrimonious after the British Medical Association (BMA) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">backed teaching unions</a> who said the government was moving too quickly.</p> <p>Pressure on the unions increased after the children\u2019s commissioner for England called on the two sides to \u201cstop squabbling\u201d and agree on a plan. Anne Longfield said she was in \u201cdespair\u201d at the increasingly entrenched positions being taken by the two sides, and that the interests of children were being ignored. <br><br>However, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said members supported schools reopening provided they could be made \u201cCovid secure\u201d and it would not put public health at risk. <br><br>Discussions between unions and government scientific advisers took place on Friday. However, the meeting was inconclusive and critics of the government\u2019s plan said it raised more questions than answers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis\">'Rushed and premature': parents reveal fears over schools reopening amid Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roach said teachers needed unequivocal guidance from the government that there would be strong controls in place that would satisfy both teachers and parents that it was safe to return.<br><br>\u201cWe are continuing to say to government but also to schools and employers, that we are here, we want to work with those employers to put plans in place to see whether schools can be ready for reopening from 1 June,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.<br> <br>\u201cWe want schools to be reopened, we want children to be safe and we want staff to be safe. It is not a zero-sum game here. It is about ensuring that we get back to a place where we can return to some form of normality.\u201d <br><br>Longfield said that until a vaccine was found there would have to be a managed approach to risk. \u201cMy worry within all that is that the needs of children and the best interests of children are disappearing from view,\u201d she told Today. <br><br>\u201cThere are really strong reasons why children need to get back into school. It is really imperative to see the can-do willingness to work together that we have seen in other parts of society.</p> <p>\u201cNone of us want to put children, or indeed staff or parents, into any kind of situation that is unsafe.

      "bodyText": "Teaching unions say they are willing to work with the government to begin reopening schools in England as long as it can be done safely, amid concerns about a renewed coronavirus outbreak. The debate over Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to return some primary pupils to classrooms on 1 June has grown increasingly acrimonious after the British Medical Association (BMA) backed teaching unions who said the government was moving too quickly. Pressure on the unions increased after the children\u2019s commissioner for England called on the two sides to \u201cstop squabbling\u201d and agree on a plan. Anne Longfield said she was in \u201cdespair\u201d at the increasingly entrenched positions being taken by the two sides, and that the interests of children were being ignored. However, Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT union, said members supported schools reopening provided they could be made \u201cCovid secure\u201d and it would not put public health at risk. Discussions between unions and government scientific advisers took place on Friday. However, the meeting was inconclusive and critics of the government\u2019s plan said it raised more questions than answers. Roach said teachers needed unequivocal guidance from the government that there would be strong controls in place that would satisfy both teachers and parents that it was safe to return. \u201cWe are continuing to say to government but also to schools and employers, that we are here, we want to work with those employers to put plans in place to see whether schools can be ready for reopening from 1 June,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cWe want schools to be reopened, we want children to be safe and we want staff to be safe. It is not a zero-sum game here. It is about ensuring that we get back to a place where we can return to some form of normality.\u201d Longfield said that until a vaccine was found there would have to be a managed approach to risk. \u201cMy worry within all that is that the needs of children and the best interests of children are disappearing from view,\u201d she told Today. \u201cThere are really strong reasons why children need to get back into school. It is really imperative to see the can-do willingness to work together that we have seen in other parts of society. \u201cNone of us want to put children, or indeed staff or parents, into any kind of situation that is unsafe. But until we get a vaccine we are going to have to be managing risk.\u201d Prof Sir Mark Walport, the chief executive of UK Research and Innovation and a former government chief scientific adviser, said ministers were taking a cautious approach and that a similar phased reopening in Denmark had not led to an increase in the transmission rate of the disease. \u201cIt is very harmful for children and complicated for families if their children aren\u2019t in school,\u201d he told Today. \u201cIt is clear that although children do get infected \u2013 and the evidence is that they are infected probably as often as older people \u2013 nevertheless they show less symptoms and almost certainly transmit less than older people. \u201cClass sizes are being kept low, not all school years are going back, so it is being done in a very cautious fashion.\u201d Meanwhile, another English council has publicly stated it would oppose the government\u2019s timetable. Hartlepool borough council said: \u201cGiven that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, the council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. \u201cWhile we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this. We continue to work with schools to put in place appropriate measures to help keep children and staff safe when a phased reopening is possible.\u201d Hartlepool\u2019s statement followed confirmation that Liverpool\u2019s schools would only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on 1 June. The BMA, the UK\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 union, said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Teaching unions had been \u201cabsolutely right\u201d to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening schools on 1 June, it said. \u201cWe cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK,\u201d the BMA council\u2019s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in the letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney.",

A+ service.\u201d While leaders in other countries may send staff ahead to make arrangements, a spokesperson for Ardern\u2019s office said waiting at a cafe was something anyone could experience during New Zealand\u2019s virus restrictions: \u201cThe PM says she just waits like everyone else.\u201d Without providing his name, the restaurant\u2019s owner told the New Zealand Herald that he was pleased to be talking about \u201csomething light-hearted and fun\u201d following \u201cthe drama and stress\u201d of the previous two months. He confirmed no exceptions were made for Ardern and that she and Gayford were initially turned away by the restaurant manager. However, the manager then ran down the street minutes later, after a table became free, which he stressed is a courtesy extended to other customers. \u201cShe had a lovely brunch and left half an hour later,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cShe was lovely with all the staff ... [and] she was treated like a normal customer.\u201d Refusing to reveal what the prime minister ordered, he confirmed that the couple did not have their 23-month-old daughter, Neve, with them. \u201c[It was a] date brunch,\u201d he said. Fewer than 1,500 people have been infected with Covid-19 in New Zealand, and 21 people have died, after the government pursued a vigorous elimination strategy, shutting its borders on 15 March and entering a country-wide lockdown 10 days later. As the country edges back to normal, the incident shows that while New Zealand\u2019s prime minister has reached near record-breaking approval levels, the country is remaining vigilant. \u201cWe\u2019re following every one of the rules,\u201d Olive\u2019s owner said.",

In other words: men need to be forced to wear masks more than women do.

The economic crisis brought on by the coronavirus is hitting women, particularly women of colour, the hardest. Women accounted for 55% of the 20.5 million jobs lost in April. Google is cutting diversity programs to avoid being seen as anti-conservative Eight current and former Google employees told NBC News that the tech giant has drastically scaled back internal diversity and inclusion training programs over the last two years. \u201cOne of the major motivations \u2026 is that the company doesn\u2019t want to be seen as anti-conservative,\u201d one employee said. \u201cIt does not want to invite lawsuits or claims by right-wing white employees about Google discriminating against them.\u201d Nice to know where Google\u2019s priorities are, eh? \u2018La Covid\u2019: coronavirus acronym is feminine Some French people have been saying \u201cle Covid\u201d, greatly distressing the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. The language body recently declared that \u201cthe use of the feminine gender would be preferable and it may not be too late to return the acronym to its proper gender.\u201d Thank God for that, then.",

      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s property market has proved to be a cornerstone of economic activity for decades. Without buyers and sellers alike booking removal lorries and moving home, large parts of the economy can lose momentum and drag on growth.</p> <p>The decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/housing-market-in-england-to-reopen-for-socially-distanced-property-viewings\" title=\"\">allow property viewings</a> as part of an easing of the lockdown was seen by ministers as a much-needed boost to commercial life. Over the coming months retailers and wholesalers that supply kitchens, carpets and light fittings will join the army of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\" title=\"\">previously furloughed</a> estate agents in getting a boost.</p> <p>Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, describes the move as \u201crelief for the housing market\u201d that \u201cshould allow activity to progressively pick up\u201d over the coming months.</p> <p>A better outcome \u2013 one that leads to a stronger rebound \u2013 is unlikely, he says. The anxiety surrounding the path of the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of thousands of businesses going bust and millions of people becoming unemployed, will keep a lid on the recovery.</p> <p>\u201cSome people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they could still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends,\u201d he says. \u201cAdditionally, many incomes have been negatively affected. Consumer confidence is currently at or near record low levels on many measures, and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come with regards to making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.\u201d</p> <p>Archer is one of the more optimistic analysts of the property market, expecting a fall in prices of just 5% over the next few months and a flattening-out by the end of the year. The average house price in the UK was \u00a3230,000 in February, down 0.3% on the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. There are much less modest declines to come, say experts.</p> <p>The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that prices in 2020 will be down 13% \u201cas a lack of transactions, high uncertainty and falling incomes take their toll\u201d.</p> <p>In the first weeks of the pandemic, property agency Knight Frank said it anticipated a fall of 3% in 2020 before increasing this forecast to 7% last week. Its analysis suggested prices had fallen 5% since March, with further pain for sellers to come.</p> <p>Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: \u201cI suspect people will be fairly wary.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that while the easing of restrictions will unlock transactions already in the pipeline and encourage those who need to move for work or family reasons, most people will wait to see how their circumstances develop before buying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T23:14:01/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Average house prices since 2009\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-15T23:14:01/embed.html\">Average house prices since 2009</a> </figure>  <p>High-end property agent Henry Pryor says his clients are looking for 20% discounts, though they are likely to agree on a figure nearer 10%.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t know where prices are going to be at the end of the year and whether they will be in negative equity,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Rubinsohn says buyers have also found they may want to consider aspects of a property that were not so important three months ago.</p> <p>\u201cThey might want to put a garden or balcony higher up their agenda, or put more time into considering the merits of city life versus something more rural,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI am not sure we are able to make judgments about which way people are going to jump. It is too early to say. But there is certainly the potential for people to rethink what they want from their next home.\u201d</p> <p>Trends that were developing before the pandemic hit could be accelerated as the lockdown eases. If commercial properties become less attractive to employers following a shift to home working, a trend to convert empty offices into apartments could pick up pace.</p> <p>Rubinsohn warns that this may not be good news for buyers after <a href=\"https://www.rics.org/uk/news-insight/research/research-reports/assessing-the-impacts-of-extending-permitted-development-rights-to-office-to-residential-change-of-use-in-england/\" title=\"\">a report by academics at University College London</a> for Rics found developers had taken the opportunity of weak planning rules to produce substandard homes that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48fbe55c-ffb2-11e8-ac00-57a2a826423e\" title=\"\">one critic dubbed \u201cthe slums of the future\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Other trends could reverse. A drift to the city could come to an abrupt end as the prospect of rejoining the morning commuter crush loses its appeal. And the hollowing-out of town centre high streets could be turned around if the prospect of queuing at an out-of-town supermarket is tarnished and buying from local shops is seen as safer.</p> <p>The promise of historically low interest rates for the next two years \u2013 and most likely a decade or more \u2013 could underpin this transition, but the route back to a more normal level of transactions will be slow.</p> <p>Archer says: \u201cVery low borrowing costs should also help matters, with the Bank of England unlikely to lift interest rates from 0.1% until well into 2021. Even so, we expect house price gains to be no more than 2-3% in 2021.\u201d</p> <p>Rubinsohn argues that the government will need to consider tax breaks or subsidies to kickstart the market before housebuilders consider limiting the supply of new homes further.</p> <p>\u201cWithout help, and especially as unemployment increases, the housing market recovery is going to be slow. It will be a hard slog,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Case studies of a troubled market</h2> <p><strong>The buyers</strong><br>Ed Fireman, 54, and his wife Sue, 53, were raring to go when the property market reopened on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s property market has proved to be a cornerstone of economic activity for decades. Without buyers and sellers alike booking removal lorries and moving home, large parts of the economy can lose momentum and drag on growth. The decision to allow property viewings as part of an easing of the lockdown was seen by ministers as a much-needed boost to commercial life. Over the coming months retailers and wholesalers that supply kitchens, carpets and light fittings will join the army of previously furloughed estate agents in getting a boost. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, describes the move as \u201crelief for the housing market\u201d that \u201cshould allow activity to progressively pick up\u201d over the coming months. A better outcome \u2013 one that leads to a stronger rebound \u2013 is unlikely, he says. The anxiety surrounding the path of the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of thousands of businesses going bust and millions of people becoming unemployed, will keep a lid on the recovery. \u201cSome people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they could still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends,\u201d he says. \u201cAdditionally, many incomes have been negatively affected. Consumer confidence is currently at or near record low levels on many measures, and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come with regards to making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.\u201d Archer is one of the more optimistic analysts of the property market, expecting a fall in prices of just 5% over the next few months and a flattening-out by the end of the year. The average house price in the UK was \u00a3230,000 in February, down 0.3% on the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. There are much less modest declines to come, say experts. The Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that prices in 2020 will be down 13% \u201cas a lack of transactions, high uncertainty and falling incomes take their toll\u201d. In the first weeks of the pandemic, property agency Knight Frank said it anticipated a fall of 3% in 2020 before increasing this forecast to 7% last week. Its analysis suggested prices had fallen 5% since March, with further pain for sellers to come. Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: \u201cI suspect people will be fairly wary.\u201d He adds that while the easing of restrictions will unlock transactions already in the pipeline and encourage those who need to move for work or family reasons, most people will wait to see how their circumstances develop before buying. High-end property agent Henry Pryor says his clients are looking for 20% discounts, though they are likely to agree on a figure nearer 10%. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where prices are going to be at the end of the year and whether they will be in negative equity,\u201d he says. Rubinsohn says buyers have also found they may want to consider aspects of a property that were not so important three months ago. \u201cThey might want to put a garden or balcony higher up their agenda, or put more time into considering the merits of city life versus something more rural,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not sure we are able to make judgments about which way people are going to jump. It is too early to say. But there is certainly the potential for people to rethink what they want from their next home.\u201d Trends that were developing before the pandemic hit could be accelerated as the lockdown eases. If commercial properties become less attractive to employers following a shift to home working, a trend to convert empty offices into apartments could pick up pace. Rubinsohn warns that this may not be good news for buyers after a report by academics at University College London for Rics found developers had taken the opportunity of weak planning rules to produce substandard homes that one critic dubbed \u201cthe slums of the future\u201d. Other trends could reverse. A drift to the city could come to an abrupt end as the prospect of rejoining the morning commuter crush loses its appeal. And the hollowing-out of town centre high streets could be turned around if the prospect of queuing at an out-of-town supermarket is tarnished and buying from local shops is seen as safer. The promise of historically low interest rates for the next two years \u2013 and most likely a decade or more \u2013 could underpin this transition, but the route back to a more normal level of transactions will be slow. Archer says: \u201cVery low borrowing costs should also help matters, with the Bank of England unlikely to lift interest rates from 0.1% until well into 2021. Even so, we expect house price gains to be no more than 2-3% in 2021.\u201d Rubinsohn argues that the government will need to consider tax breaks or subsidies to kickstart the market before housebuilders consider limiting the supply of new homes further. \u201cWithout help, and especially as unemployment increases, the housing market recovery is going to be slow. It will be a hard slog,\u201d he says. Case studies of a troubled market The buyers Ed Fireman, 54, and his wife Sue, 53, were raring to go when the property market reopened on Wednesday. The couple, who live near Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, had an offer accepted on a new home nearby during lockdown, based on a virtual viewing, and were keen to get their place on the market. \u201cWe were straight on the phone to the estate agent \u2013 let\u2019s get moving.

New York City is often described as the \u201ccenter of the pandemic\u201d, but a map of the <a href=\"https://anhdnyc.carto.com/builder/aa03fc4a-9086-494c-8989-99db078ed62e/embed?state=%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22ne%22%3A%5B40.54720023441049%2C-74.48249816894533%5D%2C%22sw%22%3A%5B40.89482963261178%2C-73.54316711425783%5D%2C%22center%22%3A%5B40.72124187397379%2C-74.01283264160158%5D%2C%22zoom%22%3A11%7D%7D\">most affected areas</a> clearly shows that poorer neighborhoods are bearing the brunt. In Chicago, <a href=\"https://features.propublica.org/chicago-first-deaths/covid-coronavirus-took-black-lives-first/\">70 of the first 100 Covid-19 victims were black</a>; Milwaukee tells a <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/early-data-shows-african-americans-have-contracted-and-died-of-coronavirus-at-an-alarming-rate\">similar story</a>.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the government\u2019s measures to mitigate the economic effects of Covid-19 lockdowns exacerbate <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/01/essential-workers-and-the-reverse-robin-hood-coronavirus-bailout/\">previously</a><a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/01/essential-workers-and-the-reverse-robin-hood-coronavirus-bailout/\"> existing inequalities</a>. Trump\u2019s much-vaunted bailout has created a multitrillion-dollar money supply for the largest corporations in the country, with almost <a href=\"https://kpfa.org/episode/letters-and-politics-april-1-2020/\">no critical oversight requirements</a>. At the same time, people whose livelihoods are being destroyed are being asked to make do with a one-off $1,200 payment, the conditions for which exclude many of those who need it most.</p> <p>This amounts to a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-coronavirus-bailout-repeats-2008s-mistakes-huge-corporate-payoffs-with-little-accountability\">Just like in 2008</a>, capital has taken hold of the crisis, and turned it to its own advantage.</p> <p>Yet at this stage simply lifting the lockdown to get the economy going would do <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/opinion/coronavirus-depression.html\">more harm than good</a>. The lockdown has generated its own crisis.

Many workers are rightly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-georgia-worker/americans-too-scared-to-go-to-work-risk-losing-unemployment-aid-experts-say-idUSKCN2251RD\">scared</a> of returning to workplaces that do not properly ensure their safety.

      "bodyText": "The argument over lockdown seems to have crystallized into a simple \u2013 and simplistic \u2013 binary: health versus the economy. If you position yourself on the left, you value health over money, and so support the lockdown. That\u2019s a mistake. The \u201chealth versus the economy\u201d frame ignores how disastrous the lockdown has been to America\u2019s poor. Despite rhetoric about \u201cshared sacrifice\u201d, the ability to self-isolate is overwhelmingly correlated to income. While middle-class professionals congratulate themselves for staying inside, their isolation is dependent on a class of workers who often labor without essential equipment or while ill. Making matters worse, these exposed workers also tend to have more of the health conditions \u2013 including hypertension and diabetes \u2013 that make Covid-19 so deadly. In America, getting sick is a class condition. This pandemic is an X-ray, exposing the racial and class inequalities of our society.

To make matters worse, the government\u2019s measures to mitigate the economic effects of Covid-19 lockdowns exacerbate previously existing inequalities.

An Associated Press review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed. <br> </p> <p>Contact tracing was one of the \u201ccore state preparedness responsibilities\u201d outlined in the White House guidelines for reopening the country, but governors have been pressing ahead with lifting restrictions without having comprehensive programs in place.</p> <p>Hall county, which has over 200,000 residents and the second-highest rate of coronavirus cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia\">Georgia</a>, has between 30 and 40 contact tracers assigned to the local public health district, which also serves a dozen neighboring counties. It hopes to receive an additional 30 from the state.</p> <p>Georgia was among the first states to ease restrictions. Public health experts have expressed concern that the state was risking a spike in cases by moving too quickly. So far, the state has hired 250 contact tracers with a goal of reaching 1,000.</p> <p>While there is no federal formula for how many of the disease detectives are needed, public health experts have said one contact tracer is needed for every 1,000 to 3,000 residents in the US, or between 100,000 and 300,000 nationally. For Georgia, that would be between 3,333 and 10,000.</p> <p>During congressional testimony this past week, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, reiterated his concern that parts of the US might be easing restrictions too early without having the ability to respond effectively to an increase in cases with \u201cgood identification, isolation and contact tracing\u201d.</p> <p>The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released general guidance to states on contact tracing.

      "bodyText": "As state after state begins to reopen in the United States, local health departments charged with tracking down everyone who has been in close contact with those who test positive for coronavirus are still scrambling to hire the number of people they need to do the job. They are often hundreds \u2013 even thousands \u2013 of people short of targets for their so-called contact tracing programs. Public health experts have consistently said robust programs to test more people and trace their contacts are needed for states to safely reboot their economies and prevent a resurgence of the virus. Cook county, Illinois, has just 29 contact tracers serving 2.5 million people living in suburban communities around Chicago. The jail in Cook county has been an intense hotspot for Covid-19. Los Angeles county, at more than 10 million people has a population slightly greater than Michigan, and has just 400 of the estimated 6,000 contact tracers it will need under California\u2019s criteria for a broader reopening. With 2.7 million residents and roughly 100 to 300 new Covid-19 cases a day, Miami-Dade county in Florida, home to Miami and Miami Beach, has 175 people tracking down people who were potentially exposed to the virus. \u201cThe whole point of the lockdown was to buy time to have a better way to keep numbers down,\u201d said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the humanitarian response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa during the Obama administration. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why so many of us are screaming ourselves hoarse about testing and tracing.\u201d Public health experts say contact tracing systems should be in place before cases become widespread, so every new infection can be tracked and the person\u2019s contacts identified, tested and isolated from the rest of the community. Until recently, there had been scant federal guidance on what contact tracing should look like, and there is still no coordinated federal strategy. While other countries are taking a national approach to contact tracing, the US is leaving it to states to devise their own programs. The result has been a patchwork of efforts. An Associated Press review in late April found little consensus among states on basic questions such as how many investigators are needed. Contact tracing was one of the \u201ccore state preparedness responsibilities\u201d outlined in the White House guidelines for reopening the country, but governors have been pressing ahead with lifting restrictions without having comprehensive programs in place. Hall county, which has over 200,000 residents and the second-highest rate of coronavirus cases in Georgia, has between 30 and 40 contact tracers assigned to the local public health district, which also serves a dozen neighboring counties. It hopes to receive an additional 30 from the state. Georgia was among the first states to ease restrictions. Public health experts have expressed concern that the state was risking a spike in cases by moving too quickly. So far, the state has hired 250 contact tracers with a goal of reaching 1,000. While there is no federal formula for how many of the disease detectives are needed, public health experts have said one contact tracer is needed for every 1,000 to 3,000 residents in the US, or between 100,000 and 300,000 nationally. For Georgia, that would be between 3,333 and 10,000. During congressional testimony this past week, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, reiterated his concern that parts of the US might be easing restrictions too early without having the ability to respond effectively to an increase in cases with \u201cgood identification, isolation and contact tracing\u201d. The next day, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released general guidance to states on contact tracing. It said the number of cases investigators and contact tracers needed in each community \u201cmay be large\u201d and will vary, in part due to caseloads. Under California\u2019s criteria for a broader reopening, counties should have 15 people trained in contact tracing for every 100,000 residents. The state is helping, working to train between 10,000 and 20,000 tracers, but most large counties are falling short. Harris county, Texas\u2019s most populous with more than 4.7 million residents, is working to train about 300 contact tracers by 22 May. It has been two weeks since Texas reopened retail, restaurants, malls and movie theaters to limited numbers of customers. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Department of Public Health has trained a small number of contact tracers and wants to hire more to be deployed once the number of new infections has dropped enough to make contact tracing practical, spokesman James Garrow said. A few states, including Utah, made contact tracing a priority before beginning to ease restrictions.",

Well, not in the UK, not yet. But over in Germany, the Bundesliga today becomes the first major division to get back up and running in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. And what a place to pick things up again: Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke! The Revierderby! The rumble in the Ruhr! The noise in North Rhine-Westphalia! The ... hey, let us shake off some MBM rust, will you, it\u2019s been a while. You get the gist.</p> <p><strong>So about that rumble and noise ... </strong>BVB\u2019s Westfalenstadion is arguably the most atmospheric ground in Europe, the Yellow Wall, all that. But not today. This game will be played behind closed doors, with only 213 people allowed in. That number takes in players, managers and staff, officials and ballboys, medical folk, camera operators and other assorted media types. There\u2019ll be no handshakes, no team photos, no mascots. No cheering, no chanting. The rest of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season will be played out like this. Nine eerie games to go.</p> <p><strong>The tragic realities of Covid-19 aside, this is a shame for a more trivial reason. </strong>The Revierderby has always generated one hell of an atmosphere. Take 1969, for example, when Schalke took the lead at Dortmund. Fans staged a celebratory pitch invasion, and were chased back into the stands by police dogs. Amid the brouhaha, an Alsatian sunk his teeth into the most padded portion of Schalke defender Friedel Rausch\u2019s shorts. It later transpired that this particular hound had nothing to do with the police, but was brought in by a sassy Dortmund fan posing as a peeler to gain free entry! When Schalke hosted the reverse fixture later that season, their president Gunter Siebert responded to events by patrolling the pitch with <em>a lion</em>. Forget that miserable old saw about Germans having no sense of humour: this was, quite literally, satire with teeth.</p> <p><strong>Fifty-one years on ...</strong> and the Dortmund of 2020 are chasing their first Bundesliga title since the Jurgen Klopp era; since 2012 to be precise. They\u2019re currently four points behind reigning champions Bayern Munich. Schalke are well off the pace in sixth spot, but if they can hinder their rivals\u2019 title challenge this afternoon, it\u2019ll make up for an awful lot. Schalke started the season well under new boss David Wagner, formerly of Huddersfield Town and Dortmund reserves, but the enforced break came at a good time for them: they\u2019ve only won once in eight league games since the winter break, a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in January, and were recently battered 5-0 at home by RB Leipzig. Lucien Favre\u2019s black and yellows, by contrast, are on a four-match winning run, though that comes with the obvious caveats and asterisks. The hosts will be the favourites today.</p> <p><strong>And yet Schalke will take heart from their last two visits to the Westfalenstadion.</strong> In 2017, they came back from four goals down after 25 minutes to grab an absurd 4-4 draw, while they won 4-2 last season as Dortmund\u2019s title bid spluttered out horribly. On both occasions, Dortmund had men sent off. They haven\u2019t won this fixture since 2015. So despite the strange, sterile, mid-pandemic atmosphere, today\u2019s Revierderby still has the potential to thrill. It\u2019s Der BVB! It\u2019s Die Knappen! It\u2019s one of the biggest rivalries in world football! It is, once again, on!</p> <p><strong>Kick-off:</strong> Too soon, some will undoubtedly say. But they\u2019ll get the ball rolling at 3.30pm in Dortmund, 2.30pm UK time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb50706d2bc70d2a3ea528bf1870ca3d3036a1c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb50706d2bc70d2a3ea528bf1870ca3d3036a1c5/0_0_3500_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ballboys disinfect the balls before the match.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ballboys disinfect the balls before the match.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-16T13:08:24.860Z\">at 2.08pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "John Brewin\u2019s report has landed. Here it is; you know what to do. Click, enjoy ... and thanks for reading this MBM. Stay safe, everyone. Dortmund, by contrast, were superb. All four of their goals were crackers; they\u2019re a fine team to watch in full flow. And all without Jadon Sancho, too. This is a team that can spread the goals around. They\u2019re a point behind Bayern, though the reigning champs can stretch their lead back to four tomorrow with a win at Union Berlin. Der Klassiker, here at the Westfalenstadion in ten days time, promises to be ... well ... a classic. Schalke were abysmal. David Wagner has plenty of thinking to do. They\u2019re now eight games without a win in the Bundesliga, a run which has seen them lose 3-0 to Cologne, 5-0 to Bayern Munich and Leipzig, and now 4-0 to their arch enemies. They slip from sixth down to eighth, and you wouldn\u2019t put too many pfennigs on them making the Europa League next season. Dortmund close to within a point of Bayern Munich at the top, with an imperious victory in the Revierderby. Schalke were swiped aside with ease, as poor as Dortmund were excellent. The Westfalenstadion echos to a round of applause, and the team amuse themselves by staging a choreographed celebration in front of the empty Yellow Wall. Very droll. 90 min: There will be some added time. Seven seconds of it, in fact. 88 min: Both teams make another change. Jonjo Kenny makes way for Timo Becker, while Mahmoud Dahoud is replaced by 2014 World Cup hero Mario Goetze. 86 min: Kenny prods down the right for Matondo, who sashays across the front of the box and nearly works space to shoot. It\u2019s a fine run, but Hummels comes crunching in with a fine tackle, then Matondo accidentally studs Hakimi while stretching for the loose ball. Matondo is booked, though there\u2019s no serious injury and no bad feeling. 84 min: This match has dropped to walking pace. It\u2019s long become a stroll for Dortmund. 82 min: Hakimi takes down a long punt gracefully and tears off down the right touchline. He fizzes a ball through the six-yard box, but it\u2019s inches away from Haaland, who was racing in with a view to slapshooting home. Schalke are in tatters. 80 min: Schalke stroke it around. Matondo tries to raise the tempo with a burst down the left, but there\u2019s nowhere for him to go. 78 min: Hazard, who has had a fine game, makes way for Jadon Sancho. 76 min: Yet another Schalke change: Caligiuri makes way for Miranda. A reminder that teams are permitted to use five subs per match for the rest of the season. 74 min: Some admin. Schopf replaces Serdar. Piszczek is booked for accidentally handling the ball while slide-tackling. And Schalke win a corner! Sane attacks it, but heads harmlessly over. 72 min: \u201cOne sided matches in empty stadiums? Nobody told me Scottish football was back.\u201d Simon McMahon, laddies and lassies. He\u2019s here all week, try the sausage and mustard. 70 min: Dahoud grapples with Burgstaller to the right of the Dortmund D, and that\u2019s a free kick to Schalke. Caligiuri curls it to the far post, where Matondo prepares to head home from close range. But Balerdi is immediately in the thick of it, showcasing his qualities by back-heading clear just in time. 68 min: Delaney makes way for 21-year-old Argentinian defender Leo Balerdi. As he makes his way to the bench, the club doctor issues him with his face mask. All protocols observed. The Premier League will be taking notes. 67 min: Imagine the noise the Yellow Wall would be making now. 65 min: Guerreiro didn\u2019t bother celebrating that one. Nothing to do with social distancing, more that he thought he was a mile offside. But Kenny, way deeper than the rest of the Schalke back line, was playing him on. Miles onside. Good thing too, because that was a brilliant move of pace, ambition and no little skill. It\u2019d have been horrible to see it chalked off. This is a delicious goal. Guerreiro powers in diagonally from the left. He slips a pass inside for Haaland, just to the right of the D. Haaland returns it down the channel, Guerreiro having continued his diagonal run. Guerreiro then flicks home sensationally, flicking it with the outside of his boot into the right-hand side of the net, totally flummoxing Schubert yet again. That is something else! 61 min: See 59 min. Hey, don\u2019t shoot the messenger. 59 min: Schalke pop the ball around the middle of the park. Dortmund seem happy enough to let them get on with it, because they\u2019re going nowhere. 57 min: Burgstaller tries to get something going for the Miners. He twists and turns on the edge of the Dortmund D and bobbles a shot goalwards. It\u2019s not great, but at least it\u2019s something. Schalke have terrible problems scoring goals. Burki gathers without fuss, not bad going seeing the ball was bouncing all over the place and took a deflection en route. 55 min: Dortmund carve Schalke open down the left with some pretty triangles. Haaland enters the box and should get a shot away, but uncharacteristically wastes the chance, overrunning the ball and allowing Nastasic to close him down. Schalke are a rabble. 54 min: Delaney is booked for using his elbow in a high 50-50 with Serdar. He can\u2019t have any complaints, but makes some anyway. 53 min: Nothing comes from the free kick, other than a speculative long-distance blam by Kenny. Nope! 52 min: Delaney hauls back Harit as the Schalke man attacks down the left. Free kick in a dangerous position. 50 min: Haaland needs a bit of treatment, but he\u2019s good to continue. The game restarts ... though is it already effectively over? Well, Schalke did come from 4-0 down to draw two seasons ago ... Schalke faff around, and Dortmund break upfield. Haaland storms down the left and pokes forward for Brandt. He\u2019s blocked by Sane and yells in pain, but the ref lets play go on. Brandt strides down the left, then strokes a pass infield for Hazard, free down the inside-right channel. Hazard creams a low shot towards the bottom right, and it goes straight through Schubert and in. 46 min: Serdar has a whack from distance. It\u2019s easy for Burki, but that\u2019s as good as anything they did in the first half. Here we go again! Schalke have made a double change, and it\u2019s an attacking gambit. Burgstaller comes on to add a bit of lumber to the attack; he replaces injured defender Todibo. Raman makes way for Matondo up front. Half-time entertainment. Pint, pie, potty, podcast. All sorted! Dortmund are well in control of the Revierderby. They go off to a light smattering of uncertain applause, the sort Mike and Bernie Winters used to receive at the Glasgow Empire. Schubert shanks a dismal clearance straight at Delaney, who offloads to Brandt. The ball\u2019s shuttled to Guerreiro, who strides into the box and lashes a low shot across the hapless keeper and into the bottom right. Schubert dips his head, as well he might. What a gift, though the finish was special. It\u2019s Guerreiro\u2019s sixth of the season. 43 min: Kenny crosses low from the Schalke right. Harit prepares to shoot from the edge of the D. He\u2019s clipped from behind by Hummels and goes over. But he doesn\u2019t get the free kick. There wasn\u2019t a lot of contact, true, but it was enough. Harit is furious, and nearly fumes his way into the book with a verbal volley at the ref. But we play on. 41 min: From the corner, Dahoud has a crack from the best part of 30 yards. He catches it flush, and it\u2019s going to take the net off the frame of the goal, but Sane bravely gets in the way to flick over the bar. Ooyah, oof, that\u2019s gotta hurt. The next corner is a non-event. 40 min: Brandt creams a diagonal pass towards Hakimi on the right. Hakimi\u2019s in acres, and strides into the box. He\u2019s got Guerreiro and Haaland to his left, but opts to shoot instead. The ball pings off Nastasic and away for a corner. He should have laid it off. 38 min: A break in play as Todibo gets a bit of treatment. Not sure what for. Shock, perhaps. Hakimi is some prospect. 36 min: Hakimi zips down the right flank and gets to a ball he had no right to reach. He hooks it back from the byline, with Todibo in close attendance, and finds Guerreiro, who slices high and wide left from the edge of the box. Chances are Guerreiro was as surprised as anyone else that Hakimi kept that in. 34 min: Dortmund are well on top now. Imagine the noise if the Yellow Wall was in situ. \u201cA bit like watching soundcheck, this,\u201d suggests Grant Tennille. \u201cNot that that necessarily precludes heavy-metal football.\u201d 32 min: Schalke have been rocked by the quality of that goal. They\u2019re struggling to clear their heads, and to retain possession. 30 min: That\u2019s Haaland\u2019s tenth Bundesliga goal of the season, and it was a sensational move. He runs off to the corner flag, but there\u2019s nobody there to celebrate with. Never mind, a huge smile plays across his face anyway. It didn\u2019t take long for him to get back into the groove, did it? Who else? Erling Braut Haaland scores yet again, opening his body up to elegantly sidefoot Hazard\u2019s right-wing cross into the bottom left. A gorgeous finish to a flowing move that started with Brandt sending Hazard away down the wing with a cute reverse flick 26 min: Schalke have been quiet, but suddenly they explode into life, Oczipka whipping a cross in from the left. Akanji\u2019s clearing header is dreadful, straight at Caligiuri, who nearly powers home at the far post. But Akanji does extremely well to get back and block, with a little help from Burki. 25 min: Incidentally, just before the corner was taken, Haaland and Todibo received a mild ticking off from the referee for some garden-variety fussin\u2019 and fightin\u2019. A feud worth keeping an eye on. 24 min: Brant sends it in. It\u2019s only half cleared, and he gets another go to swing in from the right. Sane eyebrows the cross away from Hummels, who was preparing to head home from six yards. The ball breaks to Haaland at the far post. He lashes in his trademark fierce style into the side netting. Dortmund very close there. 23 min: Hazard is brought down by Serdar as he dribbles down the left. A free kick just to the side of the D. Hakimi takes, but it\u2019s straight at the wall and headed away from danger by Nastasic. But it\u2019s at the expense of a corner, from which ... 21 min: A lull, the first of the new era. 19 min: Hummels faffs around on the halfway line, and is nearly stripped of possession by the buzzing Raman. He gets away with it. A lucky one, because if Raman won the block-tackle duel, he\u2019d have been clean away. 17 min: Dortmund have enjoyed 57% of possession so far. After a slow start, they\u2019ve also had the better chances. About right for a match-up between second and sixth. 15 min: Dortmund are beginning to assert themselves now. Hazard flicks one round the corner to send Guerreiro skittering towards the Schalke box down the inside right. He\u2019s got enough time and space to shoot when he enters the area, but his weak drag is easily blocked by Sane. It\u2019s a corner, which turns out to be a total non-event. 13 min: The exciting Hakimi goes on a tear down the right and whips a low ball into the six-yard box. Haaland is lurking at the far post, waiting to slam home, but Todibo slides in stylishly to hook clear, a sensational bit of defending. For a second, Schalke had been ripped open. 12 min: After an interminable wait, it\u2019s decided that Kenny was so close to Haaland that he could do nothing about the ball striking his hand. Something that was blatantly obvious from the get-go. Did you miss VAR? 10 min: Hazard is upended mid-dribble down the right by Nastasic. Delaney hooks the free kick into the mixer. Haaland rises at the far post and tries to hook a shot around Kenny. The ball clanks onto Kenny\u2019s hand. Haaland wants a penalty kick. The referee goes upstairs to find out what the deal is. 9 min: Dortmund ping it around for a while to no great effect. 7 min: It\u2019s a bright start, this. How we\u2019ve missed football. Hazard jigs down the inside right channel and has a whack from distance. He blazes the ball high into the empty stand. 6 min: Caligiuri tries a curler towards the top left, but blooters the free kick straight into the wall. 5 min: So this is good end to end fun. Harit dances down the middle and draws a clumsy foul from Dahoud. A free kick, just outside the D, in a very dangerous position. 4 min: Having realised Schalke are playing at a higher tempo, Haaland tries to kick-start Dortmund into life with a burst down the inside-right channel. He nearly bursts through, but loses control just at the end, allowing Schubert to smother. 3 min: Schalke press Dortmund hard. McKennie steals the ball in the midfield and feeds Raman down the inside left. For a second it looks as though there\u2019ll be time for a shot, but he\u2019s closed down by Hakimi and the danger\u2019s over. 2 min: Ah, that sports-centre five-a-side ambience. Dortmund knock it around the back in the training-ground style. Football really is all about the fans. But this is where we all are, and there\u2019s no point harping on about it. Let\u2019s enjoy it for what it is. Dortmund get the ball rolling! God speed, everyone. The teams are out! And it\u2019s a positively psychedelic experience. No fans, just 200-odd people in the 81,000-capacity Westfalenstadion. The PA guy\u2019s voice pinging off the walls like the hollow announcement of the last train home. And there\u2019s been a last-minute change to the Dortmund team, with Thorgan Hazard taking the place of young Gio Reyna. We\u2019ll be off in a few seconds! Pre-match chit-chat. \u201cHi Scott, hope you are well.\u201d All good over here, Ruth Purdue, thanks for asking. Hope you\u2019re well too. \u201cAre you excited about seeing European football again as well as being conflicted about it at the same time?\u201d Excited? Yes. Conflicted? Indeed. Although for some of us, football never ever stops, not really. It only seems like a couple of weeks ago when Stanley Matthews lifted the 1953 FA Cup. Strange times. Pre-bandwagon-jumping reading. Because, as Pjotr van Rooijen says: \u201cWe are all football hipsters now.\u201d \u266b\u266f\u266a \u201cIt was 20 19 years ago today ... \u266b\u266a\u266b It\u2019s the anniversary of another notable match at the Westfalenstadion. Here\u2019s how Sid Lowe saw the wild and wonderful 2001 Uefa Cup final at the time. Another nine-goal thriller today? Yes please, everyone. Giovanni Reyna, son of former Rangers, Sunderland and Manchester City midfielder Claudio, makes his first start for Dortmund. Thomas Delaney returns, while Jadon Sancho is left on the bench. Axel Witsel, Marco Reus, Emre Can, Nico Schulz and Dan-Axel Zagadou all miss out due to injury. Schalke welcome back Salif Sane, who makes his first appearance since injuring his knee last November. Jonjoe Kenny, on loan from Everton, starts, as does Barca loanee Jean-Clair Todibo. Ozan Kabak and Benjamin Stambouli miss out. BVB: Burki, Akanji, Hummels, Piszczek, Hakimi, Guerreiro, Delaney, Dahoud, Reyna, Brandt, Haaland. Subs: Hitz, Sancho, Hazard, Schmelzer, Morey, Balerdi, Furich, Gotze, Raschl. S04: Schubert, McKennie, Nastasic, Serdar, Raman, Caligiuri, Kenny, Todibo, Oczipka, Harit, Sane. Subs: Nubel, Miranda, Gregoritsch, Matondo, Kutucu, Burgstaller, Schopf, Becker, Mercan. Football\u2019s back, baby! It\u2019s back! Well, not in the UK, not yet. But over in Germany, the Bundesliga today becomes the first major division to get back up and running in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. And what a place to pick things up again: Borussia Dortmund versus Schalke! The Revierderby! The rumble in the Ruhr! The noise in North Rhine-Westphalia! The ... hey, let us shake off some MBM rust, will you, it\u2019s been a while. You get the gist. So about that rumble and noise ... BVB\u2019s Westfalenstadion is arguably the most atmospheric ground in Europe, the Yellow Wall, all that. But not today. This game will be played behind closed doors, with only 213 people allowed in. That number takes in players, managers and staff, officials and ballboys, medical folk, camera operators and other assorted media types. There\u2019ll be no handshakes, no team photos, no mascots. No cheering, no chanting. The rest of the 2019-20 Bundesliga season will be played out like this. Nine eerie games to go. The tragic realities of Covid-19 aside, this is a shame for a more trivial reason. The Revierderby has always generated one hell of an atmosphere. Take 1969, for example, when Schalke took the lead at Dortmund. Fans staged a celebratory pitch invasion, and were chased back into the stands by police dogs. Amid the brouhaha, an Alsatian sunk his teeth into the most padded portion of Schalke defender Friedel Rausch\u2019s shorts. It later transpired that this particular hound had nothing to do with the police, but was brought in by a sassy Dortmund fan posing as a peeler to gain free entry! When Schalke hosted the reverse fixture later that season, their president Gunter Siebert responded to events by patrolling the pitch with a lion. Forget that miserable old saw about Germans having no sense of humour: this was, quite literally, satire with teeth. Fifty-one years on ... and the Dortmund of 2020 are chasing their first Bundesliga title since the Jurgen Klopp era; since 2012 to be precise. They\u2019re currently four points behind reigning champions Bayern Munich. Schalke are well off the pace in sixth spot, but if they can hinder their rivals\u2019 title challenge this afternoon, it\u2019ll make up for an awful lot. Schalke started the season well under new boss David Wagner, formerly of Huddersfield Town and Dortmund reserves, but the enforced break came at a good time for them: they\u2019ve only won once in eight league games since the winter break, a 2-0 victory over Borussia Monchengladbach in January, and were recently battered 5-0 at home by RB Leipzig. Lucien Favre\u2019s black and yellows, by contrast, are on a four-match winning run, though that comes with the obvious caveats and asterisks. The hosts will be the favourites today. And yet Schalke will take heart from their last two visits to the Westfalenstadion. In 2017, they came back from four goals down after 25 minutes to grab an absurd 4-4 draw, while they won 4-2 last season as Dortmund\u2019s title bid spluttered out horribly. On both occasions, Dortmund had men sent off. They haven\u2019t won this fixture since 2015. So despite the strange, sterile, mid-pandemic atmosphere, today\u2019s Revierderby still has the potential to thrill. It\u2019s Der BVB! It\u2019s Die Knappen! It\u2019s one of the biggest rivalries in world football! It is, once again, on! Kick-off: Too soon, some will undoubtedly say. But they\u2019ll get the ball rolling at 3.30pm in Dortmund, 2.30pm UK time.",

      "body": "<p>Everyone in care homes in Wales will be able to get a coronavirus test, the Welsh government has said.</p> <p>The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the change follows the latest scientific advice and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-care-home-residents-deaths-england-wales\">brings Wales in</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/coronavirus-care-home-residents-deaths-england-wales\"> line with England</a>. The move means every care home in Wales will have access to testing and be able to order online kits for residents and staff.</p> <p>It comes as opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry. </p> <p>Previously, only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Gething said: \u201cHow we tackle coronavirus continually changes as we receive more emerging evidence and scientific advice. We have been very clear in our approach that our strategy is about reducing harm first and we will adapt policies in order to do this. </p> <p>\u201cToday is a step change in how we will be testing in care homes, adapting our policy so that every resident and member of staff can be tested for coronavirus. I hope this brings further reassurance to those living and working in care homes and their families.\u201d </p> <p>Testing in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all care home residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms since the end of April. </p> <p>The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said at the time there was not a \u201cclinical value\u201d in testing everyone where no one was displaying symptoms. The Office for National Statistics said there were 532 deaths up to 1 May involving Covid-19 among care home residents in Wales. This was the lowest regional total across England and Wales. </p> <p>Janet Finch-Saunders, the shadow minister for social care, said: \u201cCare homes have some of society\u2019s most vulnerable and for that reason I have been urging the Welsh government for weeks to extend coronavirus testing to cover all care home residents and staff. </p> <p>\u201cAs I said at the time, expanding the testing in care homes can reduce the spread of Covid-19 among our most vulnerable and incredible staff. </p> <p>\u201cIt is about time that my calls have been answered by the Welsh government, but it is shameful that the expansion could not have been implemented sooner given that capacity in testing is increasing.\u201d </p> <p>Plaid\u2019s Delyth Jewell added: \u201cThis is a long-awaited recognition of what we have consistently argued for. </p> <p>\u201cThe tragic cases of Covid-19 in care homes and its prevalence within them should have been a wakeup call for the Welsh government that testing everyone was a necessary life-saving step.

      "bodyText": "Everyone in care homes in Wales will be able to get a coronavirus test, the Welsh government has said. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the change follows the latest scientific advice and brings Wales in line with England. The move means every care home in Wales will have access to testing and be able to order online kits for residents and staff. It comes as opposition politicians said the original decision not to test all residents and staff in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry. Previously, only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community. Gething said: \u201cHow we tackle coronavirus continually changes as we receive more emerging evidence and scientific advice. We have been very clear in our approach that our strategy is about reducing harm first and we will adapt policies in order to do this. \u201cToday is a step change in how we will be testing in care homes, adapting our policy so that every resident and member of staff can be tested for coronavirus. I hope this brings further reassurance to those living and working in care homes and their families.\u201d Testing in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all care home residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms since the end of April. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said at the time there was not a \u201cclinical value\u201d in testing everyone where no one was displaying symptoms. The Office for National Statistics said there were 532 deaths up to 1 May involving Covid-19 among care home residents in Wales. This was the lowest regional total across England and Wales. Janet Finch-Saunders, the shadow minister for social care, said: \u201cCare homes have some of society\u2019s most vulnerable and for that reason I have been urging the Welsh government for weeks to extend coronavirus testing to cover all care home residents and staff. \u201cAs I said at the time, expanding the testing in care homes can reduce the spread of Covid-19 among our most vulnerable and incredible staff. \u201cIt is about time that my calls have been answered by the Welsh government, but it is shameful that the expansion could not have been implemented sooner given that capacity in testing is increasing.\u201d Plaid\u2019s Delyth Jewell added: \u201cThis is a long-awaited recognition of what we have consistently argued for. \u201cThe tragic cases of Covid-19 in care homes and its prevalence within them should have been a wakeup call for the Welsh government that testing everyone was a necessary life-saving step. The refusal to do so up to now should be the subject of examination in the future inquiry.\u201d On Friday, the first minister announced Wales\u2019 plan to exit the coronavirus lockdown. The 20-page document has been described as a \u201ctraffic light roadmap\u201d, and details what restrictions will be eased through three stages \u2013 red, amber and green. Each of the stages will see a \u201ccautious\u201d lifting of measures that apply to schools, businesses and general freedoms. Unlike in England, the Welsh government has decided not to give any dates for when the country could expect the changes.

      "body": "<p>I must have walked by the shop in question hundreds of times in the years I\u2019ve lived here, and it has never looked anything other than utterly unprepossessing, all Cillit Bang and slightly dusty green peppers. But the queue at the greengrocer, marked out by the taped lines we\u2019ve all come to know so well, was more than usually long, and so it was that the other day I finally went in. I saw the fresh coriander straightaway, and grabbed it. But then I spied something else, even more lusted after: fresh naans as big as satellite dishes; Middle Eastern flatbreads as long and as soft as linen table runners. Treasure. I gathered up bags of each, paid, and went home feeling thrilled: another discovery made.</p> <p>Has this happened to you? During the lockdown, my mind maps have completely changed. I walk for an hour each day, usually at about 5pm, always heading east from my front door, which is less leafy than in other directions, but vastly more interesting: mosques nestling up to baptist chapels; plaques dedicated to long forgotten aldermen; terraced houses that seem to come in one of only two states (peeling like psoriasis, or fully Farrow &amp; Ball-ed). Sometimes, I\u2019m not after any shopping, and on those occasions I just take it all in, my eyes working to peel back the layers of the city. Often, though, I am in need of something, even if I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2013 and these perambulations are even more satisfying. I go in for tea bags or rice, and come out bearing halva, or a paper bag of the loquats, golden and mottled, that I loved in my Jaffa childhood. The other day, standing in a corner shop that seemed to specialise mostly in tortilla chips, I found a box of pink wafers. I\u2019d forgotten all about pink wafers! Reader, I bought them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pluck of  restaurants  selling dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch lifts the heart</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>City walking is mournful, of course. It tears at the heart, the sight of beloved pubs, now closed, that you only wish you\u2019d used more. Will they ever reopen? How are their staff doing? In one, a boozer of which I\u2019m particularly fond, even now a huge bowl of lemons still stands hopefully on the bar. And then there are the restaurants, shuttered and silent. Sometimes, I stop and read their menus, a rite that feels increasingly strange and melancholy. One warm afternoon, I turned a corner to be greeted by the sight of a hitherto unknown ice-cream parlour. The moment, seconds later, when I realised that its discovery would make no material difference to my life \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 was, I can tell you, heavy indeed. (Did they sell pistachio and raspberry ripple? Peering in, I could not tell.)</p> <p>But there are moments of intense gladness, too. When the young Italian guys at the end of our street reopened their pizzeria for takeaway, happiness rose inside me, the sound of their shouting and laughter every bit as much of a tonic as the prospect of a napoletana. The pluck of the restaurants that are selling their dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch straight onto the street lifts the heart. \u201cWe are still here and baking,\u201d says the hand-written sign in the window of our local patisserie, and it does us so much good, on a Saturday, to buy croissants there \u2013 and, when available, a tarte tropezienne. (The cream-filled, orange-flower-scented brioche which, having been named by <a href=\"theguardian.com/film/2017/aug/20/brigitte-bardot-viva-maria-louis-malle-frozen-in-time\">Brigitte Bardot</a> when she was in St Tropez filming <em>And God Created Woman</em> - its inventor, a Polish baker called Alexandre Micka, was hired by Roger Vadim to cater for the crew - allows me briefly to slip into my swimming costume and a little Ambre Solaire, albeit only in my mind.)</p> <p>So, I walk and I walk. I am a tramper, a <em>flaneuse</em> with a rucksack and a half-memorised recipe scrolling through my mind. If I\u2019m lucky, when I get home, my neighbour Julia will have left on our doorstep one of her own fine loaves, or perhaps a wedge of victoria sponge cake. I\u2019m always hungry by this point, and I\u2019m usually much happier than when I left, too. I eat the first slice standing up, my purchases on the kitchen counter promising a future that I hope very much will come sooner rather than later.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I must have walked by the shop in question hundreds of times in the years I\u2019ve lived here, and it has never looked anything other than utterly unprepossessing, all Cillit Bang and slightly dusty green peppers. But the queue at the greengrocer, marked out by the taped lines we\u2019ve all come to know so well, was more than usually long, and so it was that the other day I finally went in. I saw the fresh coriander straightaway, and grabbed it. But then I spied something else, even more lusted after: fresh naans as big as satellite dishes; Middle Eastern flatbreads as long and as soft as linen table runners. Treasure. I gathered up bags of each, paid, and went home feeling thrilled: another discovery made. Has this happened to you? During the lockdown, my mind maps have completely changed. I walk for an hour each day, usually at about 5pm, always heading east from my front door, which is less leafy than in other directions, but vastly more interesting: mosques nestling up to baptist chapels; plaques dedicated to long forgotten aldermen; terraced houses that seem to come in one of only two states (peeling like psoriasis, or fully Farrow &amp; Ball-ed). Sometimes, I\u2019m not after any shopping, and on those occasions I just take it all in, my eyes working to peel back the layers of the city. Often, though, I am in need of something, even if I don\u2019t know exactly what \u2013 and these perambulations are even more satisfying. I go in for tea bags or rice, and come out bearing halva, or a paper bag of the loquats, golden and mottled, that I loved in my Jaffa childhood. The other day, standing in a corner shop that seemed to specialise mostly in tortilla chips, I found a box of pink wafers. I\u2019d forgotten all about pink wafers! Reader, I bought them. City walking is mournful, of course. It tears at the heart, the sight of beloved pubs, now closed, that you only wish you\u2019d used more. Will they ever reopen? How are their staff doing? In one, a boozer of which I\u2019m particularly fond, even now a huge bowl of lemons still stands hopefully on the bar. And then there are the restaurants, shuttered and silent. Sometimes, I stop and read their menus, a rite that feels increasingly strange and melancholy. One warm afternoon, I turned a corner to be greeted by the sight of a hitherto unknown ice-cream parlour. The moment, seconds later, when I realised that its discovery would make no material difference to my life \u2013 at least for the time being \u2013 was, I can tell you, heavy indeed. (Did they sell pistachio and raspberry ripple? Peering in, I could not tell.) But there are moments of intense gladness, too. When the young Italian guys at the end of our street reopened their pizzeria for takeaway, happiness rose inside me, the sound of their shouting and laughter every bit as much of a tonic as the prospect of a napoletana. The pluck of the restaurants that are selling their dishes through a hastily fashioned serving hatch straight onto the street lifts the heart. \u201cWe are still here and baking,\u201d says the hand-written sign in the window of our local patisserie, and it does us so much good, on a Saturday, to buy croissants there \u2013 and, when available, a tarte tropezienne. (The cream-filled, orange-flower-scented brioche which, having been named by Brigitte Bardot when she was in St Tropez filming And God Created Woman - its inventor, a Polish baker called Alexandre Micka, was hired by Roger Vadim to cater for the crew - allows me briefly to slip into my swimming costume and a little Ambre Solaire, albeit only in my mind.) So, I walk and I walk. I am a tramper, a flaneuse with a rucksack and a half-memorised recipe scrolling through my mind. If I\u2019m lucky, when I get home, my neighbour Julia will have left on our doorstep one of her own fine loaves, or perhaps a wedge of victoria sponge cake. I\u2019m always hungry by this point, and I\u2019m usually much happier than when I left, too. I eat the first slice standing up, my purchases on the kitchen counter promising a future that I hope very much will come sooner rather than later.",

Her mother rarely speaks of the past, she added. \u201cShe says it\u2019s better not to think about these things, you have to keep looking forward. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s lived so long.\u201d Branyas was instead happier to outline the changes she hoped her 13 great-grandchildren would see in their lives. \u201cA change in values, one that prioritises education, health and research,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd fewer weapons and far less spending on so many politicians.\u201d She laughed off a question over what comes next after fighting off the coronavirus. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll live,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil God wants.\u201d",

Millions of migrant labourers have been stranded without employment, and dozens have died trying to get home.</p> \n<p><strong>Russia</strong> recorded its highest daily toll from the disease on Saturday, with 119 deaths, but says overall cases are falling, and is pushing ahead with plans to start lifting the lockdown from next week.</p> \n<p>In <strong>Brazil</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/brazil-health-minister-nelson-teich-resigns\">the health minister</a> offered his resignation over the ballooning crisis, after less than a month on the job and a day after president Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand the unproven use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients.</p> \n<p>Brazil now has its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/brazil-health-minister-nelson-teich-resigns\">third health minister in three months</a> as Bolsonaro continues to ignore expert advice.

At least five children have died from the condition, which has hallmarks of a rare disease known as Kawasaki syndrome.</p> \n<p>The most recently announced death from this inflammatory syndrome <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/french-boy-dies-from-coronavirus-linked-kawasaki-diseae\">was that of a nine-year-old boy in </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/french-boy-dies-from-coronavirus-linked-kawasaki-diseae\">France</a></strong>. Doctors said he had developed a form of coronavirus but had no symptoms, and medics initially thought he had scarlet fever. He died on 8 May, six days after being admitted to intensive care.</p> \n<p>Despite the high toll of the coronavirus, and as new discoveries continue to emerge about its nature and impact, there are protests over the weekend in several countries, including the UK and Germany, by small groups who oppose the lockdown measures.</p> \n<p>In the <strong>US</strong>, the worst affected country in terms of both infections and deaths, the toll is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, the CDC director, Robert Redfield, has said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>President Donald Trump has announced details of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">\u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine</a> by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. Standing behind Trump, Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert, wore a face mask and cast his glance down and reached to adjust his tie as the president spoke. Trump did not wear a face mask.</p> \n<p>The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill pushed for by Democrats to battle the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republicans who control the Senate have vowed to block the bill, though some support its provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.</p> \n<p>Trump also suggested on Saturday his administration might resume some payments to the World Health Organization, which he has frozen after accusing the body of promoting Chinese \u201cdisinformation\u201d. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open.</p> \n<p>One draft would see the US return to paying only 10% of its former contributions, matching China\u2019s assessed contribution.</p> \n<p>In other developments:</p> \n<p>In <strong>Australia</strong>, as coronavirus restrictions begin to ease, people have started venturing back to weekend activities such as dining out, going to beauty salons and attending birthday parties, while observing social distancing rules.</p> \n<p><strong>China </strong>has increased pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday; Taiwan\u2019s attendance and a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.</p> \n<p>As <strong>Mexico</strong> moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations on Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with more than 2,000 new cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Beaches across Europe began reopening in time for an early heatwave, as several countries inched out of coronavirus lockdown, and the continent prepared for the first major league football matches in over a month. The games played in Germany\u2019s Bundesliga will be held in empty stadiums, with tight controls including a ban on handshaking between players. Other opening measures for travel, commerce and tourism are all tentative, with governments ready to bring back tight controls if signs of a second wave of infections appear. The World Health Organization has warned countries ending lockdown that now should be a \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d, to avoid a deadly winter surge in new infections. But the changes suggest there are hopes of rescuing the summer tourism season, at least for travellers coming from countries that have had some success suppressing the virus. Italy will allow international travel from 3 June, and Greece has said it hopes to open up to foreign tourists again from July. Austria\u2019s borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary will fully reopen on 15 June, the interior ministry said on Saturday, following a previously coordinated step to fully remove barriers on travel between Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Restrictions remain in place for transit from Italy. Elsewhere the battle against Covid-19 continues, with infections in India rising past China\u2019s total, and the government expected to extend its strict lockdown despite the heavy human and economic cost. Millions of migrant labourers have been stranded without employment, and dozens have died trying to get home. Russia recorded its highest daily toll from the disease on Saturday, with 119 deaths, but says overall cases are falling, and is pushing ahead with plans to start lifting the lockdown from next week. In Brazil the health minister offered his resignation over the ballooning crisis, after less than a month on the job and a day after president Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand the unproven use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients. Brazil now has its third health minister in three months as Bolsonaro continues to ignore expert advice. It has had over 200,000 cases, and 14,000 deaths. Worldwide the disease has now infected over 4.5 million people and killed over 300,000; both tolls are likely to be underestimates because of shortages of testing. Although the disease affects older people more severely, Europe and the US have seen sharp surges in recent weeks of a rare but severe immune disorder in children linked to Covid-19. At least five children have died from the condition, which has hallmarks of a rare disease known as Kawasaki syndrome. The most recently announced death from this inflammatory syndrome was that of a nine-year-old boy in France. Doctors said he had developed a form of coronavirus but had no symptoms, and medics initially thought he had scarlet fever. He died on 8 May, six days after being admitted to intensive care. Despite the high toll of the coronavirus, and as new discoveries continue to emerge about its nature and impact, there are protests over the weekend in several countries, including the UK and Germany, by small groups who oppose the lockdown measures. In the US, the worst affected country in terms of both infections and deaths, the toll is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, the CDC director, Robert Redfield, has said. President Donald Trump has announced details of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. Standing behind Trump, Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert, wore a face mask and cast his glance down and reached to adjust his tie as the president spoke. Trump did not wear a face mask. The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill pushed for by Democrats to battle the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republicans who control the Senate have vowed to block the bill, though some support its provisions aimed at helping state and local governments. Trump also suggested on Saturday his administration might resume some payments to the World Health Organization, which he has frozen after accusing the body of promoting Chinese \u201cdisinformation\u201d. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open. One draft would see the US return to paying only 10% of its former contributions, matching China\u2019s assessed contribution. In other developments: In Australia, as coronavirus restrictions begin to ease, people have started venturing back to weekend activities such as dining out, going to beauty salons and attending birthday parties, while observing social distancing rules. China has increased pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China. The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday; Taiwan\u2019s attendance and a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations on Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with more than 2,000 new cases.",

Several places including Margate, the Peak District and the Lake District reiterated that people should not visit.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pregnant BAME women are four times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 than white women, a study found.</strong> More than half (55%) of women admitted to hospital with coronavirus were from a BAME background, prompting experts to issue guidance for midwives to remain on high alert and lower the threshold for diagnosis by medical professionals for BAME women.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side for the day.

And last night the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\"><strong>British Medical Association</strong> backed the teaching unions\u2019 opposition to phased reopening</a> from 1 June, saying it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d for the unions to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening.</p> \n  <p>The BMA council\u2019s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in a letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK.<br></p> \n   <p>Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools\">BMA backs teaching unions' opposition to schools reopening</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>It comes after the revelation on Friday that the UK\u2019s R number (reproduction rate) had risen in the past week to between 0.7 and 1. That is dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave of infections. The data is subject to a several week long lag, there are are regional differences and the increase could also reflect what is happening in hospitals and care homes, but it has brought the government\u2019s easing of lockdown measures in England into question. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n    <div>\n     <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n      <p></p>\n      <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread.

      "bodyText": "Pupils in years 10 and 12 will be prioritised in the phased reopening of schools in England early next month, Gavin Williamson said. The education secretary said that along with plans to get reception, year 1 and year 6 children in school from 1 June they also want pupils who were preparing for GCSE and A-level exams to have face-to-face time with their teachers. Ministers and unions were told to \u201cstop squabbling and agree a plan\u201d for safely reopening schools by the children\u2019s commissioner for England. Several local authorities have said they won\u2019t reopen schools on 1 June and the British Medical Association backed teaching unions in saying schools shouldn\u2019t reopen until infection numbers are \u201cmuch lower\u201d. All care home residents and staff in Wales are to be offered coronavirus tests, the Welsh government announced. The move brings Wales into line with England and is a marked change in Welsh policy, where previously only the symptomatic were able to get tested. The public were told to stay away after several English beauty spots became busy in the first weekend since lockdown measures were eased in England. National parks and local authorities had earlier warned people to \u201cthink carefully\u201d before visiting beauty spots to avoid putting themselves and others at risk if physical distancing became impossible. Several places including Margate, the Peak District and the Lake District reiterated that people should not visit. Pregnant BAME women are four times more likely to be hospitalised with Covid-19 than white women, a study found. More than half (55%) of women admitted to hospital with coronavirus were from a BAME background, prompting experts to issue guidance for midwives to remain on high alert and lower the threshold for diagnosis by medical professionals for BAME women. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side for the day. Thank you to everybody who has been in touch throughout the day to share insight with me and to all of you for reading along. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. And that\u2019s it, the press conference is over. Q. How will women (who make up most primary school teachers) go back to work if there\u2019s no childcare available? Williamson says teachers are critical workers, so all have access to education provision for their children. Q. Why will pupils be allowed to take their own lunch boxes to school but not their own pencil cases - what\u2019s the difference? Harries says the basic public health principle is to keep everything as clean as possible. Lunch boxes are quite personal to the child it belongs to and when you\u2019re eating you put your hands to your food and face, she says. It\u2019s important that both are kept as clean as possible and good hygiene is practised. Q. Are you worried that union leaders who don\u2019t wish to return to school on 1 June don\u2019t understand that the most disadvantaged children are suffering most from not being at school or that they\u2019re prepared to sacrifice that? Williamson says every teacher he has spoken to understands this. He wants to talk to representative organisations and work with them on this, he says. Q. So are you saying teachers don\u2019t agree with what their union leaders are saying? Do you want them to ignore them? Williamson says teachers have been heroes and thanks them. Q. How will you ensure that children in special schools and vulnerable children won\u2019t get left behind? Williamson says education is the greatest leveller. Different initiatives are being looked at, he says. Q. Given teachers\u2019 concerns about schools reopening in June, would you consider starting the next school year in early August? Williamson says there are currently no plans to start the new school year in early August. Q. Why are year 6 pupils going back ahead of year 5 who are getting ready to sit their SATs? Williamson says one of the reasons year 6 was chosen is because it is a key transition year for children getting ready to go into secondary school. Q. Is it the case that children in reception and year 1 won\u2019t be expected to socially distance? Williamson says schools won\u2019t be brought back without meeting the five tests. Harries says good respiratory and hand hygiene is very important and measures like spacing desks apart can help reduce the risk of infection. Q. What are you going to do to ensure better national coordination and support for children who won\u2019t be going back to school for many months to ease the burden on individual teachers and parents? Williamson says there\u2019s no substitute for being in school, but they\u2019re looking at a package of measures. Q. The R estimate has been revised upwards. Can you guarantee reopening schools in this way won\u2019t result in a significant increase in the R number? Q. What\u2019s the R value at which you consider reversing the new strategy? Williamson says Sage has looked at different models to see which would have the least impact on the R value. Harries says 0.7-1 is a broad range below 1. It\u2019s derived from a broad consensus of modellers. It has gone up using that consensus model, but there are several different R rates, she says. There is an R value for the community, which informs ONS data, there\u2019s one for care homes and there\u2019s one for hospitals too. We need to understand what the drivers in each of these areas are to determine where hotspots are, she says. They are taking questions from the media now. Q. The British Medical Association says cases aren\u2019t dropping fast enough to reopen schools. Will you ignore the UK\u2019s doctors if that\u2019s still their view in June? Williamson says they recognise the important role of schools in a child\u2019s life. When there is advice that there is an opportunity to reopen schools in a \u201csafe\u201d and \u201ccontrolled\u201d way, we should be doing that, he says. Harries says Sage has input from a huge number of doctors when doing their modelling, and this has gone into their advice about schools. It\u2019s important if other medical groups share anything they think has been missed with the government, she says. We know now that children rarely get as ill as the older population with Covid-19, she says. Evidence is still growing but there is some to suggest they\u2019re also less likely to pass it on, she says. We need to track cases now they\u2019re going down, but the latest ONS data suggested one in 400 people were infected. In two weeks it will be half that rate, she says. So parents should not think every school will be swarming with cases. Q. Where local councils are telling schools they don\u2019t have to open, should school governors be listening to them or to you? Williamson says caution is at the heart of the government\u2019s approach. Lee from Maidstone asked if people with diabetes should be added to the shielded list, given that the NHS confirmed that more than 25% of people who have died in hospital of Covid-19 were diabetic. Harries says this data looks at specific diseases without necessarily looking at other risk factors these individuals had, such as obesity or cardiovascular disease. The variables need to be looked at together to better determine risk, she says. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Lindsay from Gateshead, which has the highest infection rate in the country, asks why the government isn\u2019t taking a regional approach to reopening schools, given the differences in infection rates across the UK. Williamson says he wants every child to have the opportunity to come back to school, but this will be done \u201cin a cautious way\u201d. If there are concerns about the rate of infection, we will look at that, he says. Harries says that in most communities the R number is likely to be significantly lower than the national R number. Dr Jenny Harries is going through the daily slides now. Transport use is consistently low, though there is a slight rise in the use of cars and light goods vehicles as people begin to go back to work, she says. There has been a sustained increase in testing, she says. There is a \u201cslow and steady\u201d downward trend in hospital admissions for Covid-19 across the four nations. The seven-day rolling average for daily deaths is also coming down, she says. This is in line with what other European countries are doing to get their schools, nurseries and colleges back, he says. Some pupils will be asked to return to school next month. Reducing class sizes, keeping children in small groups, will create a \u201cprotective, small bubble around them\u201d, Williamson says. He says schools will be rigorous about hygiene and hand washing. School staff can already be tested for the virus. From 1 June this will be extended to cover school children and their families if any of them develop symptoms, he says. Track and trace methods would then be used to prevent further spread. The poorest, most disadvantaged children will be the ones who will fall furthest behind if schools remain closed, Williamson says. The education secretary turns to wider plans for reopening of schools. He says he is sorry to all children who were preparing for GCSE and A-level exams. It\u2019s now been eight weeks since schools closed to most pupils, he says, thanking workers who kept them open for the children of critical workers. The government will only reopen schools when the five tests are met, he says. But children do need to be back in school. We can start planning for some pupils to return as early as next month, he says. If rates of infection are decreasing, this will give us the green light to get some children back into school, he says. Reception, year 1 and year 6 will be allowed to return with smaller class sizes, along with students in years 10 and 12 on a limited basis to have face-to-face time with their teachers. These children are being prioritised because they stand to lose more by missing school, he says. Williamson is speaking now. He is going through the daily figures on testing, positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths. This information can be found here. The education secretary Gavin Williamson will front today\u2019s daily government news briefing, due to begin shortly. He will be joined by the deputy chief medical officer for England, Dr Jenny Harries. All residents and members of staff in care homes in Wales will be able to get a coronavirus test, the Welsh government has said. The health minister, Vaughan Gething, said the change follows the latest scientific advice and brings Wales into line with England. Opposition politicians said the original decision not to test everyone in care homes should be the subject of a future inquiry. From now, every care home in Wales will have access to testing and will be able to order online testing kits for their residents and staff. Previously only residents and staff in care homes with confirmed cases of coronavirus were tested, as were homes with more than 50 beds, anyone being discharged from hospital into a care home, or anyone moving into a care home from the community. Gething said: Today is a step change in how we will be testing in care homes, adapting our policy so that every resident and member of staff can be tested for coronavirus. I hope this brings further reassurance to those living and working in care homes and their families. Testing in Wales had been more restrictive than in England, where all care home residents and staff have been eligible for testing regardless of symptoms since the end of April. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said at the time there was not a \u201cclinical value\u201d in testing everyone where no one was displaying symptoms. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Delyth Jewell said: This is a long-awaited recognition of what we have consistently argued for. The tragic cases of Covid-19 in care homes and its prevalence within them should have been a wake-up call for the Welsh government that testing everyone was a necessary life-saving step. The refusal to do so up to now should be the subject of examination in the future inquiry. While it is a welcome change of approach, ministers must now publish the advice which informed the previous policy of not testing in every care home and how it has now changed. A further 468 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, taking the total across all settings in the UK to 34,466, the DHSC said. A new \u201chome-school\u201d competition for children and young people has been launched to explore black British history and multicultural Britain. The competition, sponsored by the National Education Union (NEU), is part of the 100 Great Black Britons campaign created by Patrick Vernon to celebrate the continued legacy and achievements of black people in Britain. Kevin Courtney, NEU joint general secretary, said: The current crisis has highlighted the centrality of black people in Britain, to the NHS and care work, transport systems, food supplies, utilities, research, education and so much more. Arike Oke, managing director of Black Cultural Archives, said: Black history in Britain goes as far back as it\u2019s possible to go. Children growing up in modern Britain should know their true history, and whether they are Black, brown or white, Black history is part our of national story. Lavinya Stennett, founder of Black Curriculum, said: Black history is vital for every young persons' development and understanding of their identity and the world around them. To become fully rounded people, it is important that all young people are given meaningful access to a full version of history. A senior British Transport Police officer has been criticised after travelling from Glasgow to his family home in Yorkshire during the lockdown. BTP has confirmed Ch Supt Eddie Wylie returned to Yorkshire from his rented flat in Glasgow on two occasions between 21 March and 13 May, but claimed he did not breach Covid-19 regulations \u2013 after the UK went into lockdown on 23 March. It said that on both occasions he travelled home alone and by car to minimise any possible exposure to others. In a statement, BTP said: British Transport Police is a national police force with its headquarters in London, and as such our officers are required to regularly travel across England, Scotland and Wales for essential meetings or as operationally required. In these instances, Ch Supt Wylie will stay at whichever address is the most convenient. Our officers can be posted anywhere in the UK, at any time. This means it is not unusual for them to have their family home in one part of the country and rent other accommodation nearer to where they are currently stationed. Crucially, the restrictions state that people should only leave the place they are living if they have a reasonable excuse. This includes travelling for the purposes of work where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from the place they are living. It would not be reasonably possible for Chief Superintendent Wylie to perform his role solely from either the Glasgow address, or his home in Yorkshire. However, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: British Transport Police officers are currently playing a crucial role as guardians of the lockdown. Alongside the Scottish Government and Police Scotland, the BTP\u2019s message to the people of Scotland has rightly been to stay at home, and avoid any unnecessary travel. People across Scotland and the whole UK have made huge sacrifices during this time, including missing family funerals and spending precious time away from their loved ones. But it seems as if the BTP\u2019s top officer in Scotland has failed to learn the lessons of the Catherine Calderwood debacle, and believes there is one rule for him, and one rule for the rest of us. This could have serious consequences for the BTP\u2019s ability to police the lockdown, which could in turn endanger public safety in Scotland. Eddie Wylie has serious questions to answer. NHS England has announced 181 more deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths in hospitals in England to 24,527. Of the 181 new deaths announced today: - 39 occurred on 15 May - 89 occurred on 14 May - 22 occurred on 13 May The figures also show 23 of the new deaths took place between 3-12 May. The remaining eight deaths occurred in April, the earliest being on 4 April. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The latest NHS England figures show 8 April continues to have the deadliest day of the outbreak so far, with a current total of 889. The number of people who have died after being tested positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to 473 after a further four deaths were reported by the Department of Health. Another 40 positive cases of Covid-19 were confirmed, taking the total since the outbreak began to 4,357. The DoH dashboard is here: A total of 2,094 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, a rise of 41 from 2,053 on Friday, according to the latest Scottish government statistics. The number of people to have tested positive for the virus rose to 14,447, up 187 from 14,260 the day before. There are 59 patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in intensive care, down from 71 on Friday, of whom 49 have tested positive. There are 1,416 people in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, a decrease of 33. People have been told to stay away from Loch Lomond thousands of people breached lockdown rules around the beauty spot in recent weeks, my colleagues Severin Carrell and Libby Brooks report. Police data shows breaches have increased at weekends and on sunny days. The district, which includes the villages of Balloch and Luss on the banks of the loch, has had the highest number of lockdown breaches of any in Scotland. Police ordered 2,291 people to go home in 30 days. A further 18 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,191, health officials said. Public Health Wales said another 183 people had tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 12,142. Spokesman Dr Chris Williams said: Public Health Wales welcomes the announcement yesterday by the first minister of the traffic light road map which sets out how Wales could exit the coronavirus lockdown. In conjunction with the Welsh government\u2019s \u2018Test, Trace, Protect\u2019 strategy published earlier in the week, Public Health Wales will continue to work in partnership with our communities, the Welsh government, the wider NHS and local government in Wales to focus on protecting the health of the people of Wales as we support the implementation of the strategy. Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour leader, has been led away in handcuffs after arriving at Hyde Park with a megaphone and espousing the conspiracy theory that 5G and the coronavirus pandemic are linked, calling it a \u201cpack of lies to brainwash you and keep you in order\u201d. He was detained after declining to leave when asked to by an officer and refusing to provide his details, PA Media reports. A group of about a dozen people has also gathered on Southampton Common to demonstrate against the lockdown. One protester, Dee, who did not wish to give her surname, said her job in the hair and beauty industry had been hit by the crisis. She told PA Media: I am here because I am worried about civil liberties being taken away. Reading the coronavirus act that has gone through parliament it seems there are changes being made which infringe our freedom. And I am worried the media has run away with the Covid-19 thing and blown it all out of proportion. Boris Johnson\u2019s father has said he has not noticed criticism of the prime minister\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Speaking to Ta Nea, a Greek daily newspaper, Stanley Johnson said the government\u2019s approach had been \u201con the right track\u201d. He told the paper from his home in Exmoor, south-west England: We are living in a time of great uncertainty and nobody quite knows what the impact is or what the disease is or what to do. At the moment there are no clear answers and I think we are probably on the right track. We have been taking a tough line here and we\u2019ll have to see how that goes. I didn\u2019t notice that he\u2019s received a lot of criticism. Asked about his son\u2019s own bout of coronavirus, which included a stay in intensive care, he said he \u201cfelt as any father must feel when his son is at death\u2019s door\u201d. Before strict lockdown measures were introduced, he said he would ignore his son\u2019s advice to avoid pubs. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll go to a pub if I need to go to a pub,\u201d he said. The Department of Health has said mass high-quality testing is an integral part of dealing with coronavirus after the chair of the Royal College of GPs said doctors were concerned about the government\u2019s strategy. Prof Martin Marshall said: We do not believe that there is sufficient clarity on a joined-up comprehensive testing strategy to prevent a second wave of infections and to secure the overall health of the population. As we ease lockdown over the coming weeks and months, it is essential that the profession and patients have full confidence in the approach to test, track and trace. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: High-quality testing on a mass scale is an integral part of our strategy to stop the spread of the virus and save lives. Thanks to the significant increases in capacity which we have built at pace, tens of millions of people are now eligible for tests and we have been able to prioritise our frontline health and care staff, essential workers and the most vulnerable, including in our care homes. We have also doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE labs to ensure people receive their results swiftly, with 95% of tests processed in less than 48 hours. Thousands of young people and frontline workers are turning to a text advice line for people in crisis during the coronavirus epidemic, as counsellors report a rise in anxiety caused by the lockdown. In the two months since Boris Johnson announced restrictions on normal life, an extra 6,000 people have contacted the Shout line and there has been a 10% increase in the number of people with anxiety. Shout often deals with young people in considerable distress, and suicidal feelings are the most common issue raised. Typically, two-thirds of people texting are aged under 25. The helpline, which was launched a year ago with the backing of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a \u00a33m investment from the Royal Foundation charity, reported that frontline and key workers are twice as likely as others to mention anxiety. Conversations concerning Covid-19 peaked on days where there were significant announcements, such as those about school closures and other lockdown details. Around three dozen people have gathered in Hyde Park to protest against the coronavirus lockdown and the principle of mandatory vaccinations, with at least two people led away in handcuffs so far. Standing close together near Speaker\u2019s Corner, several held placards and banners including slogans like \u201cfreedom over fear\u201d as police, including some on horseback, looked on, PA reports. David Samson, 50, who said he works in finance, said he was attending the protest because \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see in my generation the suppressing of civil rights\u201d over what he falsely described as a \u201cfake virus\u201d. A school pastoral support worker who was handcuffed by police has said misuse of stop and search powers has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, my colleagues Ben Quinn and Frances Perraudin report. Dwayne Francis, who was detained while waiting in his car for a post office to open on his way to work, said young black men\u2019s negative experiences of police use of stop and search in London had got worse during the city\u2019s lockdown. The full story is here: And the thread Francis posted on Twitter about this experience is here: The Met carried out 30,608 stops in April, up from 20,981 in April 2019 and 23,783 in March this year. The force said one-in-five led to a \u201cpositive outcome\u201d. Researchers are investigating whether dogs can be trained to identify unique odours associated with coronavirus infection, my colleague Frances Perraudin reports. Dogs are to be trained to try to sniff out the coronavirus before symptoms appear in humans, under trials launched with \u00a3500,000 of government funding. Dogs have already been successfully trained to detect the odour of certain cancers, malaria and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and a new study will look at whether labradors and cocker spaniels can be trained to detect Covid-19 in people. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will carry out the first phase of a trial in collaboration with Durham University and the charity Medical Detection Dogs. The Peak District has urged the public not to visit after its car parks filled up on the first weekend since lockdown measures were partially eased in England. The national park said the Langsett area at the north-eastern edge of the park was \u201cextremely busy\u201d on Saturday morning, making physical distancing difficult. Visitors flocked to the area despite people being asked to \u201cthink carefully\u201d before visiting national parks and beaches (see 10.15am.). Park bosses in the Peak District tweeted: With the Met Office forecasting sunny conditions, members of the public are being urged to continue observing physical distancing rules and avoid potentially contributing to crowded public spaces this weekend. Businesses in Margate have issued a \u201cdon\u2019t visit\u201d plea to discourage visitors on the first weekend since lockdown restrictions were eased in England, the Isle of Thanet News reports. The Don\u2019t Visit Margate campaign was launched on the Visit Margate website, where a letter from prominent local businesses says the area is \u201cnot ready\u201d for visitors. It reads: We love Margate. It\u2019s a beautiful place, with a kind community, and we are all happiest when we can share it with visitors. But right now, we have other things we need to do. Covid-19 is real, and here on the Isle of Thanet we have one of the highest death rates in the county. Our NHS is fragile, our local council clearly struggling, and we\u2019re not ready for visitors. So \u2013 for all of our indies, for local people, and for your own health, please stay home. Don\u2019t visit Margate. The local MP, Sir Roger Gale, also urged people not to visit and called the government\u2019s advice on limitless travel within England \u201cpremature and possibly sheer folly\u201d. In a thread on Twitter, he said it was \u201cirresponsible\u201d for people to be encouraged to visit the coast this weekend. \u201cBaby steps towards reopening\u201d are needed, he said, not \u201ca leap in the dark\u201d: Get this wrong and we could be worse than right back when we started. Get it right and we could be back in business in time for the real summer holidays. A study has found that more than half of pregnant women who were admitted to hospital with coronavirus in the UK were from a black and minority ethnic background, my colleague Aamna Mohdin reports. The \u201ctroubling data\u201d has prompted experts to issue guidance for midwives to remain on high alert and lower the threshold for diagnosis by medical professionals for BAME women. The study found that 55% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with coronavirus from 1 March to 14 April were from a BAME background. The findings show women from a BAME background were four times more likely to be hospitalised with coronavirus than white women. The study suggests that for pregnant women, being from a BAME background is a stronger predictor of the likelihood of being hospitalised with coronavirus than age and obesity. Test, track and trace is critical as a second wave is still a possibility, Sir Mark Walport, chief executive of UK Research and Innovation, has said. The former government chief scientific adviser told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: It is a combination of people being really careful about how they behave coupled with identifying cases as early and as rigorously by testing as possible, and then working out who their contacts have been and making sure that they do isolate themselves. As measures are taken to relax social distancing, they have got to be taken very, very cautiously indeed. There is no question that the prospect of a second wave does exist. That is undoubtedly the case. It will continue to exist while there are a significant number of cases out there. Meanwhile, Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the body was aware of concerns among healthcare workers about the accuracy and timing of some test results. He said: We know that the distances that tests are travelling to labs and the wait time for results is undermining confidence in the process and results themselves. Any testing strategy must therefore commit to building confidence in the process, including a commitment to improving the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. He called for GPs to be given guidance on how to help patients get tested, and asked for \u201ctransparent communication\u201d from government. The government needs to move away from an \u201carbitrary focus on numbers\u201d to a clear testing strategy to prevent a second wave of coronavirus infections, the Royal College of GPs has said. In a letter to the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, the RCGP chair, Prof Martin Marshall, said there was a lack of confidence in the government\u2019s testing strategy - including in the accuracy and timing of results. He added that while improvements have been made, a clear and comprehensive plan is needed to stop a second swell of cases. Marshall wrote: Whilst we recognise the work of government and a range of stakeholders, we do not believe that there is sufficient clarity on a joined-up comprehensive testing strategy to prevent a second wave of infections and to secure the overall health of the population. As we ease lockdown over the coming weeks and months, it is essential that the profession and patients have full confidence in the approach to test, track and trace. He said a joined-up approach is required between the NHS, social care and community care, including care homes, which he said were on the \u201cfrontlines\u201d of the pandemic, adding: In the absence of a clear strategy and with delays in social care planning, patients have been left vulnerable. I am sure you will agree that now is the time to move beyond an arbitrary focus on numbers and targets and ensure that our loved ones in vulnerable settings are given particular protection. He stressed the importance of confidence in the testing strategy from both the healthcare profession and the general public as the government moves to ease parts of the lockdown. The government also needed to clearly inform the public about the importance of test, track and trace, and other measures that will accompany the NHS Covid-19 tracking app, he said. People are being asked to \u201cthink twice\u201d before visiting national parks and beaches on the first weekend since lockdown measures were partially eased in England. With no limit on the amount of exercise allowed and how far one can travel within England for it, an estimated 15m leisure trips will be made by car in the UK this weekend, an RCA survey indicates. And with sunny weather predicted, the County Councils Network is urging people to stay local, warning that some facilities remain closed and places may be forced to close again if overcrowding makes physical distancing impossible. National parks including the Lake District and the Peak District have told travellers to stay away for the sake of the communities that live there and to avoid straining the emergency services. Cornwall council also warned people to think twice before going into the sea this weekend as there won\u2019t be any lifeguards on duty. This, from BBC Breakfast, gives the perspective of many in seaside towns. Good morning. Ministers and teaching unions should \u201cstop squabbling and agree a plan\u201d for the reopening of schools in England, the children\u2019s commissioner for England has said. Anne Longfield said schools needed to reopen \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d because many disadvantaged pupils were losing out as a result of schools being closed for so long. Teachers\u2019 leaders met the government\u2019s scientific advisers on Friday, but no agreement was reached on how to open schools safely. And last night the British Medical Association backed the teaching unions\u2019 opposition to phased reopening from 1 June, saying it was \u201cabsolutely right\u201d for the unions to urge caution and prioritise testing before reopening. The BMA council\u2019s chair, Chaand Nagpaul, said in a letter to his NEU counterpart, Kevin Courtney: We cannot risk a second spike or take actions which would increase the spread of this virus, particularly as we see sustained rates of infection across the UK. Until we have got case numbers much lower, we should not consider reopening schools. It comes after the revelation on Friday that the UK\u2019s R number (reproduction rate) had risen in the past week to between 0.7 and 1. That is dangerously close to levels that could bring a second wave of infections. The data is subject to a several week long lag, there are are regional differences and the increase could also reflect what is happening in hospitals and care homes, but it has brought the government\u2019s easing of lockdown measures in England into question. Some local authorities, including Liverpool city council and Hartlepool borough council, have already challenged the government\u2019s timetable amid fears that 1 June is too early to guarantee it will be safe. However, the Times (paywall) reports that the heads of four primary school chains are preparing to defy the teaching unions and back the government\u2019s plans to reopen to some pupils next month. Schools in Wales will not be going back on 1 June and it is not expected that schools in Scotland or Northern Ireland will go back before the summer holidays begin.

      "body": "<p>The most shocking feature of the lockdown is not that it is fraying but that it has held at all. If you had listened to rightwing moralists, you would never have believed collective self-discipline was possible. For decades, they have lamented the decline in deference. In her first speech as leader of Conservative party, Margaret Thatcher saw liberal leftists as rats who \u201c<a href=\"https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/102777\">gnaw away at our national self-respect</a>\u201d. By debunking the glories of British history, and undermining religious and educational standards, they were turning the British into a rootless mob unable to act in its own or the national interest.</p> <p>Leftwing moralists reached the same conclusion but took a different road to hell. Capitalism turned citizens into consumers, who thought only of themselves. \u201cA market society automatically carries with it an undermining of solidarity,\u201d <a href=\"https://noam-chomsky.tumblr.com/post/68780384732/even-trying-to-stimulate-consumerism-is-an-effort\">declared</a> Noam Chomsky. It generates selfish individualists, unable to stick together.

If you had listened to rightwing moralists, you would never have believed collective self-discipline was possible. For decades, they have lamented the decline in deference. In her first speech as leader of Conservative party, Margaret Thatcher saw liberal leftists as rats who \u201cgnaw away at our national self-respect\u201d. By debunking the glories of British history, and undermining religious and educational standards, they were turning the British into a rootless mob unable to act in its own or the national interest. Leftwing moralists reached the same conclusion but took a different road to hell. Capitalism turned citizens into consumers, who thought only of themselves. \u201cA market society automatically carries with it an undermining of solidarity,\u201d declared Noam Chomsky. It generates selfish individualists, unable to stick together. In our day, liberals have explained away Brexit, Trump and populism by citing the willingness of tens of millions to listen to idiot demagogues rather than the educated. And yet here we are, shorn of most traditional beliefs, the undoubted products of consumer capitalism, and still more or less sticking together and obeying the medical elite.

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s plan to stage international cricket this summer involves hiving off players from contact with other personnel at the ground and forming exclusive \u201ccontact clusters\u201d to reduce the risk of Covid-19 sweeping through the camp. Under detailed plans seen by the Observer, the proposed series against West Indies and Pakistan in July and August will be staged behind closed doors at \u201cbio-secure\u201d venues that are split into zones, with movement between these kept to a minimum. Players and support staff will make up what is known as a \u201cfunctional area\u201d \u2013 one of a number of such groups working on site \u2013 and have the option to create smaller social pods within this called \u201ccontact clusters\u201d that allow individuals to further relax in the company of others who have committed to it. It means, as well as regular testing for coronavirus and daily screening for symptoms, the enlarged 30-man squads will need to stay mindful of how they move around and interact with others during an extended spell living at either the Ageas Bowl or Old Trafford, the two Test grounds with hotels on site. Such extreme lengths to put on matches highlights the desperate need to get cricket on screens this summer and prevent the England and Wales Cricket Board suffering a devastating financial loss. But there is growing optimism the two sets of Test tourists are willing to make the journey and put their players in such extreme lockdown conditions. Further talks with Cricket West Indies are due to take place on Monday, while an initial conference call with the Pakistan board on Friday, which included the head coaches Misbah-ul-Haq and Chris Silverwood, has reportedly resulted in Pakistan committing to three Tests and three Twenty20 matches. Drafted by the ECB\u2019s science and medicine team, an introductory outline was circulated to the counties last week explaining the process for the return of professional cricket that, from Wednesday, will see the first of 30 England players behin individual training under phase one. But it also lays out the principles of how a bio-secure venue may operate on match day. After phase two, where training is permitted to take place in small groups, players and support staff from both sides would enter an \u201cisland site\u201d \u2013 a cricket ground with a hotel \u2013 for phase three and, following initial testing for coronavirus, they will then live and train on site but only within strictly designated zones. Ashley Giles, England\u2019s cricket director, has confirmed they are looking at ways England\u2019s players can leave and re-enter the so-called \u201cbubble\u201d given a block of nine weeks away from friends and family that covers preparation time, practice games and the six proposed Tests, starting at Hampshire\u2019s Ageas Bowl on 8 July. However when the squad is together in the ground and part of a regular testing and screening programme it forms a \u201cfunctional area\u201d, one of a number of separate personnel groups that also include venue staff, the ECB events team, groundstaff, broadcasters/media and match officials within an overall headcount of around 300. These FAs must each stick to their designated zones within the hotel and stadium and though two such groups may find themselves down to operate in the same zone at times \u2013 for example players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match \u2013 contact between them must be kept to an absolute minimum. The system is designed to create clearly defined distance between FAs and, in theory, prevent the spread of Covid-19 should it penetrate the ground. Perhaps the most intriguing element of the plan is the concept of \u201ccontact clusters\u201d, where individuals within an FA group can create their own exclusive sub-group. The principle here is that individuals within a \u201ccontact cluster\u201d avoid anything but essential contact with those outside of it and so can be more comfortable within what is called \u201ca circle of trust\u201d. How this applies to the social dynamics of two playing squads that will both be up to 30 cricketers-strong remains to be seen. Schematics for the grounds detail the various zones and there will be signposted one-way systems to navigate on foot. Personnel will also be urged to sanitise hands at entry points to communal areas and use alternative methods of communication, such as telephone calls or video conferencing, where possible. While the introductory document states an intention to create isolation areas for individuals who become ill, as well as exit strategies and contact tracing, a full medical protocol for how a possible outbreak may be tackled has not yet been shared and will be crucial to receiving sign-off from the government. England\u2019s players have had a number of the details above explained to them already \u2013 one told the Observer it was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d \u2013 but much will hinge on convincing West Indies, the first set of tourists, they will be safe to leave the relatively untouched Caribbean to fly to one of the pandemic\u2019s hotspots. Giles has already admitted the plans have a number of \u201cpinch points\u201d that need fully ironing out before they can be put back to the government, while the International Cricket Council is yet to rule on whether players who have passed testing can still apply saliva to the ball and, if not, permit some form of legalised ball tampering. The bill for creating these bio-secure venues and flying two touring teams into the country on charter flights will run well into seven figures and the proposed tours will ultimately hinge on how the national picture looks in the coming weeks as lockdown measures in the UK begin to be relaxed. With the ECB facing losses of \u00a3380m in the event of no cricket being staged this summer \u2013 and six Tests worth an estimated \u00a3120m in broadcast revenues \u2013 the governing body is throwing every possible resource at getting international cricket back on television.",

      "body": "<p>Without the Covid-19 pandemic, Saturday 16 May would have seen the final matches of the German football league\u2019s 57th season: a day of passion and noise, tears of joy from the champions and despair from fans of relegated teams. Instead, the restart of the Bundesliga after a nine-week break was a strangely clinical affair, which is more likely to be remembered for unfamiliar hygiene routines, an eerie atmosphere inside the stadiums and awkward elbow bumps.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/16/haaland-leads-way-as-dortmund-win-by-a-distance-on-bundesliga-return-against-schalke\">Haaland leads the way as Dortmund win by a distance on Bundesliga return</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For the restart to go ahead, the 36 clubs in the first and second division had to abide by a strict code of regulations drawn up by the German football association. No more than a total of 300 people were allowed in and directly around the stadiums where the games took place. Clubs were responsible for stopping their fans from gathering outside the arenas\u2019 gates, though fears of fans ignoring social distancing to cheer on their teams proved unfounded: at Dortmund\u2019s Signal Iduna Park, famed for its intense atmosphere, the only people passing by the empty stands were joggers.</p> \n<p>Around the pitch, there were no mascots and no children holding hands with players in the tunnels. Ballboys, reduced to four at each match, wore gloves and had to be tested for the coronavirus beforehand. TV reporters wore masks and plastic sheets over their microphones.</p> \n<p>The German FA\u2019s protocols advised clubs to disinfect match balls \u201cbefore and during the match\u201d, though only Eintracht Frankfurt confirmed they would wipe clean the balls used in their evening match against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach at half-time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db0a55e79e3c6fd49ef3acd8eb0ec3220f388709\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db0a55e79e3c6fd49ef3acd8eb0ec3220f388709/154_0_2577_1548/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dedryck Boyata gets too close to teammate Marko Grujic during Hertha\u2019s win over Hoffenheim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dedryck Boyata gets too close to teammate Marko Grujic during Hertha\u2019s win over Hoffenheim.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Union Berlin\u2019s coach, Urs Fischer, will miss his team\u2019s game against Bayern Munich on Sunday after breaking quarantine following a family bereavement.

      "bodyText": "Without the Covid-19 pandemic, Saturday 16 May would have seen the final matches of the German football league\u2019s 57th season: a day of passion and noise, tears of joy from the champions and despair from fans of relegated teams. Instead, the restart of the Bundesliga after a nine-week break was a strangely clinical affair, which is more likely to be remembered for unfamiliar hygiene routines, an eerie atmosphere inside the stadiums and awkward elbow bumps. For the restart to go ahead, the 36 clubs in the first and second division had to abide by a strict code of regulations drawn up by the German football association. No more than a total of 300 people were allowed in and directly around the stadiums where the games took place. Clubs were responsible for stopping their fans from gathering outside the arenas\u2019 gates, though fears of fans ignoring social distancing to cheer on their teams proved unfounded: at Dortmund\u2019s Signal Iduna Park, famed for its intense atmosphere, the only people passing by the empty stands were joggers. Around the pitch, there were no mascots and no children holding hands with players in the tunnels. Ballboys, reduced to four at each match, wore gloves and had to be tested for the coronavirus beforehand. TV reporters wore masks and plastic sheets over their microphones. The German FA\u2019s protocols advised clubs to disinfect match balls \u201cbefore and during the match\u201d, though only Eintracht Frankfurt confirmed they would wipe clean the balls used in their evening match against Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach at half-time. Union Berlin\u2019s coach, Urs Fischer, will miss his team\u2019s game against Bayern Munich on Sunday after breaking quarantine following a family bereavement. Augsburg\u2019s Heiko Herrlich was absent from the touchline as his side lost to Wolfsburg on Saturday, having left the team hotel earlier in the week to buy toiletries. Players were advised to avoid communal showers or even wait to wash off the sweat and dirt in their hotels. Hygiene masks had to be worn in the dressing room, the players\u2019 tunnel and on the subs bench. Hugs and high-fives during goal celebrations had been discouraged. Most players and coaches opted for a bump of the elbow or lower arm instead. When Dortmund\u2019s prodigious Norwegian striker Erling Braut Haaland scored the day\u2019s first goal in the 29th minute, his team made sure to abide by social distancing to celebrate the opener. Not everyone had got the message: the former Manchester City defender Dedryck Boyata broke guidelines by getting too close to teammate Marko Grujic during their 3-0 victory against Hoffenheim. In the buildup to the matches, there had been high hopes that the Bundesliga being the first high-profile football league in Europe to restart after the lockdown would create an image boost for a league often overshadowed by the Premier League, Spain\u2019s La Liga and Italy\u2019s Serie A. Instead, footage of deserted stands and players\u2019 shouts eerily echoing inside the empty stadiums seemed to mainly draw attention to the absence of the strongly nourished grassroots fan culture that used to set the German league apart from others in Europe.",

With some children set to go back to school at on 1 June under proposals announced last week, relations between teaching unions and the government have become fraught in recent days. On Friday the British Medical Association threw its weight behind unions which oppose the government\u2019s push to reopen schools in England, after the infection rate in the UK rose, potentially close to the point at which the virus starts spreading again. In the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing, Williamson said that the government\u2019s approach was based on the best scientific advice with children \u201cat the very heart of everything we do\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Artificial intelligence is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52120747\">searching for the drugs</a> to combat Covid-19. It enabled the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-ai-tracking-coronavirus-outbreak/\">pandemic to be tracked</a> and information about it to be synthesised. It is diagnosing patients,<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/23/1000410/ai-triage-covid-19-patients-health-care/\"> triaging them</a>, and identifying those in need of intensive care before their condition deteriorates.</p> <p>There is much hype about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to combat coronavirus. Some of it is justified. Its ability to sift through vast amounts of data and to recognise patterns has been of great value. Some of the hype is flannel. AI did not, as some claim, <a href=\"https://singularityhub.com/2020/02/05/how-ai-helped-predict-the-coronavirus-outbreak-before-it-happened/\">predict the pandemic</a> before humans recognised it. Inflated claims, for instance for the accuracy of AI in diagnosing Covid-19, should be <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-guide-to-healthy-skepticism-of-artificial-intelligence-and-coronavirus/\">cause for suspicion, not celebration</a>.</p> <p>Some of it is cause for concern \u2013 such as the use of AI for mass surveillance. And some aspects of the pandemic have exposed the limitations of AI. Algorithms, such as those used by online retailers, trained on normal human behaviour, now find that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/05/11/1001563/covid-pandemic-broken-ai-machine-learning-amazon-retail-fraud-humans-in-the-loop/\">people\u2019s behaviour has completely changed </a>when it comes to shopping or travel, and they are often flummoxed.</p> <p>All this suggests a need to be clearer about what machines are good at and what humans are good at. The computer scientist and philosopher <a href=\"https://ischool.utoronto.ca/profile/brian-cantwell-smith/\">Brian Cantwell Smith</a> distils that difference into the distinction between what he calls <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/contributors/brian-cantwell-smith\">\u201creckoning\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Reckoning is essentially calculation: the ability to manipulate data and recognise patterns. Judgment, on the other hand, refers to a form of \u201cdeliberative thought, grounded in ethical commitment and responsible action, appropriate to the situation in which it is deployed\u201d.</p> <p>Judgment, Smith observes, is not simply a way of thinking about the world, but emerges from a particular relationship to the world that humans have and machines do not. Humans are both embodied and embedded in the world. We are able to recognise the world as real and as unified but also to break it down into distinct objects and phenomena. We can represent the world but also appreciate the distinction between representation and reality. And, most importantly, humans possess an ethical commitment to the real over the representation. What is morally important is not the image or mental representation I have of you, but the fact that you exist in the world. A system with judgment must, Smith insists, not simply be able to think but also to \u201ccare about what it is thinking about\u201d. It must \u201cgive a damn\u201d. Humans do. Machines don\u2019t.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No machine has an ethical commitment to patients the way doctors and nurses do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>AI may be able to triage patients because of its ability to recognise patterns that humans may miss, but no machine has an ethical commitment to patients in the way doctors and nurses do, for whom it\u2019s not just the facts or patterns that matter. It is also that patients possess worth and dignity which need protecting.</p> <p>Human judgments are not necessarily good, nor do humans always act with judgment. But all have the capacity to do so. That is why we hold humans, but not machines, as morally accountable for their acts.</p> <p>The distinction between reckoning and judgment is important in assessing not just machines but humans, too. In this pandemic, one of the key responses from government minsters, when faced with difficult political questions, has been to suggest that they are merely \u201cfollowing the science\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Artificial intelligence is searching for the drugs to combat Covid-19. It enabled the pandemic to be tracked and information about it to be synthesised. It is diagnosing patients, triaging them, and identifying those in need of intensive care before their condition deteriorates. There is much hype about the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to combat coronavirus. Some of it is justified. Its ability to sift through vast amounts of data and to recognise patterns has been of great value. Some of the hype is flannel. AI did not, as some claim, predict the pandemic before humans recognised it. Inflated claims, for instance for the accuracy of AI in diagnosing Covid-19, should be cause for suspicion, not celebration. Some of it is cause for concern \u2013 such as the use of AI for mass surveillance. And some aspects of the pandemic have exposed the limitations of AI. Algorithms, such as those used by online retailers, trained on normal human behaviour, now find that people\u2019s behaviour has completely changed when it comes to shopping or travel, and they are often flummoxed. All this suggests a need to be clearer about what machines are good at and what humans are good at. The computer scientist and philosopher Brian Cantwell Smith distils that difference into the distinction between what he calls \u201creckoning\u201d and \u201cjudgment\u201d. Reckoning is essentially calculation: the ability to manipulate data and recognise patterns. Judgment, on the other hand, refers to a form of \u201cdeliberative thought, grounded in ethical commitment and responsible action, appropriate to the situation in which it is deployed\u201d. Judgment, Smith observes, is not simply a way of thinking about the world, but emerges from a particular relationship to the world that humans have and machines do not. Humans are both embodied and embedded in the world. We are able to recognise the world as real and as unified but also to break it down into distinct objects and phenomena. We can represent the world but also appreciate the distinction between representation and reality. And, most importantly, humans possess an ethical commitment to the real over the representation. What is morally important is not the image or mental representation I have of you, but the fact that you exist in the world. A system with judgment must, Smith insists, not simply be able to think but also to \u201ccare about what it is thinking about\u201d. It must \u201cgive a damn\u201d. Humans do. Machines don\u2019t. AI may be able to triage patients because of its ability to recognise patterns that humans may miss, but no machine has an ethical commitment to patients in the way doctors and nurses do, for whom it\u2019s not just the facts or patterns that matter. It is also that patients possess worth and dignity which need protecting. Human judgments are not necessarily good, nor do humans always act with judgment. But all have the capacity to do so. That is why we hold humans, but not machines, as morally accountable for their acts. The distinction between reckoning and judgment is important in assessing not just machines but humans, too. In this pandemic, one of the key responses from government minsters, when faced with difficult political questions, has been to suggest that they are merely \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. Not only is there not a single \u201cscience\u201d to follow, and that much of what we know about coronavirus is laced with uncertainty, but even if the science were clear, we still could not abjure judgment. Take the debate about the reopening of schools. Suppose we knew for certain how likely it was for children to become infected, and to infect others, and what exactly the R number was in any part of the country. The decision on whether to reopen would still rest on making political and moral judgments about how to balance the risk of increased infection with the risk of children losing education and of the disadvantaged being further disadvantaged. The best public policy rests on facts but it also requires us to choose between competing demands, and to decide how these fit into various ethical and political commitments. There can be good or bad judgment, but there can be no pretence that there is no judgment. The \u201cwe\u2019re following the science\u201d line suggests that policymaking is a matter merely of reckoning \u2013 of making calculations from the given data \u2013 rather than also of judgment. It suggests, too, that a computer, rather than a human, would be best placed to lead the fight against Covid-19. Machines cannot think like humans. Humans should not act like machines. Even politicians. \u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Punk gigs don\u2019t usually lend themselves to quiet introspection. By their nature, they should be noisy, chaotic and rammed with fans. But music under lockdown has warped into new ways of being. So <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9-XGlzT9csY\">Free Word\u2019s festival of feminist punk</a>, streamed live on YouTube from each artist\u2019s home, is a discombobulating experience; <a href=\"https://msmohammed.bandcamp.com/\">Ms Mohammed,</a> a musician costumed in blood red against a wall draped in shawls, reminds herself to \u201cpause and wait for the applause\u201d at the end of each song, despite not being able to see any of the 60 fans who have tuned in to see her. </p> <p>The scene is doing its best to connect, given the circumstances. But with an industry on its knees, where 80% of UK music venues are now under serious risk of permanent closure and \u00a3900m has been wiped from the \u00a31.1bn live sector this year, the need for nimble innovation is urgent. But what exactly will live music look like after lockdown? Gigs can be reconfigured to meet social distancing guidelines \u2013 the crucial question is whether they will work.</p> <p>Drive-in concerts, where punters park up in a field to watch shows, have already popped up in Norway, Lithuania and the US, where country star <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/keith-urban-drive-in-concert-social-distancing-1000791/\">Keith Urban played a show </a>for health workers on Thursday. The idea that venues will open up to reduced physical capacity, with grids on the floor to enforce social distancing, has also been mooted. Some venues are running and have already scheduled ticketed concerts to be streamed online; on Saturday, Bristol\u2019s Colston Hall <a href=\"https://www.colstonhall.org/shows/bristol-takeover-online/\">will be livestreaming bands all day</a>.

His company has designed tours for Madonna, U2, Beyonc\u00e9 and Elton John among others. \u201cYour favourite artist will be performing, you\u2019ll be able to see them clearly, and the only thing missing is that you don\u2019t have to queue to go to the toilet, spend lots of money buying beer and spend two hours getting there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/13/uk-live-music-festivals-sector-at-risk-coronavirus\">UK live music and festival sector at risk of collapse due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Winkler predicts that without a Covid-19 vaccine or serious subsidy, the live music industry will have imploded in 12 months: \u201cEveryone will have gone bankrupt, and then these emerging technologies will rush to fill that niche really quickly. People\u2019s way of consuming entertainment will change with it. Look at Blockbuster: it was at its peak 15 years ago and now bam! It\u2019s gone.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of virtual concerts is not new.

The live music experience will be what it is for when it\u2019s ready to come back.\u201d</p> <p>The escalating costs of extra security to enforce social distancing, increased sanitation, insurance, potential protection for venue staff in the future is a minefield for the industry, already grappling to stay afloat.</p> <p>Live Nation, one of the world\u2019s largest concert promoters, has furloughed 20% of its staff and postponed its 2020 shows. John Reid, company president for Europe concerts, told the <em>Observer </em>that it has been working on alternative ways to adjust its model, including \u201cdrive-in concerts, reduced-capacity shows and fan-less concerts from iconic venues \u2026 the hope is that we will have tickets for the big 2021 tours on sale before the end of the year.\u201d</p> <p>Mumford &amp; Sons, who completed their 60-date international tour with Live Nation last spring, have cancelled their summer festival appearances. But as the owner of a promotions company and two London music venues, Lovett is weathering the crisis and runs a weekly Zoom roundtable with London venue owners as they try to work together on solutions.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing to come out of this,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who wouldn\u2019t have picked up the phone before are now coming together. It\u2019s been a forced pause, a reset, and put things in perspective. But whatever comes next has to be clear so we can plan our way out of this. It\u2019s the lack of guidance from government and the uncertainty that is the worst.\u201d</p> <p>Musician John Grant agrees. Speaking to the <em>Observer</em> from his home in Iceland, Grant said: \u201cI do appreciate that people are trying to figure it out and be proactive about doing shows online, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it right now, and am hoping things go back to normal. We can\u2019t <em>live</em> without live music.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Davyd, CEO of <a href=\"http://musicvenuetrust.com/\">Music Venues Trust</a>, which represents 736 grassroots venues across the UK, and former MP Tom Watson, now chair of industry umbrella group <a href=\"https://www.ukmusic.org/\">UK Music</a>, have been lobbying government for financial support.</p> <p>Watson says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know when live shows will come back. Tt has to be health-led, but there isn\u2019t great optimism in the sector that it will be very soon.

      "bodyText": "Punk gigs don\u2019t usually lend themselves to quiet introspection. By their nature, they should be noisy, chaotic and rammed with fans. But music under lockdown has warped into new ways of being. So Free Word\u2019s festival of feminist punk, streamed live on YouTube from each artist\u2019s home, is a discombobulating experience; Ms Mohammed, a musician costumed in blood red against a wall draped in shawls, reminds herself to \u201cpause and wait for the applause\u201d at the end of each song, despite not being able to see any of the 60 fans who have tuned in to see her. The scene is doing its best to connect, given the circumstances. But with an industry on its knees, where 80% of UK music venues are now under serious risk of permanent closure and \u00a3900m has been wiped from the \u00a31.1bn live sector this year, the need for nimble innovation is urgent. But what exactly will live music look like after lockdown? Gigs can be reconfigured to meet social distancing guidelines \u2013 the crucial question is whether they will work. Drive-in concerts, where punters park up in a field to watch shows, have already popped up in Norway, Lithuania and the US, where country star Keith Urban played a show for health workers on Thursday. The idea that venues will open up to reduced physical capacity, with grids on the floor to enforce social distancing, has also been mooted. Some venues are running and have already scheduled ticketed concerts to be streamed online; on Saturday, Bristol\u2019s Colston Hall will be livestreaming bands all day. Next month, the Union Chapel in London will host Laura Marling to perform an online-only show. \u201cIn the future, I can absolutely imagine we will be able to sit at home, strap on an augmented or virtual reality headset and \u2026 boom, suddenly be in the middle of Wembley,\u201d says Ray Winkler, CEO of Stufish Entertainment. His company has designed tours for Madonna, U2, Beyonc\u00e9 and Elton John among others. \u201cYour favourite artist will be performing, you\u2019ll be able to see them clearly, and the only thing missing is that you don\u2019t have to queue to go to the toilet, spend lots of money buying beer and spend two hours getting there.\u201d Winkler predicts that without a Covid-19 vaccine or serious subsidy, the live music industry will have imploded in 12 months: \u201cEveryone will have gone bankrupt, and then these emerging technologies will rush to fill that niche really quickly. People\u2019s way of consuming entertainment will change with it. Look at Blockbuster: it was at its peak 15 years ago and now bam! It\u2019s gone.\u201d The idea of virtual concerts is not new. But the mammoth speed of data and technology required to run them, plus their limited appeal to artists and audiences, means they have been slow to take hold. Travis Scott ventured into the market last month by playing a concert on videogame Fortnite, while Massive Attack \u201cperformed\u201d in the Lego videogame, Minecraft. Keen to take a lead, Sony began recruiting this month for a team dedicated to building large-scale virtual concerts. \u201cIt\u2019s a different thing altogether,\u201d says Ben Lovett, from Mumford &amp; Sons. \u201cSuggesting that virtual reality could replace gigs is a weird way to look at it when it\u2019s actually just an additional form \u2013 another way to experience connection with an artist. The live music experience will be what it is for when it\u2019s ready to come back.\u201d The escalating costs of extra security to enforce social distancing, increased sanitation, insurance, potential protection for venue staff in the future is a minefield for the industry, already grappling to stay afloat. Live Nation, one of the world\u2019s largest concert promoters, has furloughed 20% of its staff and postponed its 2020 shows. John Reid, company president for Europe concerts, told the Observer that it has been working on alternative ways to adjust its model, including \u201cdrive-in concerts, reduced-capacity shows and fan-less concerts from iconic venues \u2026 the hope is that we will have tickets for the big 2021 tours on sale before the end of the year.\u201d Mumford &amp; Sons, who completed their 60-date international tour with Live Nation last spring, have cancelled their summer festival appearances. But as the owner of a promotions company and two London music venues, Lovett is weathering the crisis and runs a weekly Zoom roundtable with London venue owners as they try to work together on solutions. \u201cThat\u2019s a good thing to come out of this,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who wouldn\u2019t have picked up the phone before are now coming together. It\u2019s been a forced pause, a reset, and put things in perspective. But whatever comes next has to be clear so we can plan our way out of this. It\u2019s the lack of guidance from government and the uncertainty that is the worst.\u201d Musician John Grant agrees. Speaking to the Observer from his home in Iceland, Grant said: \u201cI do appreciate that people are trying to figure it out and be proactive about doing shows online, but I can\u2019t bring myself to do it right now, and am hoping things go back to normal. We can\u2019t live without live music.\u201d Mark Davyd, CEO of Music Venues Trust, which represents 736 grassroots venues across the UK, and former MP Tom Watson, now chair of industry umbrella group UK Music, have been lobbying government for financial support. Watson says: \u201cWe don\u2019t know when live shows will come back. Tt has to be health-led, but there isn\u2019t great optimism in the sector that it will be very soon. But we would like to see landlords give grassroots music venues rent-free periods to help them cope. \u201d \u201cThe picture is immensely bleak,\u201d agrees Davyd, but he suggests that landlords might strike a deal with government. \u201cIf the government took action on rents, you could stop the live music infrastructure from collapsing. Once these venues close, they won\u2019t come back.

      "bodyText": "It wasn\u2019t Liverpool vs Manchester United or Arsenal vs Spurs. But it was live football. After a two-month coronavirus shutdown, that was good enough for many match-starved fans. The German Bundesliga yesterday became the first major league to resume, with five games played behind closed doors, including a Ruhr derby between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04. The restart was a moment that fans, administrators, TV bosses and politicians hope will prove a first morale-boosting step towards normality. From Dortmund, BT Sport\u2019s coverage panned round a cavernous and virtually empty Westfalenstadion. Substitutes perched on seats two metres apart wearing face masks, while the players\u2019 shouts echoed eerily. The fans were missing, and they were missed. The combination of recorded cheers and tinny music that accompanied each of Dortmund\u2019s four goals made their absence starker. \u201cIt\u2019s like going to a nightclub without music or a pub without beer,\u201d said Dr Mark Doidge, a senior research fellow in sport at the University of Brighton. \u201cSport is nothing without emotion.\u201d Doidge is a huge fan and has followed the Bundesliga for several years, enticed, as he says, by the \u201cfull stadiums of active fans, creating a spectacle\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m finding myself torn,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI really want to watch some football and I like watching the Bundesliga. But do I want to buy into a system where the fans themselves in Germany are saying we don\u2019t want the games to be taking place without us there. \u201cThe television companies scrabbling to get football back because they paid for it might be need to be careful what they wish for because the spectacle won\u2019t be very good.\u201d Since lockdown began, sports fans have found various ways to fill their time. Surreal sporting commentary has become a niche genre. Andrew Cotter, the golf commentator, has gone viral with wryly amusing play-by-plays of the exploits of his two labradors, Olive and Mabel. Nick Heath usually commentates on rugby matches but has been watching squirrels, dogs and birds in his south London park and posting the results on Instagram and Tik Tok as part of his #LifeCommentary. He has gone from 15,000 followers to 130,000 \u2013 most of them women. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of messages from women saying \u2018I don\u2019t really do sports \u2013 that\u2019s my husband\u2019s domain.

But he was \u201cshocked\u201d by this week\u2019s events across Lake Michigan in Wisconsin.</p> <p>\u201cExperiencing the deaths that we have here in the Detroit area and then seeing pictures from people crowding into bars over the last couple of days is just horrifying,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here in Wayne County, Michigan, and not feel the aura of death. Seeing the crowds in a place like Wisconsin just hours after the ban was lifted, there is a real disjointedness and a sense that parts of America may not understand what it\u2019s like to be living through this.\u201d</p> <p>Wisconsin had already stunned observers last month when Evers was again overruled by Republicans who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">forced a primary election to go ahead,</a> leaving people in face masks to line up for hours to cast ballots. Critics described it as a chilling consequence <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">of aggressive gerrymandering,</a> which all but guarantees Republicans a legislative majority.</p> <p>Ed Fallone, a Marquette University Law School professor who <a href=\"https://www.falloneforjustice.com/\">unsuccessfully ran for the Wisconsin supreme court</a> as a Democrat, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had two Wisconsin supreme court decisions that undermine the Democratic governor\u2019s authority and now it\u2019s fully expected that even local jurisdictions that have in place countywide or citywide stay-at-home orders will have litigation brought against them. It\u2019s pretty much Democrat versus Republican, top-to-bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Reports suggest that the pandemic has been sucked into America\u2019s political polarisation and culture wars.</p> <p>Many protesters, taking their lead from Trump, refuse to wear face masks or maintain physical distance. \u201cScience is no match for tribalism in this dysfunctional country,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/opinion/coronavirus-masks.htm\">wrote Frank Bruni,</a> a New York Times columnist. \u201cAnd protective masks, God help us, are tribal totems.\u201d</p> <p>Fallone has seen evidence of the trend in Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m on various political Facebook groups throughout Wisconsin and you can see on social media the difference between people who react when they run into folks who aren\u2019t wearing face masks and who are upset about it, and then other folks who are mocking anyone who tries to social distance,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96a601925a9a8991a9c6cf60a089041b7d675d94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a601925a9a8991a9c6cf60a089041b7d675d94/0_30_2892_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has been a target of protestors\u2019 anger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has been a target of protestors\u2019 anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become very political. People take their cues from their leaders and so, on the Republican side, people are taking their cues from the Trump administration and the state Republican party leaders who are consistently talking about freedom and liberty and go where you want, do what you want. And on the Democrat side, people are trying to follow the governor\u2019s recommendations and engage in social distancing and wear face masks.\u201d</p> <p>Confirmed coronavirus cases in Michigan crossed 50,000 while Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 4,825, the state health department said on Friday. More than 11,000 cases had been identified in Wisconsin as of Thursday night, according to a New York Times database, and at least 434 people had died.

      "bodyText": "They were the battleground states that handed the White House keys to Donald Trump by a whisker. Now they are the battleground states of the coronavirus pandemic, microcosms of a crisis that, far from bringing America together, threatens to tear it apart. Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin formed the blue wall that crumbled in 2016 as Hillary Clinton lost them by a combined total of fewer than 80,000 votes (0.06% of 137m votes cast). Each is led by a Democratic governor whose lockdown orders, while mitigating the spread of the virus, could shape the US president\u2019s race with Joe Biden in 2020. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit,\u201d Trump told workers at a medical supply distribution hub in Allentown this week. \u201cYou have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they want to keep them closed. Can\u2019t do that.\u201d On Friday, hundreds of demonstrators descended on Pennsylvania\u2019s state capitol in Harrisburg to protest the stay-at-home order from Governor Tom Wolf. Pennsylvania ranks 12th among states in Covid-19 cases per capita, according to a Reuters tally. In Wisconsin, meanwhile, the state supreme court\u2019s conservative majority this week struck down a stay-at-home order extension issued by Governor Tony Evers. \u201cWe\u2019re the Wild West,\u201d he said despairingly. Trump was quick to describe it as a \u201cwin\u201d over the \u201cDemocrat Governor\u201d, tweeting: \u201cThe people want to get on with their lives. The place is bustling!\u201d Indeed, photos of crowded bars quickly appeared on social media. Following Wisconsin\u2019s lead, on Friday Republicans who control the state legislature in Michigan urged a judge to strike down stay-at-home orders and restrictions on businesses imposed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Republicans complain that her approach is overly cautious, particularly in areas that have not been hit as hard with the virus as the Detroit area, which has two thirds of the state\u2019s cases. Armed protesters, some with Confederate flags and Trump regalia, have gathered at the Michigan state capitol in Lansing over the past three weeks. On Thursday a legislative session was cancelled to avoid a repeat of a recent incident in which gun-toting demonstrators crowded inside the building. Clinton tweeted: \u201cArmed men storming a legislature to disrupt its democratic proceedings is domestic terrorism. It cannot be tolerated.\u201d A man was charged with terrorism, accused of death threats against Whitmer. The protesters have been endorsed by Trump, who at one point tweeted \u201cLiberate Michigan\u201d, guaranteeing outsized media exposure despite polls showing a majority in favour of restrictions on businesses, schools and social gatherings, despite mass job losses. Neil Sroka, a city council member in Grosse Pointe Farms, Michigan, said: \u201cFrankly, the right wing agitators that were trying to pull a stunt with these protests really put their foot in their mouth by having folks marching around with weapons. \u201cEveryone is frustrated at being cooped up in their house, and certainly the weather here in Michigan hasn\u2019t helped, but those folks that were protesting in the capitol do not reflect the views of anywhere close to a majority of people in my community and Michiganders in general.\u201d Sroka, who is also spokesperson for the progressive group Democracy for America, said partisan divisions over the issue are beginning to emerge, though they remain relatively modest. But he was \u201cshocked\u201d by this week\u2019s events across Lake Michigan in Wisconsin. \u201cExperiencing the deaths that we have here in the Detroit area and then seeing pictures from people crowding into bars over the last couple of days is just horrifying,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t be here in Wayne County, Michigan, and not feel the aura of death. Seeing the crowds in a place like Wisconsin just hours after the ban was lifted, there is a real disjointedness and a sense that parts of America may not understand what it\u2019s like to be living through this.\u201d Wisconsin had already stunned observers last month when Evers was again overruled by Republicans who forced a primary election to go ahead, leaving people in face masks to line up for hours to cast ballots. Critics described it as a chilling consequence of aggressive gerrymandering, which all but guarantees Republicans a legislative majority. Ed Fallone, a Marquette University Law School professor who unsuccessfully ran for the Wisconsin supreme court as a Democrat, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had two Wisconsin supreme court decisions that undermine the Democratic governor\u2019s authority and now it\u2019s fully expected that even local jurisdictions that have in place countywide or citywide stay-at-home orders will have litigation brought against them. It\u2019s pretty much Democrat versus Republican, top-to-bottom.\u201d Reports suggest that the pandemic has been sucked into America\u2019s political polarisation and culture wars. Many protesters, taking their lead from Trump, refuse to wear face masks or maintain physical distance. \u201cScience is no match for tribalism in this dysfunctional country,\u201d wrote Frank Bruni, a New York Times columnist. \u201cAnd protective masks, God help us, are tribal totems.\u201d Fallone has seen evidence of the trend in Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m on various political Facebook groups throughout Wisconsin and you can see on social media the difference between people who react when they run into folks who aren\u2019t wearing face masks and who are upset about it, and then other folks who are mocking anyone who tries to social distance,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s become very political. People take their cues from their leaders and so, on the Republican side, people are taking their cues from the Trump administration and the state Republican party leaders who are consistently talking about freedom and liberty and go where you want, do what you want. And on the Democrat side, people are trying to follow the governor\u2019s recommendations and engage in social distancing and wear face masks.\u201d Confirmed coronavirus cases in Michigan crossed 50,000 while Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 4,825, the state health department said on Friday. More than 11,000 cases had been identified in Wisconsin as of Thursday night, according to a New York Times database, and at least 434 people had died. More than 63,000 cases had been identified in Pennsylvania as of Thursday night, along with about 4,300 deaths, the Times reported. Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world. But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted unemployment claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as Georgia and Texas were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen. \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d Trump said in the White House rose garden on Friday while announcing a major US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine. Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps. \u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump. \u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope.

      "bodyText": "The brother of the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was one of 19 protesters arrested on Saturday, as small demonstrations against the coronavirus lockdown took place across the country. Protesters gathered on green spaces across the UK holding placards describing the lockdown rules as unlawful and claiming that the government measures were suppressing civil rights. In Hyde Park, London, about 50 people defied social distancing guidelines to gather close together at Speakers\u2019 Corner holding placards with slogans including \u201canti-vax deserves a voice\u201d and \u201cfreedom over fear\u201d. Dozens of police officers, including some on horseback, patrolled the protest, issuing 10 on-the-spot fines and making 19 arrests. Corbyn\u2019s brother, Piers, was taken away after using a megaphone to declare that 5G and the coronavirus pandemic were linked and branding the pandemic as a \u201cpack of lies to brainwash you and keep you in order\u201d. He also said \u201cvaccination is not necessary\u201d and that \u201c5G towers will be installed everywhere\u201d, adding: \u201c5G enhances anyone who\u2019s got illness from Covid, so they work together.\u201d There is no evidence to link 5G and Covid-19 and scientists fear that a rise in measles among children can be attributed in part to unfounded fears about vaccines. Corbyn was taken away after declining to leave when asked by a police officer and refusing to give his details when asked. A flyer advertising the protest called for \u201cno to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal, and no to the unlawful lockdown\u201d. David Samson, 50, a finance worker, who attended the protests told the Press Association news agency: \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see in my generation the suppressing of civil rights [over a] fake virus. This is nothing compared to what\u2019s coming.\u201d There was a large round of boos whenever protesters were arrested, and repeated shouts of \u201cjail Bill Gates\u201d. Another demonstrator, 62-year-old Catharine Harvey, said she was defying the rules to highlight the \u201cdevastation this lockdown has caused\u201d. The shop owner said: \u201cDeveloping countries will have no trade, no tourism. I have had to close my shop on Columbia Road flower market. The effects of the lockdown are far, far worse than the virus \u2013 mental health, domestic violence, shops are closed, theatres, cinemas, restaurants. It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said: \u201cWith the easing of restrictions we fully expected open spaces to be busy this weekend. \u201cIt was disappointing that a relatively small group in Hyde Park came together to protest the regulations in clear breach of the guidance, putting themselves and others at risk of infection. \u201cOfficers once again took a measured approach and tried to engage the group to disperse. \u201cThey clearly had no intention of doing so, and so it did result in 19 people being arrested, and a further 10 being issued with a fixed-penalty notice.\u201d A separate protest in Southampton saw about a dozen protesters gather on Southampton Common, holding placards saying \u201cStop the Lies\u201d, \u201cSay no to tyranny\u201d and \u201cFight 4 Freedom\u201d.

But this brings me to a recurrent problem throughout the crisis. The mayor of London is on Cobra, and rightly so. But there is no place for any mayors from the north, or indeed the rest, of England.</p> <p>For a government elected on votes in the north, and promises to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/06/economists-warning-boris-johnson-election-pledge-output\">\u201clevel-up\u201d</a>, it is surprising how quickly it has reverted to the default, London-centric mode in this crisis. Last Sunday\u2019s package certainly felt more suited to the south than to the north.</p> <p>And the same pattern continued into the week. On Thursday, a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-grants-transport-for-london-funding-package\">\u00a31.6bn </a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-grants-transport-for-london-funding-package\">funding package </a>was agreed for Transport for London. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. But where was the deal for Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham?</p> <p>Like London\u2019s Tube, our tram system has seen an increase in passengers this week. But we are running a skeleton, 20-minute service and are not even fully funded to do that. If you are encouraging a return to work, surely any safety-led approach would require you to help cities fund extra trams to allow for social distancing? Simply telling people to drive doesn\u2019t work for the third of people here who don\u2019t own a car.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just on transport where the government is not reading the room. At the start of the crisis, the message to councils was, \u201cspend what you need to keep people safe, we will see you right\u201d. Now it\u2019s all about \u201csharing the cost\u201d.</p> <p>In the same week that the ONS identified the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/covid-19-deaths-twice-as-high-in-poorest-areas-in-england-and-wales\">link between the virus and deprivation</a>, the government removed deprivation weighting from the latest council allocations. Nine of the 10 Greater Manchester councils received hefty cuts. The change resulted in a huge shift of resources from north to south, with Knowsley getting a 39% cut and South Gloucestershire a 30% increase. Not so much \u201clevelling-up\u201d as doubling down on the north-south divide.</p> <p>This matters because northern councils are seeing more cases and facing extra costs, not least on issues like homelessness. At the start of all this, the government rightly launched an \u201cEveryone In\u201d policy. We needed no persuading and already had a scheme in hand. However, a few weeks on, the goalposts were moved. When we said Everyone In, civil servants explained, we meant people who were homeless before the crisis, not those who have become homeless since.</p> <p>We are now left with 800 people in hotels and apartments but with insufficient funding to help them make a transition to a more secure placement. The communities secretary insists he is fully funding \u201cEveryone In\u201d but our councils see it differently. The gap between national government and local government in England is growing wider by the day.</p> <p>So where do we go from here?</p> <p>If the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies. Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-52679548\">own approach on schools</a>, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. And if we don\u2019t get the help we need, there is a risk of a second spike here which, in turn, will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London. </p> <p>Instead, the government needs to draw a line and show it is listening.</p> <p>Tomorrow morning, it should ask the mayor of the West Midlands to represent the non-London mayors on Cobra and commit to publish the regional R number, as requested by myself and the mayor of the Liverpool city region. They should quickly follow that by agreeing a transport funding package for cities to put on more buses and trams so that people can travel more safely to work. And something that would win back huge goodwill across all of England would be a commitment to honouring the promise to cover all costs incurred by councils, including on homelessness.</p> <p>We remain in the midst of a national crisis and we need a sense of national unity to get through it. We all need to work hard next week to bring that back.</p> <p>\u2022Andy Burnham is mayor of Greater Manchester</p>",

On Thursday, a \u00a31.6bn funding package was agreed for Transport for London. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. But where was the deal for Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham? Like London\u2019s Tube, our tram system has seen an increase in passengers this week. But we are running a skeleton, 20-minute service and are not even fully funded to do that. If you are encouraging a return to work, surely any safety-led approach would require you to help cities fund extra trams to allow for social distancing? Simply telling people to drive doesn\u2019t work for the third of people here who don\u2019t own a car. It\u2019s not just on transport where the government is not reading the room. At the start of the crisis, the message to councils was, \u201cspend what you need to keep people safe, we will see you right\u201d. Now it\u2019s all about \u201csharing the cost\u201d. In the same week that the ONS identified the link between the virus and deprivation, the government removed deprivation weighting from the latest council allocations. Nine of the 10 Greater Manchester councils received hefty cuts. The change resulted in a huge shift of resources from north to south, with Knowsley getting a 39% cut and South Gloucestershire a 30% increase. Not so much \u201clevelling-up\u201d as doubling down on the north-south divide. This matters because northern councils are seeing more cases and facing extra costs, not least on issues like homelessness. At the start of all this, the government rightly launched an \u201cEveryone In\u201d policy. We needed no persuading and already had a scheme in hand. However, a few weeks on, the goalposts were moved. When we said Everyone In, civil servants explained, we meant people who were homeless before the crisis, not those who have become homeless since. We are now left with 800 people in hotels and apartments but with insufficient funding to help them make a transition to a more secure placement. The communities secretary insists he is fully funding \u201cEveryone In\u201d but our councils see it differently. The gap between national government and local government in England is growing wider by the day. So where do we go from here? If the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies. Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. And if we don\u2019t get the help we need, there is a risk of a second spike here which, in turn, will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London. Instead, the government needs to draw a line and show it is listening. Tomorrow morning, it should ask the mayor of the West Midlands to represent the non-London mayors on Cobra and commit to publish the regional R number, as requested by myself and the mayor of the Liverpool city region. They should quickly follow that by agreeing a transport funding package for cities to put on more buses and trams so that people can travel more safely to work. And something that would win back huge goodwill across all of England would be a commitment to honouring the promise to cover all costs incurred by councils, including on homelessness. We remain in the midst of a national crisis and we need a sense of national unity to get through it. We all need to work hard next week to bring that back. \u2022Andy Burnham is mayor of Greater Manchester",

Richard Clarke, a global hotels and leisure analyst at research firm Bernstein, has calculated that Australia could stand to benefit from a closure of international borders, should the spending of Australian international travellers be redirected to domestic travel. He says even if 60% of the amount of money Australians spend overseas is instead spent by travelling within Australia \u2013 as happened in the UK after Brexit \u2013 the total value of spending in the Australian market could end up even. Tourism Australia is attempting to stoke domestic demand with a significant campaign, which included an hour-long live TV special, Live from Aus, on Channel Ten on Friday night, encouraging Australians to start making plans for travelling locally. They expect travel to pick up slowly, with day trips followed by regional and interstate travel. Managing director Phillipa Harrison expects people to be keen to get outdoors, explore nature and do things they\u2019ve missed out on, like dining out. However, even though their own polling suggests that 60% of Australians are keen to travel the country as restrictions ease, Harrison is cautious about assuming the local market will make up for the loss of the international one. There will doubtless be an increase in domestic travel, she says, but \u201cit can\u2019t fill the gap of international business entirely\u201d. Dr David Beirman, a lecturer in tourism management at the University of Technology Sydney, agrees that the losses of the year from bushfires, drought and floods, coupled with the continued border lockdown, will be a hole too deep to plug. \u201cWhichever way you look at it \u2013 even if you are the most optimistic person in the world \u2013 we\u2019ve already lost several months of travel,\u201d he says. \u201cThis year is going to be pretty diabolical, even at the most optimistic assessments.\u201d However, he says, there is opportunity for tourism to bounce at least partially back. \u201cPeople will be stir crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re going to want to go somewhere. \u201cHow many people in Sydney go opal mining in Lightning Ridge? Or check out White Cliffs?\u201d he says. \u201cWine tours in the Hunter Valley. Astronomical Tours in Siding Springs. There\u2019s a whole range of experiences that we probably don\u2019t market as effectively as we could.\u201d For some tourism and hospitality operators, business is already showing signs of lifting. Luxury resort and spa in the Blue Mountains, Lilianfels, has already started receiving calls for bookings in June and July. John Fink, the creative director of the Fink Group which includes high-end Sydney restaurants Otto, Bennelong and Firedoor, says many people cannot wait to be able to return to the pleasantries of life. \u201cI\u2019m feeling it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut also, when the word went out that they\u2019re going to start easing restrictions our phones just rang off the hook: \u2018When are you opening?\u2019 \u2018When are you opening?\u2019\u201d Fink\u2019s restaurants predominantly serve local patrons, but a significant minority of guests \u2013 Fink estimates between 10% and 30% depending on the restaurant \u2013 are international. He is confident that as people are finally allowed out of their homes, they will be craving nice experiences, particularly ones where they can connect with friends. Those who haven\u2019t been financially affected by the crisis, he says, will have extra money to spend. \u201cI think Sydney will bounce back,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as everything is safe and everything goes according to plan with the slow easing of restrictions, in the dining scene I can really see Sydney coming back to life.\u201d However, Australia is not just capital cities and hatted restaurants. The regions, particularly tourist towns, have been battered by back-to-back unprecedented crises this year. For the Youth Hostels Association Australia, the crisis has decimated business. The network is reliant on international travellers, who make up two-thirds of their guests. The remaining third is dominated by school and business groups. Just 19 of its 70 hostels are open, catering to a far reduced clientele. The backpacker not-for-profit has put nearly all eligible staff on jobkeeper, stood down others and made redundant yet others still. The regional hostels have fared particularly badly. \u201cWe\u2019re basically bunkering down and really waiting for the borders to open,\u201d says the chief executive, Paul McGrath. While his key market is no longer able to travel to Australia, McGrath is \u201cpretty confident\u201d that domestic travel could make up for the losses of foreign travellers. \u201cPeople are going to want to get out and get into nature or go to the beach,\u201d he says. \u201cJust get out of their suburbs and cities.\u201d YHA is hoping that restrictions on regional travel may lift in time for the July school holidays. If border restrictions ease as winter bites in the southern states, he expects a mass migration to holidays north. If so, they will be encouraging people to support the bush, and marketing to families in earnest for the first time. The organisation is in the process of converting small dormitories into family rooms, as a low-cost option for family travellers. \u201cThat\u2019s where I see a great opportunity \u2013 to capture the attention of families for whom it may have previously been cheaper to go to Bali or Fiji,\u201d he says. And, says McGrath, they will be offering discounts to get people back into their accommodation. \u201cWe will certainly be price driven.\u201d Tourism lecturer Beirman says that YHA is not the only tourism operator likely to be offering deals. \u201cIf you\u2019re a smart consumer, and you have the money, get in early because there\u2019ll be a whole bunch of special deals going on. Regions, hotels, attractions will want to lure people to come to them and I think there\u2019ll be some very good deals in the short term,\u201d he says. However, he says, that discounting won\u2019t last, and travel in Australia may become more expensive in the longer term. \u201cA lot of the tourism businesses which have been making no money for months are going to want to fill back the coffers.\u201d In the meantime, Hackney, who typically has multiple holidays in far-flung destinations a year, is hoping that restrictions are open in time for her parents\u2019 annual holiday to NSW coastal town Forster. \u201cIn the current climate, even something as simple as going to Forster feels like such an immense treat,\u201d she says. Her holidays, she says, will now be slower, more meandering, with a focus on enjoying the things around her. This has been a reset. \u201cThe world has shrunk,\u201d she says. \u201cBut not necessarily in a terrible way.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Australia has been quietly making its influence felt at the World Health Organisation, even as political leaders call for major changes to its operations. Australia is serving a three-year term on the WHO\u2019s executive board and has used the position to push for global action on cervical cancer and reducing preventable blindness. Australia has also been a consistent \u201cchampion of reform\u201d within its upper echelons, the health department says. Scott Morrison recently argued Australia might have suffered the fate of other countries if it had relied on the WHO\u2019s early advice against travel bans to combat Covid-19, and the organisation deserved to be criticised for \u201ca few poor outings lately\u201d, including \u201cunfathomable\u201d comments on wet markets. But the prime minister described Australia as \u201ca constructive but not uncritical partner\u201d, acknowledging the value of the WHO\u2019s work to help Pacific island nations deal with health challenges. He has not followed Donald Trump\u2019s lead in suspending funding to the WHO, although he has said he sympathises with some of the US president\u2019s criticism. Australia has used its position on the executive board, which began in mid-2018, \u201cto support regional health priorities, particularly those of our neighbours in the Pacific\u201d. \u201cAustralia has also been leading global advocacy on two key health issues: cervical cancer and eye health,\u201d the health department says. \u201cAustralia led the development of a resolution on cervical cancer elimination, supported by 50 co-sponsors, which will see the World Health Assembly adopt a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, with clear targets for the period 2020-2030.\u201d The spokesperson says that Australia has co-led, with Indonesia, a resolution focused on addressing the rising global rates of preventable vision impairment and blindness. Australia \u2013 currently represented on the board by the health department\u2019s deputy secretary, Dr Lisa Studdert \u2013 has also strongly supported a range of reform initiatives. The spokesperson says Australia was a founding member state of the WHO, joining in 1948, so it had \u201ca longstanding reputation for actively pursuing global health interests through current and previous terms on the executive board, including our leadership in the establishment of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\u201d. Upholding a reputation John Mackenzie, a Curtin University emeritus professor who has served on WHO emergency committees, says Australia had \u201calways punched above its own weight and been incredibly well thought of when it comes to health\u201d. \u201cSo I think we should use that reputation we have and basically for building up support for WHO, but also making sure that countries that have less ability to respond not only to this outbreak but other diseases, too, that we look after those much more than we have been,\u201d he says. The executive board normally meets twice a year and puts proposals forward to the annual World Health Assembly, where all of the member states decide on motions. The WHO provided several briefings on the latest information on the coronavirus outbreak in late January and early February while delegates were in Geneva to attend the executive board meeting. This year the work of the WHO governing bodies, including the executive board, has shifted \u201cto almost exclusively focus on health responses to Covid-19\u201d, in particular a resolution set to be put before next week\u2019s World Health Assembly. Wrangling over Covid-19 review This assembly \u2013 which will take the form of a virtual meeting because of current travel restrictions \u2013 will be held on Monday and Tuesday and focus on the coronavirus. The health department says Australia has used its current position to advocate to all other executive board members that the resolution should be \u201cprincipally centred on efforts to investigate the source of the epidemic, its transition to a pandemic, and independent review and evaluation of WHO\u2019s global response\u201d. The wording, however, remains under negotiation. China has reacted angrily to Australia\u2019s calls for an independent investigation into the origins and handling of Covid-19, which it says are aimed at Beijing and have been cited in the current trade tensions. But China\u2019s foreign ministry argues the European Union-drafted motion to be dealt with at the World Health Assembly should be viewed in a different light. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing on Tuesday. \u201cYou should not view them together from a political angle.\u201d A draft circulated by the EU in April contained a heavy focus on the ongoing health response to Covid-19 but also included a request for the WHO director general to plan for an evaluation on lessons learnt.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading free-market thinktanks, which backed Margaret Thatcher\u2019s tax-cutting and privatisation agenda and sanctioned the last 10 years of austerity, have lent their support to the government\u2019s plans for unprecedented and sustained increases in public spending. In a shift of stance that will give Rishi Sunak political clearance to ramp up UK debts to levels not seen in peacetime, the Adam Smith Institute, the Centre for Policy Studies, the Institute of Economic Affairs and Policy Exchange said they endorsed public spending increases to confront the coronavirus outbreak and state-funded investment to boost the recovery. The support for widespread state intervention to rescue the economy came as Boris Johnson told backbench Tory MPs there were no plans to impose a public sector wage freeze or other austerity measures to bring down public spending in the crisis. In a call to around 125 members of the 1922 Committee of backbenchers, the Daily Telegraph reported that the prime minister said there was \u201cno question\u201d of a return to austerity, and assured them he would \u201cdouble down\u201d on funding transport projects in the north of England. Johnson addressed MPs after a leaked Treasury memo revealed that some officials were putting in place detailed plans for spending cuts to arrest a public sector deficit expected to climb by at least \u00a3300bn this year. Britain is expected to enter a deep recession following the lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, showed the economy suffering a 35% decline in output between April and the end of June and a rise in unemployment to at least 10%. The cost of measures such as the Treasury\u2019s furlough scheme, which has paid employers to send home over 7 million workers, will send the public spending deficit above 15% this year, 50% higher than the worst period following the 2008 crash. Left-leaning thinktanks and academics have lined up to condemn plans for a return to austerity, saying it would harm the recovery, and adding that further government borrowing would be needed to secure a return to growth after the virus-induced mothballing of the economy. During the last recession, most free market thinktanks buttressed austerity measures imposed by the then chancellor George Osborne, arguing that the public sector deficit should be quickly reduced. Warwick Lightfoot, chief economist at Policy Exchange, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is arguing for a relaunch of austerity. Even an austerity hawk believes it is different this time. \u201cThe last thing you want to do is amplify the prospects of a full-blown depression,\u201d he added. Policy Exchange, founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office chief, Tory peer Francis Maude, former MP Nick Boles and businessman Archie Norman, has a loyal following in the cabinet and has claimed to be behind several recent Tory policies. Lightfoot said low interest rates meant the government could borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure to get the economy back on its feet. Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, founded in the 1970s to promote free-market policies, said: \u201cEven fiscally hawkish people have less of a problem with the current increase in debt levels.\u201d Tom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \u201cI\u2019d usually be wary of big public investment schemes In the current circumstances, though, with borrowing costs very low and little prospect of crowding out private investment, I think the pros outweigh the cons.\u201d The CPS was founded in the 1970s to combat socialism by former MP Keith Joseph, a close friend and supporter of Margaret Thatcher. Echoing left-leaning economists, Lesh said the Bank of England should support the government with loose monetary policy, allowing it to borrow at low interest rates. Julian Jessop, an economics fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs \u2013 a thinktank founded in the 1950s with the support of free-market economist Friedrich Hayek \u2013 said that he was relaxed about the debts built up during the worst of the lockdown. \u201cThere are obvious risks that austerity will restrict growth,\u201d he said. But he was concerned that the government would harm the economy by keeping restrictions on business activity for much of the year, which would delay a bounce-back in economic growth. \u201cThe longer the economy is kept shuttered, the greater the risk that more of the damage will be permanent, making it that much harder to pay for better public services and infrastructure in the future,\u201d he said. The four thinktanks continue to believe the Treasury should examine tax-cutting measures to promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity, saying that over the longer term, Whitehall was poor at allocating funds to the economy in the most effective way.",

How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world.</p> \n   <p>But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-unemployment-and-employment-statistics\">unemployment</a> claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states.

A large nursing home population, accounting for about half the county\u2019s deaths, and densely housed poor people are two main reasons.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38cc411c3adeba2253eebe13d8d8a305b4c6ba50\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38cc411c3adeba2253eebe13d8d8a305b4c6ba50/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus testing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A view of a coronavirus drive-through testing site in Los Angeles.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec014a98f0886ce4f5d4d95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-16T16:30:21.662Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Trump machine continues to hammer away at presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.</strong> Only days after launching a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-2020-campaign-strategy-attack-biden\">barrage of negative digital ads</a> questioning the former vice-president\u2019s mental acuity, Donald Trump Jr came in hot on Saturday morning with an Instagram post suggesting Biden is a pedophile.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CAP6ERslm-v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

That includes some rural districts of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a> state even though the world\u2019s hotspot for <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a></strong> - the Big Apple - is still under max restrictions. This comes while states are under intense pressure from <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a></strong> to reopen, but after a week of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/coronavirus-us-live-fauci-testify-danger-reopening-early-trump-tweets-cuomo-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836#block-5ebab9608f08d99d46a15836\">warnings</a> from America\u2019s top public health experts that rushing to lift stay-at-home orders without a sustained decline in new cases risks \u201cserious consequences\u201d. And an Associated Press analysis found that 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fall short of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a></strong> testing levels that experts say are necessary to avoid another wave of outbreaks.</li> \n   <li>Donald Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he is up and very, very busy tweeting and retweeting. Perhaps the most arresting one so far is a retweet of an article that says: \u201cThe fact is that we already have more compelling evidence that the Obama administration engaged in misconduct than we ever did for opening the Russian-collusion investigation.\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1261606781979168771\">tweeted</a>: \u201cSo true!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/trump-obama-obsession-coronavirus-president\"><strong>Here</strong></a>\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith\">David Smith</a> this morning on 45\u2019s obsession with 44 as the election looms... </li> \n   <li>Talking of <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a></strong>, the former president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/1257687918388424707\">will give</a> a virtual <strong>commencement address</strong> this afternoon at 2pm ET for students graduating from America\u2019s Historically Black Universities and Colleges (<strong>HBCU</strong>).

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a look at today\u2019s biggest news items: Obama criticizes Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus crisis response. At an online \u2018virtual\u2019 commencement ceremony for HBCUs this afternoon, the former US president ripped his successor\u2019s actions on the pandemic, saying: \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d Justin Amash will not run as third-party candidate for president. The former Republican said he will not run as a third-party candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election, assuaging fears among Democrats that he would help return Trump to power in this November\u2019s election. New York tourist arrested in Hawaii for violating local quarantine rule. The island state, with 638 Covid-19 cases, has been cracking down on those who refuse to comply with the 14-day mandated isolation. US states begin to reopen amid contact tracing programs scramble. Patchwork of efforts as states left to devise own programs and local health department are still hiring people to test and trace contacts. Barack Obama delivered a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors on Saturday when he criticized the Trump administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic during an online commencement address to graduates of 78 historically black colleges and universities. A just-published story from my colleague Jessica Glenza has further details. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities.\u201d As he continued, Obama criticized federal response efforts to the pandemic: \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge,\u201d he said. The speech was the first of two addresses Obama was due to give on Saturday. He is also scheduled to take part in a prime time special for high-school graduates that starts at 8pm Eastern on all the major TV networks. The White House says Donald Trump\u2019s latest firing of a federal watchdog came following a recommendation by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. \u201cSecretary Pompeo recommended the move, and President Trump agreed,\u201d an administration official said on Saturday after two top Democrats announced a probe into Trump\u2019s dismissal of Steve Linick, the state department\u2019s inspector general, on Friday night. New York representative Eliot Engel and New Jersey senator Bob Menendez said the decision \u201cmay be an illegal act of retaliation\u201d in letters to the White House, the state department and the inspector general\u2019s office announcing the investigation, asking that administration officials provide all records related to the firing to the committees by Friday, according to the AP. The results of more than 35,000 Covid-19 tests ordered by a Florida-based health care system and performed by a third-party lab are unreliable, the company said Saturday. The Associated Press reports: According to AdventHealth, a faith-based health care system, the situation has created unacceptable delays. AdventHealth didnt name the third-party lab but said it had terminated its contract with the lab. The tests were a mixture of positive and negative results, and some had been at the lab for a while. About 25,000 of the unreliable tests were in the central Florida area. AdventHealth president and CEO Terry Shaw said the company will notify patients who are impacted. AdventHealth has 49 hospitals in nine states. Company spokeswoman Melanie Lawhorn said two of those states are joint venture systems and were not affected by the unreliable testing. On Saturday, Florida\u2019s department of health reported more than 600 new coronavirus cases in the past 24-hour period, lifting the overall count to 44,811. A total of 1,964 people have died from the virus, up 47 from Friday. US swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin helped bring Donald Trump to power in 2016. How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith. Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world. But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted unemployment claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as Georgia and Texas were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen. \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d Trump said in the White House rose garden on Friday while announcing a major US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine. Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps. \u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump. \u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again\u2019. Barack Obama also commented in his virtual commencement address just now on the cold-blood shooting of Ahmaud Arbery that has sparked widespread horror and outrage. Arbery, a black man shot and killed while jogging in Georgia by a white former police officer and his son, was 25. After he was killed, it took local authorities more than two months to file charges, a move that followed shocking video footage of the shooting emerging into the public domain. Obama made the comments at a virtual commencement ceremony for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as he acknowledged the dual crises graduates now face after leaving college \u2013 the Covid-19 pandemic and a historic economic downturn. Let\u2019s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country... We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities,\u201d said Obama. \u201cJust as we see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn\u2019t submit to their questioning. Injustice like this isn\u2019t new.\u201d At an online \u201cvirtual\u201d commencement ceremony for Historically Black College and Universities this afternoon, the former US president, Barack Obama, told graduates moments ago about his successor administration\u2019s actions on the pandemic: More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d The takedown of the Trump administration\u2019s response to the pandemic is a rare rebuke from a former president. It follows Obama\u2019s leaked remarks last week that the government response to Covid-19 had been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d. But Saturday\u2019s remarks were made openly to likely thousands of graduating students tuned in online. While a majority of North American thoroughbred tracks have been shuttered during the pandemic, Churchill Downs and Santa Anita Park resumed live racing on Saturday in what the Associated Press says could be a lifeline for owners and trainers with smaller barns who have been suffering without steady income. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, hopefully,\u201d Maryland-based owner and trainer Linda Gaudet said from Kentucky, where she\u2019s preparing for racing to return Saturday at Churchill Downs. \u201cThe owners and the trainers and the riders, they need to get back to work, make a living.\u201d A mix of government restrictions and positive Covid-19 results stopped racing in Kentucky, Maryland, New York, California and elsewhere in March, and Gaudet said \u201cit\u2019s been a long two months.\u201d Racing without fans continued only at a handful of tracks, including Florida\u2019s Gulfstream Park and Tampa Bay Downs and Arkansas\u2019 Oaklawn Park. Trainer Norm Casse recently said from Florida that as long as some tracks are running, he\u2019s able to keep his operation going. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s probably an industry in the country that\u2019s not affected by this in some way, shape or form,\u201d Norm Casse said. \u201cYou take comfort in the fact that you know you\u2019re not alone, that everybody\u2019s going to be making sacrifices. Everybody probably stands to lose a little something from all of this and just be grateful to be in the position we were in to begin with.\u201d Some are in better position than others. Deep-pocketed owners and big-time trainers like two-time Triple Crown winner Bob Baffert can handle the reduction in racing. It\u2019s more concerning for the small businesses throughout the industry, from owners and trainers to jockeys, grooms and other employees. \u201cThose businesses don\u2019t have the financial flexibility, perhaps the cash reserves, to weather this storm for longer than a month or two,\u201d National Thoroughbred Racing Association president and CEO Alex Waldrop said. \u201cIf this extends past May into June or July, you\u2019re going to see attrition. You\u2019re going to see people who aren\u2019t going to be able to remain viable business operations.\u201d Congressmen announces examination of watchdog firing by Trump Representative Eliot Engel of New York, a Democrat and the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee (as well as a leading figure in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump at the start of the year), announced that the committee would be probing the firing last night of the State Department inspector general, Steve Linick. In a statement, Engel said: \u201cThis firing is the outrageous act of a president trying to protect one of his most loyal supporters, the Secretary of State, from accountability. I have learned that the Office of the Inspector General had opened an investigation into Secretary Pompeo. Mr. Linick\u2019s firing amid such a probe strongly suggests that this is an unlawful act of retaliation. \u201cThis president believes he is above the law. As he systematically removes the official independent watchdogs from the Executive Branch, the work of the Committee on Foreign Affairs becomes that much more critical. In the days ahead, I will be looking into this matter in greater detail, and I will press the State Department for answers. \u201cI thank Mr. Linick for his distinguished service.\u201d The US House foreign relations committee has just announced an investigation into the firing last night of Donald Trump\u2019s inspector general at the State Department, Reuters reports. Steve Linick was ousted last night as the department\u2019s internal watchdog. He had been reportedly looking into the actions of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. According to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan. More details as they emerge. Justin Amash has announced that he will not run as a third-party candidate in this year\u2019s presidential election. Some had feared the former Republican\u2019s campaign would help return Donald Trump to power in this November\u2019s election, an accusation Amash denied. \u201cWashington is totally dysfunctional,\u201d Amash told CNN\u2019s State of the Union earlier this month. \u201cThat\u2019s why I left the Republican party, because there was this partisan death spiral. \u201cWe need someone who\u2019s going to come in as president, respect our constitution, defend our rights, and fix our representative system of government so that people will actually feel represented at home. And I know that millions of Americans want that.\u201d On Saturday, he said he had reconsidered his decision. \u201cAfter much reflection, I\u2019ve concluded that circumstances don\u2019t lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year, and therefore I will not be a candidate,\u201d the Michigan congressman tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve spent nearly three weeks assessing the race, appearing in media, talking to delegates and donors, watching the Libertarian Party\u2019s convention plan unfold, and gathering feedback from family, friends, and other advisers,\u201d he added. Amash was the first Republican congressman to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump. Barack Obama is due to make a speech today during an online commencement for HBCUs. You can follow the speech here on a livestream. David Smith has detailed Donald Trump\u2019s obsession with his predecessor. As David puts it: \u201cObservers point to a mix of anti-intellectualism, racism, vengeance and primitive envy over everything from Obama\u2019s Nobel peace prize to the scale of his inauguration crowd and social media following.\u201d You can read the full article below: New Orleans is making its first steps towards reopening today. Cafes, restaurants and nail salons can serve customers but only those who have made reservations. Casinos, concert venues and bars are still closed, however, and people are still recommended to stay home when possible. Louisiana has been badly affected by Covid-19 with 2,448 deaths recorded so far. However, fatalities have been falling for some time, prompting the partial reopening. New Jersey, the state with the second most deaths from Covid-19 in the US, has reported some (relatively) positive news. In Saturday\u2019s press briefing Governor Phil Murphy said hospitalization, ICU occupancy and ventilation rates were all down \u201cdramatically\u201d over the last few weeks. However, on a more sobering note, he pointed out that more than 10,000 people have died from Covid-19 in New Jersey since the start of the pandemic. Only New York has reported more deaths. \u201cWe cannot let those we have lost ever just become a statistic,\u201d wrote Murphy on Twitter. \u201cThey were real people, with real families, and with tremendous stories.\u201d He also said that $2.8m has been allocated to mental health services during the pandemic. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has announced an increase to the country\u2019s child benefit, which was introduced four years ago, to help families struggling because of the pandemic. \u201cTo all the moms and dads out there: This means that your monthly CCB payments will go up this July to help you pay for things like food, clothes, and activities you and your family can do together at home. And next week, you\u2019ll get an extra one-time payment of $300 per child,\u201d Trudeau wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou should be able to focus on what matters most right now: raising your kids and keeping your family healthy. And by increasing your monthly CCB payments, we\u2019re making sure that\u2019s exactly what you can do,\u201d he added. Canada\u2019s death toll has increased to 5,595, up from 5,499, as the country\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to 74,993 from 73,818, according to Reuters. Los Angeles has become the first major US city to allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested for Covid-19 as often as they want. \u201cSo long as COVID-19 spreads, we have to scale up our response \u2013 and because this disease can be a silent killer, we have carefully built the capacity to get more people tested,\u201d LA mayor Eric Garcetti said. \u201cNo one should have to wait, wonder, or risk infecting others. Don\u2019t leave it to chance. Schedule a test.\u201d The AP reports: A website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation\u2019s second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn\u2019t get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others. But despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn\u2019t show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren\u2019t being used each week, according to figures provided to the Associated Press by the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cWasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,\u201d said Dr Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. \u201cI applaud what they\u2019re doing. The more people tested the better.\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti\u2019s vow to not let a test go to waste was the result of a partnership with a start-up company that developed an easy-to-administer test that doesn\u2019t rely on scarce supplies. But it was a significant departure from stricter state criteria and guidelines set by the health department the city shares with the county to limit tests to those who need them most. It comes at a time when expanded testing is a cornerstone of the state\u2019s plan to ease its stay-at-home order and as Los Angeles County has become the epicenter of the virus outbreak and lags progress the rest of the state has shown. While the virus was initially worse in Northern California, LA County, home to a quarter of the state\u2019s nearly 40 million residents, now accounts for more than half the state\u2019s deaths and a case count growing more rapidly than other major state counties. A large nursing home population, accounting for about half the county\u2019s deaths, and densely housed poor people are two main reasons. The Trump machine continues to hammer away at presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Only days after launching a barrage of negative digital ads questioning the former vice-president\u2019s mental acuity, Donald Trump Jr came in hot on Saturday morning with an Instagram post suggesting Biden is a pedophile. The Triggered author went on to clarify, via Twitter, that it was only a joke. New York governor Andrew Cuomo reports that hospitalizations, intubations and new coronavirus cases are continuing to trend downward across the state during his daily press briefing from Albany. He adds that 157 people died of Covid-19 in the last 24-hour period, pushing the overall toll past 22,400: \u201cThat number has been stubborn.\u201d Horse racing tracks across New York state will be permitted to open as of 1 June without fans. Same for Watkins Glen International race track in the Finger Lakes region, which clears the way for the Nascar race originally scheduled for August to take place. \u201cYou want to increase economic activity as much as you can without spiking the infection rate,\u201d he says. Outside the state capitol building, anti-shutdown protesters are making themselves heard. Ohio\u2019s prison system will resume accepting inmates from county jails to begin their prison sentences beginning on Monday. The practice had been suspended in an effort to reduce overcrowding amid the coronavirus outbreak. The Associated Press reports: On Monday, the state will take up to 50 inmates a day at the Correctional Reception Center in central Ohio. Authorities will hold inmates a minimum of 35 days before transferring them to facilities around the state based on their security level and other factors. The agency needs to resume housing inmates as Ohio courts reopen, says JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. \u201cReopening the reception process will be done in a gradual controlled manner while we continue to carefully monitor county jail operations,\u201d Smith said. The announcement comes even as positive cases of Covid-19 continue to rise in Ohio prisons along with inmate deaths. More than 4,500 inmates system-wide have tested positive or nearly one in 10. Some 60 inmates have died across seven institutions. A 23-year-old man was arrested in the state earlier this week after, as CNN reports, he posted beach pictures on Instagram when he was supposed to be in quarantine. The 23-year-old man was arrested for violating Hawaii\u2019s mandatory 14-day quarantine rule and for \u201cunsworn falsification to authority,\u201d the Hawaii governor\u2019s office said in a statement. He arrived in O\u2019ahu on Monday and posted pictures of himself on the beach. He allegedly used public transportation to get to the many places he was pictured, the statement said. \u201cAuthorities became aware of his social media posts from citizens who saw posts of him -- on the beach with a surfboard, sunbathing, and walking around Waikiki at night,\u201d the statement said. Tarique Peters of the Bronx borough of New York City was arrested along with a local man who was with him, and charges are pending against him. Peters was booked and his bail is set at $4,000. Hawai\u2018i Attorney General Clare Connors said, \u201cWe appreciate the assistance of local people who spot flagrant violations of our emergency rules on various social media sites and report them to the appropriate authorities.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s Friday night delights The president has a habit \u2013 firing watchdogs when the fewest amount of eyeballs are on the news. Last night it was the turn of Steve Linick at the State Department, although fortunately the Guardian\u2019s world affairs editor, Julian Borger, rests with one eye open and filed this report in short order, which was launch into the public domain by my colleagues in Australia (the Guardian never sleeps, Mr President). And the Washington Post has noted some of the other recent timings of inspectors general being axed under cover of darkness and relative Friday night torpor among news audiences. Julian notes in his piece that, according to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal last night, Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan. Linick is to be replaced by Stephen Akard, a close ally of the vice-president, Mike Pence, from his home state of Indiana. A state department spokesperson said that Akard, who has been running the office for foreign missions, would take over immediately as acting inspector general. Good morning, US live blog readers, we\u2019ll bring you all the US politics and coronavirus news here today and there is a lot going on in America this weekend, so stay tuned. Here\u2019s what is developing so far: Almost all US states are engaging in some form of reopening for business by the end of this weekend - 48 states, excluding Massachusetts and Connecticut. That includes some rural districts of New York state even though the world\u2019s hotspot for coronavirus - the Big Apple - is still under max restrictions. This comes while states are under intense pressure from Donald Trump to reopen, but after a week of warnings from America\u2019s top public health experts that rushing to lift stay-at-home orders without a sustained decline in new cases risks \u201cserious consequences\u201d. And an Associated Press analysis found that 41 of the nation\u2019s 50 states fall short of the Covid-19 testing levels that experts say are necessary to avoid another wave of outbreaks. Donald Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he is up and very, very busy tweeting and retweeting. Perhaps the most arresting one so far is a retweet of an article that says: \u201cThe fact is that we already have more compelling evidence that the Obama administration engaged in misconduct than we ever did for opening the Russian-collusion investigation.\u201d Trump tweeted: \u201cSo true!\u201d Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s David Smith this morning on 45\u2019s obsession with 44 as the election looms... Talking of Barack Obama, the former president will give a virtual commencement address this afternoon at 2pm ET for students graduating from America\u2019s Historically Black Universities and Colleges (HBCU). Then at 8pm ET he joins some other luminaries to give another virtual commencement address for the US\u2019s high schoolers who are graduating. It\u2019s some consolation for the students who aren\u2019t able to gather in person for the usual celebratory ceremonies. And the fall-out will continue from the Trump administration\u2019s firing overnight of the state department watchdog Steve Linick.",
