      "bodyText": "When Grant Robertson, New Zealand\u2019s finance minister, unveiled his last annual budget he told the country that its success would no longer be measured by economic growth and productivity, but instead by the wellbeing of the nation\u2019s population. A year on and one day before he reveals his new spending plan, Robertson\u2019s so-called wellbeing budget \u2013 a concept he intended would frame his fiscal policy for every future year of his term managing the country\u2019s books \u2013 faces an extraordinary and unexpected test: a dire global economic outlook caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, with local jobless numbers already topping those seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. It is a high-stakes document ahead of an election in September, which will function as a referendum on Robertson\u2019s ability to cushion the economy from fallout from plummeting tourism and paralysed industry. But far from abandoning the wellbeing approach, Robertson told the Guardian that the \u201chorrendous crisis that no one would have wanted to go through\u201d presented an opportunity for change in a country that appears to have largely quashed the spread of Covid-19. He cited child poverty, expensive housing, polluted waterways and rising emissions as matters to address in a pre-budget speech to a business audience early this month. \u201cIn other words, we are not quite the nation we like to think we are,\u201d he said. But, speaking to the Guardian, Robertson cautioned that due to the pandemic some of his objectives \u2013 he would not specify which \u2013 would have to wait . \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t overestimate our ability to do it and do it quickly because we still have to recover,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is a chance to look at some of those long-run issues in our economy and our society like poor productivity, like inequality, and like our inability to reduce our emissions, and say what can we do in this moment to change that?\u201d While prime minister Jacinda Ardern has garnered global praise for her leadership amid the pandemic, she faces a tough task rebooting the $200bn economy, which is dependent on trade and tourism, with growth expected to slow significantly and hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost. Robertson said it was important to prove to voters that Labour has a plan for recovery. But his budget will look very different to those that came before, and last year\u2019s carefully mapped wellbeing framework would not remain entirely intact, he said. New spending to reduce child poverty, bolster mental health, and transition to a low-carbon economy will remain, but some initiatives had been \u201cput on ice\u201d. Robertson, who was elected to parliament in 2008, is enthusiastic about discussing the finer points of policy. A former student politician, he worked for New Zealand\u2019s foreign ministry and later represented the country at the United Nations. He is also minister for his beloved sports \u2013 he met his partner, Alf, at a rugby match. Pre-budget announcements have been much more sparing than usual, but they have included a $4bn boost for the health system and $200m to combat family violence. Robertson said the more than $20bn he has already committed since Covid-19 reached New Zealand \u2013 half of it on wage subsidies for struggling firms \u2013 was \u201cfar in excess\u201d of what a government would normally spend on its entire budget. He would not \u201csugar coat\u201d the resulting blowout in the national deficit, he said, and also cautioned that the treasury forecasts for the economy released on budget day would paint a \u201cchallenging\u201d path to recovery. Previous models by officials have predicted unemployment rates of between 8.5% and 26% following the pandemic and strict lockdown. Analysts said the wellbeing approach would now come under pressure in an economy where more people were vulnerable due to the coronavirus than a year ago. \u201cLots of other countries were crying out for an economic approach that centred on something more than growth,\u201d said Max Harris, a New Zealand political commentator. \u201cBut understandably that focus meant there were expectations raised in New Zealand for an improvement in wellbeing across the board.\u201d The government must now deliver results for those who for years \u201chave been left out by budgets of a more ordinary kind,\u201d he said. \u201cIf their concerns were addressed, that would give people confidence that wellbeing is more than just a frame.\u201d But economists said Robertson could not afford to look too far into the distance, and the budget\u2019s success in improving wellbeing would depend on his short-term spending. \u201cOne of the greatest contributors to a lack of wellbeing is unemployment,\u201d said Arthur Grimes, a professor at Victoria University, Wellington and a former chairman of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few things that people don\u2019t recover from.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s strict lockdown has restricted deaths to only 21 but the government\u2019s detractors say the strident measures have come at too high a cost to business. \u201cWe may have flattened the curve as a nation but with 1,000 people a day joining the dole queue and employers deciding whether they battle on or give up, it is clear lockdown has gone on too long,\u201d the opposition leader, Simon Bridges of the National party, said.

      "bodyText": "How do you preserve a pandemic? Libraries, museums and historical associations around the world are struggling to survive right now but they\u2019re also asking themselves this critical question. They know future generations will inevitably study Covid-19 \u2013 so what are the moments and materials we should capture for people in the future, and how can we capture them? Collecting institutions around Australia have launched a series of projects aimed at creating coronavirus archives, and key to the ongoing efforts are the contributions of the general public. The State Library of Victoria is working to enlist an army of citizen collectors who can help it gather Covid-19 related materials. This is the idea behind Memory Bank: A Collective Isolation Project, the library\u2019s major pandemic archiving project. \u201cA citizen collector really needs to be an anthropologist for the future and to think about the kinds of things that we take for granted that someone in the future may find absolutely fascinating,\u201d says a senior curator, Carolyn Fraser. She lists leaflets, pamphlets and temporary take-out menus as examples of items that the library might be interested in acquiring. In addition to asking people to hold on to pandemic paraphernalia, the library is also releasing a series of weekly prompts which will encourage people to share details about their pandemic lives. The first prompt was \u201cWhat\u2019s in your fridge or pantry today?\u201d Few of us would think to photograph our fridge or pantry, but knowing what\u2019s in there could be useful for future scholars. \u201cThings like receipts and shopping lists that, within the context of an archive, are really, really telling for people beyond this moment, may seem like rubbish to us now,\u201d Fraser says. Dr Peter Hobbins, a medical historian, is also working to preserve pandemic-related ephemera. He started the #covidstreetarchive, a grassroots project encouraging people to photograph their streets and neighbourhoods, and to share their snaps on social media. The hashtag is filled with images of familiar sites: \u201cclosed\u201d signs in shopfronts, empty streets and teddy bears in windows. \u201cThe idea behind the #covidstreetarchive comes out of having been a historian who has studied the 1918-19 influenza pandemic and being aware that there are huge gaps in how we understand what it was like living through that period,\u201d Hobbins says. He notes that our understanding of domestic life and the impact of the 1918 flu on businesses is particularly limited, and he hopes that starting Covid-19 archiving efforts now will help minimise similar gaps for future historians. In many ways, we\u2019re already primed to preserve a pandemic. Smartphones and social media make it easy for us to share details about our daily lives. The New South Wales State Library embarked on a similar project to Hobbins\u2019, asking people to share pictures from self-isolation on social media using the hashtag #NSWathome.

I am a little upset and rather disappointed \u2026 I feel for those who are experiencing loss under such strict conditions.\u201d Tipene wrote on her Instagram page. \u201cWhat really sucks is \u2026 I can go to public venues of up to 100 people but I cannot attend a tanihanga/funeral that consists of more than 10 people.\u201d Tanihanga is a sacred part of the grieving process for M\u0101ori families which has changed little since colonisation, and usually lasts for three days, and can involve hundreds of people gathering on the deceased\u2019s marae. During lockdown level 3 and 4 police issued warnings at a number of large funeral gatherings, which the government have said pose a major health risk during a pandemic, as friends and families \u201cnaturally\u201d want to hug, comfort and grieve intimately. Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said it causes her great anguish to place limits on funerals, and she has had correspondence from people all over the country asking her to allow larger gatherings. \u201cThe thing I have found, as a human, hardest in all of this has been funerals and tangihanga,\u201d Ardern said on Monday, appearing genuinely moved. \u201cThe one thing I also know is that funerals and tangi are a place where you want to comfort people, that is your natural instinct that\u2019s why we come together.\u201d \u201cWe know this is causing pain. This is only intended, we hope, to be for a very, very short period.\u201d The Funeral Directors Association of New Zealand have criticised the government\u2019s decision, describing it as \u201ca cruel and heartless blow to the thousands of New Zealand families who have lost loved ones\u201d. Following growing public criticism, the health ministry announced late on Wednesday that mourners could increase from ten to 50, with strict public health measures to be enforced, including handwashing and social distancing practices. \u201cFunerals are exceptional events and have been one of the most difficult areas of restriction that we\u2019ve considered as we try to avoid the double tragedy of losing a loved one and spreading the virus,\u201d said Dr David Clark, the health minister. \u201cThe strength of our response to this virus has been in our agility to respond and we have listened to the concerns of the 10-person limit for funerals and moved on that - while emphasising they still pose a significant risk in setting us back.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "On the hill above Bruce Pascoe\u2019s farm near Mallacoota in Victoria\u2019s East Gippsland, there\u2019s a sea of mandadyan nalluk. Translated from Yuin, the language of the country, it means \u201cdancing grass\u201d. Pascoe and his small team of coworkers have never done a harvest like this before. There\u2019s so much grass that both sheds are full, and Pascoe says they are \u201cracing against the clock to refine our methods so we can extract the seed and make the flour. We have got to get this done in two or three weeks before the seed completely drops.\u201d Bruce Pascoe with his dog Yambulla in the mandadyan nalluk grass on the hill above his property. The team had a ceremony for the the beginning of the harvest because they think it\u2019s the first time in 200 years that mandadyan nalluk has been harvested for food. \u201cAnd some of these people are descended from those who would have done the last harvest,\u201d Pascoe says. \u201cThat\u2019s what this farm is all about \u2013 trying to make sure that Aboriginal people are part of the resurgence in these grains, rather than being on the periphery and being dispossessed again.\u201d Pascoe and his Yuin co-worker Terry map out where to harvest the mandadyan nalluk. Pascoe (second from left) and co-workers (from left) Chris, Terry and Kate plan their morning on the property. They had intended to harvest a different, more promising crop of kangaroo grass but it was destroyed by the summer\u2019s catastrophic bushfires. As a CFA volunteer, Pascoe spent weeks on the fire and recovery efforts. His sheds burned down but his house survived. \u201cIt was terrible. Terrible. All the days merged into one. Here it went for five or six weeks. The days were indistinguishable. Everyone was just racing around, trying to fight a fire here, fight a fire there, save a house here, save a house there. It just went on and on and on. The people of Mallacoota have done it really tough. [They] are just recovering, and will still be recovering in a decade.\u201d As he battled the fires, Pascoe was under increasingly vitriolic attack over his 2014 book Dark Emu, which used historical sources, including the journals of explorers, to show that Aboriginal people engaged in complex agriculture and were not just hunter-gatherers. Terry looks into the harvest hopper, and burning chaff from seed. The personal attacks, largely driven by the Herald Sun columnist Andrew Bolt and a prominent Aboriginal businesswoman, Josephine Cashman, escalated. Cashman asked the Australian federal police to investigate allegations that Pascoe had received financial benefit from claiming to be Aboriginal. The AFP said Pascoe\u2019s Aboriginality \u201cwas not relevant in determining whether a commonwealth offence had been committed, as such there was no need to undertake these inquiries\u201d. Then the provenance of a letter Bolt and Cashman relied on to denounce Pascoe was called into question by NITV. Cashman was removed from the senior advisory body to the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt. Pascoe looks at the chaff from the burning seed. Pascoe had little to say publicly at the time and withdrew from some scheduled appearances. But he says book sales went up and he could afford to hire four young people to work with him. \u201cWhen Andrew Bolt attacked me a lot of Australians took it as a personal attack on them, because a lot of people have read Dark Emu,\u201d he says. \u201cThe same people, booksellers have been telling me, bought 10 copies as Christmas presents. The road out of the farm near Mallacoota in East Gippsland. \u201cSales boomed around that time so I was making money, and all of that money is going into wages. And wages then go back into Eden [across the NSW border] and they\u2019re spent on the children, at shops where the shopkeepers are battling their guts out to stay alive, so I feel a lot of good has come out.\u201d But Pascoe says it was \u201cthe worst, worst time of my life\u201d. \u201cIt was hard for me, that period,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to downplay it. I\u2019m not trying to say I\u2019m this resilient character because I\u2019m not. But I was totally supported by Aboriginal community. Not every Aboriginal person, obviously, because people tell me that social media was rife with other opinions. But basically the elders stuck by me firm, and some of them came down here, some of them stopped me in the street, to tell me to keep doing what I was doing.\u201d Pascoe says he took solace from the number of Australians \u201cwho want their children to learn a better history, a more true history\u201d. Pascoe in the mandadyan nalluk with his neighbour\u2019s dog at sunset. \u201cIt\u2019s a wave that is washing over these dinosaurs,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s an extinction event happening, and the dinosaur, of course, is never aware of his demise.\u201d Pascoe\u2019s team has been able to work right through the coronavirus: \u201cWe just carry on. This is a very isolated farm and we\u2019re isolated on it, so it\u2019s pretty good.\u201d This week they milled some of the mandadyan nalluk seed into flour and baked a loaf of bread. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful bread. It\u2019s a really dark, rye-like flour. Incredibly dark, incredibly aromatic, but also very tasty,\u201d Pascoe says, and it\u2019s not like anything he has smelled before. Pascoe inside his kitchen with the glowing mandadyan nalluk view. He gets seven or eight requests a day from bakers and restaurateurs to supply seed or flour, which they will do when they get the milling right. He also wants to show local farmers that letting these plants grow is worth the effort. \u201cIn future years it\u2019ll be commonplace because we can grow these grasses on degraded land. I think there are a lot of farmers on marginal land now. They want some consistency, and they want reduced costs. Perennial grain is a way to do that.\u201d Pascoe slices the loaf of bread made from the mandadyan nalluk flour. The dancing grass is only one of several perennials the team is working with, including kangaroo grass, warrigal greens, samphires and water ribbons. \u201cWe cooked with murnong the other day in a recipe we hadn\u2019t tried before and it was sensational,\u201d Pascoe says. \u201cWater ribbon tubers are absolutely delicious. We found a plant, we still don\u2019t know what it is, which came back after the fires, a lovely little onion type thing, absolutely sensational. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new about it at all, but we ignored it. We turned our back on anything of Aboriginal provenance, such was our sensitivity to the history of the country. \u201cIt\u2019s time to embrace the history of the country, and with that we will be able to embrace its food.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Most state and territory governments say they are not using the Covid-19 tests brought to Australia by the billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest at a $200m cost to taxpayers, which the Guardian can reveal have been sent to the national medical stockpile rather than the coronavirus frontline. When announcing the purchase last month, the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said the tests would be used to help state public health units test throughout 2020. But weeks later most states say they are not using the type of tests purchased by Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation, which were on-sold at cost to the government. Some say they have no need for any additional tests. The federal health department has told Guardian Australia the tests bought by Forrest have been added to a strategic reserve. The mining magnate announced last month that he had secured 10m Covid-19 PCR tests for Australia from the Chinese manufacturer Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) at a cost of $200m, which would be refunded by the federal government. Forrest and his philanthropic arm, the Minderoo Foundation, had set about securing the tests for the government at a time of extreme global demand, and when it was unclear whether Australia\u2019s crisis would be as severe as in nations like the US and Italy. During last month\u2019s announcement Forrest said the new tests would give governments the confidence to \u201clift restrictions to rapidly expedite getting the country back to work\u201d. Hunt said the tests would allow public health units to test for the rest of the year. \u201cWhat these 10m tests will do is allow our state and territory public health units to be able to test right through 2020, to provide us with the capacity to contain and suppress and defeat the virus,\u201d Hunt said. But Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have all told Guardian Australia they are not using the BGI tests. Victoria was the only state to confirm use of BGI tests. Some states went as far as to say they weren\u2019t needed at all. The WA health department said it had sufficient capacity without the BGI equipment. \u201cPathWest \u2013 Western Australia\u2019s leading pathology laboratory \u2013 is not using the BGI-manufactured Covid-19 PCR testing kits,\u201d the department said. \u201cPathWest has capacity and sufficient reagent to provide testing throughout the state without the need to use these tests.\u201d Queensland Health said it had \u201cample\u201d testing capacity already and wasn\u2019t using the BGI tests. \u201cQueensland Health does not use the BGI Covid-19 test or its operating platform,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cQueensland already has ample testing capacity, illustrated by the world leading figures of 137,000 Covid-19 tests since January.\u201d Tasmania and South Australia did not respond by deadline. The federal government told the Guardian that the BGI tests were acquired for the national medical stockpile, a strategic reserve of medical equipment. \u201cThis acquisition will enable Australia to diversify Covid-19 testing supplies in an area where there are uncertain supply lines and shortages globally,\u201d a health department spokesman said. A spokesman for the Minderoo Foundation said: \u201cIt is incredibly important, especially during the challenges the country is facing from Covid-19, that we all pull together and get through this crisis. \u201cThis is why we are working closely with the government to help save lives where we can and provide testing kits to help the government reopen the economy. \u201cIt is why we are also working hard to maintain positive relationships with all parties to manage what is in Australia\u2019s national interest.\u201d This month, the Guardian revealed the Australian government had agreed to buy 500,000 Covid-19 antibody test kits \u2013 a different type of testing to the PCR tests procured by Forrest \u2013 from Promedical, a company run by a convicted rapist and a former business partner of the services minister, Stuart Robert. Promedical was fined by the TGA last week for falsely claiming to have approvals. The company initially had authority \u2013 later rescinded \u2013 to supply the \u201cpoint-of-care\u201d antibody tests made by a Chinese company, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech. The government agreed to purchase the Wondfo tests from Promedical, but since that deal collapsed has refused to enter into a replacement deal with other authorised suppliers, on the grounds that point of care tests were no longer needed. One of those suppliers, Tayler Dental Consulting, told Guardian Australia it remained unclear how any company managed to strike a deal to provide tests. \u201cWe have contacted the various state health departments and sent emails to Greg Hunt to no avail.

      "bodyText": "Public confidence in the planned 5G network has been significantly undermined by a strong misinformation campaign, an Australian parliamentary committee has admitted. The House of Representatives committee was established last year to examine the plans for 5G networks in Australia, currently under construction by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, but the committee received hundreds of submissions from members of the public and groups concerned about perceived health issues associated with 5G networks. MPs have also reported being \u201cbombarded\u201d with letters complaining about the rollout of 5G. At hearings held by the committee, those opposed to 5G argued that so-called small cells for the network on every street would make it impossible for them to avoid being \u201cexposed\u201d to 5G, and that rollouts should be stopped until more research was done into the health effects of 5G. In the report tabled in parliament on Tuesday evening, the committee, chaired by Nationals MP David Gillespie, expressed concern about 5G misinformation. \u201cCommunity confidence in 5G has been shaken by extensive misinformation preying on the fears of the public spread via the internet, and presented as facts, particularly through social media,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe communication of the reality of 5G has been neglected, allowing fears over health and safety, the technology involved and the application of 5G to take hold. Misinformation has filled the vacuum and public confidence in 5G has been shaken.\u201d The report goes into significant detail to address some of the concerns put forward by those opposed to 5G, including pointing out that the impact of non-ionising radiation has been heavily researched. Initially 5G will operate in the same spectrum band as 4G, and although it will move to higher frequencies in a few years, the report notes \u201chigher frequencies do not mean higher exposure levels\u201d. The report also counters several of the reports provided by opponents of 5G on the alleged health impacts. \u201cUnfortunately, a vast amount of misinformation about the safety and impact of 5G is out there,\u201d the committee said. \u201cPerhaps some confusion comes from the new spectrum bands 5G will use. The committee heard that \u2018higher frequency does not mean higher power\u2019, and that, in fact, devices will operate at a lower power due to focusing the 5G signal only to where it is required and the increased number of antennae, which means that users will have less exposure than under previous generations of mobile technology. \u201cThe committee has been assured that 5G is safe.\u201d In December last year, the federal communications minister, Paul Fletcher, announced $9m in funding to address misinformation about the health impact of telecommunications networks, including more research and public education. The committee has made several recommendations, including getting the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (Arpansa) to better consult with members of the public about concerns over electromagnetic radiation, and the committee supported the federal government\u2019s education campaign funding. The report was finalised in March before misinformation began spreading online claiming either 5G was responsible for coronavirus, due to the construction of 5G networks in Wuhan, or for \u201cpoisoning cells\u201d that created coronavirus. The misinformation has been widely spread on Facebook, in particular \u2013 a video went viral where a man claiming to be a former Vodafone executive warned the pandemic was a global plot to install 5G and track the population through vaccines. In reality, the Guardian revealed, the voice on the tape making the baseless claims is an evangelical pastor who had only worked in sales for Vodafone for less than a year in 2014. Several mobile towers in the UK have been attacked by people as a result of the misinformation, and telecoms workers have reported being harassed by members of the public. Facebook has since said it is taking \u201caggressive steps\u201d to remove coronavirus-related misinformation, including linking it to 5G, or encouraging attacks on phone towers. In Australia, a Nazi flag with #COVID19 written on it was tied to two Chinese flags on a mobile tower in regional Victoria in April. Last weekend, anti-5G protesters joined anti-lockdown protesters in small protests in Sydney and Melbourne. The Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association chief executive, Chris Althaus, told Guardian Australia the committee\u2019s hearings made the mobile lobby group realise misinformation had taken hold. \u201cWe realised that there\u2019s a much stronger communications role that we need to play, and we see a role for government in this as well and they have responded to that call. So there\u2019s a lot more to do, and we\u2019re very, very active on doing it.\u201d Part of the problem, he said, was for most people they had heard about 5G but had not seen how it works. \u201cUnfortunately, like in a lot of industries with a high technology focus, the latest generation and discussion about the latest generation tends to get out well ahead of its arrival into the market. \u201cPeople have gotten used to hearing about it but they haven\u2019t seen it, so we\u2019ve got to do a stronger job now that 5G is coming to market. We\u2019ve got to do a much better job of explaining the opportunities that 5G is going to bring.\u201d",

The crisis has changed the awareness of the importance of solidarity.\u201d Adding urgency to the need for a recovery plan, he said, was an expected shortfall of private investment \u20ac800bn in 2021 and 2022, funds that should have kickstarted Europe\u2019s green deal and main answer to the climate emergency. The EU\u2019s strategic goals, he said \u201cneed to be supported, strongly supported now\u201d. The commissioner also said he was worried about a no-deal from negotiations on a post-Brexit future with the UK, which is one of the \u201cdownside risks\u201d in the commission\u2019s latest economic forecast for the UK and EU. \u201cNo deal is a lose-lose situation,\u201d he said reiterating the commission\u2019s widely shared view that economic difficulties would be worse for the UK. \u201cObviously we hope that in both cases we will not have this downside risk materialise.\u201d The UK economy is forecast by the commission to shrink by 8.3% in 2020, but failure to reach an agreement would further dampen economic growth.",

      "body": "<p>In a past life, the satirist Charlie Brooker may have been one of those dogs with a sixth sense for imminent natural disaster, barking urgently at the humans who are blithely unaware their whole world is about to be smashed to smithereens. The preteen Brooker watched scary TV documentaries about nuclear war and assumed it would happen some day. As the co-creator of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/06/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-charlie-brooker\">Emmy-award-winning series Black Mirror</a>, he has offered dystopian prophecies of the unintended consequences of technology, from robotic killer dogs to tracking chip implants in Matrix-like virtual worlds. So a microbe shaking civilisation to its core can\u2019t have come as a complete surprise.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s odd,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\">Contagion that lots of people have watched recently</a>? When that came out and I read the description and everyone said this is really horrible and you should wash your hands a million times and use hand gel, I thought, there\u2019s no way on earth I\u2019m ever gonna watch that because that is exactly the sort of thing that terrifies me.</p> <p>\u201cLike when swine flu happened, I went around using hand gel and not touching doorknobs for several months. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a hypochondriac. I\u2019m like this every year when the norovirus happens and I\u2019ve always been concerned that something \u2013 you can detect, obviously, in Black Mirror a certain level of paranoia \u2013 that things could slide out of control at any moment.\u201d</p> <p>One of Black Mirror\u2019s best-known episodes, USS Callister, ends with a bully, Robert Daly, trapped inside a tiny spacecraft screaming: \u201cExit fucking game!\u201d as the lights of his computer-simulated universe wink out around him. At times, pandemic lockdown can make us all feel like Daly, floating in the void with no exit in sight. Brooker\u2019s blend of self-scrutiny, Alan Bennett-esque whimsy and curmudgeonly profanities would appear to make him an ideal pub companion. But the pubs are closed, so Brooker is speaking by phone from his home in Ealing, west London.</p> <p>It seems hard to be a Pollyanna-in-reverse, living in a perpetual state of hyperanxiety. But having long suspected that Armageddon is around the corner, has Brooker thicker psychological armour for the pandemic? \u201cI do think that, in a strange way, when the worst actually happens \u2013 I don\u2019t know if this is true for everyone who\u2019s an anxious or neurotic person, but it\u2019s definitely true for my head \u2013 you\u2019re not worrying about what is unknown because it\u2019s right in front of you. In fact, it\u2019s hypnotically clear what the challenge is. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m relaxed, but I don\u2019t have that sense of creeping dread of the unknown.</p> <p>\u201cThat means I\u2019m slightly acclimatised. I\u2019m not going through a giant psychological shock that this has happened because, in a way, I sort of thought it might. I don\u2019t think that in a smart-arsey way, but I had felt worried, for years, because having watched lots of nuclear war stuff as a kid, I assumed that was going to happen to me. I assumed I was going to be stumbling through rubble eating rats, so this happening just confirms my expectations in many ways.</p> <p>\u201cIt means once it\u2019s happened and it\u2019s occurring, I\u2019m not having to deal so much \u2013 obviously, like anyone I\u2019ve got my abyss-staring moments \u2013 but I\u2019m not having to deal so much with a huge adjustment, in a way. Hopefully that doesn\u2019t sound like bragging. It\u2019s certainly nothing to brag about.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f577f97272964db5efcae214979a83e71613e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f577f97272964db5efcae214979a83e71613e35/0_0_2986_4479/667.jpg\" alt=\"Black Mirror: USS Callister.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Mirror: USS Callister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In isolation, he banged his head on a pull-up bar and almost had to go to accident and emergency. (\u201cIf you\u2019ve got a pull-up bar that goes in a doorway, immediately take it down and throw it away because it genuinely nearly killed me.\u201d) He and his wife, the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq, are trying to juggle work commitments with home-schooling their sons, aged eight and six. \u201cTheir screen time has gone through the roof,\u201d Brooker says, cheerfully, a child\u2019s yell occasionally audible in the background. \u201cTheir screen time has probably always been higher and really would get me drummed off Mumsnet. But I always think, well, I watched loads of telly. And I think video games are good for you. If they\u2019re playing Mario Maker 2, where you\u2019re creating, I think that\u2019s much better than just watching a cartoon or something, so I don\u2019t particularly mind.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker has been catching up with Quiz, Tiger King and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/20/unorthodox-a-thrilling-story-of-rebellion-and-freedom-from-new-york-to-berlin\">Unorthodox</a>, as well as his \u201ccomfort watch\u201d, MasterChef. He grumbles: \u201cI just don\u2019t think things should have a one-word title. I mean, I guess you could get away with Quiz, but a show called See \u2013 why am I gonna watch that? Make an effort. If you can\u2019t be bothered to put two words in your title, why should I be bothered to tune in?\u201d</p> <p>He does get out for a walk or jog once a day. \u201cI\u2019m very aware if I\u2019m going out running that the joggers have got a bad rep at the moment, spluttering and running past. So I go out of my way to run into the middle of the road or cross the street and I get very cross when I see someone not doing that. I don\u2019t bother saying anything to them because what if they came over and hit me?\u201d</p> <p>For Brooker, who wrote the column <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/screenburn\">Screen Burn for the Guardian\u2019s Guide</a> from 2000 to 2010, there has also been an opportunity to revive one of his greatest hits, Wipe, in which he caustically reviews and skewers television from a sofa. The concept started life with Screenwipe on BBC Four in 2006 and moved to BBC Two with Newswipe, Gameswipe, Weekly Wipe and annual Wipes. Now a 45-minute <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/22/charlie-brooker-to-return-to-bbc-with-lockdown-special-antiviral-wipe\">Antiviral Wipe special will broadcast on Thursday</a>, including the familiar characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell).</p> <p>Hollywood and the West End might be comatose, but Wipe marches on. Brooker was lucky to have a literal in-house production team that included Huq and a documentary-maker who has been helping with childcare and staying in a spare room. He also has the familiar sofa rescued from the studio when the show finished. \u201cThe only difference is that people have to keep running off to deal with a crying baby or the internet goes down or we have to synchronise our toilet breaks. Other than that, it\u2019s surprisingly seamless.\u201d</p> <p>The virus may seem like a tough topic for Wipe, but Brooker says: \u201cObviously we\u2019re mindful of the fact that this is an extreme time for everybody, but hopefully we\u2019re getting it right tonally. I hope we\u2019re not being patronising. It\u2019s not kid gloves. There\u2019s a bit of gallows humour in there. I think that\u2019s important and I think that\u2019s human and I think that\u2019s cathartic, and you just have to gauge it right. There are things to laugh at and there are things to question.\u201d</p> <p>Over in the US, Donald Trump has memorably suggested that once the lockdown ends, the coronavirus \u201cmust be quickly forgotten\u201d and the economy will boom. Does Brooker think that in, say, a couple of years from now, life can go back to normal, as if the virus never happened? Or has it changed everything for good?</p> <p>\u201cI would imagine probably somewhere in the middle,\u201d he replies. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute thirst for: \u2018Oh, can we just go back to how things were\u2019, but the longer it goes on, the longer we\u2019ll forget what that was like. Weirdly, just the thought of things like everyone crowding into a stadium to watch a gig feels like: \u2018Oh my God, why would you do that?\u2019 at the moment. But I daresay behaviour changes. It happened after Spanish flu as well, so I imagine certain things we\u2019ll just forget about and go back to normal.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully, the other thing this does is throw into relief all sorts of things about what should be important in society in general and makes certain things fairly undeniable. God, how many people are now really delighted about the existence of delivery drivers, whereas a few months ago I would moan about delivery drivers with the best of them.\u201d He puts on a grouchy voice. \u201c\u2018He threw the parcel over the gate. Silly bastard. Typical.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cI was a bit rude about a postman the other day and it\u2019s haunted me. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not coming out to sign for that.\u2019 And then I thought maybe I was a bit terse with him and I didn\u2019t need to be. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re not meant to sign for them at the moment; but trying to have that debate through a closed door?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05f72f9a2db261e7c2f38a31e07a8a3b00fcd730\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05f72f9a2db261e7c2f38a31e07a8a3b00fcd730/0_0_2050_1367/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Brooker\u2019s Screenwipe.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Endemol</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wretched state of the economy, he notes, has been relegated to almost an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate because I\u2019ve got a job at the moment so I\u2019m not having to worry about the stock market. But, again, you\u2019d hope that this means that it\u2019s hard to justify paying someone millions and millions of pounds for sitting on the board of something. But who knows? Maybe that sort of thing will shift and change. It needs to be a societal shift.\u201d</p> <p>When societal shifts happen in Black Mirror \u2013 which migrated from Channel 4 to Netflix and was praised by the novelist Stephen King as \u201cterrifying, funny, intelligent\u201d \u2013 they usually come with a dark twist. The season-four episode Metalhead features a post-apocalyptic future where humans are hunted by robot dogs (\u201calmost like a tone poem of bleakness,\u201d he says). Brooker has little appetite to write in that vein right now, but points out that Black Mirror can be uplifting too \u2013 San Junipero was a love story with a happy ending \u2013 so we should not necessarily give up on a sixth season.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not writing stories about societies falling apart at the moment, so read into that what you will. If you look at classic dystopian stories, it becomes every man for himself immediately. Actually, in this crisis, what\u2019s happened is you\u2019re more likely to be sitting indoors watching Tiger King and worrying that your neighbour\u2019s OK and asking to see if they need you to bring in a bag of potatoes or whatever. What\u2019s actually happening at the moment is much more cohesive and heartening.</p> <p>\u201cAt the moment, if you were trying to write a story about a pandemic sweeping the world and everyone immediately turning on each other, plenty of people would look at that and go: \u2018Well, that isn\u2019t what\u2019s happened.\u2019 So there\u2019s plenty of room for bleak stories and horror movies \u2013 it\u2019s just I think you\u2019ve got to approach it slightly differently.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker was summed up on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs as: \u201cSardonic, deadpan, scabrous and snarky ... and he\u2019s really got it in for politicians.\u201d But now a dad in his mellow fifth decade, it turns out he even has a place in his heart for Boris Johnson \u2013 up to a point.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at Boris Johnson getting ill, when he was in intensive care, I\u2019m not a fan of Boris Johnson but I was worried about him on some level. He\u2019s a human being with a kid on the way. Worrying about that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not worried about everything else. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not critical of things he\u2019s done or decisions he\u2019s taken. And also it doesn\u2019t give him a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now he\u2019s back in the saddle, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t criticise the decisions that he\u2019s made.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker\u2019s assessment of Johnson as prime minister is unflattering. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the new, sort of slightly bolshie shrugging off of the truth that happens, the way they slightly adopted the fake news. Dominic Cummings swanning out of his house and telling journalists that they\u2019re all rich remainers. It\u2019s a sort of gaslighting that goes on.</p> <p>\u201cThat feels to me like a new thing, or a new sort of shamelessness, which I hope goes into a great big burning bin. And I hope everybody involved in that eventually finds themselves nowhere near any position of power or employment. If I think about that for more than 20 seconds, I can get very cross indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker\u2019s imagination prepared him well for the world-changing pandemic. How does he feel about an event that can be predicted with absolute certainty next year: his 50th birthday? \u201cI\u2019m resigned to it now, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember turning 30 that was: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to be 30,\u2019 and then that was OK, that was almost: \u2018Oh, actually, hang on, I\u2019m still young.\u2019 Turning 40 was a bit more like: \u2018Oh no, this isn\u2019t great.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIn my head I\u2019ve been 50 for a while so I think I\u2019m going to deal with it. But that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m going out running and trying to use pull-up bars, because I\u2019m desperately trying to not die. But then, we all are.\u201d</p> <p><em>Charlie Brooker\u2019s Antiviral Wipe will be on BBC Two on Thursday at 9pm</em></p>",

The concept started life with Screenwipe on BBC Four in 2006 and moved to BBC Two with Newswipe, Gameswipe, Weekly Wipe and annual Wipes. Now a 45-minute Antiviral Wipe special will broadcast on Thursday, including the familiar characters Philomena Cunk (Diane Morgan) and Barry Shitpeas (Al Campbell). Hollywood and the West End might be comatose, but Wipe marches on. Brooker was lucky to have a literal in-house production team that included Huq and a documentary-maker who has been helping with childcare and staying in a spare room. He also has the familiar sofa rescued from the studio when the show finished. \u201cThe only difference is that people have to keep running off to deal with a crying baby or the internet goes down or we have to synchronise our toilet breaks. Other than that, it\u2019s surprisingly seamless.\u201d The virus may seem like a tough topic for Wipe, but Brooker says: \u201cObviously we\u2019re mindful of the fact that this is an extreme time for everybody, but hopefully we\u2019re getting it right tonally. I hope we\u2019re not being patronising. It\u2019s not kid gloves. There\u2019s a bit of gallows humour in there. I think that\u2019s important and I think that\u2019s human and I think that\u2019s cathartic, and you just have to gauge it right. There are things to laugh at and there are things to question.\u201d Over in the US, Donald Trump has memorably suggested that once the lockdown ends, the coronavirus \u201cmust be quickly forgotten\u201d and the economy will boom. Does Brooker think that in, say, a couple of years from now, life can go back to normal, as if the virus never happened? Or has it changed everything for good? \u201cI would imagine probably somewhere in the middle,\u201d he replies. \u201cThere\u2019s an absolute thirst for: \u2018Oh, can we just go back to how things were\u2019, but the longer it goes on, the longer we\u2019ll forget what that was like. Weirdly, just the thought of things like everyone crowding into a stadium to watch a gig feels like: \u2018Oh my God, why would you do that?\u2019 at the moment. But I daresay behaviour changes. It happened after Spanish flu as well, so I imagine certain things we\u2019ll just forget about and go back to normal. \u201cHopefully, the other thing this does is throw into relief all sorts of things about what should be important in society in general and makes certain things fairly undeniable. God, how many people are now really delighted about the existence of delivery drivers, whereas a few months ago I would moan about delivery drivers with the best of them.\u201d He puts on a grouchy voice. \u201c\u2018He threw the parcel over the gate. Silly bastard. Typical.\u2019 \u201cI was a bit rude about a postman the other day and it\u2019s haunted me. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not coming out to sign for that.\u2019 And then I thought maybe I was a bit terse with him and I didn\u2019t need to be. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re not meant to sign for them at the moment; but trying to have that debate through a closed door?\u201d The wretched state of the economy, he notes, has been relegated to almost an afterthought. \u201cI\u2019m fortunate because I\u2019ve got a job at the moment so I\u2019m not having to worry about the stock market. But, again, you\u2019d hope that this means that it\u2019s hard to justify paying someone millions and millions of pounds for sitting on the board of something. But who knows? Maybe that sort of thing will shift and change. It needs to be a societal shift.\u201d When societal shifts happen in Black Mirror \u2013 which migrated from Channel 4 to Netflix and was praised by the novelist Stephen King as \u201cterrifying, funny, intelligent\u201d \u2013 they usually come with a dark twist. The season-four episode Metalhead features a post-apocalyptic future where humans are hunted by robot dogs (\u201calmost like a tone poem of bleakness,\u201d he says). Brooker has little appetite to write in that vein right now, but points out that Black Mirror can be uplifting too \u2013 San Junipero was a love story with a happy ending \u2013 so we should not necessarily give up on a sixth season. \u201cI\u2019m not writing stories about societies falling apart at the moment, so read into that what you will. If you look at classic dystopian stories, it becomes every man for himself immediately. Actually, in this crisis, what\u2019s happened is you\u2019re more likely to be sitting indoors watching Tiger King and worrying that your neighbour\u2019s OK and asking to see if they need you to bring in a bag of potatoes or whatever. What\u2019s actually happening at the moment is much more cohesive and heartening. \u201cAt the moment, if you were trying to write a story about a pandemic sweeping the world and everyone immediately turning on each other, plenty of people would look at that and go: \u2018Well, that isn\u2019t what\u2019s happened.\u2019 So there\u2019s plenty of room for bleak stories and horror movies \u2013 it\u2019s just I think you\u2019ve got to approach it slightly differently.\u201d Brooker was summed up on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs as: \u201cSardonic, deadpan, scabrous and snarky ... and he\u2019s really got it in for politicians.\u201d But now a dad in his mellow fifth decade, it turns out he even has a place in his heart for Boris Johnson \u2013 up to a point. \u201cIf you look at Boris Johnson getting ill, when he was in intensive care, I\u2019m not a fan of Boris Johnson but I was worried about him on some level. He\u2019s a human being with a kid on the way. Worrying about that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not worried about everything else. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not critical of things he\u2019s done or decisions he\u2019s taken. And also it doesn\u2019t give him a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now he\u2019s back in the saddle, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t criticise the decisions that he\u2019s made.\u201d Brooker\u2019s assessment of Johnson as prime minister is unflattering. \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the new, sort of slightly bolshie shrugging off of the truth that happens, the way they slightly adopted the fake news. Dominic Cummings swanning out of his house and telling journalists that they\u2019re all rich remainers. It\u2019s a sort of gaslighting that goes on. \u201cThat feels to me like a new thing, or a new sort of shamelessness, which I hope goes into a great big burning bin. And I hope everybody involved in that eventually finds themselves nowhere near any position of power or employment. If I think about that for more than 20 seconds, I can get very cross indeed.\u201d Brooker\u2019s imagination prepared him well for the world-changing pandemic. How does he feel about an event that can be predicted with absolute certainty next year: his 50th birthday? \u201cI\u2019m resigned to it now, I guess,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember turning 30 that was: \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m going to be 30,\u2019 and then that was OK, that was almost: \u2018Oh, actually, hang on, I\u2019m still young.\u2019 Turning 40 was a bit more like: \u2018Oh no, this isn\u2019t great.\u2019 \u201cIn my head I\u2019ve been 50 for a while so I think I\u2019m going to deal with it. But that\u2019s probably why I\u2019m going out running and trying to use pull-up bars, because I\u2019m desperately trying to not die. But then, we all are.\u201d Charlie Brooker\u2019s Antiviral Wipe will be on BBC Two on Thursday at 9pm",

Washington has said Israel can implement parts of the plan without involvement from the Palestinians.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a pretty detailed and realistic and implementable concept and I wanted to share with them some of the work that we are continuing to do on that,\u201d Pompeo said.</p> <p>Daniel Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Israel, said the hurry around Pompeo\u2019s \u201chigh-speed mid-pandemic\u201d trip was to coordinate the annexation, which he said Trump sees as an electoral boon if it can be pulled off before the US election in November.</p> <p>\u201cFor Trump\u2019s evangelical and rightwing Jewish base, Israeli annexation \u2013 and the last rites it will administer to the dying two-state solution \u2013 is wildly popular,\u201d Shapiro <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-what-pompeo-s-high-speed-mid-pandemic-trip-to-israel-is-really-about-1.8838797\">wrote in </a><a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-what-pompeo-s-high-speed-mid-pandemic-trip-to-israel-is-really-about-1.8838797\">Haaretz</a>.</p> <p>The visit took place as potential obstacles grow, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-eu/france-pushing-for-tough-eu-response-to-any-west-bank-annexation-diplomats-idUSKBN22N2CJ\">reports</a> that EU countries including France, Ireland and Belgium are considering threatening punitive economic measures if Israel breaks international law by unilaterally claiming sovereignty over land it occupies.</p> <p>EU foreign ministers are meeting on Friday and Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said annexation would be the \u201cmost important\u201d issue on the agenda. He added, however, that unanimity was needed to impose sanctions and the subject was divisive\u200b among member states\u200b. </p> <p>Washington may also be unsure if Netanyahu himself is committed to the plan. Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader has been accused domestically by right-wingers of dangling the promise of annexation to win elections but preferring to keep the status quo of endless occupation rather than risk the potential diplomatic fallout.</p> <p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/netanyahu-and-gantz-agree-to-form-unity-israeli-government\">unity government agreement</a> that Netanyahu signed with Gantz allows the prime minister to introduce an annexation proposal to cabinet for discussion after 1 July. That can take place even with objections from Gantz, who also supports the occupation but is considered within Israel as more of a centrist.</p> <p>Speaking next to Netanyahu on Wednesday ahead of their three-hour meeting, Pompeo said there was work to be done on Trump\u2019s plan. He said: \u201c[W]e need to make progress on that.\u201d </p>",

The US plan, preemptively rejected by Palestinian leaders who refuse to negotiate under its terms, gives Israel full military control over Palestinians, much of their land and all of Jerusalem and Israeli settlements. Washington has said Israel can implement parts of the plan without involvement from the Palestinians. \u201cIt is a pretty detailed and realistic and implementable concept and I wanted to share with them some of the work that we are continuing to do on that,\u201d Pompeo said. Daniel Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Israel, said the hurry around Pompeo\u2019s \u201chigh-speed mid-pandemic\u201d trip was to coordinate the annexation, which he said Trump sees as an electoral boon if it can be pulled off before the US election in November. \u201cFor Trump\u2019s evangelical and rightwing Jewish base, Israeli annexation \u2013 and the last rites it will administer to the dying two-state solution \u2013 is wildly popular,\u201d Shapiro wrote in Haaretz. The visit took place as potential obstacles grow, with reports that EU countries including France, Ireland and Belgium are considering threatening punitive economic measures if Israel breaks international law by unilaterally claiming sovereignty over land it occupies. EU foreign ministers are meeting on Friday and Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said annexation would be the \u201cmost important\u201d issue on the agenda. He added, however, that unanimity was needed to impose sanctions and the subject was divisive among member states. Washington may also be unsure if Netanyahu himself is committed to the plan. Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader has been accused domestically by right-wingers of dangling the promise of annexation to win elections but preferring to keep the status quo of endless occupation rather than risk the potential diplomatic fallout. Still, the unity government agreement that Netanyahu signed with Gantz allows the prime minister to introduce an annexation proposal to cabinet for discussion after 1 July. That can take place even with objections from Gantz, who also supports the occupation but is considered within Israel as more of a centrist. Speaking next to Netanyahu on Wednesday ahead of their three-hour meeting, Pompeo said there was work to be done on Trump\u2019s plan. He said: \u201c[W]e need to make progress on that.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>Top story: Virus not going to disappear, Fauci warns</h2> \n<p>Hello and good morning from me, Warren Murray. Hopefully you are settled into a comfortable position \u2013 or a comfortable stride. Here is the news to start your Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Eight million people with underlying health conditions <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/millions-with-health-conditions-at-risk-from-covid-19-if-forced-back-to-work\">should be exempted</a> from plans to get Britain back to work and normal life, according to scientists who warn that easing lockdown too quickly could propel the Covid-19 death toll to 73,000 this year. Union leaders have voiced concerns over Boris Johnson\u2019s exhortations to people to return to work from today if their jobs can\u2019t be done from home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/stay-alert-or-stay-home-how-covid-19-lockdown-rules-differ-across-uk\">Whether to \u201cstay alert\u201d or \u201cstay home\u201d</a> is a different story from today depending on where you live in the UK, with devolved administrations diverging from the central government\u2019s plans for lifting the lockdown.</p> \n<p>As many as 6,000 children around the world could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/13/unicef-6000-children-could-die-every-day-due-to-impact-of-coronavirus\">die every day from preventable causes</a> over the next six months due to the impact of coronavirus on routine health services, such as family planning, childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination, Unicef has warned.

Hopefully you are settled into a comfortable position \u2013 or a comfortable stride. Here is the news to start your Wednesday. Eight million people with underlying health conditions should be exempted from plans to get Britain back to work and normal life, according to scientists who warn that easing lockdown too quickly could propel the Covid-19 death toll to 73,000 this year. Union leaders have voiced concerns over Boris Johnson\u2019s exhortations to people to return to work from today if their jobs can\u2019t be done from home. Whether to \u201cstay alert\u201d or \u201cstay home\u201d is a different story from today depending on where you live in the UK, with devolved administrations diverging from the central government\u2019s plans for lifting the lockdown. As many as 6,000 children around the world could die every day from preventable causes over the next six months due to the impact of coronavirus on routine health services, such as family planning, childbirth, postnatal care and vaccination, Unicef has warned. This is in addition to the 2.5 million children who die globally every six months before their fifth birthday, and threatens to reverse nearly a decade of progress on ending preventable child deaths. Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike sharply on their deadliest days yet. The US remains by far the worst-affected country and now has almost one-third of the world\u2019s 4.26m cases, and a national death tally of 82,339. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert, has warned in Senate testimony via videoconference that the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll is under-counted and \u201cthe consequences could be really serious\u201d if America relaxes safeguards too abruptly. \u201cThere is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to economic recovery.\u201d Fauci said America might be headed in the right direction but this did not mean the pandemic was under control. And as Trump has claimed more than once, is the virus going to disappear? \u201cThat is just not going to happen,\u201d said Fauci, who has headed the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984.

Scottish Power will revamp Hagshaw Hill, Scotland\u2019s oldest commercial wind farm, as part of a \u00a3150m scheme to develop a clean energy cluster capable of supplying 100,000 homes.

Coronavirus Extra Do we need more than one vaccine? Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for Covid-19, and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort. As the coronavirus continues to kill thousands each day, tech companies are seizing the opportunity to extend their reach and power, writes Naomi Klein.

A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support.</p> <p>AIF chief executive Paul Reed says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet lending criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year.</p> <p>Goc O\u2019Callaghan, who runs rock festival ArcTanGent and works with 2000trees, says the majority of staff members are also ineligible for the furlough scheme, which is due to end on 31 October. \u201cAnd, as small-business owners who pay themselves via dividends, we also don\u2019t qualify for any of the payments, despite the large amount of corporation tax we\u2019re contributing,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca37c3e703d77e86dd4456e6fa7754b78437cf57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca37c3e703d77e86dd4456e6fa7754b78437cf57/0_0_3648_2432/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The crowd at ArcTanGent festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The crowd at ArcTanGent festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wayne Farrell/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Reed says that the seasonal nature of the festival sector poses specific challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s not a temporary shutdown of business \u2013 this is an entire year of income and trade essentially wiped out,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s really different from a retail business, where, however devastating this may have been, they can get to a point where they can reopen, mobilise and bring staff back in.

In addition, it wants clear guidance about when festivals will be able to operate, as well as any social distancing measures that would be expected in order to maintain public safety.</p> <p>ArcTanGent and 2000trees have been cancelled this year. \u201cIf there had been clearer guidelines earlier on, we certainly could have saved ourselves spending huge amounts of money over the last three months, and possibly longer,\u201d O\u2019Callaghan says. She\u2019s hopeful that all three events will return in 2021, thanks in part to the \u201cgoodwill\u201d of fans who haven\u2019t asked for refunds for tickets that will still be valid next year, as well as a successful crowdfunding campaign for 2000trees that has so far raised nearly all of its \u00a350,000 target to help keep the festival afloat. A similar campaign will be launched for ArcTanGent this week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the generosity of our fanbase that is allowing those events to continue.

      "body": "<p>Last week, the Office for National Statistics confirmed what many had suspected since the start of this pandemic \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic people are far more likely to get and die from coronavirus. But it is the scale of difference that is so worrying. Black people are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people</a>. Even after taking into account age, underlying health and income factors, they are still almost twice as likely as white people to die from the virus.</p> <p>The government has promised that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/phe-to-review-how-ethnicity-affects-vulnerability-to-coronavirus\">review</a> by Public Health England into how ethnicity affects vulnerability to coronavirus will be published by the end of May. It can\u2019t come soon enough: among frontline NHS and social care workers, the difference is all too stark: despite accounting for just <a href=\"https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/workforce-and-business/workforce-diversity/nhs-workforce/latest\">20%</a> of the workforce, rising to 44% among medics, <a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">94% of doctors and </a><a href=\"https://www.hsj.co.uk/exclusive-deaths-of-nhs-staff-from-covid-19-analysed/7027471.article\">71% of nurses</a> who have died from Covid-19 were black, Asian and minority ethnic. It has prompted NHS England to recommend risk assessments for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/nhs-bosses-say-bame-staff-should-be-risk-assessed-to-cut-covid-19\">BAME frontline staff</a> to reduce their exposure to the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/doctors-nurses-porters-volunteers-the-uk-health-workers-who-have-died-from-covid-19\">Doctors, nurses, porters, volunteers: the UK health workers who have died from Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other pandemics have also proven deadly for medical staff. Health workers caught flu during both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/nurses-fell-like-ninepins-death-and-bravery-in-the-1918-flu-pandemic\">1918</a> and <a href=\"https://bjgp.org/content/59/565/622\">1957</a> and 1968 flu pandemics. And while an ethnic breakdown of the data is not available, some of the casualties of the 1957 and 1968 epidemics will have been black, Asian or from ethnic minorities. It is even possible some BAME nurses working in the UK died in the 1918 epidemic. We just don\u2019t know. But nurses from BAME backgrounds have been working in the NHS for generations. Although many were part of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2018/apr/17/who-are-the-windrush-generation-video-explainer\">Windrush generation</a>, coming from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971 to work in the newly established NHS, they were not the first arrivals.<br><br>By 1954, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Many-rivers-cross-Caribbean-1948-69/dp/0113227213\">more than 3,000 Caribbean women</a> were training in British hospitals. By 1959, official statistics showed 6,365 nursing students in Britain who had come here from overseas. By 1966-67 the total number of nurses and midwives from overseas who trained here had risen to 16,745. </p> <p>Research (<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/historysocialaction/esther-bruce\">Aunt Esther</a>)<strong> </strong>by social historian Stephen Bourne has revealed that black nurses worked in the healthcare system long before the NHS was even thought of. Most would have been from within the British empire, including the Caribbean, India and countries in Africa.</p> <p> Bourne believes that their experiences were far less negative than current thinking might have us believe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stereotype black nurses\u2019 experiences, nor victimise the nurses who came as part of the Windrush generation,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>\u201cWe know that black nurses from Britain\u2019s former colonies, including the Windrush generation, began to arrive in Britain soon after the founding of the NHS. However, the back story of the nurses who came here before 1948 is not known.</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I am aware, none left any testimonies, so we do not know their point of view. They would have confronted some racist attitudes, but they would also have been loved and respected by their contemporaries in the medical profession, and their patients.\u201d</p> <p> Most will have at least heard of the Jamaican nurse <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Seacole\">Mary Seacole</a>, a contemporary of Florence Nightingale, who also nursed troops in the Crimean war. Other, less well-known black nurses include <a href=\"https://eastendwomensmuseum.org/blog/annie-brewster-the-london-hospitals-nurse-ophthalmic\">Annie Brewster</a> , a nurse originally from St Vincent , who moved to London as a child in the 1860s, worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel from 1881 for 20 years and died in 1902, aged 42.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3d573781ac5aca46b9b1f067e3b7f5a8f1e0496/0_0_755_1184/638.jpg\" alt=\"Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel\" width=\"638\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annie Brewster, who came from St Vincent to London in the 1860s and worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brewster worked with elderly patients who were losing their sight. \u201cBrewster was much loved,\u201d says Bourne. </p> <p>Fast forward to the early 1930s, when <a href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/library-exhibitions/wake-up-slackers\">Eva Lowe </a><strong> </strong>came to the UK from Jamaica looking for work.

      "bodyText": "Last week, the Office for National Statistics confirmed what many had suspected since the start of this pandemic \u2013 black, Asian and minority ethnic people are far more likely to get and die from coronavirus. But it is the scale of difference that is so worrying. Black people are more than four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people. Even after taking into account age, underlying health and income factors, they are still almost twice as likely as white people to die from the virus. The government has promised that a review by Public Health England into how ethnicity affects vulnerability to coronavirus will be published by the end of May. It can\u2019t come soon enough: among frontline NHS and social care workers, the difference is all too stark: despite accounting for just 20% of the workforce, rising to 44% among medics, 94% of doctors and 71% of nurses who have died from Covid-19 were black, Asian and minority ethnic. It has prompted NHS England to recommend risk assessments for BAME frontline staff to reduce their exposure to the virus. Other pandemics have also proven deadly for medical staff. Health workers caught flu during both the 1918 and 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics. And while an ethnic breakdown of the data is not available, some of the casualties of the 1957 and 1968 epidemics will have been black, Asian or from ethnic minorities. It is even possible some BAME nurses working in the UK died in the 1918 epidemic. We just don\u2019t know. But nurses from BAME backgrounds have been working in the NHS for generations. Although many were part of the Windrush generation, coming from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971 to work in the newly established NHS, they were not the first arrivals. By 1954, more than 3,000 Caribbean women were training in British hospitals. By 1959, official statistics showed 6,365 nursing students in Britain who had come here from overseas. By 1966-67 the total number of nurses and midwives from overseas who trained here had risen to 16,745. Research (Aunt Esther) by social historian Stephen Bourne has revealed that black nurses worked in the healthcare system long before the NHS was even thought of. Most would have been from within the British empire, including the Caribbean, India and countries in Africa. Bourne believes that their experiences were far less negative than current thinking might have us believe. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t stereotype black nurses\u2019 experiences, nor victimise the nurses who came as part of the Windrush generation,\u201d says Bourne. \u201cWe know that black nurses from Britain\u2019s former colonies, including the Windrush generation, began to arrive in Britain soon after the founding of the NHS. However, the back story of the nurses who came here before 1948 is not known. \u201cAs far as I am aware, none left any testimonies, so we do not know their point of view. They would have confronted some racist attitudes, but they would also have been loved and respected by their contemporaries in the medical profession, and their patients.\u201d Most will have at least heard of the Jamaican nurse Mary Seacole, a contemporary of Florence Nightingale, who also nursed troops in the Crimean war. Other, less well-known black nurses include Annie Brewster , a nurse originally from St Vincent , who moved to London as a child in the 1860s, worked at the London hospital in Whitechapel from 1881 for 20 years and died in 1902, aged 42. Brewster worked with elderly patients who were losing their sight. \u201cBrewster was much loved,\u201d says Bourne. Fast forward to the early 1930s, when Eva Lowe came to the UK from Jamaica looking for work. She eventually trained at St Nicholas\u2019 hospital in Plumstead, south London, from 1932, registering with the Royal College of Nursing as a qualified nurse in 1935. But it was a difficult time for any black nurse to gain employment in the pre-NHS healthcare system. Before working at St Nicholas, Lowe had applied to 28 hospitals. All rejected her. One hospital said they had to consider the feelings of the patients; another that she would have difficulty being accepted by other nurses, some of whom were daughters of army officers. According to the Royal College of Nursing, there are many other stories, as yet untold, of women who trained here and were admitted to the nursing register before the 1930s. No one knows who they were, as the nurse\u2019s ethnicity was not recorded on the register. However, it is known that hospitals in London and Birmingham admitted black nurses for training before that time. Today, one in every five nurses and midwives are from BAME backgrounds, rising to much higher levels (up to 40%) in some regions and parts of the country, such as London. \u201cBlack nurses in Britain entering the profession today have more role models than I did,\u201d says Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, who trained in the 1980s. \u201cThere are far more visible black leaders in health and social care now.

      "body": "<p>You might assume that during a time of crisis it\u2019s important for governments to hold information close to their chest. Surely, in the midst of a life and death struggle, the priority is to be pragmatic and effective. In such circumstances, openness is simply a luxury we can\u2019t afford.</p> <p>But openness is not a luxury, or an abstract principle to be set against more pressing needs. In fact, it\u2019s a crucial component in the struggle to defeat illness. For a number of reasons, this is rarely appreciated by governments.</p> <p>The most fundamental of these reasons has to do with an elitist conception of human psychology. There is a <a href=\"https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/two-psychologies-and-coronavirus\">longstanding view</a>, dating back to the dawn of industrialisation and formation of mass society, that people are psychologically fragile. Their reasoning is beset by bias. They can\u2019t comprehend complexity. They can\u2019t deal with uncertainty. They certainly can\u2019t cope with threat. So in a crisis, they fold. They react <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/truth-about-panic&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589287637808000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG94qgsZQShnJ6DFYq4GWqWzMBpzw\">excessively, irrationally, dysfunctionally</a>. And their reactions create as many problems, if not more, than the original crisis itself. This view is encapsulated by a scene common to Hollywood disaster films: people fleeing danger, screaming and waving their arms in the air, before meeting a grisly end.</p> <p>This view holds that since people are childlike and can\u2019t look after themselves, they need a paternalistic government to shield them from uncomfortable truths and guide them through a dangerous world. Not surprisingly, this attitude is highly attractive to governments of different stripes. And, over the years, on various committees planning for emergencies, I have seen this attitude again and again. I have endlessly heard the anxious enquiry: \u201cWon\u2019t people panic if we are straight with them?\u201d</p> <p>The irony here is that people very rarely panic in a crisis. They are generally calm, orderly and, as we\u2019ve seen during the coronavirus crisis, they come together to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\">support each other through hard times</a>. When people die, it is less because they overreact than because they underreact. They fail to appreciate the true dangers of a situation until it is too late. And how can they appreciate those dangers if they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/30/accurate-honest-and-transparent-how-leaders-should-communicate-about-coronavirus\">aren\u2019t properly warned of them</a>? Lack of openness, and of clear and comprehensive information, does nothing to protect people. To the contrary \u2013 such opacity is a killer during a crisis like this.</p> <p>The real story of this pandemic is one of remarkable public heroism. If the spread of the virus has been contained, it is because people\u2019s compliance with the lockdown has gone well beyond expectations. This hasn\u2019t been easy. Many people <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/Coronavirus-in-the-UK-cluster-analysis.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1589287637812000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHO3RTezg7zkuSGjstFuSxNqRHtMg\">have been suffering</a>, and yet still they have remained home for the public good.</p> <p>What has led to such high levels of adherence? The literature on why people obey authorities is clear. It isn\u2019t out of fear of punishment, but because people believe the authorities are of us, and are acting for us. The reason we feel bound together in a common cause has partly to do with a sense of \u201cprocedural justice\u201d: being treated fairly, being listened to and being reasoned with. In other words, people are more inclined to obey authority when they feel they are being respected as equals, not patronised like children.</p> <p>Here, the government\u2019s opacity is profoundly corrosive. An unwillingness to trust people with information undermines this sense of procedural justice. In turn, this sets government apart from the people, which weakens adherence to policies such as the lockdown, allowing infection to run rampant. This is why a policy of openness has to be a critical part of the government\u2019s efforts to defeat Covid-19.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, we need a broader shift in the relationship between the state and its citizens.

      "bodyText": "You might assume that during a time of crisis it\u2019s important for governments to hold information close to their chest. Surely, in the midst of a life and death struggle, the priority is to be pragmatic and effective. In such circumstances, openness is simply a luxury we can\u2019t afford. But openness is not a luxury, or an abstract principle to be set against more pressing needs. In fact, it\u2019s a crucial component in the struggle to defeat illness. For a number of reasons, this is rarely appreciated by governments. The most fundamental of these reasons has to do with an elitist conception of human psychology. There is a longstanding view, dating back to the dawn of industrialisation and formation of mass society, that people are psychologically fragile. Their reasoning is beset by bias. They can\u2019t comprehend complexity. They can\u2019t deal with uncertainty. They certainly can\u2019t cope with threat. So in a crisis, they fold. They react excessively, irrationally, dysfunctionally. And their reactions create as many problems, if not more, than the original crisis itself. This view is encapsulated by a scene common to Hollywood disaster films: people fleeing danger, screaming and waving their arms in the air, before meeting a grisly end. This view holds that since people are childlike and can\u2019t look after themselves, they need a paternalistic government to shield them from uncomfortable truths and guide them through a dangerous world. Not surprisingly, this attitude is highly attractive to governments of different stripes. And, over the years, on various committees planning for emergencies, I have seen this attitude again and again. I have endlessly heard the anxious enquiry: \u201cWon\u2019t people panic if we are straight with them?\u201d The irony here is that people very rarely panic in a crisis. They are generally calm, orderly and, as we\u2019ve seen during the coronavirus crisis, they come together to support each other through hard times. When people die, it is less because they overreact than because they underreact. They fail to appreciate the true dangers of a situation until it is too late. And how can they appreciate those dangers if they aren\u2019t properly warned of them? Lack of openness, and of clear and comprehensive information, does nothing to protect people. To the contrary \u2013 such opacity is a killer during a crisis like this. The real story of this pandemic is one of remarkable public heroism. If the spread of the virus has been contained, it is because people\u2019s compliance with the lockdown has gone well beyond expectations. This hasn\u2019t been easy. Many people have been suffering, and yet still they have remained home for the public good. What has led to such high levels of adherence? The literature on why people obey authorities is clear. It isn\u2019t out of fear of punishment, but because people believe the authorities are of us, and are acting for us. The reason we feel bound together in a common cause has partly to do with a sense of \u201cprocedural justice\u201d: being treated fairly, being listened to and being reasoned with. In other words, people are more inclined to obey authority when they feel they are being respected as equals, not patronised like children. Here, the government\u2019s opacity is profoundly corrosive. An unwillingness to trust people with information undermines this sense of procedural justice. In turn, this sets government apart from the people, which weakens adherence to policies such as the lockdown, allowing infection to run rampant. This is why a policy of openness has to be a critical part of the government\u2019s efforts to defeat Covid-19. Ultimately, though, we need a broader shift in the relationship between the state and its citizens. The government must abandon a psychology that infantilises people. It must recognise and respect the ability of the public to acknowledge and deal with harsh realities. It must engage us as full partners in every stage of the strategy against Covid-19: from formulating a response, to implementing and evaluating policy. And, as in any constructive relationship, none of this can happen without putting openness at the very heart of what government does. \u2022 Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus, and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews",

      "bodyText": "The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has corrected evidence that Scott Morrison\u2019s handpicked Covid-19 coordination adviser, the former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power, is being paid $500,000 for six months\u2019 work. In a statement issued late on Wednesday, Morrison\u2019s department said Power would be paid $267,345 to cover his expenses as chair of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission \u2013 not $500,000. Power\u2019s remuneration was revealed at a hearing of the Senate inquiry into the management of the coronavirus crisis, where senators focused on whether there were proper processes in place for members of the NCCC to declare any conflicts of interest, given that many are company directors. It was also revealed during the inquiry that Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, who has been engaged as a special adviser to the NCCC on manufacturing, was not required to declare potential conflicts in the way that commissioners were. Morrison established the NCCC in late March, when the health crisis was at its height. The commission has a broad remit, advising the government on all non-health aspects of its pandemic response. Terms of reference for its activities were published last week. People familiar with the group\u2019s deliberations say it has been championing a significant boost to sovereign capability as Australia absorbs the lessons of the crisis. Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency of the group\u2019s deliberations, and the absence of a conventional governance framework for a taxpayer-funded enterprise. Environment groups are also concerned that the commission is promoting gas as central to the economic recovery rather than a mix of fuel sources. In media interviews Power has argued that the cheap supply of energy to business will be critical to Australia\u2019s recovery. The NCCC\u2019s chief executive, Peter Harris, told the hearing that the commission had developed a process for members to declare conflicts at the start of every meeting. In addition to the standard declaration, commissioners had to disclose more specific conflicts as they worked through proposals. Harris said Power had askedhim to develop a protocol: \u201cIn the course of the work that is being undertaken by each commissioner, should they encounter something that involves effectively commercially sensitive information which could create a perception that they were being put in an advantageous position, they should draw that matter to his attention, or in his absence, to my attention.\u201d That had happened on one occasion, Harris said, but he declined to say which commissioner had declared the conflict, or disclose the proposal in question. He also pushed back on a request to make the conflict declarations public. Harris said Liveris \u2013 who heads a manufacturing group which Harris said was \u201cappended to the commission\u201d because that group was \u201cset up in an informal manner\u201d \u2013 was not subject to the conflict declarations that other commissioners faced. He said he did not believe Liveris was being paid for his advice. Asked by the Labor senator Murray Watt whether \u201cappendages had to make conflict of interest declarations\u201d, Harris relied: \u201cNot as far as the commission process goes, no.\u201d He said the manufacturing group would provide advice to the NCCC \u201cwithin the next week\u201d but it was unclear how that advice would then progress through government decision making. \u201cThat\u2019s the part of the process that remains a little opaque \u2026 but logically and inevitably you can\u2019t take actions in any of that kind of work without going through a cabinet process,\u201d Harris said. Officials from Morrison\u2019s department told the hearing that appointments to the NCCC had not been endorsed by cabinet but selected by the prime minister. Stephanie Foster, an associate secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, said Power had been engaged on a six-month contract worth \u201caround $500,000\u201d which wasn\u2019t a salary but an allowance for the businessman to recover his travel and accommodation costs.

      "bodyText": "Peter Piot, the scientist who helped discover the Ebola virus, and the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, has told of his brush with death after contracting Covid-19. The professor had never previously been seriously ill, but after 40 years studying and leading the global response to infectious diseases including HIV and Aids, he said that \u201cfinally, a virus got me\u201d. Piot, who was awarded an honorary knighthood for services to science in 2017, is still recovering from the virus after severe pneumonia left him hospitalised. Professional expertise and personal experience give him an extraordinary insight into the potential impact of the virus on public health, predicting many people will be left with chronic kidney and heart problems. But he hopes the crisis might ease political tensions over vaccines and force anti-vaccine campaigners to re-evaluate their positions, as well as lead to reform of the World Health Organization (WHO). In his first interview since contracting the virus, the professor said he started to display symptoms on 19 March when he developed a high fever and a sharp headache. He had other symptoms, not then linked to coronavirus. \u201cMy skull and hair felt very painful, which was bizarre,\u201d he said in an interview with the Belgian magazine Knack, a version of which was published in English in Science magazine. He did not have a cough at the time but his instinct told him it was coronavirus. He thought it would pass and he continued to work as a special adviser to the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen. To be hospitalised by a virus after four decades avoiding the infectious diseases he studies was not something he expected. \u201cI have devoted my life to fighting viruses and finally, they get their revenge. For a week I balanced between heaven and earth, on the edge of what could have been the end,\u201d he said. \u201cI had never been seriously ill and have not taken a day of sick leave the past 10 years.

In 2018 there were just 468 baby Karens born. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of a rare breed,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Her mother, who had immigrated from Nigeria, chose the name so that Attiah could \u201ceasily move around in a white-dominated world\u201d. \u201cIt has afforded me, I think, a certain privilege,\u201d says Attiah.</p> <p>It is that privilege that the meme sets out to skewer. In 2018, it was among a <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/white-cop-caller-nicknames\">handful of female names</a> to become attached to a spate of viral videos showing white women racially targeting people of colour. The antagonist of one such clip, of a woman calling the police over a group of African American men having a barbecue in a park in Oakland, California, came to be known as <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bbq-becky\">BBQ Becky</a> (another name applied to white women online).</p> <p>The meme is therefore rooted in black American internet culture, says Attiah \u2013 an attempt to find humour in real-world racism and oppression. To call someone a Karen is to target a particular behaviour: \u201cIt\u2019s a very specific definition and, if you\u2019re not acting that way, it shouldn\u2019t bother you,\u201d says Attiah.

Philadelphia community organiser Gwen Snyder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gwensnyderPHL/status/1254783335949152261\">recently tweeted</a> that it had been co-opted by \u201cwhite boys [who] stole it and turned it into code for \u2018bitch\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>Last month, the British feminist commentator Julie Bindel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/13/the-karen-meme-is-everywhere-and-it-has-become-mired-in-sexism\">tweeted</a> that \u201cthe \u2018Karen\u2019 slur is woman hating and based on class prejudice\u201d, arguing that it was a working-class name.</p> <p>She later said that she was not aware of the origins of the meme, and had reached her view after seeing \u201cwhite misogynistic men use it towards older women\u201d.

According to a popular meme, Karen is a middle-aged white woman with an asymmetrical bob asking to speak to the manager, who happens to be as entitled as she is ignorant.

Originally called the Albert Institute and Victoria Galleries, it was the largest memorial to Prince Albert outside London. It was renamed in honour of a much-loved Lord Provost, has been voted Dundee\u2019s best-loved building and is proud to have earned its local nickname \u2013 The People\u2019s Museum. Image: The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery &amp; Museum \u00a9 The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery &amp; Museum, 2:D - Alexander Carse (c 1770-1843) was famous for his incident-packed scenes of everyday life, influenced by Dutch genre painting. The Village Ba\u2019 Game shows a game between the \u2018uppies\u2019 and the \u2018doonies\u2019 in Jedburgh in the Scottish borders. The aim was to get the ball from one end of the village to the other. A similar game is still played in Orkney on New Year\u2019s Day. Image: The Village Ba\u2019 Game\u2019, 1818, Alexander Carse (c 1770-1843), Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 3:D - Perhaps the finest work by Abraham van Beyeren (1620/21-90) in a Scottish collection, this sumptuous still life is known as a banketjes or banquet piece. If you look carefully into the silver jug, you can just see a reflection of the artist at his easel. Image: Still Life with a Lobster, Fruit, Silver and China Ware, c 1660, Abraham van Beyeren (1620/1621-1690), Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 4:A - The Tayport Artist Circle was an exhibiting society formed in 1905 by artists David Foggie (1878-1948), Alec Grieve (1864-1933) and Frank Laing (1862-1907) in the coastal village of Tayport on the southern bank of the River Tay, opposite Dundee. Dundee Art Society held its first exhibition in 1893 and is one of the longest-running art societies in the UK; Creative Dundee run a popular Pecha Kucha Night and have supported Dundee\u2019s creative community since 2008; Generator is an artist led collective and project space formed in Dundee in 1996. Image: Sunset on the Tay, 1921, Alec Grieve (1864-1933), Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 5:B - Hugh Cameron (1835-1918) was known for sentimental scenes often combining childhood and country life. Here the moral is clear \u2013 cleanliness is next to godliness. Image: The Little Housewife, 19th century, Hugh Cameron (1835-1918), Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 6:B - This painting shows the view south from the front of Patrick\u2019s (1907-1998) home \u2013 the Shrubbery \u2013 across Magdalen Green. Patrick had to paint the railings from memory as they were removed as part of the war effort. Look for the artist\u2019s son Andrew on his bicycle. The horse and cart belonged to Roy the fruit merchant. Its companion view north A City Garden, 1940, is on the Art UK website. Image: The Tay Bridge from My Studio Window, 1948, James McIntosh Patrick (1907-1998) \u00a9 the artist\u2019s estate/Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council). Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 7:A - Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912-2004) used orange or black squares to denote the spaces in the phrasing of The Lord\u2019s Prayer \u2013 thus \"Our father, which art in heaven\". This is one of a series of abstract works inspired by the sense of community she experienced attending church. Image: Orange, Black and Lilac Squares on Vermilion, 1968, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham (1912-2004) \u00a9 by courtesy of the Barns-Graham Charitable Trust. Dundee Art Galleries and Museums Collection (Dundee City Council), 8:A - The Sidhe (Shee) were Celtic fairy folk who rode out to their sacred circle on Midsummer\u2019s Eve. Duncan (1866-1945) wrote that the tree of life meant wisdom, the grail cup love, and the sword symbolised power. The armour and other items were inspired by real examples of ancient Celtic metalwork seen by Duncan in museum collections. This included the iron age Battersea shield in the British Museum.

What is the furlough scheme?</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s officially called the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">launched in March</a> . It allows employers to stand down workers but then claim a cash grant of up to 80% of their wages, capped at \u00a32,500 a month. The money is claimed by the company and distributed to staff, so individuals don\u2019t have to do anything themselves. Some employers decide to make up the 20% difference, some do not.</p> <h2><strong>2. How many people are on the scheme?</strong></h2> <p>Huge numbers \u2013 the government revealed on Tuesday that the scheme is currently paying out to around 7.5 million employees, a quarter of Britain\u2019s private sector workforce. It has been used by 935,000 companies.</p> <h2><strong>3. How is it changing?</strong></h2> <p>It is being extended for another four months, to the end of October 2020 but with a number of changes. Crucially the 80% rate is being retained, squashing concerns that Chancellor Rishi Sunak would cut the government contribution to 60%.</p> <p>The big change, which will come into force from the start of August, is that workers will be able to return to their jobs part-time. At the moment companies must choose between putting staff into complete furlough, where they do not work at all, or keep them on full pay. From August furloughed workers will be able to return to work part-time with employers being asked to pay towards the salaries of their furloughed staff.</p> <p>The government said it is also exploring ways in which people can do additional training or learn new skills while they are furloughed and their employer is receiving money from the government.</p> <h2><strong>4. What does it mean for employers?</strong></h2> <p>The 80% pay level will remain, but companies will have to start contributing for staff that return part-time. There are currently no details of what companies will be asked to pay, but it could be that employers have to pay 20% of their furloughed employees\u2019 salaries, while the government pays the remaining 60%.</p> <p>The chancellor said: \u201cWe will ask employers to start sharing with the government the cost of paying salaries.\u201d</p> <p>In its <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-extends-furlough-scheme-until-october\">official advice</a>, the Treasury said: \u201cThe employer payments will substitute the contribution the government is currently making, ensuring that staff continue to receive 80% of their salary, up to \u00a32,500 a month.\u201d</p> <p>Employer groups welcomed the deal, but said they needed more details. Mike Cherry, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: \u201cWe await further detail on the contributions that will be required of small employers after July. We need to ensure that those obligations are affordable for the many businesses that have had no revenue coming in for months now, but still have fixed overheads to worry about.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5. What does it mean for workers?</strong></h2> <p>This deal paves the way for workers to begin a partial return to employment and probably means that employers will be less likely to make them permanently unemployed in the coming weeks. But it is still another 10 weeks before the part-time scheme begins and in the meantime some employers may still decide to make deep redundancies. In that case, the employee will have to apply for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/11/universal-credit-how-claim-coronavirus-lay-offs-benefits\">universal credit.</a></p> <h2><strong>6. I\u2019m self-employed. Am I being offered anything?</strong></h2> <p>The government said there will be no changes to the scheme until July. It is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-support-package-for-uk-self-employed-how-does-it-work\">currently offering </a>self-employed people a taxable grant based on their previous monthly earnings over the last three years, worth up to 80% of earnings and capped at \u00a32,500 a month. To be eligible, you must have annual \u201cprofits\u201d (self-employed earnings) of less than \u00a350,000 a year, according to HMRC.</p> <p>The scheme has been criticised for leaving some groups of the self-employed without a safety net. </p> <h2><strong>7. How much will it cost?</strong></h2> <p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies estimates the likely cost over the whole of the period from March to July will be around \u00a360bn \u2013 or \u00a312bn a month.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/how-the-uk-furlough-scheme-compares-with-other-countries\">8. How does the scheme compare with those available in other countries?</a></strong></h2> <p>The German scheme, called <em>Kurzarbeit</em>, is expected to cost at least \u20ac40bn. It currently covers 10 million workers and is among the most generous, paying up to 67% of net wages lost due to shorter hours, to a maximum of \u20ac6,700 per month for employees with children, and 60% for those without children. Unlike the British scheme, German firms can allow staff to work part-time, reducing the cost.</p> <p>In France, more than 12 million are covered by a scheme called <em>Chimage Partial</em> which has cost \u20ac26bn so far. It offers 70% of salary on up to \u20ac6,927 gross per month. Employees on minimum wage (SMIC) receive 100% . As with the German scheme, firms can claim just part of a worker\u2019s salary and many do, limiting the cost to the finance ministry.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s Temporary Wage subsidy scheme is providing support for 450,000 workers. Since 4 May the scheme has become more generous, paying an 85% subsidy up to \u20ac21,400. Like the UK scheme it compels claimants to stay at home and not work, but the Irish government has signalled that will be changed.</p>",

You fish, catch bugs, water flowers, plant fruit trees and accumulate cute things with which to decorate your home and set dress the island.

(Yes, that is a thing.) But this is part of Animal Crossing\u2019s magic: you really can play it the way you like. It can occupy you for a few hours a week, pootling around pulling up weeds and catching up with your penguin neighbour; or for hours every day, amassing wealth and furniture and clothing until your virtual house looks like an imaginative 12-year-old\u2019s dream mansion.</p> <p>In Kyoto, Japan, the game\u2019s creators at Nintendo are finding the immense virality of Animal Crossing: New Horizons validating, because this is a game designed to be shared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49fcfbf5863ad36426d4801bfe9eb193cc212714\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49fcfbf5863ad36426d4801bfe9eb193cc212714/0_0_670_906/370.jpg\" alt=\"Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing series producer at Nintendo, where he has worked since 1994.\" width=\"370\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hisashi Nogami, Animal Crossing series producer at Nintendo, where he has worked since 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nintendo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnimal Crossing is a communication game,\u201d says Aya Kyogoku, who has worked on every Animal Crossing game since 2003. \u201cI hope that through their life in the game world, people enjoy communicating with each other, whether it\u2019s through playing with other people or talking enthusiastically about the game.

      "bodyText": "Bluey, the Emmy-winning Australian children\u2019s television series about a little blue heeler puppy and her family, has just added another award to its swag \u2013 in a far more traditional medium. Bluey: The Beach, a board book based on the animated TV series and published by Penguin Random House Australia\u2019s Puffin imprint, has become the first children\u2019s picture book to be named book of the year at the Australian Book Industry awards. The Abias are hosted by the Australian Publishers Association and judged by an academy of more than 250 publishing industry figures. They recognise success in Australian writing, publishing and bookselling, with an orientation towards business and sales. The Bluey books line has been a sales machine for PRH, with books from the series being the second-, third- and fourth-biggest selling children\u2019s books in Australia in 2019. The Beach was the highest-selling Bluey title last year, shifting 129,516 copies in the two months after its release in November, and was second only to Andy Griffiths and Terry Denton\u2019s The 117-Storey Treehouse, which sold 213,102 copies. Sales for The Beach now tally more than 200,000. Though they traditionally feature a lavish dinner event, this year\u2019s Abias ceremony was livestreamed on YouTube on Wednesday afternoon amid the coronavirus lockdown. The 117-Storey Treehouse, Pan Macmillan\u2019s own children\u2019s literary juggernaut, was not overlooked, winning book of the year for younger children (ages seven to 12). Behrouz Boochani has received another award for his book written from an Australian-run detention centre on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Manus Island, No Friend But the Mountains \u2013 this time for the audiobook narrated by the Farsi translator Omid Tofighian and other high-profile Australians, including Benjamin Law, Isobelle Carmody, Janet Galbraith, Mathilda Imlah, Geoffrey Robertson, Richard Flanagan, Sarah Dale, Thomas Keneally and Yumi Stynes. Boochani, who remains in New Zealand after travelling there for a literary festival in November, now adds the Abias\u2019 audiobook of the year award to a long list of Australian literary accolades, including the Victorian premier\u2019s literary prize, the NSW premier\u2019s literary prize, the National Biography award, and last year\u2019s Abia general nonfiction award, among others. Helen Garner\u2019s contribution to the books industry was recognised on Wednesday with the Lloyd O\u2019Neil Hall of Fame award. Allen &amp; Unwin was named publisher of the year, as well as being responsible for a host of other prizewinning books, including Heather Rose\u2019s novel Bruny, which won general fiction book of the year, while the prize for literary book of the year went to Charlotte Wood for The Weekend. Kitty Flanagan won general nonfiction book of the year for her \u201canti-self-help\u201d book, Kitty Flanagan\u2019s 488 Rules for Life, while Clare Bowditch\u2019s memoir, Your Own Kind of Girl, was awarded the Matt Richell award for new writer of the year. The Indigenous press Magabala Books, Readings and the Sydney bookshop Kinokuniya also received industry awards. There are seven titles so far in the Bluey series, with total sales about to exceed 1m.

Sunak said that while the UK was yet to fulfil the technical definition of a recession \u2013 two successive quarters of falling activity \u2013 it was only a matter of time. \u201cWe are seeing one [quarter of GDP contraction] here with only a few days of impact from the virus, so it is now \u2026 very likely that the UK economy will face a significant recession this year and we are in the middle of that as we speak,\u201d the chancellor told the BBC. The ONS data showed that the economy stagnated in the final three months of 2019 before its coronavirus-induced plunge in the first quarter of 2020. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cMarch\u2019s GDP figures showed the UK economy was already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect. And with the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse.\u201d Service sector output \u2013 which accounts four-fifths of GDP \u2013 declined by more than 6% in March, while production fell by 4.2% and construction by 5.9%. Over the year to the first quarter of this year, the economy grew smaller by 1.6%, its fastest rate of decline since late 2009. The contraction recorded in the first three months of 2020 was slightly smaller than the 2.5% expected by the City. But a much bigger hit is in store for the second quarter, with the Bank of England pencilling in a decline of 25% in GDP. Threadneedle Street is projecting a 14% annual decline. The ONS\u2019s deputy national statistician for economic statistics, Jonathan Athow, said: \u201cWith the arrival of the pandemic, nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall. \u201cServices and construction saw record declines on the month, with education, car sales and restaurants all falling substantially. Although very few industries saw growth, there were some that did, including IT support and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, soaps and cleaning products. \u201cThe pandemic also hit trade globally, with UK imports and exports falling over the last couple of months, including a notable drop in imports from China.\u201d Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe speed and scale at which coronavirus has hit the UK economy is unprecedented and means that the first-quarter decline is likely to be followed by a further, more historically significant contraction in economic activity in [the second quarter]. \u201cWhile a swift \u2018V-shaped\u2019 economic revival as restrictions are lifted may prove too optimistic, government support can play a vital role in avoiding a prolonged downturn.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The Old Vic, one of London\u2019s oldest and most illustrious theatres, is in a \u201cseriously perilous\u201d financial situation caused by the Covid-19 crisis, says its artistic director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/matthew-warchus\">Matthew Warchus</a>.</p> <p>Warchus said that the Old Vic is one of a group of organisations, including Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, the Royal Academy and the Royal Albert Hall, that have \u201csignificant cultural presence but, unusually, no government funding\u201d. The theatre is a charity that relies entirely on ticket sales, sponsorship and donations. It has some reserve funds but according to Warchus it is a matter of \u201ca small number of months\u201d before those run out and there is \u201cno safety net\u201d after that.</p> <p>How long its reserves will last is \u201cthe big question we talk about nearly every day\u201d, said Warchus, and depends partly on how much further the government\u2019s furlough scheme is extended. Eighty per cent of the organisation\u2019s staff are currently furloughed and the scheme has kept the theatre from \u201cfalling to pieces\u201d, he explained, but it is not a long-term solution. Rishi Sunak has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52634759\">extended the furlough job retention scheme</a> until the end of October, but many theatres are not expecting to open until after that date.

      "body": "<p>\u201cDoes anyone know of a private Covid antibody test that is properly reliable?\u201d asked one of my friends on WhatsApp.</p> \n<p>The question made me curious. Having antibodies, of course, means you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and you\u2019re unlikely to spread it. But with false negatives and positives, it\u2019s no guarantee and you\u2019d still want to keep a distance from vulnerable people. Also no one knows how long the immunity lasts.</p> \n<p>At the moment, the only tests available to ordinary people are commercial kits on sale over the internet. I had a quick rummage online and it looked like some may now have regulatory approval. But are they really any good? How do they work? How much does it cost? And will I feel impregnable if I get a positive answer?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It goes against the grain to shell out \u00a3100 (\u00a3160 if you add same-day delivery within the M25) for a private test of uncertain provenance, quality, reliability and significance. But I ordered one to road test it. After a bit of a kerfuffle, a cheerful bike courier (helmet, no mask or gloves, hadn\u2019t had the test himself because \u201cit costs too much for me\u201d) delivered the elegantly boxed kit and waited patiently for me to do it. I may be a doctor but I found it very tricky. I tried to follow the written instructions but if you\u2019re not a natural Ikea assembler, you may struggle as I did. You use a lancet to prick your finger and milk 10 drops of blood into a tube. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I filled it from the wrong end \u2013 not realising that you had to take the top off first. I couldn\u2019t get enough blood out of my chubby fingertips \u2013 even after four attempts. Luckily my GP partner arrived, shoved a needle into a vein in my arm and we filled the tube from the right end. By this time, the puncture sites in my fingertips had started dripping and there was blood all over the place. I felt like an idiot.</p> \n<p>The results will be ready in a couple of days but, in the meantime, if I have any Covid questions or feel unwell, I should call NHS 111 according to the kit supplier\u2019s website. This default setting by the private sector always makes me smile wryly. To be fair, the company I used is offering a discount to NHS staff \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure that this absolves them of a duty of care to the consumer.</p> \n<p>The test claims that it has \u201cdemonstrated specificity and sensitivity of greater than 99% 14 days or more after symptoms started\u201d. This means that it is unlikely to give a false positive or negative result. It has been certified for use by the EU and is undergoing validation testing in the UK by public health organisations. It tests for immunoglobulin G, the antibody that rises more slowly after infection but stays around longer in the body \u2013 hence the 14-day lag. Kits that include immunoglobulin M, which is the antibody that appears more quickly after infection, are also becoming available.</p> \n<p>Authorities including the US Food and Drug Administration are giving <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/fda-voices/insight-fdas-revised-policy-antibody-tests-prioritizing-access-and-accuracy\">emergency use authorisation</a> to get more antibody testing kits on to the market to answer the all important questions: what percentage of the population has been exposed to the virus; does the presence of antibodies confer immunity; and, if so, for how long? And antibody-rich blood from recovered individuals (\u201cconvalescent plasma\u201d) can also potentially be used <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/plasma-from-coronavirus-survivors-found-to-help-severely-ill-patients\">to treat infected patients</a> with life-threatening disease.</p> \n<p>So the kits are useful for the study of populations and to identify potential antibody donors. But should you rush out and buy one? The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">World Health Organization </a>says that the tests can show if you\u2019ve had the virus but that there is \u201cno evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\u201d.</p> \n<p>The leading consultant oncologist <a href=\"https://www.therutherford.com/\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://www.therutherford.com/\"> Karol Sikora</a> argues that the kits are probably reliable but not necessarily useful for individuals. He says the dream ticket would be a test like a piece of litmus paper that you could put in the mouth to reveal both the presence of the active virus and antibodies to get an instant result. Biotech companies are working on it but it\u2019s a huge challenge. As things stand in the UK, there\u2019s no freely available, officially sanctioned antibody test to show previous infection and no wholly satisfactory antigen test to show active infection. (The antigen test relies on a swab being shoved up your throat and nose and transported to a distant lab for analysis. False negative rates are as high as 25% and portable tests are still unreliable.)</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/929083\">Sikora</a> says there are three groups of people on the streets, \u201cthe susceptible, the infected and the recovered or so-called <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31034-5/fulltext\">immunoprivileged</a>\u201d. We can\u2019t be sure but, based on experience with similar Sars and Mers viruses, he thinks that the recovered group who have antibodies are probably immune. How <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/covid-19-rapid-risk-assessment-coronavirus-disease-2019-eighth-update-8-april-2020.pdf\">strong or long-lasting that immunity</a> is, though, is anyone\u2019s guess.</p> \n<p>The rate of seroconversion (the percentage of people who have antibodies) in studies is lower than you\u2019d expect given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/antibody-study-suggests-coronavirus-is-far-more-widespread-than-previously-thought\">prevalence of the disease</a> (between 1.5% and 20% in published studies and around 10% in Sikora\u2019s small study). This could be because the body can mount a swift and effective defence against a virus without forming lasting antibodies. So if you test positive for the virus (antigen test) but negative for antibodies, that means that you\u2019ve had the infection. But are you immune? The answer is a weak \u201cmaybe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even if you are immune, what about the ethics of granting immunity passports\u2013 a kind of get out of jail free card \u2013 to those who test positive? The ethicist <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765836\">Prof</a><a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2765836\"> Ezekiel Emanuel</a> argues that immunity-based licences would be good because they would free up individuals who have been infected already without worsening the situation of those who haven\u2019t. Licences would be based on hard facts so would not be discriminatory. That may be so, but doesn\u2019t allow for the fake or stolen documents that would be inevitable in our ethically impure world.</p> \n<p>Where does all this uncertainty leave us?

      "bodyText": "\u201cDoes anyone know of a private Covid antibody test that is properly reliable?\u201d asked one of my friends on WhatsApp. The question made me curious. Having antibodies, of course, means you\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and you\u2019re unlikely to spread it. But with false negatives and positives, it\u2019s no guarantee and you\u2019d still want to keep a distance from vulnerable people. Also no one knows how long the immunity lasts. At the moment, the only tests available to ordinary people are commercial kits on sale over the internet. I had a quick rummage online and it looked like some may now have regulatory approval. But are they really any good? How do they work? How much does it cost? And will I feel impregnable if I get a positive answer? It goes against the grain to shell out \u00a3100 (\u00a3160 if you add same-day delivery within the M25) for a private test of uncertain provenance, quality, reliability and significance. But I ordered one to road test it. After a bit of a kerfuffle, a cheerful bike courier (helmet, no mask or gloves, hadn\u2019t had the test himself because \u201cit costs too much for me\u201d) delivered the elegantly boxed kit and waited patiently for me to do it. I may be a doctor but I found it very tricky. I tried to follow the written instructions but if you\u2019re not a natural Ikea assembler, you may struggle as I did. You use a lancet to prick your finger and milk 10 drops of blood into a tube. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I filled it from the wrong end \u2013 not realising that you had to take the top off first. I couldn\u2019t get enough blood out of my chubby fingertips \u2013 even after four attempts. Luckily my GP partner arrived, shoved a needle into a vein in my arm and we filled the tube from the right end. By this time, the puncture sites in my fingertips had started dripping and there was blood all over the place. I felt like an idiot. The results will be ready in a couple of days but, in the meantime, if I have any Covid questions or feel unwell, I should call NHS 111 according to the kit supplier\u2019s website. This default setting by the private sector always makes me smile wryly. To be fair, the company I used is offering a discount to NHS staff \u2013 although I\u2019m not sure that this absolves them of a duty of care to the consumer. The test claims that it has \u201cdemonstrated specificity and sensitivity of greater than 99% 14 days or more after symptoms started\u201d. This means that it is unlikely to give a false positive or negative result. It has been certified for use by the EU and is undergoing validation testing in the UK by public health organisations. It tests for immunoglobulin G, the antibody that rises more slowly after infection but stays around longer in the body \u2013 hence the 14-day lag. Kits that include immunoglobulin M, which is the antibody that appears more quickly after infection, are also becoming available. Authorities including the US Food and Drug Administration are giving emergency use authorisation to get more antibody testing kits on to the market to answer the all important questions: what percentage of the population has been exposed to the virus; does the presence of antibodies confer immunity; and, if so, for how long? And antibody-rich blood from recovered individuals (\u201cconvalescent plasma\u201d) can also potentially be used to treat infected patients with life-threatening disease. So the kits are useful for the study of populations and to identify potential antibody donors. But should you rush out and buy one? The World Health Organization says that the tests can show if you\u2019ve had the virus but that there is \u201cno evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\u201d. The leading consultant oncologist Prof Karol Sikora argues that the kits are probably reliable but not necessarily useful for individuals. He says the dream ticket would be a test like a piece of litmus paper that you could put in the mouth to reveal both the presence of the active virus and antibodies to get an instant result. Biotech companies are working on it but it\u2019s a huge challenge. As things stand in the UK, there\u2019s no freely available, officially sanctioned antibody test to show previous infection and no wholly satisfactory antigen test to show active infection. (The antigen test relies on a swab being shoved up your throat and nose and transported to a distant lab for analysis. False negative rates are as high as 25% and portable tests are still unreliable.) Sikora says there are three groups of people on the streets, \u201cthe susceptible, the infected and the recovered or so-called immunoprivileged\u201d. We can\u2019t be sure but, based on experience with similar Sars and Mers viruses, he thinks that the recovered group who have antibodies are probably immune. How strong or long-lasting that immunity is, though, is anyone\u2019s guess. The rate of seroconversion (the percentage of people who have antibodies) in studies is lower than you\u2019d expect given the prevalence of the disease (between 1.5% and 20% in published studies and around 10% in Sikora\u2019s small study). This could be because the body can mount a swift and effective defence against a virus without forming lasting antibodies. So if you test positive for the virus (antigen test) but negative for antibodies, that means that you\u2019ve had the infection. But are you immune? The answer is a weak \u201cmaybe\u201d. Even if you are immune, what about the ethics of granting immunity passports\u2013 a kind of get out of jail free card \u2013 to those who test positive? The ethicist Prof Ezekiel Emanuel argues that immunity-based licences would be good because they would free up individuals who have been infected already without worsening the situation of those who haven\u2019t. Licences would be based on hard facts so would not be discriminatory. That may be so, but doesn\u2019t allow for the fake or stolen documents that would be inevitable in our ethically impure world. Where does all this uncertainty leave us? Should my friend shell out \u00a3100? Will my life change when I get my result? Sikora says \u201cyou can wear your positive (antibody) test as a badge if you want to but you still have to stick to the law\u201d. Perhaps it would give you peace of mind if you can\u2019t resist a cuddle with a grandchild, he concedes, and frontline key workers in hospitals and care homes could feel and be safer. Ongoing population-based antigen and antibody testing are clearly vital tools in planning an exit strategy from lockdown. But personally, I wish I\u2019d saved my money \u2013and fingertips. \u2022 Ann Robinson is a GP",

      "bodyText": "The Queensland government says it will bid for Virgin Australia in an attempt to keep the stricken airline\u2019s headquarters in Brisbane and support the state\u2019s tourism sector, which has been savaged by the coronavirus crisis. The treasurer, Cameron Dick, said the state was willing to buy equity in a resurrected Virgin Australia, but could also invest through other methods including a loan or guarantee. The government has appointed the state-owned Queensland Investment Corporation to manage the bid, which has been dubbed \u201cProject Maroon\u201d \u2013 the state\u2019s colour when it plays New South Wales in State of Origin rugby league games. Dick said Queensland intended to bid as part of a consortium but did not name any potential partners. Other reported bidders for the airline, which collapsed into administration last month, include consortiums led by the mining magnate Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest and private equity group BGH Capital, as well as specialist airline investor Indigo. Dick said Australia needed two airlines and the government was determined to avoid a repeat of the situation after the collapse of Ansett, when Qantas enjoyed a near-monopoly. \u201cWe have an opportunity to retain not only head office and crew staff in Queensland, but also to grow jobs in the repairs, maintenance and overhaul sector and support both direct and indirect jobs in our tourism sector,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw the punishing increase to the cost of flights after the Ansett collapse, and this government will not stand by and let that happen again.\u201d He said QIC, led by chief executive Damien Frawley, had developed \u201ca comprehensive strategy to ensure Queensland is best positioned for a successful bid\u201d. \u201cQIC will advise government on all aspects of the bid, including the optimal partner group, the quantum and structure of the state\u2019s contribution, as well as probity and governance,\u201d he said. Frawley said QIC would manage the state bid separately to its existing assets of more than $80bn. \u201cQIC has longstanding conflict management and governance processes in place which enable us to manage the state\u2019s potential interest in VAH [Virgin Australia Holdings], and the bid, while separately managing other clients\u2019 investment interests,\u201d he said. He said a timetable under which Virgin\u2019s administrators want non-binding bids by Friday to make a sale by mid-June was \u201cambitious\u201d. \u201cThis is a competitive space, but Queensland is a serious contender and our discussions with the administrators have been making progress,\u201d he said.",

At a fraught press briefing on Monday, the president declared: \u201cAll throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly.\u201d Yet county-specific figures show a surge in infection rates in towns and rural communities in red states such as Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky and North and South Dakota, according to data tracking by the New York Times. Trump\u2019s claim is also contradicted by data used by the White House\u2019s own pandemic taskforce to track new and emerging hotspots.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Calla Wahlquist and it is Wednesday 13 May. Josh Frydenberg tests negative to Covid-19 The federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, tested negative to Covid-19 after succumbing to a coughing fit in parliament on Tuesday. He said he was tested on Tuesday night, \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d, and was back in parliament after he received a negative result early Wednesday morning. Coronavirus advisor paid $267,345 The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has corrected evidence that Scott Morrison\u2019s handpicked Covid-19 coordination adviser, the former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power, is being paid $500,000 for six months\u2019 work. In a statement issued late on Wednesday, Morrison\u2019s department said Power would be paid $267,345 to cover his expenses as chair of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission \u2013 not $500,000. Power\u2019s remuneration was revealed at a hearing of the Senate inquiry into the management of the coronavirus crisis, where senators focused on whether there were proper processes in place for members of the NCCC to declare any conflicts of interest, given that many are company directors. Queensland government to bid for Virgin Australia The Queensland state government will bid for Virgin Australia, the new treasurer, Cameron Dick, has announced. In a statement, the treasurer said he has appointed Queensland Investment Corporation, a government-owned investment company, to pursue a bid that could include a \u201cdirect equity stake\u201d in the airline. \u201cWe have the opportunity to retain not only head office and crew staff in Queensland, but also to grow jobs in the repairs, maintenance and overhaul sector and support both direct and indirect jobs in our tourism sector,\u201d Dick said. \u201cWe saw the punishing increase to the cost of flights after the Ansett collapse, and this government will not stand by and let that happen again. Conspiracy undermines confidence in 5G A committee established to examine plans for the construction of Australia\u2019s 5G network, which is being completed by Telstra, Optus and Vodafone, has received hundreds of submissions from members of the public concerned about perceived health issues associated with 5G. A report issued by the committee said community confidence had been \u201cshaken by extensive misinformation preying on the fears of the public spread via the internet, and presented as facts, particularly through social media\u201d. \u201cThe committee has been assured that 5G is safe,\u201d it said. The report was completed in March, before misinformation began spreading online claiming that 5G was either responsible for the coronavirus or for \u201cpoisoning cells\u201d that created the virus. \u2018Healing church\u2019 fined $150,000 The Australian drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has fined an Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing more than $150,000 for selling and promoting a solution containing industrial bleach as an alleged cure for coronavirus. The church\u2019s US leader, Mark Grenon, wrote to Donald Trump days before the US president claimed disinfectant could be a coronavirus cure. Twiggy\u2019s tests are not being used Coronavirus tests brought to Australia by the mining billionaire Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest at a cost of $200m to the Australian taxpayer are not being used by most state and territory governments and have instead been sent to the national medical stockpile.

Parliament should return, says Greens The Greens have called for the federal parliament to return to its regular sitting schedule, saying the response to the coronavirus crisis requires \u201cfull parliamentary oversight\u201d. Parliament was adjourned until August at the last emergency sitting, and the leader of the House, Christian Porter, said a revised sitting calendar was being worked on to bring parliament back before August but had not yet been released.

      "body": "<p>After Iowa State saw its Big-12 and NCAA basketball tournaments cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the school was among those immediately facing a financial suckerpunch \u2013 <a href=\"https://cyclones.com/news/2020/4/1/athletics-pollard-pens-letter-to-iowa-state-fans.aspx\">a $5m shortfall</a> in its budget.</p> <p>Yet the crisis was solved swiftly and in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few months ago. Jamie Pollard, the school\u2019s athletic director, and the school\u2019s football coach, Matt Campbell, immediately agreed to a reduction of their salaries, while there were other pay cuts across the department, creating a stopgap for the entire shortfall. For Campbell, a cut to his <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28218069/iowa-state-gives-matt-campbell-extension-2025\">reported</a> $3.5m salary would hardly mean a lean paycheck for a man who, even with the drop, is among the highest-paid employees in the state.</p> <p>For decades, college sports have been in a Gilded Age. Salaries for men\u2019s basketball and football coaches and support staff have soared with <a href=\"https://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/salaries/\">dozens of college coaches</a> in America making millions annually, be they at private or public universities. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22454170/highest-paid-state-employees-include-ncaa-coaches-nick-saban-john-calipari-dabo-swinney-bill-self-bob-huggins\">College coaches are the highest-paid state employees</a> in <em>39 of 50 states</em>, according to analysis from ESPN, and some of them aren\u2019t even currently coaching at those schools anymore. Many benefit from private jets, housing stipends and generous severance packages. Wake Forest reportedly <a href=\"http://www.supertalkwfhg.com/2020/04/30/official-forbes-to-replace-manning-as-wake-forest-mens-head-basketball-coach/\">paid $15m last month just to get rid of its men\u2019s basketball coach</a>, Danny Manning.</p> <p>College athletes, meanwhile, are not paid a salary, per rules from the NCAA, the organization that governs college sports in the United States.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed-supported.html\" data-alt=\"EHRF\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2017/05/americas-unequal-future/embed-supported.html\">EHRF</a> </figure>  <p>As Covid-19 spreads, ravaging American health, the economy, and hopes for a fall football season, critical minds are turning to millionaire college coaches and handsomely-paid athletic department staff. It marks a reversal of decades of growth in long-sacred paydays in college sports. Moreover, the income inequalities of college sports are laid bare.</p> <p>These coaching pay cuts \u201care completely appropriate,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/andrew-zimbalist\">Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College</a>, says. \u201cIn fact, I think 90% pay cuts would also be appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>At the University of Louisville, which faced a $15m shortfall, coaches and senior athletic department staff took a 10% pay cut, according to a spokesman, including a reduction of football coach Scott Satterfield\u2019s $3.25m salary. Boise State University implemented furloughs across its university, including its athletic department, with those earning over $150,000 taking a larger reduction. At the University of Wyoming, athletic director Tom Burman volunteered to take a 10% salary reduction through 31 December and said he planned to donate more to the <a href=\"https://cowboyjoeclub.com/\">Cowboy Joe Club</a>, a fund for athletic scholarships.</p> <p>\u201cNot only are we impacted by the recession tied to Covid-19, but our state is extremely reliant on energy. And energy \u2013 coal, gas and oil \u2013 all are experiencing historic challenges,\u201d Burman said in a statement. \u201cI feel as a leader, who is compensated above the average person in the state, I need to lead by example. We will get through this but only if we work together and care about our neighbors.\u201d</p> <p>Even the NCAA\u2019s president Mark Emmert, a longtime focal point for criticism in the lopsided economics of college sports, announced that he would take a 20% pay cut of his $2.1m salary.</p> <p>Notable are the coaches who have not taken a pay cut, or at least announced one publicly.

      "bodyText": "After Iowa State saw its Big-12 and NCAA basketball tournaments cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, the school was among those immediately facing a financial suckerpunch \u2013 a $5m shortfall in its budget. Yet the crisis was solved swiftly and in a way that would have been unthinkable just a few months ago. Jamie Pollard, the school\u2019s athletic director, and the school\u2019s football coach, Matt Campbell, immediately agreed to a reduction of their salaries, while there were other pay cuts across the department, creating a stopgap for the entire shortfall. For Campbell, a cut to his reported $3.5m salary would hardly mean a lean paycheck for a man who, even with the drop, is among the highest-paid employees in the state. For decades, college sports have been in a Gilded Age. Salaries for men\u2019s basketball and football coaches and support staff have soared with dozens of college coaches in America making millions annually, be they at private or public universities. College coaches are the highest-paid state employees in 39 of 50 states, according to analysis from ESPN, and some of them aren\u2019t even currently coaching at those schools anymore. Many benefit from private jets, housing stipends and generous severance packages. Wake Forest reportedly paid $15m last month just to get rid of its men\u2019s basketball coach, Danny Manning. College athletes, meanwhile, are not paid a salary, per rules from the NCAA, the organization that governs college sports in the United States. As Covid-19 spreads, ravaging American health, the economy, and hopes for a fall football season, critical minds are turning to millionaire college coaches and handsomely-paid athletic department staff. It marks a reversal of decades of growth in long-sacred paydays in college sports. Moreover, the income inequalities of college sports are laid bare. These coaching pay cuts \u201care completely appropriate,\u201d Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College, says. \u201cIn fact, I think 90% pay cuts would also be appropriate.\u201d At the University of Louisville, which faced a $15m shortfall, coaches and senior athletic department staff took a 10% pay cut, according to a spokesman, including a reduction of football coach Scott Satterfield\u2019s $3.25m salary. Boise State University implemented furloughs across its university, including its athletic department, with those earning over $150,000 taking a larger reduction. At the University of Wyoming, athletic director Tom Burman volunteered to take a 10% salary reduction through 31 December and said he planned to donate more to the Cowboy Joe Club, a fund for athletic scholarships. \u201cNot only are we impacted by the recession tied to Covid-19, but our state is extremely reliant on energy. And energy \u2013 coal, gas and oil \u2013 all are experiencing historic challenges,\u201d Burman said in a statement. \u201cI feel as a leader, who is compensated above the average person in the state, I need to lead by example. We will get through this but only if we work together and care about our neighbors.\u201d Even the NCAA\u2019s president Mark Emmert, a longtime focal point for criticism in the lopsided economics of college sports, announced that he would take a 20% pay cut of his $2.1m salary. Notable are the coaches who have not taken a pay cut, or at least announced one publicly. None of the three highest-paid coaches \u2013 Clemson\u2019s Dabo Swinney ($9.3m a year), the University of Alabama\u2019s Nick Saban ($8.85m) and Jim Harbaugh at the University of Michigan ($7.5m) \u2013 have announced pay cuts. A spokesman for Clemson confirmed that Swinney has not taken a pay cut. A spokesperson from Alabama did not return requests for comment. A spokesman for the University of Michigan confirmed that although the school\u2019s athletic director Warde Manuel is taking a 5% pay cut, \u201cno athletic department staff member has been asked to consider reductions in their salary.\u201d In better times, when revenue from ticket sales, massive TV contracts and checks from boosters rolled in, schools often defended the large salaries of coaches by arguing that they brought in winning records, a sense of pride, and money to schools. Critics have argued that those programs were also costly to run and that college coach pay exists in an \u201cartificial marketplace,\u201d Zimbalist says. It\u2019s artificial in that athletes aren\u2019t paid, athletic departments don\u2019t have stockholders, and they may receive taxpayer subsidies for everything from stadium construction to their own salaries, he adds. \u201cWhat they have are stakeholders and these are boosters and alums and students and administrators who want to see the team win. A normal business operates to generate a profit and therefore they\u2019re acutely cost conscious. This business operates with very little regard to cost because they\u2019re all about winning.\u201d Zimbalist also serves on the board of directors of the Drake Group, an influential group of academics who have researched the role of college athletics. The group is calling for salary freezes for coaches, as well as a suspension of bonuses. Pointing to Iowa State\u2019s decisions as an example, the group said in a statement, \u201cthis is the right thing to do.\u201d Internally, there is a consensus that pay cuts are in the crosshairs, even if many prominent coaches or schools have yet to step forward. An April survey of athletic directors nationwide conducted by LEAD1, an organization of athletic department executives, found that 67% of athletic directors \u201cagree or strongly agree\u201d with limiting current compensation. (An anonymous quote from one of the survey respondents said, \u201ceveryone loves socialism on college campuses but in athletic departments it is straight capitalism.\u201d) More than half of those surveyed said that their departments did not \u201chave a financial reserve that could aid in this type of crisis.\u201d The economics of college sports are often more complicated than in professional leagues.

      "bodyText": "More than 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales may have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19, academics have calculated \u2013 more than double the number stated as passing away from the disease in official figures. Academics at the London School of Economics found that data on deaths in care homes directly attributed to the virus published by the Office for National Statistics significantly underestimated the impact of the pandemic on care home residents and accounted for only about four out of 10 of the excess deaths in care settings recorded in recent weeks in England and Wales. ONS statisticians said on Tuesday that 8,314 people had died from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in English care homes up to 8 May. The figures suggest the impact of the virus in care homes is finally reducing. They are based on reports filed directly from care home operators to the regulator, the Care Quality Commission. Care Inspectorate Wales has said Covid was confirmed or suspected in a further 504 cases in homes up to the 8 May in Wales. But academics at the care policy and evaluation centre at the LSE found that when excess deaths of other care residents and the deaths of care home residents from Covid-19 in hospitals are taken into account, the toll that can be directly and indirectly linked to the virus pandemic is likely to be more than double the current official count. They said these additional fatalities may have been caused by residents who did not seek or receive medical care for other health conditions for fear of contracting Covid-19 or over-burdening the NHS as well a lack of access to normal care. Care homes have been running at 10% to 20% staff absence rates and many homes have been trying to isolate residents in their rooms to reduce infection spread, but this can also make their normal care more difficult and residents\u2019 needs less visible. The academics, who have been tracking virus death tolls in care homes globally since the start of the pandemic, cited concerns raised internationally about deaths being linked to the consequences of residents being isolated in their rooms, without adequate eating, drinking or medical support, and not to the virus itself. They said that from 13 March to 1 May, there were 19,938 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in care homes \u2013 that is above the average number of deaths for the same weeks in the previous five years.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mainland China has reported more than 84,000 cases and more than 4,600 deaths during the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Fearful of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan\">another outbreak and a return to the draconian lockdowns</a>, the authorities are drawing up plans for \u201c10 days of battle\u201d, directing each district of Wuhan to develop and submit plans to test all their citizens.</p> \n<p>There are few details for the ambitious undertaking, but Chinese media has suggested the \u201c10-day\u201d directive is a time limit for each region, on staggered start times.</p> \n<p>\u201cEach district shall make arrangements for nucleic acid screening for all members within 10 days,\u201d said a Wuhan government notice.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Yicai news said Wuchang district was to be screened between 13 and 20 May, with the intention of finishing by 17 May to allow three days \u201cto find out and fill in the gaps\u201d.</p> \n<p>Caixin Global reported some districts would start this week and some next.

Once the country became a global hotspot, elderly Americans suffered. In some states, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/nursing-homes-us-data-coronavirus\">nursing homes</a> have accounted for a majority of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/nursing-homes-us-data-coronavirus\">Covid-19</a> deaths as facilities scrambled to adapt.</p> <p>Critics say the virus has ravaged nursing homes \u201clike a brushfire\u201d, partly because of the industry\u2019s disastrous track record with infection control, but also because of staffing and resource deficiencies that long predate Covid-19.</p> <p>Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a population at risk, but this industry has a lot of serious problems that led to these enormous outbreaks in nursing homes. So I don\u2019t think they can just say: \u2018It\u2019s not our fault, we didn\u2019t have equipment.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThey were supposed to have that equipment. This isn\u2019t new.\u201d</p> <p>Some nursing homes have also faced criticism for their responses to Covid-19 that have only fanned the outbreaks\u2019 flames.</p> <p>Mike Dark, a staff attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said: \u201cFacilities mostly don\u2019t want to flag that they have the virus even when it\u2019s killing residents, because it\u2019s such a publicity problem, it\u2019s such a business problem, and they are for-profit enterprises.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"611c5c0e76c05e44c4c0cbde6e58d7d29b0df8fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/611c5c0e76c05e44c4c0cbde6e58d7d29b0df8fc/0_410_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheyenne Pipkin (left) with her mother Loraine Franks visits her grandfather Jerry Hogan, a Vietnam veteran, at Lindsey Gardens in California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cheyenne Pipkin (left) with her mother Loraine Franks visits her grandfather Jerry Hogan, a Vietnam veteran, at Lindsey Gardens in California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barcroft Media/via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/nursing-home-care.htm\">70% of US nursing homes</a> are for-profit, and the industry has a reputation for lackluster performance around infection control. In all longterm care facilities, which include nursing homes, somewhere between 1m and 3m serious infections are contracted annually, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/index.html\">according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/index.html\">Hundreds of thousands</a> of people die from infections each year, even when not in the grip of a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur members are working hard to do the right thing and are focused on their missions of providing care. They are on the front lines of fighting coronavirus and are full partners with hospitals and other providers,\u201d Katie Smith Sloan, the <a href=\"https://www.leadingage.org/staff/katie-smith-sloan\">president and CEO of LeadingAge</a>, an association for nonprofits providing services to older people, said.</p> <p>\u201cRegulations about standards of care evolve and change rapidly; providers\u2019 access to needed personal protective equipment and testing is limited and often insufficient.\u201d</p> <p>State officials have been quick to let nursing homes off the hook for decisions made in the midst of the public health emergency. Through a hodgepodge of laws and executive orders, at least 21 states have granted some form of civil immunity to healthcare providers, according to a tally sent to the Guardian by National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care \u2013 though in a few cases it is not clear if the immunity extends to nursing homes.</p> <p>Smith Sloan wrote: \u201cStates recognize that providers require legal protection as a result of actions related to combating the Covid-19 pandemic. LeadingAge \u2026 is pursuing protections on the federal level with a coalition asking for uniform and consistent relief as well.\u201d</p> <p>Some states are including immunity from criminal liability, but policies do generally make exceptions for especially egregious treatment, including willful misconduct or gross negligence.</p> <p>Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said: \u201cTo basically take away the one area of potential accountability when residents are most vulnerable to me is dumbfounding and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>For some public health experts, however, the issue is not so cut and dried. They describe nursing homes as a sector in chronic need of reform that is nevertheless \u201cthe safety net of the safety net\u201d for vulnerable people.</p> <p>Experts acknowledge that the industry is filled with deficiencies, and is based upon a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/nursing-homes-care-corporate.html\">broken business model</a> that struggles in the face of a pandemic. But they also say nursing homes have been under-prioritized by officials in a public health crisis that has disproportionately targeted their patient populations.</p> <p>Michael L Barnett, a professor at the Harvard school of public health, said: \u201cPutting a nursing home out of business because somebody died is really punishing at the wrong level, because certainly there are nursing homes that probably did not act responsibly, or they may have ignored the threat. But so did many government agencies.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/brooklyn-hospital-legend-dies-of-covid-19-james-charlie-mahoney\">A legend at a Brooklyn hospital dies of Covid-19: 'He ran into the fire'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Instead of lawsuits, experts are advocating for immediate reinforcements in testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff, followed by permanent fixes for longterm care. They suggest payment reform, so nursing homes are not dependent on fickle revenue streams to subsidize their Medicaid patients.</p> <p>Mildred Solomon, president of the Hastings Center, warned against the \u201cblitzkrieg of lawsuits\u201d that these immunity measures mean to avoid.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI think we have to hold our fire, not put our energy into finger-wagging and blaming. And put more emphasis on stronger regulations, with teeth.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The US nursing home industry is clamoring for legal immunity during the coronavirus pandemic, even as horror stories from hard-hit facilities enrage families, consumer advocates and the American public. Healthcare organizations insist liability protections are essential for under-resourced nursing homes fighting against Covid-19, while an already staggering death toll continues to climb. Tricia Neuman, senior vice-president of the Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation, said: \u201cThe liability issue is exposing a longstanding tension between consumer advocates, who want to see the standards enforced, and owners, who are worried about the financial implications of a lawsuit.\u201d The US \u201cground zero\u201d for the virus was a nursing home outside of Seattle. Once the country became a global hotspot, elderly Americans suffered. In some states, nursing homes have accounted for a majority of Covid-19 deaths as facilities scrambled to adapt. Critics say the virus has ravaged nursing homes \u201clike a brushfire\u201d, partly because of the industry\u2019s disastrous track record with infection control, but also because of staffing and resource deficiencies that long predate Covid-19. Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a population at risk, but this industry has a lot of serious problems that led to these enormous outbreaks in nursing homes. So I don\u2019t think they can just say: \u2018It\u2019s not our fault, we didn\u2019t have equipment.\u2019 \u201cThey were supposed to have that equipment. This isn\u2019t new.\u201d Some nursing homes have also faced criticism for their responses to Covid-19 that have only fanned the outbreaks\u2019 flames. Mike Dark, a staff attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said: \u201cFacilities mostly don\u2019t want to flag that they have the virus even when it\u2019s killing residents, because it\u2019s such a publicity problem, it\u2019s such a business problem, and they are for-profit enterprises.\u201d Nearly 70% of US nursing homes are for-profit, and the industry has a reputation for lackluster performance around infection control. In all longterm care facilities, which include nursing homes, somewhere between 1m and 3m serious infections are contracted annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds of thousands of people die from infections each year, even when not in the grip of a pandemic. \u201cOur members are working hard to do the right thing and are focused on their missions of providing care. They are on the front lines of fighting coronavirus and are full partners with hospitals and other providers,\u201d Katie Smith Sloan, the president and CEO of LeadingAge, an association for nonprofits providing services to older people, said. \u201cRegulations about standards of care evolve and change rapidly; providers\u2019 access to needed personal protective equipment and testing is limited and often insufficient.\u201d State officials have been quick to let nursing homes off the hook for decisions made in the midst of the public health emergency. Through a hodgepodge of laws and executive orders, at least 21 states have granted some form of civil immunity to healthcare providers, according to a tally sent to the Guardian by National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care \u2013 though in a few cases it is not clear if the immunity extends to nursing homes. Smith Sloan wrote: \u201cStates recognize that providers require legal protection as a result of actions related to combating the Covid-19 pandemic. LeadingAge \u2026 is pursuing protections on the federal level with a coalition asking for uniform and consistent relief as well.\u201d Some states are including immunity from criminal liability, but policies do generally make exceptions for especially egregious treatment, including willful misconduct or gross negligence. Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said: \u201cTo basically take away the one area of potential accountability when residents are most vulnerable to me is dumbfounding and dangerous.\u201d For some public health experts, however, the issue is not so cut and dried. They describe nursing homes as a sector in chronic need of reform that is nevertheless \u201cthe safety net of the safety net\u201d for vulnerable people. Experts acknowledge that the industry is filled with deficiencies, and is based upon a broken business model that struggles in the face of a pandemic. But they also say nursing homes have been under-prioritized by officials in a public health crisis that has disproportionately targeted their patient populations. Michael L Barnett, a professor at the Harvard school of public health, said: \u201cPutting a nursing home out of business because somebody died is really punishing at the wrong level, because certainly there are nursing homes that probably did not act responsibly, or they may have ignored the threat. But so did many government agencies.\u201d Instead of lawsuits, experts are advocating for immediate reinforcements in testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff, followed by permanent fixes for longterm care. They suggest payment reform, so nursing homes are not dependent on fickle revenue streams to subsidize their Medicaid patients. Mildred Solomon, president of the Hastings Center, warned against the \u201cblitzkrieg of lawsuits\u201d that these immunity measures mean to avoid. She said: \u201cI think we have to hold our fire, not put our energy into finger-wagging and blaming. And put more emphasis on stronger regulations, with teeth.\u201d",

The wire was <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/EUR0325442015ENGLISH.PDF\">first installed in 2005</a>, removed two years later and restored by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy in 2013. The socialist government led by Pedro Sanchez had a chance to make good on repeated promises of a more humanitarian migration policy after June 2018. And throughout 2018 and 2019, Spanish officials stated their determination to remove the razor wire and, <a href=\"https://elpais.com/politica/2019/12/03/actualidad/1575392092_094935.html\">in the words of</a> the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, move beyond \u201cbloody methods\u201d of border control. <br></p> <p> Spain\u2019s humanitarian policy has become largely redundant, though, given that Moroccan authorities have <a href=\"https://www.abc.es/espana/abci-marruecos-concluye-valla-concertinas-para-dejar-interior-retire-ceuta-201910270229_noticia.html\">started installing razor wire </a> along their own border fence with Ceuta. And Grande-Marlaska <a href=\"https://www.publico.es/videos/840550/grande-marlaska-anuncia-un-incremento-del-30-de-altura-en-las-vallas-de-ceuta-y-melilla\">announced </a>recently that fences around the two Spanish exclaves would be raised by 30 metres to deter incomers.</p> <p>These apparent double standards are part of a pattern, says Karl Kopp, of the German NGO Pro Asyl.</p> <p>\u201cThe European style is to outsource this more vicious, older style of border control with its razor wire and multiple fences to third countries. At home, it\u2019s about drones, surveillance and technical cooperation to identify migrants approaching the EU border before they even reach it. Meanwhile, violent border policing is kept farther afield: out of sight, out of mind. So the Moroccans build an \u2018ugly\u2019 fence which can be criticised, while the Spanish create a more \u2018humanitarian\u2019 alternative,\u201d says Kopp.</p> <p>Public pressure elsewhere has led some governments to reconsider the use of razor wire as experts brand it both inhumane and ineffective. Others even wonder about the legality of its use.<br><br>\u201cOn the one hand, legislation about borders states that crossing anywhere other than an official checkpoint is illegal. On the other hand, the notion of crossing a border illegally is usually voided under international refugee law if making an asylum claim,\u201d says Bernd Kasparek, a researcher at <a href=\"https://bordermonitoring.eu/\">Border Monitoring</a>, a German NGO that tracks pushbacks of refugees. \u201cSo there is a legal tension at the EU\u2019s borders. Sometimes it is very necessary to cross the border irregularly in order to lodge an asylum claim. Fortified borders like these interfere with that legal right, particularly in places where it\u2019s an open secret that 99% of asylum claims lodged with border guards are rejected,\u201d Kasparek adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe8c821729a2a41b0fe609cae35d800d548c2d4/0_0_3840_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead animal caught in razor wire\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An animal is killed on a fence built to keep out migrants in Slovenia. Balkan wildlife faces an \u201cextinction threat\u201d from razor wire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Martin Lindic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recent successful attempts at removing razor wire from Europe\u2019s borders have not been motivated by legal or humanitarian concerns but by ecological ones. In Slovenia, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/11/balkan-wildlife-faces-extinction-threat-from-border-fence-to-control-migrants\">environmentalists\u2019 fears</a> of the impact of razor wire on wildlife led in 2016 to the removal of the coils from sections of its border with Croatia. In light of legal constraints in several European states on the deployment of razor wire in rural areas, some manufacturers <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/border-fence-iii/\">even indicate</a> the wildlife-friendly credentials of their razor wire.</p> <p>One difficulty in mounting a challenge is the near impossibility of establishing the true scale of the injuries inflicted specifically by razor wire at borders. According to Kate Dearden, project officer at the I nternational Organization for Migration\u2019s <a href=\"https://missingmigrants.iom.int/\">Missing Migrants Project</a>, many governments only keep records on deaths at borders, rather than deaths that occur later as a result of injuries during attempts to cross them. </p> <p>Moreover, it can be hard to discover exactly which portions of Europe\u2019s fences are topped by razor wire and who supplied it; in recent years many governments have classified detailed information about fences as state security issues. Nevertheless, some manufacturers have refused to sell to border fences on humanitarian grounds. In 2015, Talat Deger, director of the Berlin-based company Mutanox, <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/german-companies-refuse-to-sell-razor-wire-for-hungarys-anti-refugee-fence-a6668296.html\">refused</a> to do a deal with the Hungarian government. In an interview last year, Deger\u2019s successor, Efekan Dikici, said that he and his staff have kept to the principle.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to sell razor wire, of course, but only for the right purposes: to secure property, factories, jails, or for example on the railings of ships to prevent piracy. For those purposes it\u2019s justified; but when it\u2019s being used against humans who need help, that\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Dikici. \u201cMost of our workers have a foreign background themselves, so I think we all feel this a bit more.\u201d <br>That stance is costly. Dikici stressed that it can be genuinely difficult for razor wire suppliers to establish the end use of their product, given that they often deal with middlemen and procurement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling to a government, razor wire could be used for a prison or a border. But if a request for a really huge amount comes in, we do wonder whether it\u2019s for a border fence. Even large private properties need a few hundred metres, not kilometres. I ask myself, if we got a request from the US for the Mexico border, would we give them a quote?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7064d3d46084260980e23cc9945a1d96431443db/0_0_3100_2123/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian migrants clamber under a razor-wire fence into Hungary at the border with Serbia, near Roszke, August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernadett Szabo/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other companies do not appear to have these scruples \u2013 after all, there is a brisk trade to be done in razor wire, which is not to be confused with barbed wire. Razor wire is cut from single sheets of galvanised steel, and most commonly sold in folding coils known in the industry as concertinas. The sharp razors come in various sizes; most seen by the Guardian at four European border fences are of the BTO-22, BTO-20 and BTO-10 varieties \u2013 straight razor edges affixed to a metal coil.</p> <p>There are even more formidable options: CBT-60 includes \u201charpoon\u201d style hooked razor heads that can embed themselves in the flesh of those trying to cross them. Some razor wire manufacturers seemingly flaunt the effects in their brochures; for example, Chinese manufacturer Hebei Jinshi <a href=\"https://www.razorbarbedwirefence.com/pdf/concertina-razor-wire-brochure.pdf\">advertises</a> its CBT-65 long blade as a \u201cvicious product\u201d whose \u201cextra long blade razors produce[s] [a] frightening effect.\u201d</p> <p>However, some European producers have discovered that selling razor wire to border fences comes at the cost of bad press, even in times of rising xenophobic sentiment.<br><br>When Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, decreed in 2015 that a fence be raised on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia, the Malaga-based manufacturer <a href=\"http://concertina.es/en/\">European Security Fencing</a> (ESF) provided the razor wire. ESF, a subdivision of Mora Salazar, has delivered coils for fences in Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and France, and proudly presents itself as one of Europe\u2019s leading razor wire suppliers.</p> <p>Nevertheless, after the installation of its razor wire on the Hungarian border, ESF spokesmen told the Spanish press that they had been unaware of the product\u2019s final use by the Hungarian clients. In September 2015, the company <a href=\"https://www.eldiario.es/desalambre/concertinas-valla-Hungria-refugiados-Spain_0_431507330.html\">deleted its official Twitter account</a> following the backlash provoked by a tweet boasting of ESF\u2019s leading role in the European razor wire industry.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/83cf9636445169459ca1f0e15bb0a8f7700c7b08/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alain Diabanza\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alain Diabanza, a former refugee from the Democratic Republic of the Congo who now teaches in Spain, at the razor-wire fence in Ceuta, Spain\u2019s north African territory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Juan Medina/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Today, ESF appears to have competition in the form of Polish company GC Metal, which now refers to itself as Europe\u2019s leading seller of razor wire. The company\u2019s website <a href=\"https://www.gcmetal.pl/en/securing-the-border/\">indicates</a> that it may have been involved in supplying concertina wire for the Bulgarian-Turkish border fence.

      "bodyText": "You could barely see that it was a finger. \u201cThe wound was large, with several deep cuts into the flesh. He had tried to climb the fence and was up there when he was caught by police in the middle of the night,\u201d says Andr\u00e1s L\u00e9derer, advocacy officer for the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a Budapest-based NGO. \u201cHe lost his balance. The wound was so horrific because as he fell, he tried to grab the razor wire \u2013 and also, he said, touched the second layer of the fence, which is electrified.\u201d The unnamed Pakistani refugee in his 30s had attempted to cross the fence near Sombor, Serbia, to get into Hungary in 2016. The coils of metal that lacerated his finger are ubiquitous at the perimeters of \u201cFortress Europe\u201d and can be found on border fences in Slovenia, Hungary, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Spain and France. Razor wire is cut from galvanised steel, and unlike barbed wire, which was devised to tangle and impede movement, it is designed to maim. It is one of the most visible symbols of the fortification of the EU\u2019s borders. Thousands of migrants have already paid with their lives while attempting to get around those borders: by crawling through pipes, suffocating in the back of lorries, or drowning in the Mediterranean. In September 2005, a Senegalese man reportedly bled to death from wounds inflicted by deadly razor wire coils topping the fence in Ceuta, one of Spain\u2019s two exclaves on the north African coast. Migrants from African countries regularly attempt to scale the six-metre high barriers separating these port cities from Morocco. They do so at great personal risk; after mass attempts to cross, Spanish medical staff regularly attend to deep cuts from razor wire, from which migrants\u2019 bloodstained clothes are sometimes left dangling. Like the rest of Spain, Ceuta and Melilla have been under lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic. But tighter Moroccan border controls linked to the pandemic have not stopped migrants and refugees from coming: 1,140 people succeeded in crossing the frontier into Ceuta and Melilla in the first three months of this year. The Spanish authorities started removing the razor wire from these fences last December as part of a review of border security. The wire was first installed in 2005, removed two years later and restored by the centre-right government of Mariano Rajoy in 2013. The socialist government led by Pedro Sanchez had a chance to make good on repeated promises of a more humanitarian migration policy after June 2018. And throughout 2018 and 2019, Spanish officials stated their determination to remove the razor wire and, in the words of the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, move beyond \u201cbloody methods\u201d of border control. Spain\u2019s humanitarian policy has become largely redundant, though, given that Moroccan authorities have started installing razor wire along their own border fence with Ceuta. And Grande-Marlaska announced recently that fences around the two Spanish exclaves would be raised by 30 metres to deter incomers. These apparent double standards are part of a pattern, says Karl Kopp, of the German NGO Pro Asyl. \u201cThe European style is to outsource this more vicious, older style of border control with its razor wire and multiple fences to third countries. At home, it\u2019s about drones, surveillance and technical cooperation to identify migrants approaching the EU border before they even reach it. Meanwhile, violent border policing is kept farther afield: out of sight, out of mind. So the Moroccans build an \u2018ugly\u2019 fence which can be criticised, while the Spanish create a more \u2018humanitarian\u2019 alternative,\u201d says Kopp. Public pressure elsewhere has led some governments to reconsider the use of razor wire as experts brand it both inhumane and ineffective. Others even wonder about the legality of its use. \u201cOn the one hand, legislation about borders states that crossing anywhere other than an official checkpoint is illegal. On the other hand, the notion of crossing a border illegally is usually voided under international refugee law if making an asylum claim,\u201d says Bernd Kasparek, a researcher at Border Monitoring, a German NGO that tracks pushbacks of refugees. \u201cSo there is a legal tension at the EU\u2019s borders. Sometimes it is very necessary to cross the border irregularly in order to lodge an asylum claim. Fortified borders like these interfere with that legal right, particularly in places where it\u2019s an open secret that 99% of asylum claims lodged with border guards are rejected,\u201d Kasparek adds. Recent successful attempts at removing razor wire from Europe\u2019s borders have not been motivated by legal or humanitarian concerns but by ecological ones. In Slovenia, environmentalists\u2019 fears of the impact of razor wire on wildlife led in 2016 to the removal of the coils from sections of its border with Croatia. In light of legal constraints in several European states on the deployment of razor wire in rural areas, some manufacturers even indicate the wildlife-friendly credentials of their razor wire. One difficulty in mounting a challenge is the near impossibility of establishing the true scale of the injuries inflicted specifically by razor wire at borders. According to Kate Dearden, project officer at the I nternational Organization for Migration\u2019s Missing Migrants Project, many governments only keep records on deaths at borders, rather than deaths that occur later as a result of injuries during attempts to cross them. Moreover, it can be hard to discover exactly which portions of Europe\u2019s fences are topped by razor wire and who supplied it; in recent years many governments have classified detailed information about fences as state security issues. Nevertheless, some manufacturers have refused to sell to border fences on humanitarian grounds. In 2015, Talat Deger, director of the Berlin-based company Mutanox, refused to do a deal with the Hungarian government. In an interview last year, Deger\u2019s successor, Efekan Dikici, said that he and his staff have kept to the principle. \u201cWe want to sell razor wire, of course, but only for the right purposes: to secure property, factories, jails, or for example on the railings of ships to prevent piracy. For those purposes it\u2019s justified; but when it\u2019s being used against humans who need help, that\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Dikici. \u201cMost of our workers have a foreign background themselves, so I think we all feel this a bit more.\u201d That stance is costly. Dikici stressed that it can be genuinely difficult for razor wire suppliers to establish the end use of their product, given that they often deal with middlemen and procurement agencies. \u201cIf you\u2019re selling to a government, razor wire could be used for a prison or a border. But if a request for a really huge amount comes in, we do wonder whether it\u2019s for a border fence. Even large private properties need a few hundred metres, not kilometres. I ask myself, if we got a request from the US for the Mexico border, would we give them a quote?\u201d Other companies do not appear to have these scruples \u2013 after all, there is a brisk trade to be done in razor wire, which is not to be confused with barbed wire. Razor wire is cut from single sheets of galvanised steel, and most commonly sold in folding coils known in the industry as concertinas. The sharp razors come in various sizes; most seen by the Guardian at four European border fences are of the BTO-22, BTO-20 and BTO-10 varieties \u2013 straight razor edges affixed to a metal coil. There are even more formidable options: CBT-60 includes \u201charpoon\u201d style hooked razor heads that can embed themselves in the flesh of those trying to cross them. Some razor wire manufacturers seemingly flaunt the effects in their brochures; for example, Chinese manufacturer Hebei Jinshi advertises its CBT-65 long blade as a \u201cvicious product\u201d whose \u201cextra long blade razors produce[s] [a] frightening effect.\u201d However, some European producers have discovered that selling razor wire to border fences comes at the cost of bad press, even in times of rising xenophobic sentiment. When Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, decreed in 2015 that a fence be raised on Hungary\u2019s border with Serbia, the Malaga-based manufacturer European Security Fencing (ESF) provided the razor wire. ESF, a subdivision of Mora Salazar, has delivered coils for fences in Austria, Slovenia, Bulgaria and France, and proudly presents itself as one of Europe\u2019s leading razor wire suppliers. Nevertheless, after the installation of its razor wire on the Hungarian border, ESF spokesmen told the Spanish press that they had been unaware of the product\u2019s final use by the Hungarian clients. In September 2015, the company deleted its official Twitter account following the backlash provoked by a tweet boasting of ESF\u2019s leading role in the European razor wire industry. Today, ESF appears to have competition in the form of Polish company GC Metal, which now refers to itself as Europe\u2019s leading seller of razor wire. The company\u2019s website indicates that it may have been involved in supplying concertina wire for the Bulgarian-Turkish border fence. Neither ESF nor GC Metal responded to requests for comment about the end use of their products or their humanitarian implications. Europe\u2019s fortified borders are here to stay, even if borders in decades to come may be unrecognisable in comparison to today\u2019s crude fences. Razor wire, much like fortified borders in general, is both inhumane and ineffective, concludes Kopp, though its removal may not necessarily be a bellwether for a more humanitarian migration policy.

      "body": "<p>If the Conservative party had known <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-election-full-results\">last year</a> that it was recruiting a leader to handle a pandemic, would it have chosen differently?</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt\u2019s credentials as a former health secretary might have counted more, but not much. Get in the Tardis and go back to a Tory hustings in 2019. Tell the audience about coronavirus and how managerial diligence is the quality needed most in a prime minister. The audience is unmoved. \u201cProject Fear,\u201d they groan. They only want to know if Boris Johnson delivers Brexit and wins a general election, which he does.</p> <p>Returning to May 2020, we find some Tory MPs grumbling about the government\u2019s coronavirus response. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/top-experts-not-asked-approve-stay-alert-coronavirus-message-whitty-vallance\">message is confusing</a>, the grip is weak. These are just ripples of dissent and Johnson will have to get a lot more wrong before his party is seriously disappointed. But ripples on the surface indicate deeper faultlines.</p> <p>The tension is between Conservatives who are impatient to get the country out of quarantine, citing the cost of mothballing the economy, and those who fear that relaxing lockdown gives the virus new momentum to kill.</p> <p>That is a difference of ideology and temperament. The lockdown sceptics are suspicious of anything that involves the state paying people\u2019s salaries or telling them how to behave. They don\u2019t like quarantine in much the same way that they don\u2019t like the Health and Safety Executive or the European Union. They see bailouts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/12/uk-furlough-scheme-extended-rishi-sunak-coronavirus\">furloughs as sleepwalking towards socialism</a>.</p> <p>Johnson does not want to upset MPs who hold that view, partly because his own instincts tilt that way. Also, picking fights with the Tory right is a hazardous business for party leaders. Buying their loyalty with wacky policy is the usual alternative. But Johnson has had Covid-19 and he knows it cannot be treated with an enterprising spirit alone. He also has counsel from scientists that the virus is too prevalent to allow much unregulated activity.</p> <p>Confusion around the government\u2019s nebulous new \u201cstay alert\u201d message earlier this week stemmed from a conflict between clinical facts and a political demand for new facts when existing ones don\u2019t suit a certain ideological prejudice. Hence the bizarre contortion of England \u2013 and only England \u2013 changing the rules, while keeping them mostly the same. Johnson wants to lean out of quarantine, but with his feet planted in the lockdown zone.</p> <p>Some Tories who wish their leader had taken a bolder leap blame his sobering sojourn in intensive care. There is a feeling that this cautious prime minister, creeping out of quarantine in deference to doctors, is not the maverick daredevil they hired last year. This is not the \u201cBoris\u201d brand spirit that was advertised so often in the Daily Telegraph. They whisper that he has lost his bottle.</p> <p>It is true that Johnson\u2019s manner is altered and that serious illness leaves psychological scars. But there is a simple political equation being studied in Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s reputation in the early stages of the crisis was protected by fair-minded public recognition that the disease was to blame for killing people, not the politicians trying to stop the disease. That could change in a second spike where infections can be linked back to premature easing of quarantine restrictions.</p> <p>Keir Starmer\u2019s offer of constructive opposition is calibrated to match public aversion to gratuitous point-scoring in a crisis. The hostility can easily be dialled up if the national mood sours.</p> <p>Senior Tories say that Johnson is warily respectful of Starmer, noting the sure-footed start he has made, but much more troubled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/nicola-sturgeon-leads-criticism-of-uks-new-stay-alert-coronavirus-lockdown-advice\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>. The Scottish first minister has institutional powers to undermine the authority of a Tory prime minister whose charisma loses its magnetism north of Berwick.</p> <p>Most Westminster eyes are focused on day-to-day politics, but Tory strategists have not forgotten next year\u2019s Scottish parliamentary election and the wrecking ball of another independence referendum that still hovers over Downing Street.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Anything that can be cast as arrogance and complacency is toxic for Johnson, especially when it has a class component. It does not look good when the rules are amended in a lopsided way so that retired bankers can get to the golf course, while low-paid workers must travel back to precarious jobs through the Covid-19 miasma.</p> <p>Opposition MPs are alert to that asymmetry but so too are Tories in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall\">\u201cred wall\u201d constituencies</a> in the Midlands, northern England and Wales \u2013 Labour bastions until last December.</p> <p>Johnson would not be in power without those seats and he won them by overcoming deep-rooted anti-Tory culture. Labour\u2019s hold had been weakening for a generation, but it was broken by the combination of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s unique salesmanship, seducing parts of the electorate that would not otherwise consider endorsing a Conservative candidate.</p> <p>He managed it in two London mayoral elections and, while the formula that swayed the liberal metropolis in the 2000s is different to the one that worked in Brexitland, the magic ingredient \u2013 the \u201cBoris\u201d touch \u2013 is the same. It is notable how quickly the effect wore off in London once Johnson was no longer the candidate. </p> <p>Those Boris party voters are not Tories in any traditional sense. Euroscepticism aside, they do not have much in common with the small-state, market-obsessed, Thatcherite cultists who seem now to define English liberty as the inalienable right to catch and spread a deadly disease. That is a niche position when most of the country just wants rules that make sense and a government that provides a sturdy financial safety net.</p> <p>The prime minister has tied himself in a knot trying with one hand to take dictation from science, while with the other hand feeding an insatiable ideological beast that won\u2019t digest evidence. The contradiction is intrinsic to the whole project. Johnson\u2019s appeal to the Tory party last year was that he could be liked by people who hate Tories. That solved one problem by creating another one: keeping the support of people who had never voted Conservative before in their lives might involve doing things in government that lifelong Conservatives would never do.</p> <p>That tension was buried by the election result and Brexit, but the pandemic is bringing it to the surface. Dealing with coronavirus is an expensive, intrusive, big-state business. Not much about the actions required to contain a pandemic and support the economy through national convalescence matches the \u201cBoris\u201d brand that Conservative MPs thought they were getting last year. Their frustration will grow. He will try to satisfy them without doing exactly what they want, which is a proven formula for party division, dysfunctional government and failure at every stage of the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "If the Conservative party had known last year that it was recruiting a leader to handle a pandemic, would it have chosen differently? Jeremy Hunt\u2019s credentials as a former health secretary might have counted more, but not much. Get in the Tardis and go back to a Tory hustings in 2019. Tell the audience about coronavirus and how managerial diligence is the quality needed most in a prime minister. The audience is unmoved. \u201cProject Fear,\u201d they groan. They only want to know if Boris Johnson delivers Brexit and wins a general election, which he does. Returning to May 2020, we find some Tory MPs grumbling about the government\u2019s coronavirus response. The message is confusing, the grip is weak. These are just ripples of dissent and Johnson will have to get a lot more wrong before his party is seriously disappointed. But ripples on the surface indicate deeper faultlines. The tension is between Conservatives who are impatient to get the country out of quarantine, citing the cost of mothballing the economy, and those who fear that relaxing lockdown gives the virus new momentum to kill. That is a difference of ideology and temperament. The lockdown sceptics are suspicious of anything that involves the state paying people\u2019s salaries or telling them how to behave. They don\u2019t like quarantine in much the same way that they don\u2019t like the Health and Safety Executive or the European Union. They see bailouts and furloughs as sleepwalking towards socialism. Johnson does not want to upset MPs who hold that view, partly because his own instincts tilt that way. Also, picking fights with the Tory right is a hazardous business for party leaders. Buying their loyalty with wacky policy is the usual alternative. But Johnson has had Covid-19 and he knows it cannot be treated with an enterprising spirit alone. He also has counsel from scientists that the virus is too prevalent to allow much unregulated activity. Confusion around the government\u2019s nebulous new \u201cstay alert\u201d message earlier this week stemmed from a conflict between clinical facts and a political demand for new facts when existing ones don\u2019t suit a certain ideological prejudice. Hence the bizarre contortion of England \u2013 and only England \u2013 changing the rules, while keeping them mostly the same. Johnson wants to lean out of quarantine, but with his feet planted in the lockdown zone. Some Tories who wish their leader had taken a bolder leap blame his sobering sojourn in intensive care. There is a feeling that this cautious prime minister, creeping out of quarantine in deference to doctors, is not the maverick daredevil they hired last year. This is not the \u201cBoris\u201d brand spirit that was advertised so often in the Daily Telegraph. They whisper that he has lost his bottle. It is true that Johnson\u2019s manner is altered and that serious illness leaves psychological scars. But there is a simple political equation being studied in Downing Street. Johnson\u2019s reputation in the early stages of the crisis was protected by fair-minded public recognition that the disease was to blame for killing people, not the politicians trying to stop the disease. That could change in a second spike where infections can be linked back to premature easing of quarantine restrictions. Keir Starmer\u2019s offer of constructive opposition is calibrated to match public aversion to gratuitous point-scoring in a crisis. The hostility can easily be dialled up if the national mood sours. Senior Tories say that Johnson is warily respectful of Starmer, noting the sure-footed start he has made, but much more troubled by Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish first minister has institutional powers to undermine the authority of a Tory prime minister whose charisma loses its magnetism north of Berwick. Most Westminster eyes are focused on day-to-day politics, but Tory strategists have not forgotten next year\u2019s Scottish parliamentary election and the wrecking ball of another independence referendum that still hovers over Downing Street. Anything that can be cast as arrogance and complacency is toxic for Johnson, especially when it has a class component. It does not look good when the rules are amended in a lopsided way so that retired bankers can get to the golf course, while low-paid workers must travel back to precarious jobs through the Covid-19 miasma. Opposition MPs are alert to that asymmetry but so too are Tories in \u201cred wall\u201d constituencies in the Midlands, northern England and Wales \u2013 Labour bastions until last December. Johnson would not be in power without those seats and he won them by overcoming deep-rooted anti-Tory culture. Labour\u2019s hold had been weakening for a generation, but it was broken by the combination of Brexit and Johnson\u2019s unique salesmanship, seducing parts of the electorate that would not otherwise consider endorsing a Conservative candidate. He managed it in two London mayoral elections and, while the formula that swayed the liberal metropolis in the 2000s is different to the one that worked in Brexitland, the magic ingredient \u2013 the \u201cBoris\u201d touch \u2013 is the same. It is notable how quickly the effect wore off in London once Johnson was no longer the candidate. Those Boris party voters are not Tories in any traditional sense. Euroscepticism aside, they do not have much in common with the small-state, market-obsessed, Thatcherite cultists who seem now to define English liberty as the inalienable right to catch and spread a deadly disease. That is a niche position when most of the country just wants rules that make sense and a government that provides a sturdy financial safety net. The prime minister has tied himself in a knot trying with one hand to take dictation from science, while with the other hand feeding an insatiable ideological beast that won\u2019t digest evidence. The contradiction is intrinsic to the whole project. Johnson\u2019s appeal to the Tory party last year was that he could be liked by people who hate Tories. That solved one problem by creating another one: keeping the support of people who had never voted Conservative before in their lives might involve doing things in government that lifelong Conservatives would never do. That tension was buried by the election result and Brexit, but the pandemic is bringing it to the surface. Dealing with coronavirus is an expensive, intrusive, big-state business. Not much about the actions required to contain a pandemic and support the economy through national convalescence matches the \u201cBoris\u201d brand that Conservative MPs thought they were getting last year. Their frustration will grow. He will try to satisfy them without doing exactly what they want, which is a proven formula for party division, dysfunctional government and failure at every stage of the Covid-19 crisis. \u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The dramatic improvements in air quality associated with the coronavirus lockdown could increase sunlight and affect weather patterns, scientists say. With factories closed and roads relatively empty, air pollution in cities across Asia, Europe and the US has dropped by as much as 60% in recent weeks. The lack of haze has made skies bluer and some people in northern India have been able to see the Himalayas for the first time in 30 years. It also means that with fewer particles and polluting gases to hinder its path, more sunlight is able to reach the Earth\u2019s surface. Earlier this year, scientists confirmed that cleaner skies in recent decades have caused a brightening of the Earth\u2019s surface. Satellite measurements show that Europe experienced a surface dimming effect until the late 1980s, followed by a brightening effect as air pollution regulations kicked in. China followed a similar pattern, but had to wait until 2005 for brightening to set in. The cleaner skies resulting from lockdown are likely to have enhanced the brightening effect even further, but measuring the impact on climate is not straightforward. \u201cAerosols can scatter and absorb radiation. They can also modify clouds to make them more reflective and longer lived,\u201d explains Laura Wilcox, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. Unlike carbon dioxide, aerosols only hang around in the atmosphere for a week or two, meaning that any reduction in pollution will be quickly felt. \u201cWith smaller amounts of aerosol in the atmosphere we will already be seeing more solar radiation reaching the surface, and thus potentially warmer surface temperatures in regions that usually have high levels of air pollution,\u201d says Wilcox. But detecting the effect of falling air pollution and disentangling it from the random ups and downs in the weather will be extremely challenging. \u201cHere in the UK we\u2019ve had record amounts of sunshine because of the blocking high pressure system that has sat over the country through April,\u201d says Richard Allan, another atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading. \u201cThese unusual weather conditions are likely to obscure any increase in temperature resulting from the clearer skies.\u201d However, measurements over a larger area and longer time scale might demonstrate a Covid climate effect. Using computer simulations, Wilcox and her colleagues had previously shown that rapid cuts in air pollution were likely to accelerate climate change in the future. In the most extreme scenarios (with rapid increases in air quality) their results suggest the hottest day of the year may be up to 4C hotter by 2050, with around one third of that increase due to cleaner skies. Wilcox\u2019s latest research also predicts that reductions in Asian air pollution will also result in more intense tropical monsoon rains, driven by a greater contrast in temperature between oceans and land. If the drop in air pollution is sustained for long enough then it might be possible to see its impact on climate. \u201cI will be watching India closely over the coming weeks.

Instead, the drop in air pollution over northern India may help to drive a more intense monsoon, and Wilcox and her colleagues are on standby, ready to gather measurements and compare with previous years. But even if cleaner skies are temporarily accelerating climate change, the long-term dangers associated with global warming are far greater. \u201cContinuing to emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere at the current rate will drive far larger and more sustained temperature rises that along with changes in the global water cycle will cause serious impacts for our societies and the ecosystems upon which we depend,\u201d says Allan.",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government has stared down calls in its own ranks to cut the $130bn jobkeeper payment off before its full six-month duration, and delayed a Labor and Greens push to expand the program. On Wednesday the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said that business \u201ccertainty\u201d meant the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy will be delivered until September, although it could be adjusted after a review in June. Employers joined unions in warning against plans to modify the payment, after Labor called to trim the subsidy for those who normally earn less than $1,500 in return for expanded eligibility. A Labor and Greens disallowance motion attempting to allow more universities to access the program and a Labor motion to expand eligibility to entities owned by foreign governments \u2013 both due for debate on Wednesday evening \u2013 were delayed. Centre Alliance and senator Jacqui Lambie will support both motions, but One Nation are the critical votes to expanding the wage subsidy program. The Transport Workers Union has been lobbying for the foreign government ownership change, citing 5,500 workers at airline catering company Dnata who missed out on jobkeeper because it is owned by the Emirates Group. The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia his party supported the plan because \u201cthe jobkeeper money is directed at Australian workers \u2013 not the companies\u201d. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly has also backed the change, suggesting in the Coalition party room on Tuesday that withdrawing jobkeeper from businesses that recover sooner would help expand its eligibility for sectors that suffer longer. But on Wednesday Cormann ruled out ending the six-month jobkeeper program after a review in June, explaining the government wanted to give business \u201ccertainty\u201d they can retain their employees until September. \u201cWe did make a commitment for a six-month period,\u201d he told Radio National. \u201cWhen we set this program up \u2026 we didn\u2019t know how long this coronavirus crisis was going to last and to what extent.\u201d Cormann said Australia was \u201cwinning the fight against the virus\u201d so the government was hopeful the economy would recover sooner. \u201cThis is a six-month program and while there might be some adjustments to make sure it works as intended after a review halfway through, as we always flagged, this remains a six-month program.\u201d Cormann rebuffed Labor\u2019s calls to consider trimming the $1,500 fortnightly payment for workers who usually earn less, explaining it was not a \u201cloophole\u201d but an \u201cunavoidable feature of the scheme\u201d. Nevertheless, he said it would be reviewed in June. Employers are wary that scrapping the flat rate of $1,500 per worker a fortnight may restore the incentive for employees to return to work but lose the simplicity of its design, requiring the tax office to count workers\u2019 hours. Cormann ruled out making jobkeeper payments to employees of foreign government-owned businesses and denied making rule changes to disadvantage the university sector. The Australian Industry Group chief executive, Innes Willox, warned that employers would not cop \u201cany change in the minimum period over which the jobkeeper scheme will be paid or a phasing down in the amount of the payment\u201d. \u201cChanges of this sort would dramatically undermine business plans that have already been put in place,\u201d he said. Willox said jobkeeper was \u201cplaying a valuable role in supporting employment and our economy at the moment but there are ways it could be made more efficient and fairer\u201d. \u201cEmployer eligibility should be extended so that businesses in larger groups face the same (30%) test as other businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cConsideration should also be given by the government to extend the period of the scheme should conditions warrant it.\u201d The Senate is also due to consider a Labor-Greens-Lambie-backed disallowance motion to restore the one-week consultation period to change workplace pay deals, which was slashed to one day by the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter. Pauline Hanson has proposed that emergency cuts in pay and conditions made under shortened consultation should last for 12 months, but Labor believes a medicinal cannabis industry bill rushed through the lower house on Wednesday was related to courting One Nations\u2019 two votes on the issue. Senator Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia there was \u201csome merit\u201d in Hanson\u2019s proposal to limit the time cuts can have effect. He said Centre Alliance agreed with Labor and the Greens that 24 hours \u201cis not enough\u201d but the party is \u201csupportive of something closer to the three day mark\u201d.",

inquiry was first proposed in March just days after 10,000 victims of the Morrison government\u2019s cruel robodebt scheme signed up to a class action to defend their legal rights.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to government claims, research by commercial law firm Allens found the total number of class action filings was actually down 20% in 2019. </p> \n   <p>Shareholder actions were actually down 63% and so far this year there are just three new shareholder cases \u2013 none of which relate to Covid-19 matters.</p> \n   <p>Significantly, the biggest cause of new cases in 2019 came from

question time, <strong>Tony Burke </strong>had a \u2018personal explanation\u2019 to make and spills some tea about the weekly meetings the opposition leadership has been having with the government leadership (which was the compromise offered after Anthony Albanese was denied a seat on the national cabinet, and the parliament wasn\u2019t sitting). After this, I am not sure if those weekly catch-ups will be ongoing.</p> \n  <p>Asked if he had claimed to have been misrepresented (the standard reason for a personal explanation), Burke says he does:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Yesterday during debate on an amendment I had moved, which would have demanded the government produce the new sitting calendar, the leader of the House (Christian Porter) said statements I had personally made were inaccurate, by claiming that in private meetings, which I had personally attended, the government had, and I quote the leader of the House, \u2018clearly explained there will be additional sitting weeks\u2019, end quote.</p> \n   <p>This statement is false.</p> \n   <p>While I would normally not disclose the conduct of private meetings, given the leader of the House has made this false statement about me to the House, I wish to confirm the following four points.</p> \n   <p>One, in the meeting with the leadership of the government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might.</p> \n   <p>Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings.</p> \n   <p>Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd. </p> \n   <p>Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

And so any suggestion that Australia\u2019s agricultural exports are the subject of government subsidisation is rejected. </p> \n   <p>And these are the points that we make directly as part of a comprehensive and strategic partnership that was concluded many years ago and we are continuing to use the channels of that relationship and that partnership to be able to progress those matters as well as directly with the relevant authorities in China regarding their anti-dumping review in relation to barley. </p> \n   <p>Similarly, relations in matter to abattoirs are important to progress. They relate to what is claimed to be paperwork and administration issues in relation to Australian meat exports and we will continue to advocate and set out the Australian case clearly.</p> \n   <p>Let me be clear about one thing. Australia stands firmly behind our agricultural producers and we stand firmly about where we see the role of the Australian economy in the broader world. We have great confidence in our outlook as a trading nation and we engage with all partners in good faith with the purpose of ensuring the increasing global trade.</p> \n   <p>That is the basis for our relationship the Chinese government when it comes to a comprehensive strategic partnership.

In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. </p> \n   <p>In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. </p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. </p> \n   <p>What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity. </p> \n   <p>So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them. </p> \n   <p>What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\"

<p>The Greens are getting louder in the calls to have parliament return as usual ahead of August. It was adjourned until August at the last emergency sitting, but given that the government is attempting to reopen the economy, it kinda has to reopen parliament too. So that\u2019s why we are here in this sitting, which <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> called a \u201ctrial\u201d, but is actually just parliament (trials are not a thing with parliament. It either sits or it doesn\u2019t and the parliament decides how it makes that happen.) </p> \n  <p>Yesterday <strong>Christian Porter</strong> said a revised sitting calendar was being worked on to bring back parliament ahead of the August scheduled sitting, but there has been no word on when that will be made public. </p> \n  <p><strong>Larissa Waters</strong> says parliament needs to be recalled after this sitting as soon as possible. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Covid crisis response and the plan for recovery demand more transparency in government decision-making. The Senate Covid committee plays a critical role, but is no substitute for full parliamentary oversight. </p> \n   <p>We need more democracy during this time, not less. We need to ensure that Australia\u2019s recovery is fair, effective, and guided by expert advice. We need parliament to return.</p> \n   <p>The Greens are calling for both houses to sit in June to fix gaps in the jobkeeper scheme, introduce rights to pandemic leave, consider banking royal commission legislation, and debate the merits of the government\u2019s proposed gas-led recovery.</p> \n   <p>We must ensure we don\u2019t come out the other side having brought this coronovirus under control but finding ourselves with our democracy eroded and hard-fought for rights lost.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T03:20:19.969Z\">at 4.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb65768f08a55ecde58def\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T03:12:25.829Z\">4.12am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Community and Public Sector Union \u2013 which represents non-academic staff at unis \u2013 is pretty annoyed about a deal between the NTEU and management allowing pay cuts.</p> \n  <p><strong>Troy Wright</strong>, the CPSU NSW assistant general secretary, said the deal was \u201ccooked up behind closed doors between academics and universities\u201d and will cut pay, particularly for the lowest paid staff. </p> \n  <p>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>A 15% wage cut may only be a haircut for high-paid academics, but for the professional staff of universities it is a life-altering cut to their pay packet.</em></p> \n   <p><em>There are a range of smarter cost saving measures universities could take before an indiscriminate slash to wages.

However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months.</p> \n   <p><strong>If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase.<br></strong></p> \n   <p><strong>Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia.</strong><br></p> \n   <p><strong>Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade.</strong><br></p> \n   <p>In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services.<br></p> \n   <p>There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture. Given its economic ties with Asian countries are closer than those it has with western nations, it may be more in its interests to focus on how to further integrate into the Asian industrial chain.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T23:11:33.123Z\">at 12.11am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb25548f080c7274539c12\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-12T22:44:58.866Z\">11.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Amid all this, the Eden-Monaro byelection is still to be scheduled.</p> \n  <p>Labor isn\u2019t messing around \u2013 <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> will be out there this morning, with the party\u2019s candidate, <strong>Kristy McBain</strong>, and <strong>Catherine King</strong> for a doorstop at Murrumbateman.</p> \n  <p>But then Labor can do that \u2013 it has a candidate.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019ll be closing the blog tonight. Thanks for reading and stay safe. We will be back covering all the developments tomorrow. Here is what happened today: Some NSW pubs with restaurants and sit-down dining tables will be allowed to reopen on Friday. Only 10 people will be allowed in the premises, and tables will still have be 1.5 metres apart. The Queensland government announced it will bid for Virgin Australia, and that could include a \u201cdirect equity stake\u201d in the airline. Worksafe in Victoria will investigate the coronavirus cluster at the Cedar Meats abattoir. The govenment\u2019s Covid-19 coordination adviser, former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power, is being paid $267,345 for six months\u2019 work. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet had to correct its own evidence, after it told a senate inquiry Power was being paid $500,000. The money is an allowance for travel costs, not a salary. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has fined an Australian chapter of the Genesis II Church of Health and Healing more than $150,000 for selling and promoting a solution containing industrial bleach as an alleged cure for coronavirus. Coronavirus tests brought to Australia by the mining billionaire Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest at a cost of $200m to the Australian taxpayer are not being used by most state and territory governments and have instead been sent to the national medical stockpile. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg tested negative for Covid-19 after a scare prompted by a coughing fit. The federal government appointed its first deputy chief medical officer for mental health, Assoc Prof Ruth Vine. Australia\u2019s Covid-19 toll rose to 98 after an 81-year-old woman, who was a passenger on the Ruby Princess, died in NSW overnight. Australia recorded 13 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday \u2013 seven in Victoria and six in NSW. Pubs with restaurants and sit-down dining tables will be allowed to reopen on Friday, as part of the NSW government\u2019s already announced easing of restrictions. Cafes and restaurants were already slated to reopen \u2013 and the NSW treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, has clarified this includes the dining portions of some pubs. But only 10 people will be allowed in the premises at one time. And tables will still have be 1.5m apart. The rules are still unclear, and are a matter for the public health order, but a spokesperson for the Treasury told Guardian Australia that pubs would, most likely, not need an entirely separate restaurant section to be able to open. Pubs in which they served food at sit-down tables near a bar area would likely be allowed to open and operate as a restaurant, the spokesperson said. Alcohol could be served with a meal, but the bar itself would still be closed. And from earlier, here is Paul Karp\u2019s full story on Scott Morrison\u2019s explanation today on the sports rorts saga. From our reporter Matilda Boseley, Worksafe in Victoria will investigate the coronavirus cluster at the Cedar Meats abattoir. And on the news of Queensland\u2019s bid for Virgin Australia, home affairs minister Peter Dutton has said the pitch is \u201claughable\u201d. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has called Labor\u2019s shadow immigration minister, Kristina Keneally, a \u201ccloset One Nation supporter\u201d after her recent comments and opinion article in the Sydney Morning Herald about reducing immigration. In a speech in the Senate 30 minutes ago, Hanson said Keneally had proven that One Nation\u2019s arguments were \u201cso powerful\u201d that \u201ceven a staunch opponent\u201d would adopt them. Hanson said: Reading through some of the recent comments made by senator Keneally, I can only assume she has spent much of her time in quarantine reading through my speeches from 1996. Perhaps senator Keneally might want to make an admission today that she is a closet One Nation supporter ... I know it took Mark Latham a couple of decades to come out of the One Nation closet. I want to say thank you ... because I know she will not be getting much support from her Labor colleagues. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi tweeted that Labor had \u201cnormalised\u201d anti-migrant politics. The full statement on the remuneration of Nev Power, the Covid-19 coordination adviser, is now in. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has clarified that his true contract is worth $267,345 \u2013 almost half what the department told the Senate earlier today. Earlier, Stephanie Foster, an associate secretary of the department, said Power had a six-month contract with \u201caround $500,000\u201d in allowances (not salary). But in a fuller statement, the department said: Mr Power\u2019s flights, accommodation and other incidental travel costs are being covered in his role as NCCC chair \u2013 however he is not receiving a salary. The PM&amp;C estimated travel to and from Canberra valued at approximately $6,000 per return trip each week, $350 per night for accommodation and incidentals such as food and taxis, and additional extra expenses set to be incurred from other travel once internal border restrictions ease. It is expected that Mr Power will perform his duties as chair of the NCCC for a period of approximately six months. This equates to $267,345 (plus GST). Earlier today, officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet told the Senate committee examining the government\u2019s Covid-19 response that the chair of the coordination commission, the former Fortescue Metals chief, Nev Power, was being paid $500,000 for his advisory role, which was expected to run for six months. The prime minister\u2019s office has told me that figure is wrong, and the department will be issuing a statement clarifying the evidence. We\u2019ll bring you an update when we have it. In his statement, Cameron Dick also said that two airlines were \u201ccritical to Australia\u2019s economy\u201d. The Queensland treasurer said: We have the opportunity to retain not only head office and crew staff in Queensland, but also to grow jobs in the repairs, maintenance and overhaul sector and support both direct and indirect jobs in our tourism sector. We saw the punishing increase to the cost of flights after the Ansett collapse, and this government will not stand by and let that happen again. Queensland Investment Corporation, led by CEO Damien Frawley, will advise government on all aspects of the bid, including the optimal partner group, the quantum and structure of the state\u2019s contribution, as well as probity and governance. The Queensland state government will bid for Virgin Australia, the new treasurer, Cameron Dick, has announced. In a statement, the treasurer said he has appointed Queensland Investment Corporation, a government-owned investment company, to pursue a bid that could include a \u201cdirect equity stake\u201d in the airline. \u201cThe government\u2019s investment could take the form of a direct equity stake, a loan, guarantee or other financial incentives,\u201d Dick said. The Senate has voted down a motion to make the new jobseeker rate permanent. The unemployment benefit, which was formerly called Newstart, was at $40 a day until it was doubled at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The motion from the Greens senator Rachel Siewert called for the increase, to about $1,115 a fortnight, to be made permanent. The rate has not been raised above inflation since 1994. Siewert said: I can\u2019t see how anybody can think that it is OK to return the jobseeker payment to the old rate of $40 a day. We can and should choose to support people who are not in work, particularly when we know very well that we are in an economic downturn and it will be difficult for many people to find work. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here. Thanks to Amy Remeikis and Matilda Boseley for their incredible dual coronavirus and parliament blogging. In some breaking news from media correspondent Amanda Meade, the head of Australia\u2019s peak body for travel agents has resigned after he said the A Current Affair host Tracy Grimshaw should be \u201cgiven a firm uppercut or a slap across the face\u201d. Jayson Westbury made the comments in an industry webinar in which he criticised the show\u2019s coverage of the travel industry. On that note, I am going to hand you over to Naaman Zhou. Your Canberra Guardian crew will be back with you from early tomorrow morning. As will whatever is left of me. Take care of you. That feeling when it is the day after your birthday: Triggered. Still not using his elbow. That feeling when no one wishes you a happy birthday: The president of the Australian Law Council, Pauline Wright, says the organisation has concerns about Peter Dutton\u2019s latest security bill: The proposal to reduce the age of minors who may be subject to questioning from 16 to 14 years and the conferral of powers on police to apprehend and detain persons for the purpose of bringing them in for compulsory questioning also requires detailed scrutiny by the Law Council, amongst the many other amendments. The Law Council is concerned that the government is now rushing the Bill, despite having had over two years to develop the re-designed questioning legislation since the PJCIS tabled its report in May 2018. Now there is a sense of urgency given that ASIO\u2019s current questioning powers are due to sunset in 7 September, and the amendments are set to commence by or before that date. This is not a Bill to be hurried through. The Law Council will need to carefully scrutinise the Bill and we look forward to providing a comprehensive submission to the inquiry. In a Sky News interview broadcast just now, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has stuck to the government\u2019s lines about taking a constructive and considered approach to the China relationship, while backbenchers speaking out are simply exercising free speech. Interestingly, Payne said she had \u201cnever had a problem\u201d trying to connect with her counterpart. The signs are that the trade minister, Simon Bimingham, hasn\u2019t had such luck, at least at this early stage. Birmingham said during Senate question time today he was yet to secure a conversation with his Chinese counterpart, but hoped this could be arranged soon. On the barley and red meat issues, Birminham told the Senate that China had made clear publicly and privately that these were \u201ctechnical matters\u201d. So Christian Porter is talking on why the inquiry is necessary and Mark Dreyfus will respond on why it\u2019s terrible and then we will go to a vote, which Labor will lose. There is a division in the house as Labor tries to stop Christian Porter setting up an inquiry into class actions and litigation funding. Here is Mark Dreyfus on why Labor doesn\u2019t want the inquiry: Litigation funding and class actions provide a vital path to justice for ordinary Australians trying to uphold their rights against wealthy defendants with vastly greater resources. Just last November the federal court ruled in favour of the three lead applicants in a class action of more than 1,350 women who sued Johnson &amp; Johnson and two subsidiaries for negligence in relation to pelvic mesh implants. It\u2019s no coincidence this inquiry was first proposed in March just days after 10,000 victims of the Morrison government\u2019s cruel robodebt scheme signed up to a class action to defend their legal rights. Contrary to government claims, research by commercial law firm Allens found the total number of class action filings was actually down 20% in 2019. Shareholder actions were actually down 63% and so far this year there are just three new shareholder cases \u2013 none of which relate to Covid-19 matters. Significantly, the biggest cause of new cases in 2019 came from consumer actions arising from the banking royal commission that the government voted 26 times to prevent. Daniel Hurst is watching Marise Payne talk with Kieran Gilbert over on Sky on this same issue, so we\u2019ll bring you that when the interview finishes airing. Patricia Karvelas asks Simon Birmingham how he can say the relationship between China and Australia hasn\u2019t soured, given China\u2019s reaction: I\u2019ve simply highlighted what the Chinese government has said publicly and privately in relation to these matters \u2013 they are technical issues in relation to trade practices and processes, that they relate to matters that have been ongoing or under investigation for periods relating to 12 to 18 months. They have said that. We have to respond as best as we can in good faith in putting forward the arguments that address those technical issues. If we\u2019re being told they are the reasons why these permits have been cancelled, or in relation to the barley dispute, here is the process it is being assessed under, well, the first port of response rightly for the Australian government is to engage in good faith, comprehensively, using evidence to refute any of the arguments put within those processes. The NRL player Nathan Cleary has been fined $1,000 by New South Wales police for breaking social distancing rules following the TikTok drama that has earned him a two-game ban and $30,000 fine for misleading the league\u2019s integrity unit. He is asked whether there is any timing on that chat. Simon Birmingham: Well, look, the ball is very much in their court of the Chinese government. We have made very clear that I am available and keen to have a discussion where we can discuss and canvas some of these trade-related matters. There are other global issues in relation to WTO operation and the like that no doubt we will canvas as well during the conversation, but this is not the sole pathway for the Australian government to make representations to the Chinese government. That is why we have a very active embassy in Beijing, with strong connections and engagement into other avenues and parts of the Chinese government, and of course it\u2019s why we support industry in their direct engagement in response to the particular technical requests of what China has raised with us. Simon Birmingham is on the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing. Patricia Karvelas asks if he has heard back from his Chinese counterpart yet, about when is a good time to have a phone chat about the latest \u2018issues\u2019 that have flared up over trade: We don\u2019t have one scheduled as yet. I hope China will be willing to engage in those discussions, but they\u2019re not the only pathway we are pursuing to try to resolve these issues in relation to the beef sector and the barley industry and we\u2019ll make sure we pursue every avenue available to us, starting very much with using the technical administrative pathways that are available because of the nature of the type of issues that China has initiated investigations or actions around. Alternatively, before and after iso: Rewatching the end of question time, Tony Burke had a \u2018personal explanation\u2019 to make and spills some tea about the weekly meetings the opposition leadership has been having with the government leadership (which was the compromise offered after Anthony Albanese was denied a seat on the national cabinet, and the parliament wasn\u2019t sitting). After this, I am not sure if those weekly catch-ups will be ongoing. Asked if he had claimed to have been misrepresented (the standard reason for a personal explanation), Burke says he does: Yesterday during debate on an amendment I had moved, which would have demanded the government produce the new sitting calendar, the leader of the House (Christian Porter) said statements I had personally made were inaccurate, by claiming that in private meetings, which I had personally attended, the government had, and I quote the leader of the House, \u2018clearly explained there will be additional sitting weeks\u2019, end quote. This statement is false. While I would normally not disclose the conduct of private meetings, given the leader of the House has made this false statement about me to the House, I wish to confirm the following four points. One, in the meeting with the leadership of the government, on 7 May 2020, the government did not state that it would provide additional sitting weeks, but merely that it might. Two, this was to be based on an assessment, that was to be taken, and I quote, \u2018a couple of days\u2019, end quote, after parliament had risen, based on whether there had been an outbreak of Covid-19 as a result of these sittings. Three, given the virus has an incubation period of weeks not days, this position was always absurd. Four, the minister\u2019s misrepresentation of these statements also presumes the government has been forthcoming with accurate information at these meetings, which is challenged by the fact that on issues as straightforward as whether there would be changes to jobkeeper, the government has provided information at these meetings which was proven to be false the very next day. Kristina Keneally has given Labor\u2019s first response to Peter Dutton\u2019s latest bill: Labor is committed to the safety and security of all Australians and will always take the advice of our national security agencies. The powers in this legislation are ongoing matters which have been extensively considered since they were first created by John Howard. We would expect the legislation introduced today \u2013 including any new measures \u2013 to be considered by the Parliamentary Committee on Intelligence and Security, as is normal practice. When the Government asks Australians to trust them \u2013 just like they have with the response to Covid-19 \u2013 it\u2019s only reasonable for their actions to be properly scrutinised. While question time was happening, you may have missed these stories: The NRL player Nathan Cleary could yet be fined by New South Wales police for breaching social distancing guidelines, despite having initially avoided any police sanctions, AAP reports. The Penrith Panthers star is to be interviewed again today after it was alleged he left his home during the day in question in contravention of the Covid-19 measures. \u201cWe are looking at it,\u201d detective inspector Jason Pietruszka told AAP. \u201cWe\u2019re reviewing his original information and we\u2019ll be speaking with him later on today. And if that information is found to be false, then he\u2019ll be issued with a ticket as per the health order. We\u2019ll treat it for what it is and he\u2019ll be given a ticket.\u201d Cleary was originally cleared by police of breaking coronavirus restrictions when he was photographed with friends at his house. Five women received $1,000 police fines for flouting government protocols. However, after video emerged of Cleary in TikTok videos with the same group, the NRL handed him a two-game ban and $30,000 fine for being \u201cuntruthful\u201d in dealings with the integrity unit. Cleary originally received a $10,000 fine, 60% suspended, as well as a suspended one-match ban after initial league investigations. As I typed that, I had to reload the page three times in order for it to post. For some reason, every single MP who asks a dixer is getting a herogram lately, about just how crucial a cog they are to Australia\u2019s democracy. Bert van Manen gets his for his \u201clongstanding interest\u201d in the NBN. I also have a longstanding interest in the NBN. In that I would like it to work. After the second question on failures within the Covid childcare package, Dan Tehan admits there is a need for \u201crefinements\u201d (which is just a word for fixes): What we have put in place was a significant, significant package, to enable the sector to get through the pandemic, and it included free childcare. It had three priority areas that we wanted to achieve through this, including making sure parents stayed engaged with their childcare centre, so when we came out of this pandemic they would be able to go back to that centre as they went back into employment. When we announced this, we said we would have a four-week review process. And that four-week review process has taken place. We are now looking at that review and we will have further refinements to make. As you know, when you make a significant change like we did, we paused the existing system, and in the space of days, put in place a new system. And we knew, at that time, there would be certain unintended consequences that we would have to work through, and that\u2019s why we put a four-week review process into play. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, has asked about evidence from the audit office that on 26 March 2019 \u201cthe prime minister\u2019s office had advised the minister\u2019s office that it was expected that the minister would write to the prime minister to seek \u2018authority\u2019 on the approved projects and inform the prime minister of the \u2018roll out plan\u2019\u201d. In response, Scott Morrison doubled down on his statement to parliament that \u201cno authorisation\u201d was provided by him and Bridget McKenzie was the decision-maker on sports grants. \u201cThe only authority sought was in relation to announcements,\u201d he said. So Morrison has produced a distinction between authority to give sports grants to recipient clubs and authority to announce the decisions. That is not a distinction made by the Australian National Audit Office in its evidence \u2013 which was that the PMO asked McKenzie to seek \u201c\u2019authority\u2019 on the approved projects\u201d, not authority on the announcements. Let\u2019s also remember that McKenzie said she signed the final brief on 4 April 2019, and yet a flurry of late changes were made, including on 11 April, the day the election was called, even after the government went into caretaker mode. The question also got a try in the Senate, where Mathias Cormann employed the same defence that Morrison was responsible for \u201cannouncement arrangements\u201d but the projects \u201chad been approved by the minister\u201d. That\u2019s it. One question on an issue which saw the government spend $100m in a way no one can explain whether they had the legal authority to do so. In Senate question time, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young raises concerns about the conflict of interest arrangements for members of the Covid commission. Hanson-Young tells the Senate the government \u201chas stacked their Covid commission full of mining executives and developers who are hellbent on cutting green tape\u201d. She asks what the government will do to \u201censure their mates aren\u2019t feathering their own nests\u201d. The leader of the government in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, rejects the arguments in the questions, arguing the membership is \u201ca broad cross-section\u201d. He says individuals are required to declare their own interests. Let me just say that the people who are serving on the National Covid Coordination Commission are distinguished Australians who are providing great service to our country at a difficult time. Oh thank Beyonce. We get to sports rorts. Richard Marles to Scott Morison: Why did the prime minister tell the house on February 27 that in relation to sports rorts and I quote, authority for these decisions was the minister for sport, when in fact the audit officers told the parliament that the prime minister\u2019s office told the minister for sports and I quote, it was expected that the minister would write to the prime minister to seek authority on the approved projects. Morrison: I refer the member to my many statements on this. The authority for making the decisions in relation to that program was the minister for sport. That is the fact, Mr Speaker. It may be inconvenient for the opposition that that is the fact, that that is the fact, Mr Speaker. The only authority sought from the prime minister\u2019s office and for myself was in relation to announcements. The questions move on to a dixer, giving Stuart Robert a chance to act like a minister. \u201cWhen the chips are down with Australians, all Australians chip in,\u201d says Alan Tudge, sending me looking for chips to fill my existential despair at political discourse in this country. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Figures released today show annual wages growth slowed to a two-year low in the first quarter of this year before the worst of the coronavirus outbreak. Is this the kind of economy the government wants to snap back to? Frydenberg: As I said in the House yesterday, the impact on household consumption and household savings, there will be an impact on wages and there will be a significant, a significant impact across the economy. But I do want to point out to the member for Rankin that under this government, the minimum wage has gone up every year, Mr Speaker. Every year, Mr Speaker. And the reality is ... Chalmers: It didn\u2019t go up under you! Frydenberg: The member for Rankin is getting angry because he is irrelevant to the debate. He has been talking down the economy before the crisis and he is now talking down the economy through the crisis and he will be talking down the economy after the crisis. The Australian people understand and trust the Coalition to manage the economy better than Labor ever will. I mean, it is not talking down to point out what was actually happening. But ugh. Meanwhile, not covered off, sports rorts or the Angus Taylor grassland questions, because it is much better to dress up political points as questions, then try to get the government on the record. Apparently. Jason Clare to Michael Sukkar: Will the government develop a housing construction industry stimulus plan to keep Australia\u2019s almost 1 million bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and lots of other workers in the housing construction industry in a job? Look. There are a lot of words Sukkar says in response here, but none of them are in the form of an actual answer and we only have one life to live. Andrew Laming has now brought Christian Porter to the dispatch box, and he\u2019s decided to use David Littleproud\u2019s template of a loudly striped tie in lieu of a personality today, so I am going to go get a cup of tea. And I thank the very fine member for Wentworth for that question,\u201d says Karen Andrews to Dave Sharma. Tony Burke to Josh Frydenberg: Can the treasurer explain why an 18-year-old living at home and has been working a shift a week at a McDonald\u2019s franchise is receiving the full $1,500 jobkeeper wage subsidy but a full-time Australian worker at Dnata providing catering services to Qantas with a mortgage to repay is not eligible? Frydenberg: Firstly, let me say we very much understand the difficult circumstances that businesses and workers right across the country are facing with this coronavirus pandemic. As the honourable member said himself in this House yesterday, this is a health crisis that has created an economic crisis. Now, Mr Speaker, we responded with $130bn jobkeeper program, we set out very clearly what were the criteria for eligibility under that program including for full-time workers, for part-time workers, for long-term casuals based on a definition in the Fair Work Act as well we doubled the jobseeker payment effectively, the old Newstart, Mr Speaker, which is $1,100 a fortnight, Mr Speaker. We have taken unprecedented economic steps. Some people will be eligible for the jobseeker program, others for the jobkeeper program. More than a million Australians are on the jobseeker program, and when it comes to jobkeeper program, over 800,000 businesses are formally enrolled, representing 5.5 million Australian workers. Tanya Plibersek to Josh Frydenberg: My question is to the treasurer: Can the treasurer explain why a university student working one shift per week receives the full $1,500 jobkeeper wage subsidy but their full-time university tutor with three kids to support is not eligible? Frydenberg: Well, Mr Speaker, we set out very clearly that with respect to universities that they would be subject to the threshold tests of 30% and 50%, depending on their turnover, but we also made the decision as a government to provide the commonwealth grants to the universities to ensure that they are receiving money equivalent to what their enrolments would have been pre-Covid. Mr Speaker, that\u2019s some $18bn. We will see government support for the university sector over this year, that\u2019s very substantial indeed. Sidenote \u2013 Frydenberg is showing as much enthusiasm to sit in the chamber today as I do to engage with Rick and Morty. Nick McKim is one of the first out of the block to criticise the latest bill to expand the powers of Australia\u2019s security agencies (the Dutton bill we have been reporting on in the blog today): Yet again, Peter Dutton is trying to increase powers of security agencies without even trying to explain his reasons. Nor has he tried to give any possible justification for the need to interrogate children as young as 14. To use the pandemic as cover for the increased scope of the surveillance state is dangerous and cynical. The National Terrorism Threat in Australia hasn\u2019t increased for more than five years, and yet we have been confronted with wave after wave of legislation. There have been more than 200 pieces of \u2018counter terror\u2019 legislation passed in Australia since 2001 and very few have been relaxed or withdrawn. Australia desperately needs a Charter of Rights to protect our basic freedoms. Every single dixer being asked just reminds me how many frustrated would-be school captains sit on the government backbenches. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: How can the Australian people trust the prime minister with Covid-19 recovery when he was complacent in the lead up to the bushfires despite a clear warning from experts and months after the bushfires debris is still there but, more importantly, survivors are still living in caravans and showering in community halls. Morrison: This government, Mr Speaker, this government put in place the national bushfire recovery fund in January this year, Mr Speaker \u2013 $2bn was set aside to support the work of the national bushfire recovery agency, Mr Speaker. That fund was intended to acquit some $500m by June 30 of this year. We estimate that that figure will exceed over $1bn by June 30 this year. Small business support grants of some $10,000 have now been provided to over 170,000 small businesses affected across the bushfire-affected areas. In total, small business support has been over $200m to support those small businesses that were so devastated. Mr Speaker, there has also been 1.5m approvals for small businesses on the grants up to $50m, $50,000 I should say, for small businesses seeking their support. Primary producer grants have been provided to the tune of some $127m to primary producers who are affected by these arrangements. The work is being done to clear debris and that estimated cost is over half $1bn, Mr Speaker, over $500m. And as was reported earlier this week, South Australia will have largely completed that task very shortly. New South Wales, who are managing that work, will have completed that task by the end of June as indicated earlier this year. And in Victoria, we understand that that task will be completed by August of this year. As the leader of the opposition knows, the matters of accommodation for those are affected and they are matters handled by the states and territories and we have not received, to the best of my knowledge, that any request outstanding from the commonwealth to provide support for accommodation in these communities, and I look to the minister for management and he indicates that is the case. Mr Speaker, we will deal with crises every time they impact on this country and we will do it methodically and steadily and Australians are seeing that in action. If the leader of the opposition wants to these things, that is a matter for him. Bob Katter has the crossbench question today, and he uses the word \u2018can\u2019 to start his sentence, so you would assume it is a question, but it is actually just another Katter word-soup that leaves everyone looking like Bob Katter usually looks whenever someone asks him his name. North Queensland is shovel ready and Covid-19 free. The rail line, the gasification. Not absorbing money but making money projects and back in black, highway to hell. Treasurer, cough up the money. Make money. Josh Frydenberg barely even cracks a smile. He says the government is moving forward with north Queensland projects, before giving the nod to Angus Taylor, who, from the backbench, encourages Katter to keep talking to the Clean Energy Corporation. Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: What is the government doing to assist red meat growers and producers affected by recent trade restrictions announced by China and to protect the thousands of jobs currently at risk including abattoir workers in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales? Morrison: We hold concerns for the way this issue is being progressed at this point in time. This is a matter that the government has been raising now for a considerable period of time. In fact I have done so on several occasions in my direct meetings with the premier, most recently late last year. So this is an issue that has been running for some time in relation to dumping. We reject any suggestion of those matters being relevant to Australia\u2019s exports, particularly of barley. Australian agriculture is not one supported by subsidy, it is one supported by the ingenuity and good management of the Australian agricultural sector. And so any suggestion that Australia\u2019s agricultural exports are the subject of government subsidisation is rejected. And these are the points that we make directly as part of a comprehensive and strategic partnership that was concluded many years ago and we are continuing to use the channels of that relationship and that partnership to be able to progress those matters as well as directly with the relevant authorities in China regarding their anti-dumping review in relation to barley. Similarly, relations in matter to abattoirs are important to progress. They relate to what is claimed to be paperwork and administration issues in relation to Australian meat exports and we will continue to advocate and set out the Australian case clearly. Let me be clear about one thing. Australia stands firmly behind our agricultural producers and we stand firmly about where we see the role of the Australian economy in the broader world. We have great confidence in our outlook as a trading nation and we engage with all partners in good faith with the purpose of ensuring the increasing global trade. That is the basis for our relationship the Chinese government when it comes to a comprehensive strategic partnership. It works across many different areas and has been a highly successful agreement. From time to time there will be differences in views and we will progress them constructively in the national interest, always in the national interest. Michael McCormack is at the dispatch box, talking about fibre and whatnot, but is only serving to remind me that his speeches are a pretty wonderful substitute for All-Bran. And as you can see, we are back to the non-answers, non-acknowledgement, and the old \u2018deflect and attack\u2019 lines. Cool, cool, cool. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister: Does the prime minister stand by his claim businesses, the economy and his budget will snap back? Morrison: I have every confidence in Australian businesses, Mr Speaker, and it\u2019s more than confidence in Australian businesses to rebuild on the other side of this crisis. I have confidence of businesses being at the centre of our economy and the regrowth that we will see in our economy that will support the incomes and livelihoods of Australians, not just now, but in the decades into the future because as Liberal and Nationals, we have never believed that government should be at the centre of the economy, that Australians should see a future for themselves, only being dependent on the support of other taxpayers, but seeing their own livelihoods being supported by businesses investing and creating jobs, Mr Speaker. Some 1.5 million jobs created over these last six and a half years and those jobs have been decimated, Mr Speaker, by this terrible Covid crisis that has hit the world. But in the same way when we came to government and we rebuilt the nation\u2019s finances and we rebuilt the strength of the economy, Mr Speaker, and, Mr Speaker, that led to 1.5 million Australians getting into jobs. Australians can have confidence on the other side of this crisis the government, Mr Speaker, can apply the same discipline, the same faith and the same confidence in Australians\u2019 spirits and the innovative nature that we have seen as businesses have adapted in the, in this crisis. Now the leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, may want to engage in the semantics of this, but I can tell you what I\u2019m engaged in, Mr Speaker \u2013 and that is, that is, Mr Speaker \u2013 the fortitude and the strength of the Australian people and the strength of the Australian economy, which even still in the midst of this crisis, even still, with the delivery of the single largest income support package this country has ever seen. Rating agencies around the world know we\u2019ve got this covered and it\u2019s true as we sought to raise the finances necessary to pay for that economic lifeline to Australians, then the subscription of our bonds, Mr Speaker, has been subscribed over and over and over again and the ... reason for that, Mr Speaker, is because people have confidence in this country. I have confidence in ... this country and I believe this country will bounce back and bounce strongly under the leadership of this government. Chris Bowen gets today\u2019s first question: The Australian Psychological Society, Headspace and other experts say many Australians will need more than 10 mental health consultations to cope with the flow-on effects of Covid-19. To the government\u2019s credit, it adopted Labor\u2019s suggestion to increase the cap on Medicare mental health services in response to this summer\u2019s bushfires. Will it do the same in relation to Covid-19? Greg Hunt: One of the things we have done is invest very strongly in mental health. There have been a range of inputs and I thank the opposition for their input and I thank all of those who have contributed. In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we have invested $669m in telehealth of which I\u2019m advised 47.7% of all consultations in the previous week with regards to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. In addition to that, what we have also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. So it doesn\u2019t have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services in conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there were psychological and psychiatric items that were also made available. On top of that, there was a $74m investment focusing on support services for people, mostly online or through telehealth, through organisations such as the Black Dog Institute for healthcare workers, Origin for young people, Lifeline, Kids Line, so many other different support groups. And in particular, Beyond Blue has led the coronavirus activity. So with to other proposals, the government will always consider them. What we have done already is on the advice of the mental health officers, the chief medical officer, in particular the chair \u2013 or CEO \u2013 of the National Mental Health Commission and the prime minister\u2019s suicide prevention adviser, Christine Morgan, establish the arrangements which are in place. These have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period and where there are proposals we\u2019d always review them. What we have done so far, I would say, is potentially world leading and in particular the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week and we are making very good process with the states and I want to thank the prime minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet. Bob Katter is currently on ABC TV looking like he just heard audio of one of his speeches. We are on the downhill run to question time. Given it is no longer economy day, expect to hear about some of the other issues which have not been given the attention they deserve. AAP has the deets on the new deputy chief medical officer for mental health: Australia has a new mental health official to help prevent a spike in suicides related to the coronavirus. Former chief psychiatrist of Victoria, Ruth Vine, has been appointed as the country\u2019s first deputy chief medical officer for mental health. Vine will listen to community concerns and provide advice to the federal government, with a focus on anxiety linked to social distancing and economic stress. Health minister Greg Hunt announced the appointment on Wednesday, saying the Covid-19 pandemic, bushfires and drought had affected Australians\u2019 mental health. \u201cThese impacts will be felt by people of all ages and across all our communities,\u201d he told parliament. Hunt said the government was monitoring the use of mental health services so it can respond to demand. Australia\u2019s political leaders will discuss a national mental health pandemic response plan on Friday. The minister also intends to make expanded access to telehealth services a permanent fixture. Government modelling has forecast a 50% increase in suicide cases directly related to the economic shutdown and the associated distress. The modelling also points to the possibility of suicides outstripping direct deaths from coronavirus. \u201cOne of the things we are aware of is that whilst we\u2019re practising physical distancing we should also be engaging in the social contact over the phone, in whatever way we can, to tell people that we\u2019re there, we understand,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThey may be isolated but they\u2019re not alone.\u201d Professor Vine will sit alongside chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, who recommended mental health be treated as a priority. Suicide Prevention Australia and the National Mental Health Commission both welcomed her appointment, saying it recognised the importance of mental health. Lifeline 13 11 14 beyondblue 1300 22 4636 The Greens are getting louder in the calls to have parliament return as usual ahead of August. It was adjourned until August at the last emergency sitting, but given that the government is attempting to reopen the economy, it kinda has to reopen parliament too. So that\u2019s why we are here in this sitting, which Scott Morrison called a \u201ctrial\u201d, but is actually just parliament (trials are not a thing with parliament. It either sits or it doesn\u2019t and the parliament decides how it makes that happen.) Yesterday Christian Porter said a revised sitting calendar was being worked on to bring back parliament ahead of the August scheduled sitting, but there has been no word on when that will be made public. Larissa Waters says parliament needs to be recalled after this sitting as soon as possible. The Covid crisis response and the plan for recovery demand more transparency in government decision-making. The Senate Covid committee plays a critical role, but is no substitute for full parliamentary oversight. We need more democracy during this time, not less. We need to ensure that Australia\u2019s recovery is fair, effective, and guided by expert advice. We need parliament to return. The Greens are calling for both houses to sit in June to fix gaps in the jobkeeper scheme, introduce rights to pandemic leave, consider banking royal commission legislation, and debate the merits of the government\u2019s proposed gas-led recovery. We must ensure we don\u2019t come out the other side having brought this coronovirus under control but finding ourselves with our democracy eroded and hard-fought for rights lost.\u201d The Community and Public Sector Union \u2013 which represents non-academic staff at unis \u2013 is pretty annoyed about a deal between the NTEU and management allowing pay cuts. Troy Wright, the CPSU NSW assistant general secretary, said the deal was \u201ccooked up behind closed doors between academics and universities\u201d and will cut pay, particularly for the lowest paid staff. He said: A 15% wage cut may only be a haircut for high-paid academics, but for the professional staff of universities it is a life-altering cut to their pay packet. There are a range of smarter cost saving measures universities could take before an indiscriminate slash to wages. But, it would seem the NTEU\u2019s leather-elbow-patched-brigade would rather librarians, student services and admin staff on less than $70,000 take a 15% cut to their pay, than see their travel allowances reduced. There is a better way to find savings and secure jobs. We\u2019re going to each NSW university under pressure and asking them to open their books and demonstrate they\u2019ve exhausted all their borrowings. We\u2019re also calling on them to cease capital works, terminate contingent labour and have a through review of executive salaries before they begin slashing the take home pay of all employees. This framework isn\u2019t binding - it\u2019s an entirely theoretical exercise that universities may or may not sign up to. Rather than going on a case-by-case basis to find savings and compromises, this is a knee-jerk response which leaves workers worse off.\u201d The ACT remains active (and known) Covid-19 case free, with no one diagnosed with the virus in the last 24 hours. Police in Victoria now need approval from their supervisor before issuing a fine for breaching lockdown laws. The change means that only two people were fined for breaching lockdown laws in the past 24-hours \u2013 and remember the relaxed restrictions only came into force at midnight last night. Requiring supervisor approval is a significant change, when you consider how many people have been hit with $1,600 on-the-spot fines in the seven weeks since the first stay at home directions were issued. It also pretty much removes the \u201con-the-spot\u201d element \u2013 police said it\u2019s likely there will now be delays \u201cin a breach being detected and a fine being issued\u201d. In a statement, Victoria police said the new process was due to the updated directions from the chief health officer, announced on Monday. You can read those new directions here. Police said: \u201cVictoria police recognises there may be some genuine ambiguity from the community and police members alike regarding the interpretation of the new directions. \u201cThis new process will assist in providing a fair and balanced approach to all breaches and ensure accuracy in offence determination. \u201cIt also ensures a heightened level of discretion.\u201d As we\u2019ve previously reported, there was a fair bit of confusion in the public about what the previous orders meant and how they were enforced as well and accusations of \u201caggressive\u201d policing. The timing of the rule change by police, coming the day after police were criticised for not issuing more on-the-spot fines at an anti-lockdown protest, is probably going to ruffle a few feathers. Over in the Senate, Kim Carr is absolutely teeing off against the Daily Telegraph stories on the \u201cWuhan lab\u201d stories. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age\u2019s Eryk Bagshaw and Anthony Galloway did an excellent deep dive into the origins of those stories, here. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has pushed back at suggestions the government is not setting the right tone in its dealings with China. Earlier today the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, called on Payne and the government to \u201ctake control of this and exercise a little bit of discipline in their ranks\u201d to avoid inflaming tensions. \u201cIt would be pretty handy if we heard more from the foreign minister and less from people like George Christensen,\u201d Albanese told reporters in Murrumbateman. During an interview with Kieran Gilbert on Sky News \u2013 which will go to air later today \u2013 Payne said she did not want to be drawn into an argument with the opposition, but was focused on managing Australia\u2019s \u201ccomplex international relationships\u201d. She said the government was handling the issues in a considered way in the Australian interest. I think the tone is being very carefully set by the prime minister and by me in my capacity and other ministers who are engaged on these issues,\u201d Payne said. Peter Dutton reports the anti-fraud taskforce it established in relation to the bushfire and Covid-19 payments, \u201cTaskforce Iris\u201d has made its first arrest \u2013 a 34-year-old western Sydney man: It is alleged that since January 2020, the man had assumed up to 11 identities as well as 53 fictitious identities to submit a number of claims for government benefits. These include: 65 fraudulent claims for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment in the context of the summer 2019-20 bushfires; 1 fraudulent claim for Newstart allowance; 2 fraudulent claims for jobseeker payments, which includes the coronavirus supplement that is intended to support the rate of jobseeker payment due to the impact of the coronavirus. The value of fraudulent payments the man allegedly tried to claim is approximately $70,550 in total. The man has been charged with a number of commonwealth offences, including obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Some of these offences carry penalties of up to a maximum of 10 years in prison. OK, we have a little more information on what the Covid commissioners are being paid, following questioning from Katy Gallagher to Stephanie Foster from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. Here\u2019s who is on it: Neville Power. Chairman, National Covid-19 Coordination Commission (NCCC) David Thodey AO, deputy chairman The Hon Greg Combet AM Jane Halton AO PSM FAICD FIPPA Paul Little AO Catherine Tanna Peter Harris AO chief executive officer Andrew N Liveris You can find out more about who is on the commission, here. Foster says there are five commissioners supporting the chair. One has asked not to be paid, four are working for a day rate of $2,000, with three working around two days a week and one working one day a week. Katy Gallagher asks what Nev Power is receiving as chair and is told that, as a full-time roll (for six months) he is receiving $500,000, which is also meant to cover his travel and accomodation costs. Labor also believes the government\u2019s sudden interest in medical cannabis exports is related to One Nation\u2019s position on the consultation period for enterprise agreements, Paul Karp tells me. One Nation\u2019s position on that was to push back by suggesting it will allow the shorter consultation (one day) but limit the effect of cuts to 12 months. Nev Power\u2019s salary has just been made public in the Covid committee. He will be paid $500,000 for six months work. He is heading up the business link in the Covid Commission. Most of the other commissioners are being paid $2,000 a day. At the moment they are working about two days a week. So yes, that one will be sent to the parliamentary security and intelligence committee, I would suspect, but keep in mind it has been entered into the parliament with very little fanfare during a pandemic. Given that it allows for 14-year-olds to be questioned by security agencies, increases surveillance, adds in \u201cacts of foreign interference\u201d and \u201cpolitically motivated violence\u201d into reasons for a questioning warrant, which are some pretty broad definitions, and makes it easier (streamlining is just another word for easier) for tracking devices to be used, including oral authorisations for a questioning warrant, there needs to be a lot more attention paid to this one. In fact, the latest Peter Dutton bill does quite a bit: 1. The bill amends the compulsory questioning framework in the Asio Act by: \u00b7 enabling Asio\u2019s continued use of questioning warrants, but removing its ability to use questioning and detention warrants; \u00b7 replacing the existing detention framework with a more limited apprehension framework to ensure attendance during questioning and to prevent contact with others or the destruction of information; \u00b7 enabling the use of questioning warrants in relation to espionage, politically motivated violence (including terrorism) and acts of foreign interference, as defined in section 4 of the Asio Act, rather than only in relation to terrorism offences; \u00b7 streamlining the process for requesting and issuing a questioning warrant by enabling the attorney general to issue questioning warrants directly, removing the role of the issuing authority; \u00b7 enabling Asio to request, and the attorney general to issue, questioning warrants orally in an emergency; \u00b7 amending the eligibility requirements for appointment of prescribed authorities, to enable a broader pool of qualified persons to be appointed to this role; \u00b7 providing the power for a police officer to conduct a search of a person who is apprehended in connection with a questioning warrant, and the ability to seize dangerous items and items that could be used to communicate the existence of the warrant or escape from custody, with an additional ability to seize items of intelligence relevant to the questioning matter, when authorised by the attorney general; \u00b7 introducing screening measures and person searches for people attending questioning, either as the subject of the questioning warrant or others involved in the questioning process such as parents, and the ability of a police officer to retain any dangerous items and communications devices found in order to ensure the safety of those involved in questioning, and the integrity of the questioning; \u00b7 subject to a number of safeguards \u2013 permitting Asio to seek a questioning warrant in relation to minors aged 14 to 18 years old, but only where the minor is themselves the target of an Asio investigation in relation to politically motivated violence; \u00b7 strengthening the right to legal representation during questioning while retaining the ability to prevent contact with specific lawyers due to security concerns, and to remove a lawyer who is unduly disruptive during questioning; \u00b7 introducing the ability of the independent prescribed authority to appoint a lawyer for the subject of a questioning warrant in certain circumstances; and \u00b7 enabling a questioning warrant to be executed following the laying of charges against the person who is the subject of a questioning warrant, or where charges against that person are likely, and allow for the questioning to cover matters that are the subject of those charges with appropriate protections in relation to the person\u2019s fair trial. That new security bill Peter Dutton introduced into the parliament this morning includes a lot of amendments to \u201ctracking devices\u201d and internal authorisations within security agencies, for them to be used. Which means security agencies could approve the use of tracking devices internally. They wouldn\u2019t need a warrant. From the explanatory notes: The Bill also amends the surveillance device framework in the ASIO Act to promote increased operational agility, mitigate the risk to ASIO surveillance operatives engaging in physical surveillance and to help resolve the current disadvantage faced by ASIO when engaging in joint operations with law enforcement. The Bill amends the ASIO Act in this regard by: \u00b7 enabling ASIO to use tracking devices with internal authorisation in certain circumstances, rather than requiring a warrant; \u00b7 clarifying that the surveillance device framework is permissive and does not require ASIO to obtain a warrant where conduct would not otherwise be unlawful; and \u00b7 updating the definition of \u2018tracking device\u2019 and effectively modernising ASIO\u2019s capabilities. You can find the whole bill here. So that is a yes \u2013 Pauline Hanson is in the box seat for those disallowance motions Paul has been reporting about. And on the same day, the government is just coincidently trying to rush through a piece of legislation on medical cannabis she has wanted, that it only just introduced to the parliament today. Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick has confirmed that his party will support the Labor/Greens disallowance to help universities access jobkeeper, and the Labor motion to extend the wage subsidy to foreign government-owned companies with local workers. He said: The jobkeeper money is directed at Australian workers - not the companies. That was the same argument the Liberal MP Craig Kelly made in the Coalition party room yesterday when sticking up for workers at the airline catering company Dnata. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union and Australian Council of Trade Unions are both lobbying senators to pass the disallowances. No word on Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation but, given that Lambie and Centre Alliance are on board, they are the swing votes. I am still making my way through reading this legislation, but yes, this is in there. The Liberal senator James Paterson gave an interesting adjournment speech in the Senate last night, blasting universities for over-reliance on China. Paterson said: One thing [Covid-19 has] made clear already is the overreliance of our higher education institutions on the international student market, and the Chinese student market in particular. Over the last few decades, our universities have bet big on the international student dollar. Their institutions have boomed from what has been a very lucrative business. But they have become badly overexposed ... Universities argue that they\u2019ve pursued this market by necessity. They argue insufficient government funding pushed them down this path. It\u2019s a convenient story that attempts to absolve universities from responsibility for decisions they have made, and it\u2019s a false one. Paterson noted that increasing international enrolments coincided with uncapping of university places, growing domestic student places and government funding. He reveals that he\u2019s been sent details of the University of Queensland\u2019s remuneration structure. He claims one of the vice-chancellor\u2019s performance indicators is to \u201ccontinue to work towards a sound and strategic positioning in China\u201d. UQ is also supposed to cultivate students from south-east Asia and India, but Paterson says it has had less success doing so. Paterson argued that over-reliance on China particularly puts rights including \u201cfree speech, or the principle of free and open academic inquiry, or the right to protest for students\u201d at risk, given the stance of the Chinese Communist party. He argued against direct funding of courses by the Chinese government and alleged inadequate protection of academic freedom at the Confucius Institute. Paterson said: Given that we now know that the vice-chancellor was financially incentivised to deliver closer relations with the CCP, it is no wonder that the University of Queensland has found itself in such a predicament. It begs the question: is he the only VC in Australia to receive a bonus for exposing his university to financial and reputational risk by actively seeking dependence on the Chinese student market?\u201d Western Australia has no new cases of Covid to report in the last 24 hours. There are only six active cases in the state, although there is still one person in the ICU. I\u2019ve confirmed that Senator Jacqui Lambie will be voting with Labor and the Greens to restore the consultation period for pay cuts back to one week (up from 24 hours under new government rules). Lambie has discussed with Labor the disallowance to extend jobkeeper to more universities and foreign government-owned businesses, such as the airline catering company, Dnata. She has concerns about job losses but hasn\u2019t arrived at a final position. A vote is expected at 6pm, although Centre Alliance and One Nation are the critical votes on that. The Transport Workers\u2019 Union national secretary, Michael Kaine, is urging a vote for the disallowance: Dnata workers are ringing their federal MPs and senators urging them to support this motion because their families depend on it. We have workers who are struggling to pay bills, struggling to get medical supplies for their kids, eating whatever tinned food they have in their house to avoid buying groceries. They have been weeks without pay now and many fear they won\u2019t even qualify for jobseeker. They are Australian workers who pay their taxes and feel very let down. The National Tertiary Education Union has announced a deal with university management that would allow pay cuts of up to 15% in return for saving jobs in the Covid-19 contraction. It believes the emergency move could save 12,000 jobs. In a statement the NTEU explained it had done so because: Universities are looking at a sector-wide revenue loss of up to $5 billion during 2020 and more in subsequent years, due to a collapse in international and domestic enrolments. University employees are also excluded from the jobkeeper program. Under the deal: No university employee will be involuntarily stood down without pay. On a temporary basis of one year, some staff at deeply affected universities will receive 85 per cent of their salary. The vast majority of affected staff will receive between 90 and 95 per cent of their former salary. People on lower wages will not be affected. Temporary salary reductions will only happen after non-staff costs and management salaries have been reduced. Non-wage conditions such as superannuation and leave continue to accrue at the standard rate. Displaced casual and fixed-term staff will be prioritised for new work. Redundancies will only happen in cases where a university can explicitly prove there is no work. NTEU president, Alison Barnes, said: \u201cThere are no perfect options in a crisis. In the absence of a properly funded federal crisis package our Union has intervened to put income security and fairness at the centre of a national response. \u201cWithout this agreement, we faced mass sackings which would have seen careers derailed and livelihoods destroyed.\u201d The deal will still have to be voted on by workers, and the NTEU dealing with management is very controversial in the sector. A couple more bills to keep an eye on. This one from Peter Dutton. And the payment reporting time bill from Karen Andrews, which is designed to: The Payment Times Reporting Bill (the Bill) introduces a new Payment Times Reporting Scheme (the Scheme) which requires large businesses and large government enterprises with an annual total income of over $100 million to publicly report on their payment terms and practices for their small business suppliers. In identifying small business suppliers, the Scheme will draw on a taxation legislation definition of small business as those entities with an annual turnover of less than $10 million. The objective of the Scheme is to improve payment outcomes for small businesses by creating transparency around the payment practices of large business entities. By providing access to information on large business payment performance, small businesses will be able to make a more informed decision about their potential customers. Greater transparency on payment practices and performance will also create pressure for cultural change to improve payment times. A federal court judge says he will make orders allowing Virgin Australia to start giving \u201cconditional credits\u201d for cancelled flights. But at a hearing this morning John Middleton stopped short of allowing administrators of the largely grounded airline to avoid large swathes of the liabilities they\u2019re running up while in charge of the company after the attorney general and the Taxation Office asked for more time to consider the issue. As Guardian Australia reported, Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators stopped giving refunds and flight credits for cancelled trips after they took control of the airline. The administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, did this because otherwise they faced being personally liable for the money. But they\u2019ve told the court the move put them at a competitive disadvantage. The proposal Middleton said he would approve will allow the administrators to offer flight credits but not cash refunds. Meanwhile, the Attorney General\u2019s Department and the ATO have been given until Friday to decide if they object to other orders proposed by the administrators. The AG\u2019s department wanted the time to think about the administrators\u2019 desire to disclaim personal responsibility for jobkeeper payments, while the issue for the ATO appears to relate to inter-company loans. An editorial in China\u2019s state-backed English-language paper, Global Times, has sounded a warning to Australia, saying import suspensions and potential tariffs are not necessarily punishment but should serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d. The editorial says Australia\u2019s support for an inquiry into the source and origin of the virus has worsened a relationship already damaged by Australia\u2019s \u201cunfriendly actions\u201d towards China, including the blocking of Huawei from the 5G network. And if Australia is feeling worried about Chinese retaliation? Well, it should. \u201cThe latest meat import suspension and the possible imposition of major tariffs on Australia\u2019s barley exports don\u2019t necessarily represent China\u2019s economic punishment for Australia, though they may serve as a wake-up call for Australia to reflect on its economic links with China,\u201d it says. \u201cWhile China is the only choice for Australia\u2019s massive commodity exports, Australia is not necessarily the only option for China.\u201d It also notes, just out of interest, that China could replace Australian meat imports with supplies from the US, the very country Australia has sided with. \u201cOf course, China\u2019s willingness to maintain a cooperative relationship with Australia hasn\u2019t changed, and it is now up to Australia to decide what to do next.\u201d Paul Karp tells me the disallowance motion, which Labor, supported by the Greens, are putting forward to extend jobkeeper, is expected to be put to the Senate about 6pm. Pauline Hanson\u2019s two votes are enough to block it, if she is not on board. And suddenly, the government has a bill which she has been hankering for rushing through the parliament. What else have we learned in the Covid hearing this morning? The secretary of PM&amp;C, Phil Gaetjens, doesn\u2019t have a lot of answers over how national cabinet works in association with the usual cabinet. So he couldn\u2019t answer whether or not the cabinet cabinet has to endorse the decisions by the national cabinet. He also couldn\u2019t answer whether or not there was a handbook to guide national cabinet proceedings (a standard in the public service), and referred to the cabinet handbook, which wouldn\u2019t mention the national cabinet, because as we keep hearing, we haven\u2019t seen this level of cooperation in the federation before. He told the committee to look at the PM&amp;C website. Which also doesn\u2019t seem to have the answers. Obviously, this is, using the word of 2020, \u201cunprecedented\u201d \u2013 but it is not as though Gaetjens didn\u2019t know he was appearing in front of this committee today. Brendan Murphy also just told the committee that he would be surprised if \u201cthe true international caseload isn\u2019t closer to the 20m mark\u201d. This is a little bit strange. David Littleproud just introduced this bill into the House \u2013 Export Control Legislation Amendment (Certification of Narcotic Exports) Bill 2020 \u2013 which would make it easier for Australian companies to export medical cannabis. That would be particularly good news for Queensland, which is building up quite the industry in that sector. So normal so far. It gets weird with the timing \u2013 despite introducing it today, Littleproud wants the parliament to be dealt with today. So the government wants it rushed through the parliament on the same day it is introduced, which is usually only reserved for emergency bills, or fixing messes. This is not that. But it is something that Pauline Hanson has been chasing for quite some time. And the government needs Hanson to vote to against extending jobkeeper to universities, extending jobkeeper to foreign government-owned companies with local workers and restoring the one-week consultation period for pay cuts. Deidre Chambers! Victorians may be enjoying a few more freedoms today, and other states and territories have seen a slight relaxation of the restriction rules \u2013 but don\u2019t expect travel to return to normal any time soon. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, was asked about the border closures in the Senate select committee hearing this morning and replied: I cannot see border measures materially changing for some time and that presents a huge problem for the nation. Australia is still seeing new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed each week from returned travellers, who are still being sent into forced quarantine. The Greens have advised me that they support Labor\u2019s attempt to extend jobkeeper to foreign government-owned companies with local workers, like the airline catering company Dnata. Labor and the Greens need four out of five crossbench votes for that motion and a bid to improve universities\u2019 ability to access the $130bn jobkeeper wage subsidy. They\u2019re lobbying the crossbench this morning. There is further movement on the consultation period for employers seeking cuts to conditions in workplace pay deals. Centre Alliance\u2019s Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia that 24 hours is \u201cnot enough\u201d but the party is \u201csupportive of something closer to the three-day mark\u201d. That\u2019s a new compromise, the rules now say 24 hours and Labor and the Greens are trying to restore a period of one week. Griff also said there was \u201csome merit\u201d in One Nation\u2019s proposal that emergency cuts should only last for 12 months. The backbench has found its groove. Insert jokes here. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is at the XXXX brewery because it is law that the Queensland premier stand in front of the XXXX sign wearing hi-vis at least once a year. The state has no new cases in the last 24 hours, but an old case has been added to its total of 1,052 Covid cases. There are 18 active cases in Queensland. Anthony Albanese is campaigning in Eden-Monaro \u2013 he lays out what Labor\u2019s main byelection line will be: I was say this to the people of Eden-Monaro. If you think the government has been perfect, then you will make that decision. If you think the government needs improvement, if you think they could have better prepared for the bushfires, if you think they could have dealt with the crisis while the bushfires were going better, if you think the recovery should have been better, then send them a message, send the Coalition government a message, because they, quite frankly, are taking the people of Eden-Monaro for granted. That\u2019s why they\u2019re engaging in all this self-indulgent behaviour. Victoria has recorded seven new cases in the last 24 hours. None have been come from Cedar Meats although three previous tests have been linked back to the meat-processing plants, so that cluster is now responsible for 88 infections. Still in the Covid committee, and Rex Patrick is asking about the denial of his FoI request \u2013 this is how he described it two weeks ago: In anticipation of the Senate COVID-19 Committee inquiry, Senator Patrick lodged a Freedom of Information request for the early briefings provided to Prime Minister Morrison on the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cI was hopeful that the Department would release some useful information that would shed light on the Government\u2019s early assessments and responses in January. A high level of transparency is essential if we are to learn all the lessons we can from the experience of this terrible pandemic.\u201d However the Department of Prime Minister &amp; Cabinet has refused access to all of the requested briefings given to the Prime Minister at the beginning of the crisis. Patrick asks Phil Gaetjens if he can see the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of denying the request while demanding China\u2019s ruling party be transparent. Gaetjens says he does not see the hypocrisy. Peter Whish-Wilson is trying to find out what documents from the national cabinet will be made \u201ccabinet in confidence\u201d \u2013 he is talking specifically of any advice from the manufacturing taskforce in relation to gas regulation, it seems. The committee chair, Katy Gallagher, says he has run out of time. Whish-Wilson is not happy. Gallagher thanks him for the feedback: \u201cIt\u2019s always welcome.\u201d Whish-Wilson is appearing via video link so he is at a disadvantage. Fun fact, Michael Pezzullo, who heads up Home Affairs, also does not sit in on national cabinet. Even though he heas up the National Coordination Mechanism. Brendan Murphy seems to be the only first medical officer in the room \u2013 none of the other state or territory leaders take in their chief medical officers. The Liberal senator James Paterson (who has used his lockdown time to grow an iso-beard) asks the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, about Kawasaki disease \u2013 a rare, potentially fatal, disease in children, which has been linked to a small number of children diagnosed with Covid-19 internationally. Murphy says there have been no cases linked to Covid in Australia but it is something they are watching, although he says the association between Covid and Kawasaki is not clear at this stage. When you have millions of the population infected, there are obviously more children and there does seem to be an association between an increased incidence of this condition and potentially covered positive children, it\u2019s probably a reflection of probably in New York City, for example, they\u2019re likely to be several thousand children infected because you\u2019re dealing with potentially hundreds of thousands of people. So it\u2019s it\u2019s a very really rare association where it\u2019s not clear. Kawasaki disease can be set off by other viral infections \u2026 We think that it\u2019s it\u2019s one of those rare things that is emerged because of this the huge burden of the infected load. In those countries, it may appear in other countries with large, very large volumes of infected people, but because it\u2019s so rare, it\u2019s unlikely to be seen in Australia. But we\u2019ll obviously, we\u2019ve got alerts on us and we\u2019re clearly watching it. It\u2019s Kopika\u2019s fifth birthday. It\u2019s the third birthday she has spent in detention, along with her family, after they were taken from Biolela. She is now with her family in the Christmas Island detention centre. So far, questioning of PM&amp;C head Phil Gaetjens is around who attends national cabinet, in terms of public servants. Greg Hunt does not sit on the national cabinet (which we knew, given he has held press conferences, while national cabinet was being held) Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher and Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick will ask the Senate today to schedule Senate estimates in the week from 15 to 19 June. The Greens also support the motion. If the motion is successful, Senate estimates committees will hear: On 15 June and 16 June from the environment and communications, finance and public administration, legal and constitutional affairs, and rural and regional affairs and transport portfolios On 17 and 18 June from the community affairs, economics, education and employment, and foreign affairs, defence and trade portfolios On 19 June from the Indigenous matters and on Murray-Darling basin plan portfolios The Senate select committee on Covid-19 hearing has begun \u2013 the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary, Phil Gaetjens, is up first. He is reading his opening statement, which is a recap of what has been done so far. \u201cThis crisis will be a marathon not a sprint,\u201d Gaetjens said of his message to Australia\u2019s public servants. Australia\u2019s biggest bank, the Commonwealth Bank, has set aside an additional $1.5bn for loans that go bad due to the coronavirus crisis. In a quarterly trading update out this morning, its chief executive, Matt Comyn, said despite the pandemic the bank had performed well in the three months to the end of March, making a profit of $1.3bn. The bank is the last of the big-four banks to report on the impact of the virus on its business, and its provisions bring to a total of $5.8bn the amount the group \u2013 CBA, Westpac, NAB and ANZ \u2013 expects to suffer in bad loans due to the crisis. Comyn said: Today\u2019s announcement of an additional credit provision of $1.5bn for the potential longer-term impacts of Covid-19 further reinforces our already strong provisioning and balance sheet settings. The strength and resilience of the bank remained evident through the March quarter. Our people have continued to serve our customers diligently and professionally under challenging circumstances. The Global Times newspaper tends to be the more shouty and hawkish of the Communist party of China-run state media. So when it has an editorial slamming a particular country or action, it\u2019s essentially treated as an angry diplomatic cable. It turned that attention to Australia in its latest editorial, warning of economic consequences if relations continue to deteriorate: Australian media outlets have shown great concern over the likelihood that China may soon impose major tariffs on barley exports from Australia, as the move could become the symbolic start to a series of retaliatory measures against the country. Some Australian media have deliberately politicized the issue, describing it as China\u2019s retaliation to Australia\u2019s attempt to blame China for the pandemic by calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. However, the fact is that the decision on Chinese tariffs will be based on an anti-dumping investigation into Australia\u2019s exported barley that has been ongoing for almost 18 months. If anything, Australia\u2019s worries over potential tariffs underline the anxiety surrounding deteriorating China-Australia relations. Since China-US relations hit their lowest point in decades amid the Covid-19 crisis, relations between China and Australia have been heading in the same direction. Australian politicians have made no secret of their desire to follow the US, joining in on the China blame game. If China-US ties continue to deteriorate, the uncertainty surrounding China-Australia relations will also increase. Such uncertainty will inevitably lead to economic repercussions. In this sense, it now seems necessary to advise Chinese people and companies to watch out for potential risks when it comes to doing business with or studying in Australia. Fundamentally speaking, it is not in the interests of people in China and Australia if the latter\u2019s politicians continue to take unfriendly actions and launch political attacks on the former. China-US relations are now in trouble, and if Australia chooses to follow, that would not only negatively impact its relations with China but would also come at the cost of its own economy and trade. In fact, the importance of China to Australia\u2019s economy may be far greater than some Australian politicians estimate. China is Australia\u2019s largest export destination, with exports to China accounting for about one third of its total exports. China is the main buyer of Australia\u2019s commodities, farm products and education services. There is a need for Australia to reposition its role in regional geopolitics rather than becoming the lapdog of the US. It needs to rethink its relationships with the US and China at this juncture. Given its economic ties with Asian countries are closer than those it has with western nations, it may be more in its interests to focus on how to further integrate into the Asian industrial chain. Amid all this, the Eden-Monaro byelection is still to be scheduled. Labor isn\u2019t messing around \u2013 Anthony Albanese will be out there this morning, with the party\u2019s candidate, Kristy McBain, and Catherine King for a doorstop at Murrumbateman. But then Labor can do that \u2013 it has a candidate. The Coalition is still trying to work out what to do, given the whole John Barilaro/Andrew Constance/Michael McCormack mess. Soon, we shall all hear the bells. The government is still attempting to navigate increasingly delicate trading issues with China, most recently how to work through the delisting of four major Australian abattoirs. On this issue though, Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells has never been backwards in coming forwards. The select Senate committee looking at the Covid-19 response will hold a hearing this morning from 9am, with the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary, Phil Gaetjens, slated to appear. It is pretty rare for the head of PM&amp;C to appear in front of these committees. The chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, will also appear. That\u2019s less rare. The NSW chief medical officer, Dr Kerry Chant, reported that an 81-year-old woman, who had tested positive for Covid-19, died overnight. She had been a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship and disembarked on 19 March. It\u2019s the 22nd death linked to that cruise ship and the 98th for the nation. And a reminder that for a lot of other countries, life is very, very far from anything approaching normal. Gladys Berejiklian: Our success won\u2019t be measured by the number of cases we get every day, our success will be measured equally by how many people keep their jobs and don\u2019t experience the stress and diminishing quality of life that so many people have in the past couple of weeks and we want to focus on people having job security and have the good quality of life. Of the six new cases of Covid-19 diagnosed overnight, three are still having their origins tested. That\u2019s the number to watch \u2013 the community transmissions. But the NSW premier says she expects the number of new Covid-19 cases will increase as restrictions are relaxed. The number of patients in intensive care is very low with Covid but we know once we ease restrictions it won\u2019t be the case. But if you look around the world, many communities who are easing restrictions aren\u2019t in the position NSW is in. Many communities around the world easing restrictions still have the case numbers in the hundreds every day, which would be untenable for us, which means thousands of people would have been in ICUs and an untenable situation. We should feel very fortunate we are in a position as we ease restrictions, to have the case numbers, it gives us options but it also means we have to maintain our vigilance and get tested if we have the mildest symptoms and stay home if we worry we have been in contact with somebody. I can\u2019t stress enough, when you are with people you know very well, even outdoors, you tend to forget to socially distance. We can\u2019t let it happen. Inside a household it is fine, but outside, with the people you live with, even if they are members of your extended family or very close friends, don\u2019t think you can\u2019t pass the virus to each other. Please be careful. Gladys Berejiklian, right on Gladys Berejiklian time, is delivering the latest NSW update (it\u2019s how I know it is time for my second coffee). Six people in NSW tested positive for Covid-19 overnight. That\u2019s from 8,100 tests. I was very pleased to have brought to my attention a number of international reports that says NSW has the highest rate of testing in the world. It is something we are incredibly proud of, something we need to maintain. I always say to our experts and my team here in NSW, there is no way we can\u2019t lead the world in the way we deal with the pandemic moving forward, and give good advice to our citizens to keep us safe and look at parts of our community, parts of business in particular that we can activate without having any adverse impacts on health. We know from Friday we will analyse the data closely because we appreciate once you ease any restriction, there is more activities and a chance of people getting the virus or passing it on to others. Parliament is also ticking over, although there is still no word on what the revised sitting schedule will look like. Budget estimates was scheduled from 25 May but it is a little hard to have budget estimates without a budget. Still though, there are quite a few MPs who would like the opportunity to scrutinise government spending and decisions. You have Amy Remeikis and Mike Bowers to guide you through the parliamentary day, plus Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Daniel Hurst. Thank you for joining us. Today is also the first day of lockdown laws being eased in Victoria. Many have gotten up early to enjoy their newfound freedom in the dreary Melbourne weather. Here are Hunt\u2019s full remarks on a disease that has been popping up in small numbers in the US. I mentioned tensions between Australia and China just before. If you want to get up to date with that branch of the Covid-19 tree, I can recommend this report by Daniel Hurst. The Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O\u2019Neil, has spoken to the ABC this morning. She has criticised the government actions that have lead to increased tensions with China: I think it\u2019s really important that in a time of crisis that we don\u2019t create new crises. It\u2019s really important that we manage to continue to have good, strong relationships with where our goods are exported to, and our services. Our views that the focus of the government the moment, the focus of everyone, should be on getting us through this pandemic, rebuilding the economy, supporting the creation of new jobs, and not putting at risk any of the trade arrangements we currently have in place. Hunt has been asked about a disease potentially linked to Covid-19, which has reportedly been associated with the deaths of three children in the US. Prof Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, has requested advice from paediatric experts around Australia. He and Paul Kelly, the deputy chief medical officer, are also seeking advice from overseas. They\u2019re providing a briefing to the national cabinet this week. At this stage, there has been no signs of that condition in Australia. What they\u2019re determining is the relationship between it and Covid-19, whether it\u2019s in some way triggered or caused by Covid-19 or whether with the mass testing that has been done a condition which is otherwise there has been shown up. But I\u2019ll leave that to experts. We\u2019ve taken it very seriously. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, is speaking on ABC News Breakfast now. Hunt confirmed Assoc Prof Ruth Vine has been appointing as deputy chief medical officer for mental health: We do know whenever there is an economic downturn there is strong evidence that mental health challenges rise. As part of that, we\u2019re preparing now on two fronts: one is to particularly focus on the mental health concerns during and potentially flowing from the pandemic. And they could be anxiety about health, anxiety or depression relating to the lockdowns, but they\u2019re progressively lifting, and also economic anxiety which is what is so important to get people back to work. At the same time what we\u2019re doing is providing support through Beyond Blue, Lifeline, KidsHelp Line and Head Space and we\u2019re making a permanent change which is the establishment of a deputy chief medical officer for health, which Prof Brendan Murphy has strongly supported. The independent MP Zali Steggall says she is increasingly concerned about the Morrison government\u2019s influential National Covid Coordination Commission, because there is \u201cno transparency about its governance or processes\u201d. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, has the full report below: The federal government is expected to appoint Assoc Prof Ruth Vine to plan the mental health response to the coronavirus pandemic, reports the AAP. The health minister, Greg Hunt, is expected to make a statement on mental health today while Vine, the former chief psychiatrist for Victoria, has been selected for the role, the Australian newspaper reports. Government modelling forecasts a 50% increase in suicides directly related to the economic shutdown and the associated distress, with the possibility they could outstrip direct deaths from coronavirus. \u201cA priority on the road out of the pandemic is supporting the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians,\u201d Hunt will say, according to the newspaper. \u201cSupporting the mental health of Australians is a deep personal passion of mine and a priority of this government.\u201d Vine will sit alongside the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, who recommended mental health be treated as a priority. Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus crisis in Australia. This morning the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has revealed he has tested negative to Covid-19, after suffering a coughing fit in parliament yesterday. If you missed the coughing fit that prompted the test, you can watch it here: Here are yesterday\u2019s major developments you might have missed: China has suspended imports from four big Australian abattoirs, but the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said it was a \u201ctechnical\u201d issue. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said she was not consulted before George Christensen announced he wanted to summon the Chinese ambassador to face questions before a parliamentary committee. The federal government\u2019s budget update showed GDP is forecast to fall by more than 10% in the June quarter, the largest on record, and unemployment will reach about 10%, or 1.4 million people. Eight new cases have been diagnosed linked to the Cedar Meats abattoir, taking the total to 85.",

The disposal of farm animals could also have serious consequences for air and drinking water. President Trump ordered meat plants to stay open despite thousands of cases linked to them and at least 20 deaths. The coronavirus has spread at more than twice the national rate in US counties with major meatpacking plants in the first week after he issued the order, according analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. In Europe, poultry meat and egg producers warned of an oversupply of produce in the EU unless imports to the bloc were limited. Poultry meat is piling up and freezers all over the EU are already full said farming groups, who fear a price collapse. Thailand is looking to increase chicken meat exports to the EU and UK through free trade deals after its own domestic consumption dropped by 50%. China increased live cattle imports in the first months of 2020, mainly from Australia and New Zealand. The country has been increasing its national cattle herd with almost 200,000 animals imported last year. However, beef production remains far below domestic demand. Tyson Foods \u2013 one of the largest meat producers in the US \u2013 is facing legal action over the release of 200,000 gallons of insufficiently treated wastewater into a river in Alabama last summer, which killed fish and other wildlife.

Despite Donald Trump\u2019s claims that the spread of coronavirus is dropping around the US, new infection hotspots are cropping up across Republican heartlands, including in Texas and Alabama. Many of the new hotspots are in states where governors refused to instruct residents to stay at home, or are following Trump\u2019s advice to relax lockdown restrictions. These figures could be seen as the realisation of a warning from Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the president\u2019s long-suffering right-hand man on coronavirus, on Tuesday. In his latest contradiction of the president, Fauci warned the virus would not go away on its own, and that reopening the country too quickly could result in a surge in \u201clittle spikes that might turn into outbreaks\u201d.

The payout was slightly down on Potts\u2019 previous annual package of \u00a34.5m but is likely to raise eyebrows given that the boss of the Bradford-based supermarket earned nearly two-thirds that of Tesco\u2019s chief executive despite running a business less than a third of the size of its bigger rival.</p>",

The Labour peer Andrew Adonis said it was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d for Tesco to accept a business rates holiday worth \u00a3585m and said the retailer should \u201cpay it back\u201d if it could afford to pay a big dividend to shareholders. On Wednesday, the shareholder advisory group Pirc said it had already raised concerns that Tesco\u2019s pay structure was \u201cproducing excessive results\u201d. Tim Bush, the head of governance and financial analysis at Pirc, pointed to the adjustment to the scheme relating to total shareholder return: \u201cThe fact that Ocado was included, only to then be taken out, does raise questions. That\u2019s rather different to omitting it altogether.\u201d The company\u2019s annual report meanwhile reveals Tesco paid a \u00a310.7m lump sum payment in March to the former chief executive Philip Clarke in a settlement relating to his pension payments. Clarke, who stepped down in September 2014, ceased employment with Tesco in January 2015 shortly after the discovery of an accounting black hole and a period of poor performance. Lewis\u2019s hefty payouts emerged on the same day that Morrisons revealed that its chief executive, David Potts, received a total \u00a34.2m pay package last year including a \u00a32.3m long-term share bonus. The payout was slightly down on Potts\u2019 previous annual package of \u00a34.5m but is likely to raise eyebrows given that the boss of the Bradford-based supermarket earned nearly two-thirds that of Tesco\u2019s chief executive despite running a business less than a third of the size of its bigger rival.",

      "bodyText": "Hate crime directed at south and east Asian communities has increased by 21% during the coronavirus crisis, ministers have told MPs. A session of the home affairs select committee on online harm since the onset of the pandemic also heard that incidents of revenge porn \u2013 the sharing of private sexual material of another person without their consent either online and offline \u2013 had increased. Susan Williams, the Home Office minister for countering extremism, told the committee that extremism generally had not increased, but there had been a rise in specific types of hate crime. She said: \u201cI\u2019ve been speaking to our hate crime lead, and there\u2019s been a 21% uptick in hate incidents against the IC4 and IC5 community.\u201d Police use IC codes in radio communications and crime recording systems to describe the apparent ethnicity of a suspect or victim. IC4 relates to south Asia and IC5 to east Asia. Incidents of hate crime against Chinese people in the UK have been well-documented in the run up to and during the lockdown period, including individuals being spat on and assaulted. Police estimates suggest a threefold increase in such incidents in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year. Lady Williams\u2019s answer jars with information provided by another Home Office minister, Kit Malthouse, in answer to a parliamentary question from the Liberal Democrats about the proportion of hate crime incidents against people of Chinese ethnicity. Malthouse did not provide a figure in his response, and said: \u201cInformation is not routinely collected on the ethnicity of victims.\u201d Caroline Dinenage, the digital and culture minister, told the committee there had been a rise in revenge porn. \u201cFor adult users, we\u2019ve seen a concerning increasing trend in things like revenge porn and sexploitation, calls to helplines along the lines of things like that,\u201d she said. The number of visits to the website of the Revenge Porn Helpline, the government-funded service for adults who have fallen victim to the crime, doubled in the week beginning 23 March. The rise is thought to be driven by the increased use of the internet and social media during the lockdown. Dinenage also said Action Fraud, the UK\u2019s national reporting centre for fraud and cybercrime, had received 1,300 reports related to Covid-19, amounting to \u00a32.8m.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of misleading parliament by suggesting that his top medical and scientific advisers signed off his government\u2019s new \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan. The acting Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, claims the prime minister misled MPs \u201cinadvertently or otherwise\u201d by telling them in a debate in the Commons on Monday that reports that they had not approved the message were \u201cnot right\u201d. Davey has asked Johnson to come back to the chamber to \u201cclear up this discrepancy\u201d and ensure that Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, is clarified so that it is accurate. Davey has written to Johnson about his response to the Guardian\u2019s report on Monday that neither Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, nor Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, had approved the \u201cstay alert\u201d message. Political leaders, scientists and doctors have criticised it as vague and confusing and warned that it could lead to the erosion of public compliance with the lockdown rules. The experts appeared to undermine Johnson\u2019s denial when asked about the report by the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, when they appeared alongside him at a press conference on Monday evening. In the debate about the government\u2019s new plan to ease the lockdown Davey said: \u201cThroughout this crisis, many of us have put party politics aside to support the national effort to defeat coronavirus and we want to keep doing that, not least because the British people have sacrificed so much already, but in return, the government must be clear with the British people and reassure us that ministers are following the science and the advice of independent experts. \u201cSo will the prime minister confirm new reports that neither the chief medical officer nor the chief scientific adviser signed off yesterday\u2019s shift in the public health message from \u2018stay at home\u2019 to \u2018stay alert\u2019?\u201d In reply Johnson said: \u201cThat is not right\u201d. In his letter Davey told Johnson he was \u201cextremely concerned\u201d that his denial appeared to be at odds with what Whitty and Vallance said to Kuenssberg. He reminded the prime minister he had inquired about the \u201cscientific and evidential basis for the change in messaging\u201d when Johnson briefed opposition party leaders by telephone on Sunday, ahead of his televised address that night in which he set out the first steps towards easing the lockdown. In his letter, Davey said: \u201cIt is also why when, having read press reports that the change in public health messaging had not been signed off by either the chief medical officer or the chief scientific officer, that during your statement to the house on Monday I asked you directly about that. In response you refuted these suggestions and stated that those reports were \u2018not right\u2019. \u201cI was therefore extremely concerned to watch at the press conference just hours later both the chief medical officer or the chief scientific officer refuse to confirm they had directly signed off on the new message of \u2018stay alert\u2019 \u2013 seemingly in direct contradiction to your answer to me.\u201d Challenging Johnson to set the record straight, he added: \u201cI think we can both agree that if you have misled parliament, inadvertently or otherwise, that this is incredibly serious. I write to you in the hope that not only can you clear up this discrepancy, but that you attend the house to correct the record at your earliest convenience.\u201d The Guardian approached Downing Street to seek the prime minister\u2019s response to Davey. Asked on Monday about Whitty and Vallance\u2019s role in the change from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d, a government spokesperson, referring to the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage), said: \u201cSage advice fed into the new strategy as it has throughout the Covid-19 response.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The disuniting of the kingdom quickened pace this week, leaving the prime minister in freefall after his incoherent Sunday night speech, while the first minister of the Northern Ireland executive, DUP leader Arlene Foster, joined her Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, and their counterparts in Scotland and Wales in deploying parachutes. No, they said, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/northern-ireland-joins-rejection-boris-johnson-stay-alert-slogan\">would not be changing the message to the public</a> to \u201cstay alert\u201d in response to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. The message from Belfast would remain, \u201cstay at home.\u201d</p> <p>The DUP\u2019s gravitas on the crisis had been embarrassingly undermined when one of its MLAs was <a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/pictured-dup-mla-alex-easton-caught-shoe-shopping-during-health-committee-39188621.html\">spotted shopping online for shoes</a> during a crucial meeting of the health committee last week. (He apologised.) But Foster and O\u2019Neill landed quite gracefully in the assembly chamber at Stormont on Tuesday where they delivered an agreed and detailed schedule for emerging from lockdown, with no set dates, and a proviso that the current rate of infection would have to reduce significantly before they would proceed with any changes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/northern-ireland-joins-rejection-boris-johnson-stay-alert-slogan\">Northern Ireland joins in rejection of Boris Johnson's 'stay alert' slogan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Foster did try to blur her abandonment of the DUP\u2019s formerly rigid adherence to its traditional stance that Northern Ireland is British and will behave accordingly. There would be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus/arlene-foster-says-there-may-be-slight-differences-to-easing-lockdown-measures-across-uk-39194309.html\">slight differences</a>\u201d, she said. Northern Ireland\u2019s moves would be \u201cnuanced\u201d. But there can be no doubting the symbolic significance of what has happened. Even the staunchest of unionists can no longer follow a blundering leader willing to risk committing his people to disaster while <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-52620312/coronavirus-johnson-on-good-solid-british-common-sense\">chundering on</a> about \u201cgood solid British common sense\u201d.</p> <p>The SDLP leader, Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, put it bluntly. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan was \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/columeastwood/status/1259480156722298880\">nonsense\u201d</a>, he said. Eastwood is from Derry, on the border with the Irish Republic. His constituents include some of the most disadvantaged people in the UK. He has been a strong advocate for an all-island approach to Covid-19, for obvious reasons \u2013 not least the irrelevance to a virus of a political boundary. However, the DUP has rejected this out of hand. While the Republic has largely followed the health guidance offered by the World Health Organization, Northern Ireland has taken its advice from the British government. The Ulster Unionist health minister, Robin Swann, spoke of \u201cthe science that is applicable to Northern Ireland\u201d as if different science works 100 miles down the road. While the Republic of Ireland ramped up community testing, albeit inadequately, Northern Ireland dropped it, along with contact tracing, and is still failing to provide reliable statistics. Though national comparisons are difficult, the per capita death rate from coronavirus in the Irish Republic remains significantly lower than the UK\u2019s.</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in is, clearly, an all-Ireland party, but its attitude to this debate is complicated: the party did exceptionally well in the the February elections in Ireland but has been shunned by the other big parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, who refuse even to discuss going into government with Sinn F\u00e9in, even though both support the power-sharing arrangements in the North. This hypocrisy, and its position in opposition, means that Sinn F\u00e9in will not willingly praise any actions in the crisis by taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and his caretaker government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/13/uk-coronavirus-live-millions-health-conditions-return-to-work-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates\">UK coronavirus live: Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson at PMQs of failure to protect care homes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the early days of the pandemic, the newly restored Northern Ireland executive looked precarious when Sinn F\u00e9in broke ranks and advocated for the shutdown of schools in line with Dublin \u2013 while the DUP stuck with London\u2019s initial policy of keeping them open. There have been other rocky moments. But they have had to rub along, however uncomfortably.</p> <p>Both parties know that they suffered at the polls in the last Westminster elections because of public anger at their failure to deal with the crisis in Northern Ireland\u2019s health services, which led to nurses going on strike. It was a DUP health minister who introduced cuts to wages which left Northern Irish nurses worse off than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Some were on zero-hour contracts, some were relying on foodbanks. Along with other austerity measures this led to staff shortages and curtailed services. As the NHS in Northern Ireland entered the Covid-19 crisis it was described by health unions as unsafe for patients.</p> <p>Last year, speaking about Johnson\u2019s Brexit machinations, Foster said her party had been obliged to send the prime minister \u201cto the naughty step\u201d. <strong> </strong>We must be grateful that in this infinitely worse situation, she has belatedly realised that Johnson neither understands nor cares about Northern Ireland. She and O\u2019Neill, finally presenting a convincingly united front, have taken an important step towards protecting their people from the mortal threat this indifference represents.</p> <p>\u2022 Susan McKay is an Irish writer and journalist<br><br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "The disuniting of the kingdom quickened pace this week, leaving the prime minister in freefall after his incoherent Sunday night speech, while the first minister of the Northern Ireland executive, DUP leader Arlene Foster, joined her Sinn F\u00e9in deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, and their counterparts in Scotland and Wales in deploying parachutes. No, they said, they would not be changing the message to the public to \u201cstay alert\u201d in response to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. The message from Belfast would remain, \u201cstay at home.\u201d The DUP\u2019s gravitas on the crisis had been embarrassingly undermined when one of its MLAs was spotted shopping online for shoes during a crucial meeting of the health committee last week. (He apologised.) But Foster and O\u2019Neill landed quite gracefully in the assembly chamber at Stormont on Tuesday where they delivered an agreed and detailed schedule for emerging from lockdown, with no set dates, and a proviso that the current rate of infection would have to reduce significantly before they would proceed with any changes. Foster did try to blur her abandonment of the DUP\u2019s formerly rigid adherence to its traditional stance that Northern Ireland is British and will behave accordingly. There would be \u201cslight differences\u201d, she said. Northern Ireland\u2019s moves would be \u201cnuanced\u201d. But there can be no doubting the symbolic significance of what has happened. Even the staunchest of unionists can no longer follow a blundering leader willing to risk committing his people to disaster while chundering on about \u201cgood solid British common sense\u201d. The SDLP leader, Foyle MP Colum Eastwood, put it bluntly. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan was \u201cnonsense\u201d, he said. Eastwood is from Derry, on the border with the Irish Republic. His constituents include some of the most disadvantaged people in the UK. He has been a strong advocate for an all-island approach to Covid-19, for obvious reasons \u2013 not least the irrelevance to a virus of a political boundary. However, the DUP has rejected this out of hand. While the Republic has largely followed the health guidance offered by the World Health Organization, Northern Ireland has taken its advice from the British government. The Ulster Unionist health minister, Robin Swann, spoke of \u201cthe science that is applicable to Northern Ireland\u201d as if different science works 100 miles down the road. While the Republic of Ireland ramped up community testing, albeit inadequately, Northern Ireland dropped it, along with contact tracing, and is still failing to provide reliable statistics. Though national comparisons are difficult, the per capita death rate from coronavirus in the Irish Republic remains significantly lower than the UK\u2019s. Sinn F\u00e9in is, clearly, an all-Ireland party, but its attitude to this debate is complicated: the party did exceptionally well in the the February elections in Ireland but has been shunned by the other big parties, Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il, who refuse even to discuss going into government with Sinn F\u00e9in, even though both support the power-sharing arrangements in the North. This hypocrisy, and its position in opposition, means that Sinn F\u00e9in will not willingly praise any actions in the crisis by taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, and his caretaker government. In the early days of the pandemic, the newly restored Northern Ireland executive looked precarious when Sinn F\u00e9in broke ranks and advocated for the shutdown of schools in line with Dublin \u2013 while the DUP stuck with London\u2019s initial policy of keeping them open. There have been other rocky moments. But they have had to rub along, however uncomfortably. Both parties know that they suffered at the polls in the last Westminster elections because of public anger at their failure to deal with the crisis in Northern Ireland\u2019s health services, which led to nurses going on strike. It was a DUP health minister who introduced cuts to wages which left Northern Irish nurses worse off than their counterparts in the rest of the UK. Some were on zero-hour contracts, some were relying on foodbanks. Along with other austerity measures this led to staff shortages and curtailed services. As the NHS in Northern Ireland entered the Covid-19 crisis it was described by health unions as unsafe for patients. Last year, speaking about Johnson\u2019s Brexit machinations, Foster said her party had been obliged to send the prime minister \u201cto the naughty step\u201d. We must be grateful that in this infinitely worse situation, she has belatedly realised that Johnson neither understands nor cares about Northern Ireland. She and O\u2019Neill, finally presenting a convincingly united front, have taken an important step towards protecting their people from the mortal threat this indifference represents. \u2022 Susan McKay is an Irish writer and journalist",

And if you look at what\u2019s gone on, and if you look at, now, all of this information that\u2019s being released \u2013 and from what I understand, that\u2019s only the beginning \u2013 some terrible things happened, and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, but, what exactly is Obamagate? Apart from the most terribly terrible thing that disgracefully disgraced this country a long, long time ago, in ways that should never, ever, happen to anyone. Oh no.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be seeing what\u2019s going on over the next \u2013 over the coming weeks,\u201d he continued, like the all-seeing, all-knowing troll he truly is. \u201cBut I \u2013 and I wish you\u2019d write honestly about it, but unfortunately, you choose not to do so.\u201d</p> <p>This cruel, cruel world is so unjust.

You should skip over this rag, too.</p> <p>There\u2019s always the Epoch Times (motto: \u201cTruth and Tradition\u201d) of course. But frankly you need to go to a really trusted news source like One America News, Trump\u2019s new best friend in news, since Fox News turned <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/13/forced-choose-between-trump-fox-who-would-presidents-base-pick/\">weird</a> by asking questions about all its geriatric viewers dying from the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cWatching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FoxNews\">@FoxNews</a> on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time,\u201d tweeted our commander-in-chief in the middle of the pandemic. \u201cWe now have some great alternatives, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OANN\">@OANN</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Thank goodness he can watch the TV at weekends without totally wasting everyone\u2019s time.

You can\u2019t say one thing publicly and another thing privately.</p> <p>Now there are some people who fear this kind of game is going to lead to something desperate, like indicting a former president or his senior aides.

But he worries about the health effects of having to work, at times, closely with colleagues.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey were good at getting us sanitiser and gloves, and I would mostly have worn a mask anyway. We\u2019re all kitted out,\u201d says Fisher, who receives most of his work through Pimlico Plumbers. \u201cI\u2019ve not yet had to go in to anyone\u2019s house who I know has coronavirus. But I\u2019ve found everyone is very good at keeping a social distance; they open the door and then stand back and then go into another room.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat is a bit more difficult is that you have to work at times in close proximity with another guy. There is no way really of getting around that. If it\u2019s an installation, as I\u2019m doing today, it\u2019s a two-man job. But what we\u2019ve done is to make sure we buddy up with just one other person. I\u2019ve seen more of that guy than I\u2019ve seen of my family.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fisher has a wife and three daughters who he says have been ultra-cautious throughout the crisis. \u201cI almost get fumigated when I get home in the evening. My wife and my daughters have not been out of the house whatsoever. They are extremely cautious. Luckily we have a good-sized garden.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fisher\u2019s wife trained as a school teacher, so home schooling for their eight-, nine- and 11-year-olds has been less onerous than for others. He reckons it has been toughest on his eldest daughter, who will now go on to secondary school missing her last two terms at primary.</p> \n<p>There have been a few crumbs of comfort; he\u2019s felt good standing by Pimlico\u2019s pledge to not charge for emergency work for NHS frontline workers. Meanwhile, the roads are \u201cmassively empty\u201d compared with before the crisis, even if numbers have picked up a bit in recent weeks. \u201cI\u2019m probably saving around half an hour or three quarters an hour a day just because there\u2019s no traffic. And the traffic wardens seem to be OK about us too.\u201d <strong>Patrick Collinson</strong></p> \n<h2>Young person</h2> \n<p>Jess Popkin spent her 21st birthday in lockdown, like millions of other young people, unable to celebrate the usual milestones of life.

He says measures announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to support businesses during the crisis \u2013 such as the rates cut and delay on VAT payments \u2013 have been helpful.

That\u2019s why creating a robust business and ensuring you have a contingency plan in place is a good thing.\u201d Woodward believes the government is doing the right thing by focusing financial support on smaller businesses and those on lower incomes. He claims the chancellor offered enough for high earners in the budget, such as the pension tax change aimed at doctors, and thinks more needs to be done to protect those really struggling in these times, now and in the future. \u201cI do worry that there is not a real safety net for people who are struggling more and we should all as a country make sure there is help in place for them.\u201d MJ Pensioner Evelyn Morgan returned to her home in Kendal, Cumbria, from a trip to Ireland on Friday 13 March, expecting to return to work as a carer for people with disabilities on the Monday. After becoming ill with flu-like symptoms on the Sunday, she feared the worst and told her client she was self-isolating for a week. As events unfolded, the 70-year-old was told by her GP to stay at home and not return to work. But despite her age placing her at greater risk should she contract Covid-19, she was informed she could return to her job if she felt \u201ccomfortable\u201d. The mother of three and grandmother of eight felt conflicted, but knew the right thing to do was to stay at home and stay safe. But because she is paid per hour on a shift by shift basis, this meant losing a major source of income: \u00a3502.69 a month. She has been receiving about \u00a3400 a month in statutory sick pay \u2013 paid from day one as the government promised for anyone self-isolating \u2013 but she knows her annual entitlement will end soon and then she will only be left with her state pension (now \u00a3600 a month) to live on. Morgan feels frustrated there is not more to support older key workers who cannot be furloughed and are not eligible for any other benefits. \u201cI thought, I\u2019m in the vulnerable category and must stay at home, so will get furloughed in order to do that \u2013 but no, it seems I can\u2019t. I feel like there are a lot of people like me who are falling through the cracks on this,\u201d she says. Thankfully, she\u2019s found herself saving money on luxuries such as eating out, going to the cinema or meeting friends for a coffee. Morgan also says she has enjoyed spending more time at home and believes it could be a stepping stone to retirement. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice now not having to get up and struggle to get across town to work,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t want to do nothing. I do massage and Alexander technique and these are things that I love doing and would like to continue with instead. It might be a way of weaning myself off paid work and instead pursuing my own interests and passions a bit more.\u201d MJ",

      "bodyText": "A federal judge has put the justice department\u2019s decision to dismiss a criminal case against Michael Flynn, Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, on hold \u2013 opening the door for legal experts and other outside parties to oppose the administration\u2019s motion to exonerate Flynn of lying to the FBI. Judge Emmet Sullivan\u2019s order is the latest development in the high-profile case, which has led critics, including Barack Obama and hundreds of former FBI and justice department officials, to question whether William Barr, the attorney general, was orchestrating favors for Trump. Flynn, a retired general and a close Trump ally, pleaded guilty to a felony charge amid the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 US election. The former administration official was charged with lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador to the US during the presidential transition period. In exchange for leniency, Flynn cooperated with Mueller\u2019s investigation as part of his plea agreement. But Flynn sought to change his plea while awaiting sentencing, as the president floated the idea of a pardon. The justice department said last week that the FBI had had no basis to question him, and federal prosecutors asked Sullivan to throw out their case against Flynn. None of the line prosecutors supervising the case signed the motion and one withdrew from the case. When Flynn was forced from the White House, Vice-President Mike Pence said he was disappointed the national security adviser had misled him about his talks with the Russian ambassador. President Donald Trump called the deception unacceptable. Now Pence says he would welcome Flynn back to the administration, calling him a \u201cpatriot\u201d, as Trump pronounces him exonerated. And the DoJ\u2019s move to dismiss the criminal case against Flynn marks another step in his transformation, in the eyes of Trump and his allies, from rogue adviser to victim of runaway law enforcement. The dismissal rewrites the narrative of the case that Trump\u2019s own justice department had advanced for the last three years in a way that former law enforcement officials say downplays the legitimate national security concerns they believe Flynn posed and the consequences of the lies he pleaded guilty to telling. It\u2019s been swept up in a broader push by Trump and his Republican allies to reframe the Russia investigation as a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to sabotage his administration, setting the stage for a fresh onslaught of election year attacks on past and present Democratic officials and law enforcement leaders. \u201cHis goal is that by the end of this, you\u2019re just not really sure what happened and at some gut level enough Americans say, \u2018It\u2019s kind of messy,\u2019\u201d said the Princeton University presidential historian Julian Zelizer. Scrambling to manage the coronavirus crisis and economic crash, Trump has been eager to shift the focus elsewhere. He has repeatedly called Flynn \u201cexonerated\u201d and pushed the development as evidence of what he deemed \u201cObamagate\u201d, an allegation the previous administration tried to undermine him during the presidential transition. Though lawyers for Flynn asked Sullivan to immediately toss out the charges, following the DoJ\u2019s move, Sullivan said he wanted to hear more arguments. \u201cGiven the posture of the case,\u201d he said, he expected that many outside parties would want to weigh in. Sullivan has questioned Flynn in court before. During a 2018 hearing, he rejected a motion supported by the administration for probation, telling Flynn: \u201cArguably, you sold your country out.\u201d Flynn\u2019s defense team said Sullivan\u2019s order on Tuesday was prompted by a filing from a group that called itself \u201cWatergate prosecutors\u201d that questioned the justice department\u2019s actions and suggested that political influence was at play. Disputing the order, Flynn\u2019s defense lawyer Sidney Powell and her co-counsel wrote in a court filing: \u201cThere is no place for third parties to meddle in the dispute, and certainly not to usurp the role of the government\u2019s counsel. \u201cThis travesty of justice has already consumed three or more years of an innocent man\u2019s life \u2013 and that of his entire family,\u201d Powell wrote. \u201cNo further delay should be tolerated.\u201d In a leaked web talk, Obama reportedly said the \u201crule of law is at risk\u201d because the justice department dropped charges against Flynn. The chair of the House judiciary committee, Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, called the decision \u201coutrageous\u201d and said he intended to call Barr to testify about the handling of the case. \u201cWe do not believe this case should have been brought, we are correcting that and we certainly hope that in the interest of true justice, that the judge ultimately agrees and drops the case against Gen Flynn,\u201d said Kerri Kupec, a justice department spokeswoman, in an interview Fox News on Tuesday evening. The justice department did not immediately respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. Trump has increasingly lashed out in the year since Robert Mueller\u2019s report did not exonerate the president but also did not accuse him of a crime or allege a criminal conspiracy between his campaign and Russia. The acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell, declassified a list of names of Obama officials who reportedly asked for Flynn\u2019s identity to be un-redacted in intelligence documents. Republicans have generated a \u201cthick fog of propaganda,\u201d said the Democratic representative Jamie Raskin. \u201cTrump and his enablers in Congress have a strategy of never admitting anything and always going on the attack,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>As Boris Johnson finished his televised address on Sunday evening, many viewers were confused by what he had just said. One thing about his message, though, had been strikingly clear. To the surprise of many of those watching, and perhaps even to Johnson himself, it turned out that the coronavirus outbreak has changed the prime minister of the United Kingdom into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/northern-ireland-joins-rejection-boris-johnson-stay-alert-slogan\">the prime minister of England</a>.</p> <p>Over the past two months we have all become familiar with the fact that Covid-19 wreaks its most powerful effects on those individuals who are said to suffer from \u201cserious underlying conditions\u201d.

One thing about his message, though, had been strikingly clear. To the surprise of many of those watching, and perhaps even to Johnson himself, it turned out that the coronavirus outbreak has changed the prime minister of the United Kingdom into the prime minister of England. Over the past two months we have all become familiar with the fact that Covid-19 wreaks its most powerful effects on those individuals who are said to suffer from \u201cserious underlying conditions\u201d. What is only just becoming clear is that the virus can have a similarly destructive effect on nation states and societies which suffer from their own serious underlying conditions too.

In a tricky series of exchanges in the Commons, Starmer put Johnson under intense pressure to explain the extent of care home deaths. Johnson also declined to say why the government had stopped publishing daily international comparisons of Covid-19 deaths now the UK had the highest number of fatalities in Europe and the second highest in the world. Opening his questioning, Starmer noted new figures indicating that 40% of all UK coronavirus deaths had taken place in care homes, and he asked why it was that until 12 March the main government advice was that it remained \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that people in care homes could be affected. \u201cDoes the prime minister accept that the government was too slow to protect people in care homes?\u201d the Labour leader asked. Johnson said: \u201cNo, and it wasn\u2019t true that the advice said that. Actually, we brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown. And what we\u2019ve seen is a concerted action plan to tackle what has unquestionably been an appalling epidemic in care homes.\u201d Johnson said it was \u201cabsolutely true that the number of casualties has been too high\u201d, but he insisted the government was reversing the trend on deaths in care homes. Starmer responded: \u201cI\u2019m surprised the prime minister queries the advice of his own government up to 12 March.\u201d Labour later published a link to a government web page on Covid-19 advice to the care sector, which says it was \u201cvery unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected\u201d. The page says the advice was withdrawn on 13 March. Starmer asked Johnson whether he agreed with the reported view of a hospital doctor that government policy had \u201cseeded\u201d the epidemic in care homes by transferring Covid-19 patients from hospitals. Johnson said discharges into care settings went down in March and April and that testing had been done. Pressing the prime minister about official death statistics released on Tuesday, Starmer asked him to explain why there appeared to be 10,000 more deaths than average in April, even beyond those officially attributed to the virus. He said: \u201cNow I know the government must have looked into this. So can the prime minister give us the government\u2019s views on these unexplained deaths?\u201d Johnson did not reply to the question, saying only that Covid-19 was \u201can appalling disease which afflicts some groups far more than others\u201d.

Given this, I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record and to recognise that this was official government guidance regarding care homes.\u201d During PMQs, Starmer also asked why a chart showing worldwide death comparisons had been dropped from Tuesday\u2019s daily No 10 press conference. Johnson replied that seeking such comparisons was \u201cpremature because the correct and final way of making these comparisons will be when we have all the excess death totals for all the relevant countries.\u201d He urged Starmer to \u201ccontain his impatience\u201d. Starmer said: \u201cThe problem with the prime minister\u2019s answer is it\u2019s pretty obvious that for seven weeks when we weren\u2019t the highest number in Europe they were used for comparison purposes, but as soon as we hit that unenviable place they were dropped.\u201d No 10 refused to accept that Johnson had been wrong about the guidance, and declined Starmer\u2019s call for the prime minister to correct the record in parliament.

      "bodyText": "The European parliament will discuss Hungary\u2019s controversial coronavirus laws on Thursday, the latest showdown between Brussels and Budapest over rule of law under Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. In late March Hungary\u2019s parliament gave Orb\u00e1n the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting coronavirus. The law was criticised for failing to include a sunset clause to give clear time limit to the state of emergency and for introducing potential jail sentences for people who spread false information, which in recent days has led to raids on individuals criticising the government on Facebook. The one-hour debate in Brussels will have no formal consequences but is likely to deepen antagonism between the Orb\u00e1n government and the European parliament, which in September 2018 triggered a sanctions procedure against Hungary. The EU has struggled to come up with a robust response to Hungary\u2019s coronavirus legislation. An initial statement warning against excessive measures did not even include the word \u201cHungary\u201d, leading to Hungary itself eagerly adding its signature in support. Hungarian government officials have branded Thursday\u2019s hearing a \u201clynching\u201d and a \u201cwitchhunt\u201d, and Orb\u00e1n has said he is too busy to attend. \u201cIt\u2019s leftists and liberals playing politics when the continent is facing one of the greatest health and economic crises we\u2019ve seen in a century,\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Orb\u00e1n has offered to send his justice minister, Judit Varga, to speak in his place, but the suggestion was rebuffed by David Sassoli, the parliament\u2019s president, who said only the president or prime minister could address the hearing. A parliament official told the Guardian that the Hungarian government would not be represented in the debate. \u201cHe [Orb\u00e1n] declined the invitation, and for us the case is closed.\u201d It is not clear what will happen if Varga travels to Brussels anyway. The European commission vice-president V\u0115ra Jourov\u00e1 will take part. The Czech politician caused delight among pro-government commentators in Budapest when she was reported as saying there was nothing of concern in the Hungarian laws, but in an interview over the weekend she denied making the comments and called the laws \u201cvery disturbing\u201d. In response, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s spokesman said her remarks in the interview were \u201cunbecoming of a commissioner\u201d. Independent journalists have criticised the measures in the law introducing potential jail terms of up to five years for spreading false information, saying it will make gathering and disseminating reliable reporting on coronavirus in Hungary even harder. The government has insisted the move is justified and no different to legislation on spreading fake news in other countries. However, in recent days police have used it in a number of cases that have provoked criticism. On Tuesday police arrived at dawn with a search warrant at the home of a 64-year-old man in the town of Szerencs who had posted a Facebook status criticising the government\u2019s coronavirus response and called Orb\u00e1n a \u201ccruel tyrant\u201d.

Others say pushing through the measures was less about a power grab and more a demonstrative show of resolve. Over a decade as prime minister, Orb\u00e1n has eroded checks and balances, and he did not require additional legislation to augment his already considerable power.

Its cast was absolutely top notch. Who\u2019s to say the same won\u2019t be the case here? If nothing else, you\u2019d have to imagine that Hardy is lining himself up to play Magwitch, which would be extremely watchable. But even if this new Great Expectations ends up a disappointment, at least we can take two important things from it. First, this is Great Expectations \u2013 if you don\u2019t like this adaptation, then another one will be along in a couple of years. And, second, if Knight is writing this, then it means he isn\u2019t currently writing any more episodes of See on Apple TV+. That alone has to be worth something.",

      "bodyText": "Train unions have said they could take industrial action and stop trains if drivers and passengers are not protected from coronavirus, after photos emerged of packed London Underground services as many people returned to work following seven weeks of lockdown. Transport for London indicated that the number of commuters remained relatively low at 63,000 on Wednesday morning, up 7% on the previous day. Photos taken at Finsbury Park station on the Victoria line showed commuters \u2013 mostly men \u2013 standing inches apart in carriage door wells with few wearing masks. Men have died from coronavirus at twice the rate of women in England and Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. As the first lockdown relaxation came into place the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said Boris Johnson\u2019s return to work message was \u201cfraught with danger\u201d. Mick Cash, the general secretary, said strike action could be necessary to \u201cprotect workers and passengers\u201d, adding that staff would be entitled to refuse to work if they did not feel safe. \u201cIf that\u2019s what needs to be to keep people safe then we will stop trains,\u201d he told Sky News. Despite an appeal by TfL for passengers to wear face coverings on public transport, it appeared that few were doing so. Tube workers also said there was a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d during the suspension of part of the Victoria Line after reports that a passenger had collapsed. \u201cSocial distancing during the peak was a joke. During the suspension our carriages were heaving. It will get worse,\u201d said one worker.

Some photos, for example one taken at Liverpool Street station, one of the busiest interchanges for commuters from Essex and east London, showed some people were able to adhere to physical distancing. Some buses in the capital were reported to be busier than normal following the prime minister\u2019s message that people should return to work if possible from Wednesday. The Automobile Association said the roads in England, the only country in the UK where the relaxations apply, were about 10% busier on Wednesday. TfL said on Monday it would have to reduce passenger numbers to 13-15% of normal levels to achieve physical distancing of two metres. With daily numbers last April of nearly 4 million, that would mean limiting the number of people using the network to get to work to as few as 600,000. It said passenger numbers up to 10am on Wednesday were 7.3% higher than the same day last week but were still a fraction of the normal level. Just over 63,000 passengers travelled between 7am and 10am, compared with more than 1 million at the same time this time last year. In its plan for the capital published on Monday, TfL urged people to stay at home, only go to work if it is essential, and to wear face coverings on the network. Johnson said in his address to the nation on Sunday that those unable to work from home should start returning to work from Wednesday, but urged people to avoid public transport and to drive, cycle or walk. Unions say this is not a viable option for many in the capital who do not have a car and live too far away from their place of work to cycle or walk. TfL is progressively increasing the frequency of trains to reverse the reduction in services during lockdown, with a view to operating at 70% of normal capacity by next Monday. It will also reopen some of the 37 stations it closed, but it said these would not include lift-only stations because it would be impossible to maintain safe distances.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIn the war against any infectious virus,\u201d says Dr Alan McOwan, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to win various battles. You have to keep clobbering it from every direction you can.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s true for coronavirus, he says, as well as for other viral conditions. An HIV specialist at London\u2019s 56 Dean Street sexual health clinic, McOwan sees similarities between Covid-19 and HIV. Both are viruses without a working vaccine, you can be infectious without knowing it, and both rely mostly on close human contact to spread.</p> <p>McOwan and his colleagues are not only interested in comparing the two viruses, but also in examining their interplay. Because while the spread of all infectious diseases, Covid included, is slowed by physical distancing, sexual health specialists believe the unique set of circumstances lockdown has created offers an unprecedented opportunity in the decades-long fight against HIV too.</p> <p>Since the run-up to the lockdown, clinicians at 56 Dean Street have closely monitored their new cases of gonorrhoea and prescriptions written for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), a treatment which, if taken within 72 hours of exposure to HIV, can stop the virus taking hold. On both fronts they have seen sharp declines.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose these two markers as they are things people would tend to not put off coming in for,\u201d says McOwan. \u201cIf you have gonorrhoea in your penis, it feels like you\u2019re peeing razor blades and you may have discharge within four to seven days. To be effective, PEP needs to be taken quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Their findings confirmed what health professionals nationwide had predicted: through complying with measures to physically distance, the public are having less \u201crisky\u201d unprotected sex with new partners. This alone has helped slow the rate of HIV transmission, but a prolonged period of sexual inactivity in Britain has other benefits in the attempt to slow new cases of HIV.</p> <p>People are most infectious in the earlier stages of contracting HIV, and therefore more likely to pass it on. Ordinarily, the viral load of HIV-positive people not on treatment is counted in the tens of thousands, while the figure for one patient of McOwan\u2019s who had recently contacted HIV was 520bn. \u201cAs very few people right now have recently caught HIV,\u201d says McOwan. \u201cThere are far fewer of those very infectious people around.\u201d</p> <p>Having already lasted seven weeks, the lockdown also mitigates one of the biggest challenges usually facing sexual health clinicians: it can take up to a month from potential exposure to HIV for current tests to return a definitive result. \u201cIf nobody has had sex which has put them at an HIV risk for at least four weeks,\u201d says McOwan, \u201cthere will be nobody in this blindspot who might otherwise be missed.\u201d</p> <p>When taking regular treatment, people who are HIV positive have an undetectable viral load and therefore cannot pass on the infection. New HIV infections had already been dropping nationally, in part because the NHS is increasing public access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a drug taken by HIV-negative people before and after sex that reduces the risk of getting HIV. In 2012, there were an estimated 2,800 new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men in the UK. In 2018 the figure was down to 800, a 71% fall.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can now find the remaining people with HIV through testing and put them on treatment,\u201d says McOwan, \u201cwe could remove anyone who is infectious from the population with long-lasting effects. We won\u2019t get this two-month window of no sex again.\u201d</p> <p>Similar successes could also be seen in other locked-down countries where testing and treatment is widely accessible. The New Zealand Aids Foundation has already contacted Dean Street, asking permission to replicate its campaign. This is an opportunity, McOwan says, that he and his colleagues are determined to \u201cgrab by the balls\u201d.</p> <p>Alongside the Terrence Higgins Trust and other organisations in the sector, the Dean Street team have been working to encourage anyone who might have been exposed to HIV since their last check-up to get tested before the lockdown is lifted. Their social media posts explaining how this period could \u201cbreak the chain\u201d have been their most ever shared.</p> <p>But this effort can only succeed if patients can access HIV testing before resuming normal sexual activity. Sexual health services are commissioned by local authorities rather than NHS England nationally, which means access to different testing methods depends on where a patient lives. Online, postal testing isn\u2019t always routinely available in all areas, and coronavirus has seen many standard face-to-face sexual health services closed while resources are redeployed.</p> <p>The results of a <a href=\"https://members.bashh.org/Documents/COVID-19/BASHH%20COVID-19%20Clinical%20Thermometer%20Survey%20-%20First%20Round%20Results%20Snapshot%20.pdf\">survey</a> conducted by the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, published in early April, found a quarter of responding medical practitioners could not offer patients access to online HIV testing. Over half reported having under 20% of their standard capacity to deliver face-to-face HIV services.</p> <p>\u201cWhere it\u2019s available online, postal testing has ramped up,\u201d says Dr Michael Brady, a consultant in sexual health and HIV at King\u2019s College Hospital, and medical director of the Terrence Higgins Trust. \u201cIn London, and in many other parts of the country, we have really good online testing services with capacity, but it\u2019s not uniform. There will be places which don\u2019t offer online testing or have a restrictive number of tests available, and there\u2019ll be a problem if in those places face-to-face services haven\u2019t yet opened up.\u201d</p> <p>While some clinics remain closed, many NHS trusts adapted their HIV testing to introduce online services and have informed frontline healthcare workers, but some have not. When the Guardian contacted a clinic within the Northumbria NHS trust to ask whether routine HIV testing was available, it was told that this would not currently be possible in person or online.

Many years ago, Granny Fiver gave us a clip round the ear and bundled us on to a bus up to his despair-filled farm on a \u201cDiscipline Day\u201d. It was sheep-dip season, a time when wide-eyed lambs were shoved into a bath of disinfectant that no human would dare touch in order to maintain their market value. Despite their protestations, Get Orf My Land Fiver joyfully booted his recently sheared and scared witless stock into the murky brew, cackling like a gammon-faced loon as he pictured all the cash he\u2019d be able to shove into the pockets of his mustard corduroys when his sanitised product was considered saleable.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/13/safety-consultant-warns-premier-league-must-put-lives-before-money\">Safety consultant warns Premier League must put lives before money</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s a scene we were reminded of as we read reports of the protocols the Premier League will put in place in order to get the first phase of team training under way next Monday. The English top flight\u2019s flock of players will be chased down from the hills to their club\u2019s sterile training bases, where they will be hoofed by a bleached boot on to disinfected pitches to play football using hosed-down balls, cones, goalposts and corner flags while wearing masks. Physical distancing will be \u201cstrictly observed\u201d at all times, no tackling will be allowed and players will be unable to engage in dressing-room b@ntz or shower afterwards, instead being corralled towards their cars and told to go home immediately. Sounds wild.</p> \n<p>In addition, they will be expected to undergo twice-weekly testing and a daily questionnaire and temperature check. Even if such stringent conditions are observed there is no guarantee that a footballer will be safe. Or a footballer\u2019s family member. Or a staff member. Or \u2026 well you get the picture. But at least there is a massive appetite for football, even if it means treating panicked Premier League footballers like sheep on dipping day to get them to market, right?

Our Land Rover-driving, Barbour jacket-wearing, fox hunting-supporting cousin, Get Orf My Land Fiver, knows a thing or two about how to keep their product clean so people will part with their hard-earned for it. Many years ago, Granny Fiver gave us a clip round the ear and bundled us on to a bus up to his despair-filled farm on a \u201cDiscipline Day\u201d. It was sheep-dip season, a time when wide-eyed lambs were shoved into a bath of disinfectant that no human would dare touch in order to maintain their market value. Despite their protestations, Get Orf My Land Fiver joyfully booted his recently sheared and scared witless stock into the murky brew, cackling like a gammon-faced loon as he pictured all the cash he\u2019d be able to shove into the pockets of his mustard corduroys when his sanitised product was considered saleable. It\u2019s a scene we were reminded of as we read reports of the protocols the Premier League will put in place in order to get the first phase of team training under way next Monday. The English top flight\u2019s flock of players will be chased down from the hills to their club\u2019s sterile training bases, where they will be hoofed by a bleached boot on to disinfected pitches to play football using hosed-down balls, cones, goalposts and corner flags while wearing masks. Physical distancing will be \u201cstrictly observed\u201d at all times, no tackling will be allowed and players will be unable to engage in dressing-room b@ntz or shower afterwards, instead being corralled towards their cars and told to go home immediately. Sounds wild. In addition, they will be expected to undergo twice-weekly testing and a daily questionnaire and temperature check. Even if such stringent conditions are observed there is no guarantee that a footballer will be safe. Or a footballer\u2019s family member. Or a staff member. Or \u2026 well you get the picture. But at least there is a massive appetite for football, even if it means treating panicked Premier League footballers like sheep on dipping day to get them to market, right? Oh.

      "body": "<p><strong>How many children are being infected with Covid-19?<br></strong>Children represent just a small fraction of confirmed Covid-19 cases, with fewer than 2% of reported infections in China, Italy and the United States being in people under 18 years old and with under-18s accounted for fewer than 2% of <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042v1.full.pdf\">hospital admissions with Covid-19 in the UK</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Does this mean children are less susceptible?<br></strong>There is now a wealth of evidence that children generally experience milder symptoms when they are infected \u2013 although there have been rare cases of children becoming seriously ill or even dying. However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programmes, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travellers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30287-5/fulltext\">the Lancet Infectious Diseases</a>, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than ten were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing.</p> \n<p><strong>Why do children react differently to adults?<br></strong>For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern \u2013 even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children\u2019s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children\u2019s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus \u2013 mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Are children invisible transmitters?<br></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-most-infections-spread-by-people-yet-to-show-symptoms-scientists\">Asymptomatic transmission</a> is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea.

      "bodyText": "How many children are being infected with Covid-19? Children represent just a small fraction of confirmed Covid-19 cases, with fewer than 2% of reported infections in China, Italy and the United States being in people under 18 years old and with under-18s accounted for fewer than 2% of hospital admissions with Covid-19 in the UK. Does this mean children are less susceptible? There is now a wealth of evidence that children generally experience milder symptoms when they are infected \u2013 although there have been rare cases of children becoming seriously ill or even dying. However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programmes, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travellers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections. Studies on this question give a mixed picture. One analysis, in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, of households with confirmed Covid-19 in Shenzhen, China, found that children younger than ten were just as likely as adults to get infected. However, there is other evidence from South Korea, Italy and Iceland suggesting lower infection rates among children. Some of the difference could also be down to differences in social mixing. Why do children react differently to adults? For many infectious diseases, there is a U-shaped risk curve, with the youngest and oldest in society being most vulnerable. Covid-19 does not follow this pattern \u2013 even toddlers and newborn babies typically only experience mild symptoms. One theory is that children\u2019s lungs might contain fewer of the ACE2 receptors that the virus uses to enter cells. To confirm this, researchers would need to study tissue samples from children. Another possibility is that children\u2019s immune systems respond in a more optimal way to the virus \u2013 mounting a strong enough response to get rid of the infection, but without going into overdrive and flooding the body with inflammatory proteins, which are known to sometimes cause problems in adult patients. Are children invisible transmitters? Asymptomatic transmission is known to play an important role in the spread of Covid-19 \u2013 studies have shown that in general people appear to be at their most infectious in the day or so before symptoms start. This raises the question of whether children are silent spreaders of the virus. A recent German study, which compared the viral load of nearly 4,000 people aged from one to 100 years old, added weight to this idea. It found that regardless of age, people appeared to shed a similar level of virus, suggesting they could be equally infectious. However, a caveat is that the study did not measure real-life transmission in children. As schools reopen and community transmission is tracked closely in some European countries, a clearer answer on this is likely to emerge in the coming months.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected.

It\u2019s not pretty; in fact, it\u2019s ugly. It\u2019s doing an important job \u2013 it\u2019s healing and containing the wound. The best thing you can do with a scab is be patient and let it fall off. Unfortunately, there are some impatient people who want to dig their tiny orange fingernails into the scab and rip it off early and eat it.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while that would feel good for like a second, if you rip off the scab and the wound is still bleeding under there, you have to start all over again with a new scab,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cSo what Dr Fauci is saying is the same thing your mother said: don\u2019t pick the scab.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/12/jimmy-kimmel-trump-twitter-feud-trevor-noah-stephen-colbert-seth-meyers\">Jimmy Kimmel on Trump Twitter feud: 'This is the dumbest time to be alive'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, leadership at Fox News, \u201cthe little engine behind the back to work movement\u201d, according to Kimmel, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/12/media/fox-news-work-from-home-reliable-sources/index.html\">decided to keep their New York offices closed</a> through at least 15 June. \u201cIsn\u2019t that something?

      "bodyText": "Jimmy Kimmel Despite Trump\u2019s declaration Monday that the US has \u201cprevailed\u201d over coronavirus, infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci warned Congress in a televised hearing on Tuesday that reopening the country too soon would lead to \u201cneedless suffering and death\u201d, which \u201cI think is Trump\u2019s new campaign slogan,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel. \u201cFauci and Trump seem to have opposite views of how to handle this \u2013 Trump says \u2018we have prevailed!\u2019 on the same day everyone at the White House was required to wear a mask,\u201d he added. \u201cSo I guess it just comes down to who you believe: the doctor who\u2019s one of the world\u2019s leading experts on infectious disease, or our personal pan-president.\u201d To convey the stakes of reopening the country too soon \u2013 which, Fauci warned, could also hamper economic recovery \u2013 Kimmel used the metaphor of a scab, \u201ca big, black scab on our nation\u2019s face. It\u2019s not pretty; in fact, it\u2019s ugly. It\u2019s doing an important job \u2013 it\u2019s healing and containing the wound. The best thing you can do with a scab is be patient and let it fall off. Unfortunately, there are some impatient people who want to dig their tiny orange fingernails into the scab and rip it off early and eat it. \u201cAnd while that would feel good for like a second, if you rip off the scab and the wound is still bleeding under there, you have to start all over again with a new scab,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cSo what Dr Fauci is saying is the same thing your mother said: don\u2019t pick the scab.\u201d Meanwhile, leadership at Fox News, \u201cthe little engine behind the back to work movement\u201d, according to Kimmel, decided to keep their New York offices closed through at least 15 June. \u201cIsn\u2019t that something? Fox News, the ones who are making fun of people cowering at home, is advising its employees to stay home,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cBecause apparently, they don\u2019t get their news from Fox News.\u201d Finally, Kimmel touched on Trump\u2019s new distraction technique of \u201cObamagate\u201d, a vague, made-up scandal he has propagated since Yahoo News leaked remarks by the former president criticizing Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus as a chaotic disaster. In an interview with Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called Obama\u2019s critique of the administration \u201cclassless\u201d. \u201cWait \u2026 Obama is classless?\u201d exclaimed Kimmel. \u201cHe\u2019s joking \u2013 of all the wildly hypocritical things anyone has ever said about anything during this ordeal, the idea that Obama is classless and shouldn\u2019t say bad things about another president \u2013 that might take the cake.\u201d Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also addressed Trump\u2019s made-up \u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy theory \u2013 or, at least, tried to discern what it\u2019s supposed to be about.

      "body": "<p>A coalition of nine unions representing hundreds of thousands of teachers, school leaders and support staff have accused the government of a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about the dangers of coronavirus spreading within schools and to the wider community.</p> <p>In a joint statement they called on ministers to step back from plans for a phased reopening schools in England beginning on 1 June and said classrooms of four- and five-year-olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission.</p> <p>However, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warned against \u201cscaremongering\u201d and insisted a return to school was \u201cthe most sensible action\u201d. He said he was considering proposals to open summer schools run by volunteers to help disadvantaged children catch up on missed lessons.</p> <p>School leaders have complained that they were not consulted over the return date, which they say is too soon, or the decision to bring back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/11/headteachers-raise-concerns-over-reopening-of-english-primary-schools\">reception, year 1 and year 6 first</a>.</p> <p>Relations between unions and ministers have deteriorated, with some leaders calling on members <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/plans-to-reopen-schools-on-1-june-in-jeopardy-as-education-unions-tell-staff-not-to-engage-with-prepartions-1\">not to engage</a> with any planning for a 1 June reopening, but the latest statement stressed that unions wanted to work with the government to ensure a safe return.</p> <p>\u201cWe all want schools to reopen, but that should only happen when it is safe to do so,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government is showing a lack of understanding about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus within schools and outwards from schools to parents, sibling and relatives, and to the wider community.\u201d</p> <p>The statement, signed by the National Education Union, the National Association of Headteachers, NASUWT, GMB, Unison and Unite among others, also raised concerns that school staff working with young children would \u201cuniquely\u201d not be protected by the same two-metre social distancing rules required in other workplaces.</p> <p>Guidance issued this week by the Department for Education appeared to acknowledge the challenges of imposing strict physical distancing rules on children and recommended classes of no more than 15 children and staggered school days to limit the risks of transmission.</p> <p>\u201cFifteen children in a class, combined with their very young age, means that classrooms of four- and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread,\u201d the union statement said. \u201cWhile we know that children generally have mild symptoms, we do not know enough about whether they can transmit the disease to adults. We do not think that the government should be posing this level of risk to our society.\u201d</p> <p>Williamson attended the House of Commons to respond to an urgent question tabled by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, and he defended the government\u2019s course of action.</p> <p>Moran asked: \u201cGiven we still don\u2019t know about transmissibility between children, can the secretary of state reassure us that these decisions are solely based on public health? To what extent has getting parents back to work been the main driver?\u201d</p> <p>Williamson responded: \u201cWe continue to follow the best medical and scientific advice and believe that this phased return is the most sensible course of action to take.

      "bodyText": "A coalition of nine unions representing hundreds of thousands of teachers, school leaders and support staff have accused the government of a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about the dangers of coronavirus spreading within schools and to the wider community. In a joint statement they called on ministers to step back from plans for a phased reopening schools in England beginning on 1 June and said classrooms of four- and five-year-olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission. However, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, warned against \u201cscaremongering\u201d and insisted a return to school was \u201cthe most sensible action\u201d. He said he was considering proposals to open summer schools run by volunteers to help disadvantaged children catch up on missed lessons. School leaders have complained that they were not consulted over the return date, which they say is too soon, or the decision to bring back reception, year 1 and year 6 first. Relations between unions and ministers have deteriorated, with some leaders calling on members not to engage with any planning for a 1 June reopening, but the latest statement stressed that unions wanted to work with the government to ensure a safe return. \u201cWe all want schools to reopen, but that should only happen when it is safe to do so,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe government is showing a lack of understanding about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus within schools and outwards from schools to parents, sibling and relatives, and to the wider community.\u201d The statement, signed by the National Education Union, the National Association of Headteachers, NASUWT, GMB, Unison and Unite among others, also raised concerns that school staff working with young children would \u201cuniquely\u201d not be protected by the same two-metre social distancing rules required in other workplaces. Guidance issued this week by the Department for Education appeared to acknowledge the challenges of imposing strict physical distancing rules on children and recommended classes of no more than 15 children and staggered school days to limit the risks of transmission. \u201cFifteen children in a class, combined with their very young age, means that classrooms of four- and five-year olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread,\u201d the union statement said. \u201cWhile we know that children generally have mild symptoms, we do not know enough about whether they can transmit the disease to adults. We do not think that the government should be posing this level of risk to our society.\u201d Williamson attended the House of Commons to respond to an urgent question tabled by the Liberal Democrats\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, and he defended the government\u2019s course of action. Moran asked: \u201cGiven we still don\u2019t know about transmissibility between children, can the secretary of state reassure us that these decisions are solely based on public health? To what extent has getting parents back to work been the main driver?\u201d Williamson responded: \u201cWe continue to follow the best medical and scientific advice and believe that this phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. I know that this will be challenging, but I know that nursery, school and college staff will do everything in their power to start welcoming back to continue their education.\u201d He said the government would make its scientific advice available, though he did not specify when, and he insisted the government\u2019s focus was on children\u2019s education. \u201cWe all know the best place for children to be educated and to learn is in school, and it has always been my intention to get more of them back there as soon as the scientific advice allows.\u201d Williamson said he was \u201cvery closely looking\u201d at a suggestion from Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, of summer schools for children left behind during recent weeks. Halfon suggested these could be staffed by \u201cvolunteers, graduates, an army of retired teachers\u201d. Williamson replied: \u201cWe\u2019re very much looking at how we can mobilise that.\u201d Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow education secretary, called on Williamson to change the emphasis of the Department for Education\u2019s guidance so that instead of expecting schools to open, it would, \u201cask schools to meet certain conditions that, when met, would signal it was time to open\u201d. Schools in the UK have been closed since mid-March to all but the children of critical workers and those classed as vulnerable. Only a small number of those pupils have been attending, with the bulk of learning taking place at home and online.

Avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt. The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes.</p> \n   <p>These businesses are a principal source of job creation\u2014something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work.

      "bodyText": "And finally.... European stock markets have closed sharply lower amid anxiety over the economic damage of Covid-19, and what may be still to come. All the main indices ended in the red, with the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 dropping 2% to its lowest close in seven sessions. FTSE 100: down 90 points or 1.5% at 5904 German DAX: down 272 points or 2.5% at 10,546 French CAC: down 127 points or 2.8% at 4,344 In London, cruise operator Carnival (-10.7%) led the fallers, followed by engineering group Melrose (-9%), Intercontinental Hotels (-8.6%) and jet engine maker Rolls-Royce (-7.5%). They\u2019ll all struggle if the coronavirus pandemic continues to hit economies and curtail the much-desired return to normality. Risers including pharmaceuticals group Hikma (+3%) and online grocer Ocado (+2%, to a fresh record high). Among smaller companies, Aston Martin tumbled 15.9% to a new record low after reporting a large loss and a big drop in sales. Shares closed below 32p, having floated at \u00a36 in October 2018. The news that Britain\u2019s economy had suffered its worst monthly slump on record dampened the mood in the City, especially with so many economists predicting that much more damage ahead. Wall Street traders are in the doldrums too, after Fed chair Jerome Powell warned that a \u2018prolonged recession\u2019 is a threat. Powell\u2019s reluctance to consider negative interest rates has also hit stocks (the Dow is now down 485 points or 2%). Investors would like to see even more monetary easing, especially given the risk of further Covid-19 infections as economies reopen. Here\u2019s our news story and analysis on today\u2019s GDP data: Goodnight. GW A copy of Jay Powell\u2019s speech is online here. Stocks are weakening in London as the closing bell approaches, pushing the FTSE 100 down by 1.5% or 95 points today to just below 5,900..... Brazil\u2019s economy is also facing a rough recession this year: Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been widely criticised for downplaying the severity of Covid-19 -- but both the death toll (now over 10,000) and the GDP data will tell their own story. The key message from Jerome Powell today is that \u201cadditional policy measures\u201d may be needed from the US central bank and fiscal authorities to prevent Covid-19 causing greater long-term economic damage. Speaking today (see earlier post) The Federal Reserve chair said: \u201cWe ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes, and that may require additional policy measures. At the Fed, we will continue to use our tools to their fullest until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is well under way.\u201d But stocks are down, and the US dollar is up, as investors grow more fretful. City firms won\u2019t be forcing their staff back to the office anytime, despite the recent easing of the lockdown. Financial News reports that several top investment banks have told staff to keep working from home for some time. They say: The UK government\u2019s plans to ease lockdown restrictions may have caused confusion and criticism, but some of the world\u2019s largest investment banks have a clear message to their City employees \u2014 stay at home. According to internal memos seen by Financial News and people familiar with the matter, banks including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have told employees that their current remote working arrangements, which have forced them to radically overhaul their staff base, will remain in place for the foreseeable future. Others including Barclays and Deutsche Bank will ask a small proportion of staff to return in the coming weeks. Here\u2019s the full piece: Goldman Sachs, Citi, HSBC among banks telling staff to stay at home This does make sense -- maintaining physical distancing on a trading floor, or a skyscraper, will be tough (no more crowing into the lifts, for starters). And the City does appear to have coped with remote working quite well (some investors seem to be enjoying more time with the family, and new hobbies like baking and beard-growing) Today\u2019s UK GDP report shows that the Covid-19 pandemic will cause a much more severe downturn than the financial crisis 12 years ago, writes my colleague Richard Partington: While the crash after the collapse of Lehman Brothers was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence, the early evidence from the Office for National Statistics for the first quarter of 2020 shows Covid-19 will easily eclipse the last crisis. And the worst damage is yet to come. Almost no aspect of the economy was unaffected in March. Britain broke all records for a monthly decline in gross domestic product, just two weeks of restrictions needed to drastically alter the economic landscape. All three major drivers of growth \u2013 services, manufacturing and construction \u2013 went into reverse. Here\u2019s his analysis: The pound just slipped to a one-month low, as today\u2019s dire growth figures weigh on the City. Sterling is down 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.2232, for the first time since early April. It\u2019s down a similar amount against the euro, to \u20ac1.127. Economic consultancy Fathom have sent over these charts, showing how the slump in growth in March was as sharp as the entire 2008-09 recession: Jay Powell has also revealed just how badly poorer Americans are suffering from the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown: Powell\u2019s warning of a possible \u2018prolonged\u2019 US recession, and reluctance to consider negative interest rates, has hit the markets. Wall Street has opened in the red, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 218 points or 0.9% at 23,546. Jerome Powell also says the Fed isn\u2019t considering cutting interest rates below zero. According to CNBC he told the Peterson event that: \u201cI know there are fans of the policy, but for now it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re considering \u201cWe think we have a good toolkit and that\u2019s the one that we will be using.\u201d Those fans seem to include president Donald Trump. He tweeted yesterday that the US should accept the \u201cgift\u201d of negative rates, if other countries are already doing so [in the eurozone, there\u2019s a negative rate on bank deposits at the ECB to encourage lending]. America\u2019s top central banker has warned of the risk of a \u2018prolonged recession\u2019, if companies cannot survive the downturn. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, told the Peterson Institute for International Economics that the coronavirus has left \u201ca devastating human and economic toll in its wake\u201d. He cited last week\u2019s record-breaking surge in US unemployment..... The scope and speed of this downturn are without modern precedent, significantly worse than any recession since World War II. We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased. Since the pandemic arrived in force just two months ago, more than 20 million people have lost their jobs. ... before warning that the crisis could cause long-term economic damage that won\u2019t simply go away when the pandemic ends, painting a grim picture of a \u2018prolonged recession\u2019: The record shows that deeper and longer recessions can leave behind lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy. Avoidable household and business insolvencies can weigh on growth for years to come. Long stretches of unemployment can damage or end workers\u2019 careers as their skills lose value and professional networks dry up, and leave families in greater debt. The loss of thousands of small- and medium-sized businesses across the country would destroy the life\u2019s work and family legacy of many business and community leaders and limit the strength of the recovery when it comes. These businesses are a principal source of job creation\u2014something we will sorely need as people seek to return to work. A prolonged recession and weak recovery could also discourage business investment and expansion, further limiting the resurgence of jobs as well as the growth of capital stock and the pace of technological advancement. The result could be an extended period of low productivity growth and stagnant incomes. In conclusion, Powell also warns that while the Fed can lend money to help companies keep afloat, only politicians can agree fiscal measures to help the economy: Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery. This tradeoff is one for our elected representatives, who wield powers of taxation and spending. Back in the UK, the NIESR thinktank has predicted Britain\u2019s economy could shrink by nearly a third in the current quarter. That would far outstrip anything seen in recent decades (the ONS\u2019s quarterly GDP time series goes back to 1955, and shows that Q1 1974 was the worst quarter with a 2.7% drop) Having analysed today\u2019s GDP report, IERS says: The ONS preliminary estimates suggest that growth declined by 2.0 per cent in the first quarter of 2020, broadly consistent with what we suggested it could be last month. The substantive contraction in growth reflects negative contributions across all the headline sectors. Output declined by 5.8 per cent in March itself, mainly due to record falls in construction and services. The latest ONS estimates are preliminary and largely uncertain but continues to suggest GDP is around 25 per cent smaller when the lockdown is in place. In light of the preliminary release, we forecast growth in the second quarter to decline sharply by about 25 to 30 per cent. Over in America, the prices charged by companies for their wares has tumbled in another sign that the global economy is weakening fast. The US Producer Price Index (PPI) fell by 1.3% in April, driven by a 3.3% tumble in prices for goods. That\u2019s the biggest fall sine the index began in 2009. Core PPI (which strips out food, energy and trade services) fell by 0.9% during April (again, the biggest on record). It was 0.3% lower than a year ago -- the first annual fall in US core PPI inflation ever. It means companies were forced to slash prices at an unprecedented rate in an attempt to spur demand (partly driven by the slump in energy prices). Reuters has more details about IATA\u2019s warning that air travel won\u2019t recover for at least three years, and maybe longer: Airline passenger traffic is not expected to return to pre-crisis levels until 2023 at the earliest and may suffer even more if new health rules impose an excessive cost burden, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. \u201cCovid\u2019s effects on air travel are certainly going to last a number of years with no quick rebound to 2019 levels,\u201d the global airline body\u2019s Chief Economist Brian Pearce said. A likely demand shift towards shorter flights will mean growth in traffic measured in revenue passenger kilometres trails behind passenger numbers, Pearce also said. IATA, which represents the world\u2019s airlines, has warned it doesn\u2019t expect passenger numbers to return to their 2019 levels until 2023. Chief economist Brian Pearce fears that air travel will take longer to recover than the general economy, given fears that it could spread Covid-19 between countries. The prospect of tax rises and spending cuts to fund the UK\u2019s \u00a3300bn Covid-19 bill hasn\u2019t gone down well with some in the City. Bill Blain, market strategist at Shard Capital argues forcibly that the government should look to grow its way out of the crisis, not inflict more austerity. Having seen today\u2019s Daily Telegraph, he writes: The Treasury plan looks a tad premature\u2026 We are still in immediate crisis mode. They are also utterly misguided. The virus is the smoking gun pointed at the heart of the $90 trillion global economy. It\u2019s bad. There is blood and gore everywhere. Just how bad we don\u2019t yet know, but it\u2019s clear of we don\u2019t choose the right policies/treatments to address the deepening economic catastrophe, then we\u2019re doomed. Blain continues: The growth reality is simple. Every single corporate on the planet is going to figure out the outlook. If they are watching and listening to governments rein in spending too early and institute austerity spending, then they will predict and prepare for deeper recession. If every corporate is cutting investment plans, reducing headcount, and instituting cost controls \u2013 then the economic effect is inevitable; rising unemployment and an ongoing demand shock. This is the time to be spending our way out the Coronavirus recession. It doesn\u2019t all have to be negative. Losing our God-given-right to an exotic beach holiday every year spells a massive boost to staycations! (Why did I not buy that cottage in Rock last year!!) It\u2019s going to change, not end, the way we do business. Redirecting the resources currently employed in aerospace towards renewables and new tech will take time \u2013 but is possible. Time is the critical ingredient we need to re-order the economy. If there isn\u2019t a vaccine soon, the border will remain closed and global trade will wither. Protectionism and the growing China/US cold war will deepen. Get used to a new normal economy. The government would argue that it is trying to limit economic damage through gradually easing its lockdown this week, so that people who can\u2019t work from home return to work. But even here there is confusion, as Mike Hampson, CEO of Bishopsgate Financial, writes: We need to get the economy going again but the chaotic nature of the government messaging on how this is going to happen is a real problem. They need to get a grip on a clear message for business, and other sectors as to what they can do and how they can safely restart operations. The slump in UK GDP is likely to be followed by a spike in unemployment. Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has plotted together the UK unemployment rate and his measure of the UK output gap* based on today\u2019s data. And it\u2019s bad news.... The output gap (output relative to potential) is now already as bad as it was during the peak of the 2009 crisis. In fact, my quantitative estimates suggest that unemployment might have already reached a 4.1% jobless rate in 2020 Q1 (official figures are due next week). Since the 2020 Q2 GDP figure will be much worse, it is extremely likely that UK unemployment might reach double figures by summer\u2026 And all this despite the job retention scheme... [* - for economists in the room, he\u2019s used 3 statistical trend filters: a Quadratic trend filter, a Hodrick-Prescott filter and a Band-pass filter] Investors are now paying for the privilege of holding some UK government debt. Economist Shaun Richards has flagged up that the yield on two-year British gilts fell to -0.04% this morning. Yields (or the interest rate on the bond) move inversely to prices, so a negative bond yield means you\u2019d be guaranteed a small loss if you held it until maturity. Low bond yields are a sign that investors are worried about growth and inflation prospects, and looking for a safe place for their money. It also suggests they expect the Bank of England to ease monetary policy soon by expanding its bond-buying QE programme. Deputy governor Ben Broadbent hinted as much yesterday. This stunning chart from the ONS shows how Britain\u2019s services sector suffered the worst slump on record in March: Services output fell by 6.2%, the largest monthly fall since records began in January 1997. Several sectors suffered their largest falls on record, including accommodation and food services (down 31%), and transportation and storage (down 13). Film and TV production declined by 18.5% while personal services (such as hairdressers and dry cleaning) declined by 24.8%. But the computer programming industry grew by 1.5%. The ONS says this was: ...driven by large businesses and with responder-led evidence suggesting that \u201cthere was a high demand for IT equipment such as desktops and laptops\u201d because of the increase in home working. However, small businesses did experience a fall during March. Production output slumped by 4.2%, which the ONS says was the worst fall since the Winter of Discontent in 1979 . But there were bright spots --including 13.0% increase in production of industrial gases, inorganics or fertilisers, which is the third-strongest growth since records began. This appears to be driven by strong demand for chemicals used in disinfectants and hand sanitisers. And the paper industry had a record-breaking month, thanks to stockpiling: Monthly growth for the paper and paper products industry of 11.3% has never been stronger, underpinned by the \u201cpanic buying\u201d of products such as toilet roll, kitchen roll and facial tissues. Eurozone factories also had a torrid March, with widespread shutdown hurting the industry. New data today shows that industrial production across the euro area slumped by over 11%, a record low - and nearly three times as bad as any single month in the financial crisis. Production of \u2018durable consumer goods\u2019 (ie TV sets, kitchen appliances or cars) slumped by 26% during the month. Capital goods (heavy-duty machinery and equipment) fell by 15.9% compared with February. But non-durable goods (ie food and drink) only fell by 1.6% - propped up by strong demand as people stocked up. The Observer\u2019s economics editor, Phillip Inman, tackled the subject of debt and austerity last weekend. This anticipated today\u2019s concerns that a huge deficit in public spending this year would trigger a traditional Treasury response of higher taxes, cuts to welfare payments and state services. He says higher levels of debt can be maintained in the post-Covid world following a steep fall in interest rates that is not likely to reverse for more than a decade or two. With almost every developed world country experiencing a dramatic increase in debt, lenders seeking a safe haven will have nowhere to go. Here\u2019s the piece: Economist Rupert Seggins has helpfully plotted the Q1 growth figures from major economies, showing that the UK is in a mid-table spot: Keen gardeners have seized the opportunity to return to garden centres as they reopened in England this morning. Between 30 and 40 customers queued outside Chessington Garden Centre in Surrey before it reopened at 9am this morning. Shoppers filled the trolleys with bright plants, hanging baskets and compost, with many saying they wanted to bring some colour to their pots and gardens. Being allowed to reopen is a \u201crelief\u201d for managing director Jolyon Martin, although he says they have already lost 30% of their annual turnover - having been forced to close during almost two months of their peak sales season. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also warned that UK is \u201cvery likely\u201d entering a deep recession this year. And once the Covid-19 downturn is over, the UK will have to decide how it pays the bill. Today\u2019s Daily Telegraph reports that tax rises or a public sector wage freeze are being considered as options that might be needed to help the government cover the cost of the coronavirus crisis. This raises the dire prospect of another bout of austerity... but Sunak insists it\u2019s \u2018premature\u2019 to think about it. Transport secretary Grant Shapps has also played this down, saying: In terms of payment, we\u2019ll have to have future budgets, we\u2019ll get to that, but right now we are still in the midst of this thing and we\u2019re clear that we\u2019re not going to go back to world of austerity in order to do that. Our main UK Covid-19 liveblog has all the details: It\u2019s worth noting that Britain\u2019s borrowing costs are near record lows at present. The UK can borrow for 30 years at just 0.8% per year -- so there\u2019s plenty of appetite for gilts. The Covid-19 recession is forcing Europe\u2019s largest travel company, TUI, to cut 8,000 jobs: Economists don\u2019t agree on everything. But the universal consensus is that today\u2019s grim UK GDP figures are only a taster for what\u2019s ahead of us. Stefan Koopman, senior market economist at Rabobank, fears Britain will suffer a U-shaped recover, with a \u2018double-digit\u2019 slump in the April-June quarter: \u201cThe UK\u2019s economic engine will be much harder to kickstart than it was to stall, as illustrated by the latest raft of data releases. Talk of a V-shaped recovery feels like wishful thinking and we expect prolonged periods of depressed growth across the majority of the economy. A flatter, U-shaped recovery is more likely. \u201cDouble-digit declines in GDP growth will follow for the second quarter and the full year, but forecasts for beyond that horizon are near-impossible to predict. The risk of a second lockdown should another outbreak occur combined with rock-bottom levels of consumer confidence make for a potent mix of issues for businesses to deal with.\u201d Hugh Gimber, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, fears the economy won\u2019t recover from the Covid-19 shock until 2022: \u201cWhile economic activity should improve from the second half of this year, it still appears that a rebound is likely to be very gradual, and one that leaves GDP levels at the end of 2021 below where they finished 2019.\u201d Artur Baluszynski, head of research at investment managers Henderson Rowe, points out that other European countries fared even worse as they had tougher lockdowns (as explained earlier). \u201cThe numbers are really bad, especially considering that the lockdown only started mid-March. One of the reasons why the -2% figure is better than expected is because the real impairment of the consumer demand is likely to show up in April numbers. However, we can now see how the UK\u2019s more relaxed lockdown measures helped the economy to fare better than France or Spain which contracted close to 6% over the same period. But this doesn\u2019t mean that the UK economy will spring back unharmed, explains Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management: \u201cThe economic damage from roughly only a week of lockdown is striking. Activity growth in April will be much worse. \u201cAs social distancing is eased, we will probably see a strong initial bounce in activity. However, there isn\u2019t a straightforward trade-off between social distancing and activity. \u201cUntil businesses and households are confident that the virus poses little danger to lives and livelihoods, the recovery is likely to lag and activity levels will struggle to return to pre-crisis norms.\u201d Here\u2019s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today\u2019s grim UK growth figures: A record monthly plunge in activity meant the UK economy contracted by 2% in the first quarter of 2020, according to official figures. Data from the Office for National Statistics revealed the immediate impact of the coronavirus lockdown, producing an unprecedented decline in output in March and the sharpest three-month contraction since the depths of the financial crisis in late 2008. Although restrictions on businesses and individuals were only introduced in mid-March, the ONS said it was enough to cause a 5.8% plunge in activity in March. All three main components of growth, services, production and construction, were affected by the fallout from the global pandemic \u2013 with factories, shops, restaurants, hotels and building sites all closed on government orders. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said: \u201cMarch\u2019s GDP figures showed the UK economy was already in freefall within two weeks of the lockdown going into effect. And with the restrictions in place until mid-May and then only lifted very slightly, April will be far worse.\u201d Service sector output \u2013 which accounts four-fifths of GDP \u2013 declined by more than 6% in March, while production fell by 4.2% and construction by 5.9%. Over the year to the first quarter of this year, the economy grew smaller by 1.6% \u2013 its fastest rate of decline since late 2009. Here\u2019s Larry\u2019s full story: Aston Martin\u2019s losses ballooned to \u00a3119m in the first three months of the year as the coronavirus pandemic caused the already struggling British carmaker\u2019s sales to plunge across the world. The company sold only 578 cars to dealers in the first quarter of 2020, down 45% from the same period in 2019. Sales slumped by 86% in China in the quarter, while they were down by 57% and 30% in the Americas and Europe respectively, despite lockdown conditions not starting in earnest until late March. Lawrence Stroll, Aston Martin\u2019s new billionaire executive chairman after leading a \u00a3536m bailout in March, said he was \u201centhusiastic and confident\u201d about the company, despite \u201csome difficulties\u201d in the short term. The company is now focusing on reducing the number of cars held by dealers, as well as delivering its new DBX SUV, a car whose success is crucial for Aston Martin\u2019s survival. Aston Martin was the last of the large UK carmakers to pause production as the pandemic hit in March. It reopened its new St Athan plant in south Wales on 5 May in order to ramp up to full DBX production in \u201cthe next few weeks\u201d. Deliveries to customers who have pre-ordered are on track to start in the summer. However, the first-quarter figures revealed the strain the company was under before it agreed the bailout, with net debt rising to almost \u00a31bn - 16 times higher than a year\u2019s adjusted operating profitability. Aston Martin will now only build cars to fulfill order demand, and it also suspended its financial guidance for the year. Over in the City, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has fallen by 1.3% in early trading, down 78 points to 5916 points. Other European markets are also in the red, as investors fret about the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 infections as lockdowns are lifted. Yesterday, a key member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus task force warned that reopening the US economy too soon could lead to \u2018really serious\u2019 consequences. Dr Anthony Fauci warned that \u2018little spikes\u2019 in infection could soon turn into fresh outbreaks, forcing lockdown measures to be reimposed. Fauci told US senators that: ..there is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control, which in fact, paradoxically, will set you back \u2014 not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road on trying to get economic recovery Jing Teow, senior economist at PwC, says the outlook for the UK economy is also \u2018highly uncertain\u2019. The government\u2019s announcement that workers in the manufacturing and construction sector should return to work this week where safe, as well as opening the housing market, could mitigate some of the disruption to business activity in the current quarter. However, this will depend on the effectiveness of current lockdown measures in preventing a second wave of infections, which may necessitate the reimposition of these measures later on in the year.\u201d Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, isn\u2019t convinced that Britain will \u2018emerge stronger\u2019 from the lockdown slump, as Rishi Sunak claims. Parikh fears that activity levels among UK firms will remain depressed \u201cfor the foreseeable future\u201d, given the challenge of obeying physical distancing rules: \u201cWhile countless companies have made adjustments with admirable speed, many will find it difficult to operate at anything like normal capacity under social distancing rules. The furlough scheme has undoubtedly staved off redundancies, and the new flexibility provides businesses a better chance of rebooting. \u201cThe Treasury will need to continue innovating to kickstart any recovery. The Government\u2019s loan scheme provided ready cash, but now leaves many firms saddled with debt. Unless this is managed well, it will drag on business investment for long after the lockdown ends.\u201d Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he\u2019s not surprised that the UK economy shrank 2% in the last quarter. Sunak blamed the economic damage caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, adding that his freshly-extended jobs retention scheme should help Britain get through the crisis. He says (via Sky News): In common with pretty much every other economy around the world we\u2019re facing severe impact from the coronavirus. You\u2019re seeing that in the numbers. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the unprecedented action that we have to support people\u2019s jobs, their incomes and livelihoods at this time, and support businesses, so we can get through this period of severe disruption and emerge stronger on the other side. Many other countries suffered worse downturns than the UK in the last quarter, particularly in Europe. And there\u2019s a clear link between the tumble in GDP and the severity of the lockdown measures introduced to combat Covid-19. France, Italy and Spain all moved before the UK, and consequently their economies shrank by more: UK: -2% US: -1.2% Eurozone: -3.8% France: -5.8% Spain: -5.2% Italy: -4.7% China: -9.8% This chart from the ONS plots GDP against a \u2018stringency index\u2019 - and there\u2019s a clear correlation (there\u2019s an interactive version here). This monthly chart of UK growth shows just how dramatically the economy shut down in March, with GDP shrinking by an uprecedented 5.8%. James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, says there is a lot worst to come: \u201cThe lockdown was only in place for seven working days in the first three months of the year. But it was still enough to bring about the biggest quarterly economic contraction since the peak of the financial crisis and the weakest single-month change on record. \u201cWith the country in full or partial lockdown well into the second half of the year, the grim economic milestones hit in the latest data will be shattered next time around. \u201cToday\u2019s figures serve as a reminder as to why a bold economic policy response has been needed. That approach will need to continue as Britain begins the long road out of this economic crisis.\u201d You can read today\u2019s UK GDP reports online, here: GDP first quarterly estimate, UK: January to March 2020 GDP monthly estimate, UK: March 2020 The UK economy wasn\u2019t doing particularly well before the Covid-19 lockdown struck. GDP did rise by 0.1% in January (when there was talk of a post-election \u2018Boris Bounce\u2019), but the economy then contracted by 0.2% in February - as the coronavirus pandemic began to hurt the global economy. But as you can see, the real economy pain struck in March, when GDP shrank by 5.8% - and all sections of the UK economy suffering dramatic declines in activity: The economy was also flat in the last quarter of 2019. March was particularly awful for these sectors of the UK economy: education, which fell by 4.0% as a result of school closures at the end of March wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles, which fell by 10.7%, predominantly driven by a reduction in new car registrations food and beverage service activities, which fell by 7.3% as a result of the closure of bars and restaurants towards the end of March accommodation, which fell by 14.6% as a result of the closure of hotels and campsites in March travel agents, which fell by 23.6% as a result of reduced demand caused by the introduction of travel restrictions in March Most manufacturing sectors also contracted -- with transport equipment-making declining by 20.5% as car factories shut down. But one sector defied the gloom -- the manufacture of basic pharmaceuticals grew by 9.2% (presumably because people were stocking up on medicines and painkillers?) March was a particularly dire month for the economy - with GDP slumping by 5.8%. It\u2019s the worst performance since the ONS started calculating monthly data back in 1997 - so worst than in any single month during the financial crisis. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics, explains: \u201cWith the arrival of the pandemic nearly every aspect of the economy was hit in March, dragging growth to a record monthly fall. \u201cServices and construction saw record declines on the month with education, car sales and restaurants all falling substantially. \u201cAlthough very few industries saw growth, there were some that did including IT support and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, soaps and cleaning products. \u201cThe pandemic also hit trade globally, with UK imports and exports falling over the last couple of months, including a notable drop in imports from China.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector (which makes up around three-quarters of the economy) has suffered its biggest quarterly contraction on record. The Office for National Statistics says: In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, public health restrictions and social distancing measures have been put in place in the UK, leading to a widespread disruption to economic activity. These measures have impacted upon the spending behaviours of consumers as well as how businesses and their employees operate. It has also affected the provision of services provided by government, including health and education. Services output decreased by 1.9% in Quarter 1 (January to March) 2020, the largest quarterly fall since records began. Production output fell by 2.1% in Quarter 1 2020, driven by declines in manufacturing. Construction output decreased by 2.6% in the first quarter. The monthly figures corroborate that these estimates reflect the declines recorded in March 2020, when restrictions were imposed in response to the coronavirus. This chart shows just how sharply the UK economy shrank in the first quarter: But this will, I fear, be dwarfed by the slump in growth in the current quarter. Here are the key points from today\u2019s UK GDP growth report, showing how the economy shank in January-March: UK gross domestic product (GDP) in volume terms was estimated to have fallen by 2.0% in Quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2020, the largest fall since Quarter 4 (Oct to Dec) 2008. When compared with the same quarter a year ago, UK GDP decreased by 1.6% in Quarter 1 2020; the biggest fall since Quarter 4 2009, when it also fell by 1.6%. This release captures the first direct effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the government measures taken to reduce transmission of the virus. There has been a widespread disruption to economic activity, as services output fell by a record 1.9% in Quarter 1; there were also significant contractions in production and construction. Household consumption fell by 1.7% in Quarter 1 2020, the largest contraction since Quarter 4 2008, alongside declines in gross fixed capital formation, government consumption and trade volumes. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We start with some breaking news - the UK economy has suffered its worst contraction since the depths of the financial crisis, as the Covid-19 slump begins. Britain\u2019s Gross Domestic Product shrank by 2.0% in the first three months of 2020, new figures released by the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s the biggest quarterly drop in activity since the fourth quarter of 2008 - after the collapse of Lehman Brothers triggered the financial crisis. In March alone, GDP contracted by 5.8% as the lockdown began, with shops and factory shutting their doors. All sectors of the economy were badly hit. The service sector shrank by 6.2% during March, while manufacturing output fell by 4.6% during the month and construction shrank by 5.9%. Yesterday, chancellor Rishi Sunak warned that the UK recession was \u201calready happening\u201d, as he extended the jobs retention scheme until October. This data shows he was absolutely right. And there is worst to come. Last week the Bank of England suggested that the UK economy might contract by 25% in the April-June quarter, creating the deepest recession in three centuries.

This week the government gave the green light for filming to start again as long as production companies comply with physical-distancing guidelines, promising to work closely with the screen sector in order to \u201cgive confidence\u201d that they can return to sets safely. But British film and TV producers are concerned that the UK is \u201cbehind the curve\u201d on developing guidance that combats the risk of Covid-19 on sets, with some predicting that filming on British-based dramas will not start until September or October at the earliest. Production teams are awaiting new industry-wide guidance on how to work safely on sets from the British Film Commission (BFC), the national agency that has undertaken a consultation process asking figures from across the industry to give their feedback on new safe-working standards. Andrew Eaton, who produced the first two seasons of The Crown and the Formula One film drama Rush, said countries such as Iceland and Sweden, where filming has already restarted, have been better at providing film and TV production teams with clear standards. \u201cIt is real finger-in-the-air stuff at the moment,\u201d said Eaton. \u201cNo one really knows until we start doing this what the practicalities are.

Trials of the NHS contact-tracing app are under way on the Isle of Wight, ahead of a rollout across the rest of the country later this month. The bogus text messages the CTSI has seen appear to have been sent by an official source associated with the app, directing recipients to a website that asks for their personal details. Scammers can then use the information to gain access to bank accounts and commit other forms of identity fraud. Scams related to the coronavirus have increased since March, and Action Fraud reports that fraudsters have stolen more than \u00a32m.

This crisis could be a moment to rethink how work is organised and rewarded, what sort of jobs we need to be done, and how to try to make sure these jobs can provide worthwhile careers. There is no shortage of overpaid \u201cbullshit economy\u201d jobs \u2013 corporate apparatchiks, consultants and City traders. Surely it\u2019s time the true value of people\u2019s contribution to our lives should be recognised. While the government calls for people to be \u201cencouraged\u201d back to work, the extension of its furlough programme to the end of October reveals the truth: it is not yet safe for many people to return. It is not good enough for the comfortably housed and generously paid to order lower-paid workers to expose themselves to unnecessary risk. More progress is needed on reducing coronavirus infection rates before a widescale return to work can be contemplated. Work is a practical matter that involves completing tasks and meeting needs. That is one of the lessons of the past few weeks. We have taken too many people in the workforce for granted for too long, while our leaders have loftily declared economic triumph. General Omar Bradley, commander of US forces at the D-Day landings, said: \u201cAmateurs talk about strategy. Professionals talk about logistics.\u201d The logistics of getting safely to and from work should be what concerns us all now.

The coronavirus pandemic has hit the supply and demand for products across the world leading to a severe decline in world trade, said Unctad, the United Nations organisation that tracks trade flows. Almost every category of goods is expected to suffer a fall in trade over the coming months, adding to a 3% decline in the first quarter of the year. Unctad said the data revealed the huge shock to the global economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. China was the first country to report a decline in trade ahead of a lockdown put in place by the authorities in Beijing in February. The rest of the developed world followed in March when similar lockdowns were announced. Many of China\u2019s factories have opened in the meantime, but reports from the world\u2019s second largest economy show a significant proportion of the country\u2019s industry is still operating at between 60% and 80% of capacity. In recent days local authorities in China have put cities in the country\u2019s north-east back into lockdown and closed some schools for a second time after new Covid-19 infections emerged. Last week the International Monetary Fund warned that a previous forecast for an unprecedented decline in global GDP growth of 3% this year, the worst since the 1930s depression era, was looking optimistic. Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF\u2019s managing director, warned the US and China against rekindling a trade war that could weaken a recovery from the pandemic. The IMF forecast a partial rebound would follow in 2021, but warned outcomes could be far worse, depending on the course of the disease.

Unctad said the drop in global trade was accompanied by a record decrease in commodity prices, which it said had \u201cfallen precipitously since December last year\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The latest wages figures released by the bureau of statistics is one of the last lot of \u201cnormal\u201d data that is relatively unaffected by the coronavirus. As such it serves as a good reminder that even before the virus hit, the economy was stuttering. The March quarter wage price index is the last data that the ABS will release outside of next month\u2019s national accounts that mostly shows little sign of the coronavirus. Wages are \u201csticky\u201d because most workers have six-month or year-long contracts or are in permanent positions covered by multi-year agreements. But even then they do respond to the labour market and so once the impact of the surge in unemployment flows through we are likely to see a steep fall in wages growth. But as it is, wages growth was already falling. The March quarter marked the fifth consecutive quarter where the trend annual growth of private sector wages fell \u2013 this time down from 2.3% in December to 2.2%, while overall wage growth was down to 2.1%: The slow growth came from all sectors \u2013 both private and public workers are experiencing slower wage growth than they were six months or a year ago. If you were trying to argue, as did the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, this week on ABC\u2019s 7.30, that \u201cthe fundamentals of the Australian economy were sound as we went into this crisis\u201d, you would not turn to wages growth for proof. The only industries that had wages growing faster in March this year than they were 12 months earlier were construction, real estate, arts and recreation, and health: It will likely be the last time for a while those industries will see any improvement. Of course the coronavirus has smashed the economy, but these figures do not reflect that \u2013 they just reflect a weak economy with slightly rising unemployment. The 2.1% growth is perfectly in line with what you would expect given the relationship between unemployment and wages growth since 2016: Whereas once an unemployment rate of 5.2% would have seen wages growing at around 3.7%, since the end of 2016 a clear shift has occurred. The 2.1% wages growth is consistent with what we have observed over the past three and a half years. And it remains perfectly consistent with the long-term relationship between underemployment and wages: To get to 3% annual wages growth we would need the underemployment rate to fall to around 7.5% \u2013 a level not seen since 2013, and now not likely to be seen within this decade. At this point we should perhaps pause and say a small eulogy for the wage-growth predictions in December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. They were utterly absurd even then; now they just look sad: The government was predicting wages growing at 3% again by the middle of 2023, despite also suggesting unemployment would not fall below 5%. Yes, Josh Frydenberg would have had you believe that despite the labour market not improving over the next three years, employers would start offering better wage rises. The coronavirus has destroyed these predictions, but it has also given the government an easy excuse. However, let us not be fooled \u2013 the predictions for wages growth and even those for budget surpluses were extremely fanciful and were shown to be so even before the virus shut down the economy. That unemployment and underemployment are now set to soar means wages growth will become somewhat of a secondary issue in the eyes of many. But that does not mean we should forget the role it has \u2013 especially its importance in bolstering household incomes and generating economic growth. Already we are hearing governments talk of the need for austerity and freezing wages of public sector workers including for teachers and nurses. That will only lead to a vicious circle of reduced wages growth in the private sector, lower economic activity and then lower government revenue. We are already about to see wages growth fall off a cliff \u2013 there is no need for the government to give it a push on the way down. The wages data shows we entered this crisis with a weakening labour market, and if that is what the government believes we need to snap back to, then workers are unlikely to see improved wages growth even once the virus is under control. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

<p>\u201cWe saw many people being sold policies they simply could never claim on, and thousands not even knowing what they\u2019d been sold \u2013 lenders and dealers were tricky in bundling the sale of insurance into the sale of loan and some people thought it was compulsory to get approved for the loan,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Asic said the remediation program would be completed

      "bodyText": "The corporate watchdog says it has clawed $160m in compensation out of banks and other lenders who sold useless insurance to more than 434,000 credit card customers and other borrowers. Eleven lenders are about to pay the final tranche to customers they ripped off for eight years by continuing to sell them so-called \u201cjunk insurance\u201d, often using high-pressure tactics, despite being warned in 2011 that there were problems with the products. The institutions making payouts include the big four banks \u2013 ANZ, the Commonwealth Bank, NAB and Westpac \u2013 as well as Bank of Queensland and Bendigo Bank. Controversy over the dodgy products reached a peak in 2018, when the Commonwealth Bank\u2019s Matt Comyn admitted to the banking royal commission that the bank had sold worthless credit card insurance to more than 60,000 customers. The insurance was worthless to the customers because it protected them if they became unemployed, but they were already jobless. Comyn, who was head of retail banking at the time but is now the bank\u2019s chief executive, told the commission he raised the idea of stopping sales of the shonky insurance with then-chief executive Ian Narev only to be told to \u201ctemper your sense of justice\u201d. Australian Securities and Investments Commission deputy chair Karen Chester said the payout showed it was \u201cunfair to consumers and ultimately costly to business to sell junk insurance\u201d. \u201cThere is nothing fair about selling ongoing consumer credit insurance to a 65 year old when eligibility falls away at 66,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is nothing fair about selling insurance with involuntary unemployment cover to an unemployed worker. \u201cThese sales practices were systemic and through Asic\u2019s work, hundreds of thousands of consumers like these ones, have been compensated.\u201d The chief executive of the Consumer Action Law Centre, Gerard Brody, welcomed the payouts. \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that too often banks have put profits ahead of their customers,\u201d he said. He said Calc identified insurance sold as an add-on to credit or other goods and services, such as cars or motorbikes, as a big problem five years ago. \u201cWe saw many people being sold policies they simply could never claim on, and thousands not even knowing what they\u2019d been sold \u2013 lenders and dealers were tricky in bundling the sale of insurance into the sale of loan and some people thought it was compulsory to get approved for the loan,\u201d he said. Asic said the remediation program would be completed \u201cshortly\u201d, when the lenders made a final payment of $32m to 122,000 consumers. Of the 434,000 compensation cases, more than half \u2013 244,000 \u2013 relate to people who were sold policies they were ineligible to claim under or from which they were unlikely to benefit. Some 48,000 customers were the victim of high-pressure or unfair sales tactics, while 57,000 were incorrectly charged. Another 84,000 simply received no or very little value from the product. None of the 11 lenders that have paid compensation are currently offering consumer credit insurance, although it is believed some financial institutions are interested in revitalising the now-moribund market. Asic is believed to be in discussions with lenders about the measures they would need to take to make sure the products were not sold to people who could use them. The regulator banned the use of call centres to sell life and consumer credit insurance in December, and from next April, banks were also to be required to make sure they were selling products to customers who could use them under so-called \u201cdesign and distribution obligations\u201d recommended by the royal commission. Along with other royal commission reforms these are to be pushed back by six months. Brody said legislation specifically banning bundling junk insurance with other products had also been delayed because parliament had not been sitting regularly during the coronavirus crisis. \u201cWe need this reform to pass parliament as soon as possible to prevent this type of scandal occurring again,\u201d he said. \u201cAsic should also use its new design and distribution obligation powers as soon as possible, we\u2019re concerned that this reform has also been delayed due to Covid-19.\u201d Asic is also working on new guidelines telling institutions how to best remediate customers they have hurt. There have been years of bitter behind-the-scenes fights with banks and other finance companies over the terms of remediation programs in which corporate lawyers have tried to narrow the scope of compensation. The endless stoushes have helped drag out the length of time taken to compensate customers, frustrating Asic officers.",

Industry groups the Smart Energy Council and Clean Energy Council hosted online summits on green recovery themes with attendances in the thousands. Speaking at both, Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and setting a path for net zero were overlapping issues that should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/05/australian-businesses-call-for-climate-crisis-and-virus-economic-recovery-to-be-tackled-together\">be dealt with together to boost growth</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Taking measures now to fight the climate crisis is not just a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019.

      "bodyText": "There is a growing case that recovery from the coronavirus offers Australia a chance to succeed where it has failed for more than a decade: to break away from the climate wars and head in a new direction. Here and overseas, the idea of helping jumpstart an economic rebuild after the pandemic-forced shutdown by also tackling the other great existential challenge of the time is gaining currency across the political spectrum. It has been supported not just by climate activists and conservationists, but by industry, banks, energy companies, unions and major investors. Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the International Monetary Fund, articulated the push in late April while addressing the heads of 30 countries at the annual Petersberg Climate Dialogue. She rejected the suggestion that the health crisis and the economic crash caused by the \u201cgreat lockdown\u201d that followed meant steps to fight the climate crisis should be paused. \u201cNothing is further from the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are about to deploy a massive fiscal stimulus which can help us address both crises at the same time. \u201cIf this recovery is to be sustainable \u2013 if our world is to become more resilient \u2013 we must do everything in our power to promote a green recovery. In other words, taking measures now to fight the climate crisis is not just a \u2018nice-to-have\u2019. It is a \u2018must-have\u2019 if we are to leave a better world for our children.\u201d Implicit in Georgieva\u2019s call is that this may be a one-off opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and avoid what scientists warn would be a catastrophe for vast swathes of the planet. Others agree. The German government has called for recovery programs to invest in future-proof jobs that would cut emissions, rather than return to business as usual. Britain has proposed an accelerated take-up of green technologies, saying it could have a profound impact on \u201cour societies\u2019 future sustainability, resilience and, ultimately, wellbeing\u201d. The idea of a green stimulus has been supported by governments in countries as diverse as Pakistan, Portugal, Canada and the United Arab Emirates, backed by major business energy giants including BP and Shell, and promoted by the World Bank, which has published a series of blog posts with detailed suggestions of how to respond. Significant money supports this stance. Global investor groups representing members responsible for more than $55tn in assets warned governments to avoid focusing on short-term, big-emitting projects when backing clean growth, which could create jobs while improving things that have a less obvious monetary value \u2013 such as clean air. Again, the opportunity borne from crisis was central to the message. \u201cThe path we choose in the coming months will have significant ramifications for our global economy and generations to come,\u201d the groups said in a statement. The Paris-based International Energy Agency, sometimes cited by fossil fuel interests as bullish about their future, called on governments to learn from the global financial crisis, when the rebuild that followed brought the sharpest upswing in carbon dioxide emissions ever recorded. The lesson? \u201cMake smart policy decisions that can put emissions into structural decline this decade,\u201d says the agency\u2019s chief executive, Fatih Birol, warning massive stimulus programs considered now would shape infrastructure for decades to come. States lead, federal government drags its feet In Australia, the discussion about a green recovery did not begin as urgently as elsewhere, reflecting perhaps the country\u2019s notoriously difficult climate politics and a media tendency to treat climate as a second-order issue unless it is the subject of a political fight. That began to change last week. Industry groups the Smart Energy Council and Clean Energy Council hosted online summits on green recovery themes with attendances in the thousands. Speaking at both, Innes Willox, the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group, said recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and setting a path for net zero were overlapping issues that should be dealt with together to boost growth. The AIG is among a number of Australian interest groups, research organisations and experts working on what a sustainable rebuild could look like, built on evidence that renewable energy is now the cheapest source to invest in. Just as striking as Willox\u2019s call was that, across the two summits, every state and the ACT was represented either by a premier, energy minister or, in Tasmania\u2019s case, state-owned clean energy agency. Queensland\u2019s Annastacia Palaszczuk spoke about the potential to develop a battery manufacturing industry and claimed green hydrogen resources would eventually surpass the state\u2019s liquefied natural gas exports. South Australia\u2019s energy minister, Dan van Holst Pellekaan, praised his Labor predecessors for helping develop the state into a world leader in renewable energy generation (while taking a swipe at them over cost) and said he hoped the state would run on 100% clean electricity before 2030. Fellow Liberal Matt Kean, from New South Wales, said his government was considering its electricity strategy and net zero plan in the wake of the pandemic to see what measures could be brought forward to support the economy. He said they would be subject to three tests: \u201cWill they deliver decarbonisation? Will they deliver jobs? And will they deliver faster economic growth?\u201d On Thursday, the Tasmanian Liberal government went further, launching a draft renewables energy action plan for reaching 200% renewable energy generation by 2040, a goal that means the creation of a vast clean export industry. The state\u2019s energy minister, Guy Barnett, said the shift to renewable energy was more important than ever in the wake of the pandemic. \u201cAs a result of Covid-19, there are unprecedented challenges facing Australian households and industries. By seizing Tasmania\u2019s immense potential, renewable energy can grow our economy, attract investment, create jobs and support Australia\u2019s transition to renewable supply,\u201d he said. The states have not walked away from previously held positions \u2013 Queensland, for example, quietly announced a support package for the oil and gas industry at the same time that Palaszczuk was making headlines for backing the country\u2019s largest solar farm \u2013 but their emphasis was on the opportunities of a clean future, reflecting that each has a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. The federal government was not represented at either summit, and its emphasis has been in the opposite direction. It supports pumped hydro energy storage projects and green bank the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, but does not have a net zero emissions goal and is promoting a fossil fuel-powered recovery based on gas. The Covid-19 coordination commission, announced by Scott Morrison and headed by the former mining executive Nev Power, appears committed to recommending gas-fired projects and has ignored questions on whether a net zero emissions future consistent with the Paris agreement should be considered.

Data provided by the commissioner to Guardian Australia shows child sexual abuse material reports increased 27% in March and 37% in April 2020. While reports of abuse had been steadily increasing before Covid-19 restrictions, Inman Grant said there was no doubt the pandemic had contributed in part, while raising the risk of children being abused online.</p> <p>\u201cMore disturbing than the stats, perhaps, is that our investigators have also seen increased chat on forums on the dark web from predators talking about how with isolation measures in place, they have greater opportunities to contact children remotely to groom them for sexual exploitation, while others observe that they have more time to abuse children,\u201d a spokeswoman from the eSafety Office said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve picked up other users commenting that Covid-19 is bringing more youth online to platforms such as YouTube, vlog sites, online challenges and Omegle, creating more opportunity to groom them.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for the Australian federal police, which runs the Australian Centre to Counter Child Exploitation, said the organisation regularly saw cases involving children and young people being targeted through social networking, image or video-sharing apps or instant messaging, where offenders encouraged the children to self-produce online exploitation material. The centre\u2019s past six months of data show reports between October 2019 and March 2020 increased by 123% compared with the same period the previous year.</p> <p>\u201cThis increased the average number of reports from 776 report per month to 1,731 reports per month,\u201d the AFP spokesman said.</p> <p>According to research commissioned by the centre, only 52% of parents or carers talked to their children about online safety. \u201cIf you are unsure about an app, game or site, research and review them yourself to understand both the positive and negative aspects,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to make children feel comfortable to approach you or another trusted adult if something isn\u2019t right to help them deal with the issue, rather than the technology. Children may be reluctant to report issues online if they believe they will be punished or have their devices taken away.</p> <p>\u201cSupervision is recommended for younger children as well as encouraging your child to apply critical thinking skills, like questioning suspicious behaviour or \u2018friend\u2019 requests from other users online.\u201d</p> <p>Child abuse crimes were \u201cdevastating for victims and their families\u201d, he said.</p> <p>Jessie Smith (not her real name) is a peer support worker with <a href=\"https://www.partnerspeak.org.au/contact\">PartnerSPEAK</a>, Australia\u2019s only not-for-profit organisation that supports people whose partners have been caught with child abuse material.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nevertheless, 75-year-old Roger Bruce, a theatre manager, was upbeat. \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas,\u201d he said, his trolley laden with colourful hanging baskets and bedding plants. \u201cWe need to bring some colour to our lives.\u201d </p> \n<p>Jonathan Blight from Epsom was buying bulbs, taking advantage of a 50% discount on packets of gladioli and begonias.

      "bodyText": "Paul Manafort, the disgraced former chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, was released from prison on Wednesday and will serve out the rest of his sentence under home confinement. Lawyers for Manafort, who is serving a seven-year sentence for charges that emerged from special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election, had argued their client was at high risk from the coronavirus due to his age and underlying health issues. ABC News, the first to report Manafort\u2019s release, said the 71-year-old was let go from the FCI Loretto prison in Pennsylvania on Wednesday morning. He will be confined to his apartment in northern Virginia. Manafort was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison in March 2019, for convictions including unregistered lobbying, tax fraud, bank fraud and money laundering. He worked for Trump\u2019s election campaign for five months in 2016, including as campaign chair. Manafort\u2019s lawyers wrote to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in April, asking that he be transferred to home confinement for \u201cthe remainder of his sentence or, alternatively, for the duration of the on-going Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. The attorneys wrote that Manafort has \u201chigh blood pressure, liver disease, and respiratory ailments\u201d. In March 2019 Manafort arrived at his sentencing hearing in Washington DC, in a wheelchair, suffering from gout. He has been in custody since June 2018, when a federal judge revoked his bail after Manafort was charged with attempting to influence witness testimony. Manafort later pleaded guilty to a count related to witness tampering. In April the American Civil Liberties Union, in conjunction with several epidemiologists, said jails could cause an extra 99,000 US deaths from coronavirus, owing to overcrowding and only basic levels of sanitation. The Department of Justice (DoJ) issued guidelines in April relating to the release of inmates to home confinement. The DoJ said it would focus on inmates at low or medium-security prisons, prioritizing the release of those who have served half of their sentence, or have 18 months or less left and have served at least 25% of their time. Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, who is serving a three- year prison sentence for crimes including facilitating illegal payments to silence two women who alleged affairs with Trump, is due to be moved to home confinement later this month.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil and Mexico have logged their highest single-day coronavirus death tolls to date, raising fears the pandemic is surging across Latin America amid ambivalent and delayed reactions from the governments of its two most populous countries. In Brazil \u2013 where the president, Jair Bolsonaro, has dismissed the virus as \u201ca little flu\u201d \u2013 the health ministry reported a new grim record of 881 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday night. It has now confirmed 12,461 deaths, the sixth-highest death toll in the world, and 178,214 cases. Mexico also reached a new landmark on Tuesday night, reporting 353 new deaths over the previous 24 hours and 1,997 new confirmed cases. A relatively low number of 108 deaths had been recorded on Monday, sparking hopes that the country was containing the spread because the daily toll had been falling since last week. But the figures from Tuesday renewed concerns about its response and took the number of confirmed cases to 38,324 with 3,926 deaths in total. Bolsonaro, who has shrugged off the pandemic\u2019s increasing death toll, did not comment on the new figures as nurses demonstrated in Bras\u00edlia on Tuesday night for International Nurses Day. On their backs, printed in black, were the names of 109 colleagues who have so far lost their lives to Covid-19. He did, however, tweet his congratulations to nurses \u201cfighting on the frontline\u201d. Although Brazil is the worst-hit country in Latin America \u2013 and has the seventh-highest number of cases in the world \u2013 restrictions on movement have been imposed on just a handful of cities in a country of 211 million people. While most of the country\u2019s 27 governors have criticised Bolsonaro\u2019s stance, none has imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, they have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or left mayors to make those decisions. Alexandre Telles, the president of the state\u2019s doctors union, Sinmed, accused the president of \u201ctotally irresponsible\u201d behaviour over the pandemic. \u201cIt is a posture that disrespects life and the Brazilian population,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see the curve of the disease reducing without us enforcing social distancing measures.\u201d Telles \u2013 who works at Rio\u2019s overloaded Ronaldo Gazolla hospital, which specialises in Covid-19 cases \u2013 said that there were 1,300 patients in the city waiting for hospital beds, many in overcrowded health centres. Yet people are increasingly disobeying social distancing guidelines, either because they have to work or because Bolsonaro has told them to. \u201cRio\u2019s health system was not prepared for this pandemic, in spite of the warning signs,\u201d Telles said. \u201cWe have had days without basic medicine to sedate patients.\u201d On Wednesday, a Brazilian supreme court judge ordered the release of Bolsonaro\u2019s own coronavirus tests. The negative result backed up the president\u2019s previous claim of a clean bill of health, but doubts lingered after it was revealed that the three tests also were carried out nearly two months ago \u2013 since then Bolsonaro has repeatedly flouted social distancing advice and mixed with crowds of supporters and ordinary Brazilians. \ufeff Mexico is also facing a rising death toll \u2013 and questions over its response to the pandemic as the government pushes to reopen the economy. Investigations by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and El Pa\u00eds have all suggested that the government of Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is severely undercounting both cases and deaths. But Mexico has been under pressure from US officials to open businesses \u2013 especially auto plants and export factories along its northern border. On Wednesday, the Mexican president claimed victory, saying: \u201cThe safe-distancing campaign has brought us control \u2013 a flattening of the curve\u201d as his government unveiled plans to relaunch its flagging economy. Construction, mining and car manufacturing will be declared \u201cessential\u201d activities and resume operations on 18 May. On the same day, schools and businesses in areas with low Covid-19 case numbers \u2013 dubbed \u201cmunicipalities of hope\u201d \u2013 will start reopening with the rest of the country projected to reopen on 1 June. \u201cLet\u2019s move toward this new mortality,\u201d said Jorge Alcocer, the health secretary, before correcting himself: \u201cNew normality.\u201d The reopening comes amid persistent fears that its public health response \u2013 which has depended on a disease modeling rather than widespread testing \u2013 has failed to capture the scope of the crisis. \u201cThey won\u2019t recognize that they have deficiencies in their counting and the capture system [for health information] is deficient,\u201d said Xavier Tello, a physician and healthcare consultant. Analysts say Mexico\u2019s Covid-19 statistics must be read with nuance since there is a lag in the reporting of health information: the nightly death toll does not necessarily reflect the number of deaths the previous day. An analysis in the magazine Nexos also cautioned that simply reading the nightly Covid-19 numbers makes it hard to know if the curve is flattening. But Dr Alejandro Mac\u00edas, Mexico\u2019s former flu commissioner, tweeted on Tuesday after the record death toll was announced: \u201cIt\u2019s the largest number until now and shows the we are still on the increase \u2026 It\u2019s likely we haven\u2019t seen the worst. The United States, a country with three times the population, has already registered 20 times more deaths.\u201d Chile\u2019s government announced plans for a compulsory quarantine for the 6.5 million inhabitants of its capital Santiago \u2013 the strictest measures for the country which until now had employed localised lockdowns. The move came after new figures on Wednesday revealed that Chile had logged 2,660 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours \u2013 a 60% increase on the previous day\u2019s figure.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis may have saved the BBC licence fee, the chairman of ITV has said, while the editor of the BBC\u2019s Today programme on Radio 4 said the broadcaster\u2019s coverage had restored its role at the heart of the nation. ITV\u2019s Sir Peter Bazalgette also urged the government to review legislation to force Apple and Amazon to promote public service broadcasters\u2019 content. Speaking at a webinar hosted by Peter Mandelson\u2019s consultancy Global Counsel, Bazalgette said he expected the Conservative party would rethink its threats to the BBC because it has demonstrated how regulated broadcasters deliver the demand for safe, reliable information that unregulated social media cannot meet. He described the Tory aggression towards the BBC as \u201cpriapic\u201d at times, with threats made to its future funding and calls for it to be turned into a subscription service. \u201cI think the value of the BBC particularly \u2026 and the way the nation has relied on it in a crisis, as it has so many times before, will make them [the Conservative party] think again,\u201d Bazalgette said. \u201cI think that licence fee settlement will be, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll go up necessarily, but it should be at a level where it means that the long-term cuts internally \u2026 don\u2019t have to be quite as brutal.\u201d Sarah Sands, the editor of the Today programme, which was boycotted by the Tories after the general election, said the BBC\u2019s place at the heart of the nation had been restored during the past few weeks. More than seven in 10 of the TV audience at that time watched Boris Johnson\u2019s address to the nation on Sunday night, she said. Sands said Conservatives had come back to Today \u201cquickly realising that all the characteristics of the programme which they were complaining about \u2026 too many experts, too many academics and not demotic enough for them, suddenly actually became a great virtue [for them]. So I think it\u2019s had a huge public service role.\u201d Bazalgette said the BBC\u2019s financial position was stronger than that of any other public service broadcaster, with the advertising downturn at its commercial rivals \u201cthe worst in the history of commercial TV\u201d. He said they could return to financial strength as they simultaneously deliver mass audiences that online services cannot, along with \u201cbrand equity\u201d and reputation.

      "bodyText": "On Monday 11 May, Elon Musk attempted to fashion himself into a hero of the anti-public-health movement when he dared authorities to arrest him for restarting production at Tesla\u2019s northern California car plant, in defiance of the local shelter-in-place order. Neither Musk nor anyone else was arrested, but his action placed state and local officials in the difficult position of figuring out whether and how to enforce coronavirus restrictions against a litigious billionaire who is also a major employer. On Tuesday, his cause gained the support of another hot-headed executive with an overactive Twitter account: Donald Trump. \u201cCalifornia should let Tesla &amp; @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\u201d the president tweeted on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt can be done Fast &amp; Safely!\u201d By Tuesday evening, Musk and the local government appeared to have reached a compromise. How did we get here? Here\u2019s a handy timeline of what led up to Musk\u2019s meltdown May: 6 March On the day that global confirmed cases of Covid-19 surpass 100,000, Musk declares on Twitter: \u201cThe coronavirus panic is dumb.\u201d The tweet sets the tone for Musk\u2019s approach toward the deadly pandemic, repeatedly downplaying the risk of the virus and opposing public health measures. 11 March The World Health Organization declares the coronavirus a pandemic. 16 March Six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area become the first locales in the US to order all non-essential businesses to close and require residents to shelter in place. Included in the coordinated public health order is Alameda county, home to Tesla\u2019s only US car factory, in the city of Fremont. Musk emails his employees to say that he plans to continue working, signaling that he does not plan to shut the factory. On Twitter, Musk promotes chloroquine, an unproven treatment for Covid-19 that would become the darling of Fox News and Trump before being largely abandoned amid reports of dangerous cardiac side-effects. 17 March The Alameda county sheriff\u2019s office announces that Tesla is not an essential business and therefore can only maintain \u201cminimum basic operations\u201d under the public health order. Tesla does not comply. 18 March Musk tweets that Tesla will manufacture ventilators \u201cif there is a shortage\u201d. There is no indication that Tesla ever took any steps to do so, though Musk tweets about having a \u201clong engineering discussion\u201d with the medical device maker Medtronic on 21 March. 19 March Under pressure from local officials, Tesla agrees to halt production at its Fremont factory by 23 March \u2013 a week after the public health order. On Twitter, Musk predicts that there will be \u201cprobably close to zero new cases\u201d of Covid-19 in the US by the end of April. He also asserts falsely that children are \u201cessentially immune\u201d to the virus. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, issues a statewide shelter-in-place order. 23 March Production at the Fremont factory stops. 31 March Musk tweets an offer to ship \u201cFDA-approved ventilators\u201d to hospitals. The devices turn out to be BiPap machines, which are commonly used to treat sleep apnea, rather than the much more expensive mechanical ventilators that hospitals use to intubate severely ill patients. Bay Area officials extend their shelter-in-place orders through 3 May. 26 April Musk promotes a YouTube video by two California doctors using misleading statistics to argue against shelter-in-place orders. The video is removed by YouTube for promoting harmful misinformation, and the doctors are \u201cjointly and emphatically condemn[ed]\u201d by the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine. 27 April Bay Area officials again extend their shelter-in-place orders, this time through the end of May. Tesla is forced to call off plans to reopen its plant on 4 May. 28 April Musk adopts the rhetoric of anti-lockdown protesters in a late-night Twitter rant, tweeting, \u201cFREE AMERICA NOW\u201d and \u201cGive people their freedom back!\u201d He also falsely describes the shelter-in-place restrictions as \u201cde facto house arrest\u201d. 29 April Musk unleashes another rant during Tesla\u2019s quarterly earnings call with investors, declaring public health measures \u201cfascist\u201d and demanding: \u201cGive people back their goddamn freedom.\u201d Tesla beats analyst expectations for the quarter, delivering its third straight quarterly profit despite the major coronavirus disruptions. 1 May Another Twitter diatribe by Musk wipes about $13bn off Tesla\u2019s market value, after he declares that he plans to sell \u201calmost all physical possessions\u201d, including his house(s), and then opines that Tesla\u2019s stock price is \u201ctoo high imo\u201d. Tesla\u2019s stock price drops about 9% following the tweets. 4 May Musk\u2019s partner, Claire Boucher, a musician who performs as Grimes, gives birth to the couple\u2019s first child, a son named X \u00c6 A-12. 7 May Newsom announces new rules to allow some non-essential businesses, including some manufacturers, in California to reopen on 8 May. He also says that local rules supersede statewide rules, if they are stricter. 8 May California\u2019s phased reopening begins with some loosening of the statewide shelter-in-place order. 9 May Tesla sues Alameda county, alleging that the county\u2019s continuing shelter-in-place order is unconstitutional. On Twitter, Musk declares that Tesla will \u201cnow move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately\u201d and threatens to stop manufacturing in Fremont. Musk also attacks the local public health officer, Dr Erica Pan, calling her \u201cunelected and ignorant\u201d. County officials say they have been working with Tesla on a safety plan to allow the factory to reopen. 11 May Tesla resumes production at the Fremont factory in defiance of the public health order. Musk tweets, \u201cIf anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\u201d Alameda county officials tell Tesla that it is violating the public health order and say they hope it will \u201ccomply without further enforcement measures\u201d. 12 May Trump tweets in support of Tesla reopening. Musk responds: \u201cThank you!\u201d Late in the evening, Alameda county announces that it has received Tesla\u2019s safety plan and \u201cagreed that Tesla can begin to augment their minimum business operations this week in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week\u201d. The county says it will work with the local police force \u201cto verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing\u201d and that other safety measures are in place. Musk tweets a photo of an ice-cream sundae with the message, \u201cLife should be lived.\u201d The photograph was posted on Instagram by a food blogger in 2017 and re-shared by the Italian restaurant chain Buca di Beppo that same year.",

German said it would be almost impossible for police to stop people from coming to their holiday retreats because they could simply say they were travelling to do exercise.</p> \n<p>People were also heading back into the water. Padstow Harbour in north Cornwall posted a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.padstow-harbour.co.uk/phc_covid-19_update.html\">notice to mariners\u201d</a> allowing kayakers, windsurfers, kite- and paddle-boarders and dinghy sailors to use the estuary for \u201cthe purpose of exercise\u201d.</p> \n<p>The RNLI said none of its lifeguards were working on beaches in the UK and called for people to think carefully before going into or near the water.</p> \n<p>On the Norfolk Broads, one man was rescued after he capsized in gusty conditions.

Simon Blackburn, leader of Blackpool council, said the government\u2019s new message meant there was nothing that could be done to stop visitors, but he urged people to stay away for now.</p> \n<p>Tory MP Robert Goodwill said the North Yorkshire seaside towns of Whitby and Scarborough feared a deluge of visitors. He said: \u201cI would remind people that the toilets are closed, the car parks are closed. Whitby and Scarborough are not accepting visitors at this time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Celia Barnes, who lives in Skegness, Lincolnshire, said she had been shielding for nine weeks and had not left her home \u2013 yet now tourists were being allowed to visit her town. She said: \u201cHow is it fair that we will be inundated with people flocking to the beach who might have the virus?\u201d</p> \n<p>New rules permitting day trips to outdoor open spaces in England came into force on Wednesday, with no limit on the distance allowed. The full \u201cstay at home\u201d lockdown restrictions remain in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>The changes in certain lockdown rules come as police officers were told they could not enforce social distancing in England, while officers in Wales have been told they can. The College of Policing and police chiefs issued new guidance trying to explain the more complicated rules to 125,000 officers in England and Wales.</p> \n<p>It tells officers to apply legal guidelines only and not what they may have heard from politicians. It says: \u201cGovernment guidance is not enforceable, for example, two-metre distancing, avoiding public transport, or the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In Wales it says, two-metre distancing is enforceable, and exercise is allowed only in an \u201carea local to the place where the person is living\u201d.</p> \n<p>It emerged that Greater Manchester police were called to more than 1,000 house parties and large gatherings over the Bank Holiday weekend. Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester, said the \u201csubliminal message [from the government] is that you can go out as much as you like\u201d.</p> \n<p>Ian Hopkins said the new regulations made policing more complex. The chief constable of Greater Manchester police said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from what was a relatively strong message with some fairly clear legislation into something that\u2019s now more fluid. People have more leeway around what they can and can\u2019t do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"dd0e5a58-ea5e-4e76-89be-5885aa2e665c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/poFrVc0M_Uc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, said: \u201cPolice still have a role where people are gathering in groups with those not in their household or if they\u2019ve left their house for one of the reasons not designated as a reasonable excuse.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will use common sense and discretion to determine what\u2019s reasonable.

Simon Blackburn, leader of Blackpool council, said the government\u2019s new message meant there was nothing that could be done to stop visitors, but he urged people to stay away for now. Tory MP Robert Goodwill said the North Yorkshire seaside towns of Whitby and Scarborough feared a deluge of visitors. He said: \u201cI would remind people that the toilets are closed, the car parks are closed. Whitby and Scarborough are not accepting visitors at this time.\u201d Celia Barnes, who lives in Skegness, Lincolnshire, said she had been shielding for nine weeks and had not left her home \u2013 yet now tourists were being allowed to visit her town. She said: \u201cHow is it fair that we will be inundated with people flocking to the beach who might have the virus?\u201d New rules permitting day trips to outdoor open spaces in England came into force on Wednesday, with no limit on the distance allowed. The full \u201cstay at home\u201d lockdown restrictions remain in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The changes in certain lockdown rules come as police officers were told they could not enforce social distancing in England, while officers in Wales have been told they can. The College of Policing and police chiefs issued new guidance trying to explain the more complicated rules to 125,000 officers in England and Wales. It tells officers to apply legal guidelines only and not what they may have heard from politicians. It says: \u201cGovernment guidance is not enforceable, for example, two-metre distancing, avoiding public transport, or the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces.\u201d In Wales it says, two-metre distancing is enforceable, and exercise is allowed only in an \u201carea local to the place where the person is living\u201d. It emerged that Greater Manchester police were called to more than 1,000 house parties and large gatherings over the Bank Holiday weekend. Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester, said the \u201csubliminal message [from the government] is that you can go out as much as you like\u201d. Ian Hopkins said the new regulations made policing more complex. The chief constable of Greater Manchester police said: \u201cWe\u2019ve gone from what was a relatively strong message with some fairly clear legislation into something that\u2019s now more fluid. People have more leeway around what they can and can\u2019t do.\u201d Martin Hewitt, chair of the National Police Chiefs Council, said: \u201cPolice still have a role where people are gathering in groups with those not in their household or if they\u2019ve left their house for one of the reasons not designated as a reasonable excuse. \u201cWe will use common sense and discretion to determine what\u2019s reasonable. Officers will engage, explain, encourage and, only as a last resort, enforce.\u201d Simon Fell, the Conservative MP for Barrow and Furness in Cumbria, said the Lake District could be closed if the infection rate increased. \u201cWe need to keep a really, really close eye on the R number, and if we see it go up, turn on the restrictions straight away,\u201d he said. In Bournemouth, where beach hut owners were allowed back for the first time, Rob Underhill, 67, was among the first to return. \u201cIt is wonderful to be back here and to be able to look out at the sea,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>At least 95,000 people have entered the UK from overseas since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed, one of the government\u2019s chief scientific advisers has revealed, while repeatedly failing to provide an estimate of how many of these people had Covid-19.</p> <p>Appearing before MPs on the science and technology committee, Prof John Aston, the chief scientific adviser at the Home Office, admitted that had tougher restrictions been introduced at the border, the peak of the virus may have been delayed \u2013 but he did not say by how long, or if this would have saved lives.</p> <p>Aston, who attends meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is advising the government during the crisis, was asked repeatedly for the estimated proportion or number of people arriving in the UK with Covid-19.</p> <p>He insisted instead that a more \u201crobust\u201d assessment was the ratio of imported cases to domestic cases. This model, formulated by Sage, estimates 0.5% of all cases on any given day are imported from overseas.</p> <p>The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. Arrivals will have been subjected to the same <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">lockdown restrictions imposed on the wider population since 23 March</a>.</p> <p>In a heated exchange Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, who was appearing as a guest member, asked Aston if ministers had a central estimate of the number of people arriving each week who might have Covid-19 when the decision to stop asking any arrivals to self-isolate was made.</p> <p>Aston said: \u201cWhen that [decision] was made, an estimate was made about what the effect of putting further restrictions on the border would be.</p> <p>\u201cIt would delay the epidemic by a small amount of time and therefore it was deemed that wasn\u2019t a sensible thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>Cooper repeatedly asked for the estimate but it was not provided. She said: \u201cPreviously people were asked to self-isolate at the border for 14 days. Inexplicably when other countries were increasing their restrictions or their requirements to self-isolate, the UK lifted them all.

      "bodyText": "At least 95,000 people have entered the UK from overseas since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed, one of the government\u2019s chief scientific advisers has revealed, while repeatedly failing to provide an estimate of how many of these people had Covid-19. Appearing before MPs on the science and technology committee, Prof John Aston, the chief scientific adviser at the Home Office, admitted that had tougher restrictions been introduced at the border, the peak of the virus may have been delayed \u2013 but he did not say by how long, or if this would have saved lives. Aston, who attends meetings of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is advising the government during the crisis, was asked repeatedly for the estimated proportion or number of people arriving in the UK with Covid-19. He insisted instead that a more \u201crobust\u201d assessment was the ratio of imported cases to domestic cases. This model, formulated by Sage, estimates 0.5% of all cases on any given day are imported from overseas. The government stopped issuing guidance at the border to arrivals from specific countries \u2013 including from Italy and China \u2013 to self-isolate on 13 March, 10 days before the lockdown was imposed. Since then, there has been little intervention other than advice provided on leaflets and posters. Arrivals will have been subjected to the same lockdown restrictions imposed on the wider population since 23 March. In a heated exchange Yvette Cooper, the chair of the home affairs select committee, who was appearing as a guest member, asked Aston if ministers had a central estimate of the number of people arriving each week who might have Covid-19 when the decision to stop asking any arrivals to self-isolate was made. Aston said: \u201cWhen that [decision] was made, an estimate was made about what the effect of putting further restrictions on the border would be. \u201cIt would delay the epidemic by a small amount of time and therefore it was deemed that wasn\u2019t a sensible thing to do.\u201d Cooper repeatedly asked for the estimate but it was not provided. She said: \u201cPreviously people were asked to self-isolate at the border for 14 days. Inexplicably when other countries were increasing their restrictions or their requirements to self-isolate, the UK lifted them all. It was before the peak in Spain, it was still around the peak in Italy, it was several weeks before the peak in UK.\u201d Aston\u2019s evidence comes as the government prepares to enforce a 14-day quarantine for arrivals by air at the UK border \u2013 a policy that some have suggested would have been more appropriate prior to the UK lockdown on 23 March. There were 18.1 million arrivals to the UK by air in the period from 1 January to 23 March, of whom 273 passengers were formally quarantined. Aston told the committee that between 1 April and 26 April there were 95,000 arrivals into the UK by air, of whom about 53,000 were UK citizens. Defending the use of the modelling that returns an estimate that imported cases make up 0.5% of all domestic cases, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s a really complicated modelling thing to do. It was done by Sage. It requires you to understand the prevalence in overseas countries, as well as prevalence in the UK and you need to put that together to get the ratio of incoming cases to domestic cases.\u201d Aston\u2019s remarks jar with testimony given by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who told the health and social care committee that the UK received a \u201cbig influx of cases\u201d from Europe that \u201cseeded right the way across the country\u201d. The home affairs select committee has repeatedly requested the government publishes the scientific advice provided by Sage that informed its border policy. Stephen Doughty, a shadow minister and former member of the committee, who has been pursuing the issue of border policy during the crisis, said: \u201cSimply claiming it\u2019s all a bit complicated and refusing to publish the models on which these critical decisions were based is not good enough. \u201cWe need to see urgent publication of the models and scientific advice that led to the Cabinet deciding not to act when the pandemic was raging. The revelation that even since the lockdown likely more than 100,000 have entered with scant checks, also begs the urgent question \u2013 why has the government still not introduced measures?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 21 May 2020 to clarify that the 18.1m people who entered the UK between 1 January and 23 March were air passengers, and did not arrive by \u201cair, land and sea\u201d as an earlier version stated.",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has urged the public to rely on their \u201cBritish common sense\u201d as lockdown restrictions are progressively eased over the coming months. But as estate agents joined nannies and cleaners on the list of workers allowed to enter people\u2019s homes, while friends and family can\u2019t come round for a cup of tea or to visit their grandchildren, questions are being raised about whether the latest rules make any sense, British or otherwise. One anomaly was highlighted by Kate, the teacher who asked Johnson a question at Monday\u2019s press conference: why was it OK for her to mix with a class full of children when schools reopen on 1 June, but not acceptable to see members of her own family? The truth is that while they can\u2019t quite bring themselves to say it plainly, ministers are prioritising getting the economy moving again over cheering up those who are lonely and sad after seven weeks\u2019 isolation. English schools are set to reopen because, as the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, put it on Wednesday, they are \u201cthe best place for children to be educated and to learn\u201d, but also so that at least some working parents can increase their productivity by not having to juggle their jobs with home schooling. It is not hard to discern why. Wednesday\u2019s catastrophic data from the Office for National Statistics suggested a deep recession is brewing and job losses are accelerating, despite the taxpayer subsidising 7.5m workers\u2019 salaries. Allowing some aspects of economic life to resume may help to limit the longer-term scars inflicted by the overnight shutdown at the end of March \u2013 but it does not come without risks. What the government is having to decide is which risks are worth taking first. And as Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation, puts it: \u201cIn the short term, they\u2019re prioritising the risk that comes with a money payoff, over the risk that comes with an emotional payoff.\u201d In Monday\u2019s \u201cPlan to Rebuild\u201d document, the government describes its approach as \u201csaving lives, saving livelihoods\u201d. \u201cThe longer the virus affects the economy, the greater the risks of long-term scarring and permanently lower economic activity, with business failures, persistently higher unemployment and lower earnings,\u201d it says, pointing out that many of those worst affected by a prolonged recession would be the young and the low-paid. But while the government\u2019s roadmap repeatedly makes reference to \u201cfairness\u201d, the risks of the gradual reopening will not be borne evenly. Stark Office for National Statistics data on which occupations have seen the highest death rates from the virus underlined the fact that low-paid workers have been most at risk \u2013 and many more are in the sectors, including construction and manufacturing, now being asked to return, albeit with new safety rules in place. It hasn\u2019t helped, either, that Johnson bungled the messaging about what would change this this week and when \u2013 and urged workers to avoid the crush of public transport, which for many will be impossible. Despite the unprecedented generosity of the furlough scheme, that may ultimately make it harder to maintain Rishi Sunak\u2019s insistence that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d \u2013 a claim last used by a Conservative chancellor when George Osborne was slashing the welfare bill. The public may have a different understanding of the risks, and a different appetite for accepting them. The devolved nations certainly appear to, and are continuing to stick to the \u201cstay at home\u201d message \u2013 though ministers in Westminster argue that\u2019s understandable, because the outbreak is at different stages in different places. Even if the focus on the economy may be understandable, the emotional and social cost of the lockdown is intensifying. A report for Conservative thinktank Onward warned last week of the heavy toll on the nation\u2019s mental health, with the potential for \u201cincreased levels of depression, harmful use of alcohol and drugs, as well as self-harm or suicidal behaviour\u201d. That is one reason it may be hard to maintain consent for nitpicking restrictions about who can meet whom in the park, and in what circumstances, as people increasingly yearn for contact with their loved ones. Another is that the public may apply the \u201cBritish common sense\u201d that Johnson is trumpeting, and decide that if the government thinks an encounter with an estate agent is a risk worth taking, it\u2019s fine for their mum to pop round. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

It comes on the day Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of being too slow to control the spread of Covid-19 in care homes. The Labour leader claimed that Boris Johnson misled MPs at PMQs when he said it \u201cwasn\u2019t true\u201d that up until 12 March the care home sector had been advised it was \u201c very unlikely\u201d to face an outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t deny a Treasury report (<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/12/exclusive-treasury-blueprint-raise-taxes-freeze-wages-pay-300bn/\">leaked to the Telegraph</a>) that suggested</strong> <strong>the UK is more likely to get a U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one</strong>. The document, drawn up by the chancellor\u2019s policy advisers, said a \u201cprolonged recovery and some permanent damage to the economy\u201d was \u201ca more realistic scenario\u201d. Tax rises and pay freezes are reportedly being considered as options that might be needed to help the government cover the cost of the crisis \u2013 estimated to be around \u00a3300bn. Downing Street somewhat played down the prospect of the government agreeing a public sector pay freeze and breaking its \u201ctax lock\u201d promise from the last election, but didn\u2019t go as far as restating commitment.</li> \n   <li><strong>Schools in England could open informally during the summer for catch-up tuition</strong><strong>, Gavin Williamson said.</strong> This was a marked departure from the education secretary\u2019s stance last month, where he seemed to rule out opening schools at all during the summer holidays.</li> \n   <li><strong>The easing of the lockdown in England has come \u201ctoo soon\u201d for regions such as the north-wes</strong><strong>t, Andy Burnham said.</strong> The mayor of Greater Manchester said that with more patients hospitalised with Covid-19 in the north-west than in any other region in England, he wasn\u2019t convinced that lifting lockdown was safe across the country. </li> \n   <li><strong>People living in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than twice as likely to die after contracting coronavirus as those living in wealthier parts</strong>, analysis from the National Records of Scotland revealed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The government is being urged to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme to transport workers.</strong> It follows the death of rail worker Belly Mujinga who was spat at by a member of the public claiming to have the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Building sites will be allowed to apply to extend their hours</strong> to 9pm Monday to Saturday in residential areas, to make it easier for builders to practice physical distancing. The government made the announcement as part of efforts to get construction back up and running.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s it from us on the UK side.

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Sir Keir Starmer was widely expected to outperform Boris Johnson at PMQs, and in their first encounter last week he duly managed to do so with aplomb. On their second outing you would have expected No 10 to have given some thought to how to mount a more effective response. But there was not much evidence of this, and Johnson was duly skittled.</p> \n  <p>One problem for Johnson was that some of the usual tactics just don\u2019t work at Zoom PMQs. A outright untruth can win you temporary reprieve in the House of Commons if 300 MPs are cheering you on and it is going to take people a while to work out that you\u2019re mistaken or lying, but Johnson does not have the wall of sound protection he used to enjoy, and denying the existence of a document that Labour were able to circulate within seconds (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/13/uk-coronavirus-live-millions-health-conditions-return-to-work-pmqs-covid-19-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4#block-5ebbdc9c8f08a55ecde591b4\">12.47pm)</a> was just an elementary error. Starmer is not infallible, and there are ways of beating him in an argument. But suggesting that Starmer (the archetypal \u201cswot\u201d, as the PM would put it) is wrong on a point of fact - how naive can you get?</p> \n  <p>Having exhausted denial as a tactic, Johnson (in exchanges two and three) resorted to ignoring the question. But this, again, is a less reliable tactic in a largely silent House of Commons, and Johnson\u2019s failure to be able to address the point raised by <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/05/12/governments-handling-covid-19-british-disaster/\">the Ambrose Evans-Pritchard column in the Telegraph, </a>or to be able to give a sensible explanation of the excess death figure, left him looking unimpressive. In the final three answers Johnson was on slightly less shaky ground. There is an argument for not using the global death comparisons chart (although one that\u2019s harder to make if you\u2019ve only just abandoned it now), he did at last acknowledge the childcare problem, and he promised to publish Sage advice. But his very partial recovery was too late. By then the damage was done.</p> \n  <p>Again, none of this was particularly surprising.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Diamond said the UK was \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe, but that he was not prepared to say it had the worst record</strong>. Asked directly if the UK had the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m not prepared to say that at this time. I don\u2019t think that we have very good data in the UK and I do think that there is no doubt that we are, if you like, at the higher level for deaths. I\u2019ve no problem about saying that.</p> \n   <p>Because of the great difficulty in understanding exactly whether we\u2019re comparing apples with apples, or apples with pears, I\u2019m not prepared to say that the UK has the highest.</p> \n   <p>So, for example, if we look at the comparison with Italy, the most recent adjustment made in Italy only took us up to the end of March. We are much further on ...</p> \n   <p>So there are very, very different data collection strategies in different countries. It will be some time, because of the way that other countries report, that I\u2019m able to give an authoritative answer to that question.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Diamond also explained why comparing death rates in different countries could be misleading. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s just start with age. We know that, above all, this is a disease which really impacts the elderly members of society. So if you population has a radically different age structure, then one needs to do something about controlling for that. Ireland, for example, has a much younger age structure than some other parts of Europe.</p> \n   <p>Secondly, we know from ONS data it\u2019s a pandemic which started in London. It takes much longer to move through rural areas. We need to know something about the degree of urbanisation, the degree to which people are living close together.</p> \n   <p>These are areas that you really need to take into account, as well as the points that we\u2019ve that we\u2019ve already talked about, which are about making sure that the recording is comparative.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The UK Statistics Authority has backed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-live-sunak-expected-to-extend-furlough-scheme-as-lockdown-confusion-continues?page=with:block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999#block-5ebad4de8f08d99d46a15999\">Downing Street\u2019s decision to stop publishing a daily global deaths comparison chart.</a> </strong>At the hearing<strong> </strong><strong>Ed Humpherson</strong>, director general for regulation at the authority, was giving evidence alongside Diamond and he was asked specifically about the move, which means No 10 no longer presents a daily chart showing the UK as having the worst record in Europe.

independent festival sector</strong> is at risk of collapsing, with many cancelled events falling through the cracks of government support measures for businesses suffering as a result of the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p><strong>The Association of Independent Festivals</strong> (AIF), which represents 65 festivals in the UK, including <strong>Gloucestershire\u2019s 2000trees</strong>, <strong>London\u2019s Meltdown</strong> and <strong>Sheffield\u2019s Tramlines</strong>, reports 92% of its members saying they face costs that could ruin their businesses as a result of cancelled events, with the vast majority (98.5%) not covered by insurance for cancellation related to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Costs include potential refunds of up to \u00a3800m for events that were due to take place this summer, and average non-recoupable costs of \u00a3375,000 per festival for overheads such as marketing, staffing and advertising. </p> \n  <p>A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support.</p> \n  <p>The AIF chief executive, <strong>Paul Reed</strong>, says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet eligibility criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year. </p> \n  <aside

Care home deaths in England and Wales could be more than 22,000 \u2013 as much as double the official death toll \u2013 academics have calculated. It comes on the day Sir Keir Starmer accused the government of being too slow to control the spread of Covid-19 in care homes. The Labour leader claimed that Boris Johnson misled MPs at PMQs when he said it \u201cwasn\u2019t true\u201d that up until 12 March the care home sector had been advised it was \u201c very unlikely\u201d to face an outbreak. Rishi Sunak didn\u2019t deny a Treasury report (leaked to the Telegraph) that suggested the UK is more likely to get a U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one. The document, drawn up by the chancellor\u2019s policy advisers, said a \u201cprolonged recovery and some permanent damage to the economy\u201d was \u201ca more realistic scenario\u201d. Tax rises and pay freezes are reportedly being considered as options that might be needed to help the government cover the cost of the crisis \u2013 estimated to be around \u00a3300bn. Downing Street somewhat played down the prospect of the government agreeing a public sector pay freeze and breaking its \u201ctax lock\u201d promise from the last election, but didn\u2019t go as far as restating commitment. Schools in England could open informally during the summer for catch-up tuition, Gavin Williamson said. This was a marked departure from the education secretary\u2019s stance last month, where he seemed to rule out opening schools at all during the summer holidays. The easing of the lockdown in England has come \u201ctoo soon\u201d for regions such as the north-west, Andy Burnham said. The mayor of Greater Manchester said that with more patients hospitalised with Covid-19 in the north-west than in any other region in England, he wasn\u2019t convinced that lifting lockdown was safe across the country. People living in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than twice as likely to die after contracting coronavirus as those living in wealthier parts, analysis from the National Records of Scotland revealed. The government is being urged to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme to transport workers. It follows the death of rail worker Belly Mujinga who was spat at by a member of the public claiming to have the virus. Building sites will be allowed to apply to extend their hours to 9pm Monday to Saturday in residential areas, to make it easier for builders to practice physical distancing. The government made the announcement as part of efforts to get construction back up and running. That\u2019s it from us on the UK side. Thank you all for reading along and to everyone who got in touch throughout the day with tips and suggestions.

Here are the main points from Robert Jenrick\u2019s press conference. Jenrick, the housing and communities secretary, said that he would allow building sites in residential areas to operate until 9pm, to make it easier for them to follow social distancing rules. He said: [This] will enable sites to stay open during the summer months, potentially to 9pm in residential areas, and longer than that in areas where there are no neighbouring properties. This is to help the industry to catch up if it wants to and, above all, to help it to put in place the social distancing rules that it will need to operate sites safely and reduce pressure on public transport. I hope that all of us across the country, and our councils, will support that and ensure that it is implemented smoothly. He gave more details in a Commons written ministerial statement. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said there was no \u201csustained community transmission\u201d of coronavirus when the guidance quoted by Sir Keir Starmer in the Commons about it being \u201cvery unlikely\u201d that people in care homes would become infected was published. She said: It needs to be taken in the background of what the epidemiology was at the time of the incident or the advice and that will apply to any documents which Public Health England has produced. And I think at that time we did not recognise there was any sustained community transmission - we clearly had cases around. Jenrick said the government was providing an extra \u00a3600m for care homes to help them with infection control and reducing the need to rotate staff. He said: The package includes ensuring that care homes - including the smaller, independent homes - also have expert advice from councils, from public health professionals and from the NHS to ensure they have got the best infection control, access to testing, the right protective equipment, and are making use of the new discharge policies so that residents are only arriving or returning at the home once we know that they are free from Covid-19. He said places of worship might be allowed to open for private prayer before 4 July, which is the date for a possible general opening of places of worship. There was only one case of Covid-19 among prisoners confirmed in the most recent 24 hour period, an increase of 0.25%, a daily update from the Ministry of Justice shows. As at 5pm on Tuesday, 401 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 74 prisons, up from 400 on Monday. The number of infected prison staff stood at 501 workers across 70 prisons, up 2% in the same period. Prison staff have access to testing, while prisoners access is limited. There are 81,000 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, while there are around 33,000 workers in public-sector prisons. The number of cases and deaths in prisons have been much lower than expected in part due to the highly restrictive regime introduced in March, which means prisoners are spending less than an hour of their day out of their cells. At least 21 prisoners have contracted Covid-19 and died, while at least eight staff have died, including one prisoner escort and custody services worker. This is from Anthony Costello, a former director of the Institute for Global Health at the University College London and a former director of the World Health Organisation, on what Jenny Harries and Robert Jenrick were saying at the press conference. (See 5.47pm.) Q: Will the Treasury continue to fund the furlough scheme for Scotland if it needs to keep people off work longer? Jenrick says the scheme will continue to reflect the needs of working people across the UK. Q: Can you offer specific assurances to Scotland? Jenrick says there is no cliff edge. The scheme has been extended, he says. Q: What impact will the changes introduced today have on the R number? Harries says the interventions are designed to keep R below one. It is hard to know what impact certain measures will have. But most of the measures introduced this week relate to outdoors, where the risk is lower, she says. If people practice social distancing, R should stay below 1, she says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: What is causing excess deaths in care homes? Harries says some of them will have died from Covid. That is highly likely, she says. She also says it is important for people to continue to use emergency health services. Q: Care homes were told there was very little chance of their being infected until 13 March. Why did they not get better support? Harries says what matters is not just testing and discharge policy. Infection control matters too. She says this was a Public Health England document. They were monitoring background risk. She says the alert system would have been stepped up when the background risk increased. You should judge the document by what the background risk was, she says. She says when that document was published, community transmission was not a problem. Q: If the schools don\u2019t reopen in June, what does that mean for the economic recovery? Jenrick says Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is doing all he can to reach an agreement with the unions for school reopening. Q: The French government says pupil are safer at school than at home. Are children safer at school, or travelling to school? Harries say you need to think about where children will flourish. It is not just infection control. Vulnerable children in particular benefit from being at school, she says. And if children do not feel comfortable in education in their early years, that will affect them negatively in the years ahead, including in health outcomes. Q: Has the government ruled out tax increases, scrapping the triple lock on pensions, or a public sector wage freeze? Jenrick says these are matters for the chancellor. The government wants to protect as many businesses as possible. He says he has announced a reopening of the housing market. Q: Will teaching staff be penalised if they refuse to go to work in June? Jenrick says the education secretary is working closely with the teaching unions to ensure teachers are comfortable about going back. Many teachers have already been working, he says. Q: Why were you happy to stand her and present the global death comparison slide, when the government now says that data is unreliable? Harries says as a scientist she believes in transparency. The death data is available, she says. She says she and other scientist have all highlighted the risks with comparative death data. The only really good comparison will be all-cause excess mortality, adjusted for age of population, and seasonally adjusted too. But she says it is always good to look at comparisons on the way, to see what you can learn. Q: Can you see why people find this suspicious? Jenrick says the government wants to be as transparent as it can. But accurate comparisons are difficult. Q: Many care home beds are now empty. How will this money help them stay open? Jenrick says the money announced today follows \u00a33.2bn that has gone to councils, most of which are councils with responsibility for adult social. He says smaller care homes should also get expert advice. Harries says NHS England already had a plan of advanced support for care homes. That has been brought forward. She says this will be useful in small care homes that have difficulty maintaining clinical skills. Q: Wouldn\u2019t it be better to let the care homes spend the money on whatever they want? Some are facing closures. Jenrick says councils should be passing the money on to the front line. Q: Why can\u2019t the government get a grip on care homes? Jenrick says it is essential they get the help they need. Today the PM announced another \u00a3600m for councils, for spending on care homes. He says this should allow more continuity with staff. Care homes will also get PPE and testing, he says. Harries says good infection control is also important. Q: But there aren\u2019t enough tests for care homes. The government does not seem to be getting a grip. Jenrick says the package announced today builds on work that has been going on for weeks. Northern Ireland\u2019s Nightingale hospital for treating patients with Covid-19 is being temporarily stood down. The facility at the City Hospital\u2019s tower block treated 30 people in intensive care beds at the height of the first wave of virus infection, Stormont\u2019s health minister Robin Swann said. The country\u2019s rate of infection stands at 0.79, meaning less than one person is catching it for every confirmed case, but Swann said the decision was made based on the number of coronavirus cases the hospital was now dealing with. He added: It was one of the key strategic tools for tackling Covid-19. We are not doing away with it, it will be there if we have need for it. Northern Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said reducing the health service\u2019s escalation level will ensure it is able to respond and redeploy to non-Covid-19 cases. Doctors would be able to deal with urgent surgeries and treatments. McBride added: We have to undertake that gradually and cautiously. Laura from Rossendale asks when meeting in \u201cbubbles\u201d of different households might be allowed. Jenrick says that is not allowed at the moment. Harries says operating a bubble system could be complicated. If two large families were allowed to meet up, you would get a large gathering. Jenrick is now taking questions. The first is from Michael, a member of the public. He says he works in theatre. What will the government do to protect the theatre industry? Jenrick says the theatre industry is incredibly important. All of us care about it, he says. It is important for our wellbeing too. He says the government has set up job retention schemes, for employers and the self-employed. He says the culture secretary is working with the sector on how social distancing can be applied when theatres do open up. Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England, is now going through the rest of the slides. Here are the latest transport figures. Here is the slide for testing figures. Jenrick says he wants to get construction up and running. So he he announcing new steps, he says. He will allow building sites to apply to extend their hours, to 9pm Monday to Saturday in residential areas, and later in other areas. He says the government will tell councils that there is a presumption they should approve these applications. He says longer hours will make it easier for builders to observe social distancing. (This will be a measure for England.) Jenrick says people (in England) can now move house if they want to. He says they have to follow the guidelines on the government\u2019s website. He says he can understand why people might think it is odd to be allowed to visit a stranger\u2019s house (if they are buying), but not a relative\u2019s. But, he says, in the first instance buyers should inspect a house online. There should be no open viewings, and no speculative viewings, he says. Jenrick is now going through the daily slides. This slide set out what is and isn\u2019t allowed (in England, although Jenrick does not say that.) He says the government hopes to be able to allow churches to open for private worship soon. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is now holding the daily government press conference. He starts by reading out the latest testing and death figures. It turns out that, when No 10 claimed Sir Keir Starmer selectively quoted from government guidance on care homes, it was highlighting the wrong quote. At PMQs Starmer quoted these words from the document. It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home \u2026 will become infected. At a subsequent briefing No 10 claimed Starmer had quoted selectively from the document, because he had added \u201cremains\u201d and missed out a \u201ctherefore\u201d. See 3.10pm. No 10 was referring to this passage from the document, in section 1. This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of COVID-19 in the community. It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected. This is the latest information and will be updated shortly. But Starmer was actually quoting from another passage in the document which uses similar wording, in section 7. During normal day-to-day activities facemasks do not provide protection from respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19 and do not need to be worn by staff in any of these settings. Facemasks are only recommended to be worn by infected individuals when advised by a healthcare worker, to reduce the risk of transmitting the infection to other people. It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected. (To be fair, the Labour spokesman who sent out the quote to journalists as PMQs was happening sent out the section 1 version, not the section 7 version. But Starmer was quoting from the section 7 version.) I am very grateful to BonyTony in the comments for flagging this up. The government has privately conceded there will be checks on goods crossing the Irish sea post Brexit, months after Boris Johnson insisted there would be no such trade barriers. Members of the Stormont assembly were told that they had a briefing from the executive office officials on Monday on the latest plans to implement the protocol and they included checks at the ports and airports. \u201cThe sum total of that, and without breaching executive confidentiality \u2026 [is that the] British government has confirmed it will urgently put in place detailed plans with the executive, which does include the physical posts at ports of entry,\u201d said Declan Kearney, junior minister at the executive office, the regional equivalent of the Cabinet Office in London. The checks would involve customs controls and health checks on animals and fresh food products entering Northern Ireland from Britain from 2021 to comply with the Brexit deal. The checks were part of the deal struck by Johnson with the EU last October. However, to the astonishment of the EU, he spent the election campaign in December telling businesses there would be no checks. If they were asked to fill in any paperwork they could call him up and he would tell them to throw it in the bin. While he continued to stick to this position in January, more recently Michael Gove has given assurances that the UK will observe the Northern Ireland protocol in the withdrawal agreement. In the latest episode of the Politics Weekly podcast, Jonathan Freedland chats to The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Peter Walker about the latest goings on in Westminster, including whether or not the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has done enough to save the economy from collapse. He then speaks to Ayesha Hazarika and Andrew Gimson about whether the pandemic will bring about fundamental change in opposition politics, and also how the government should handle public messaging going forward. Plus, Simon Jenkins discusses 20 years of London mayoral elections. Last month Gavin Williamson, the education secretary for England, seemed to rule out opening schools for the summer holidays. But in the Commons earlier this afternoon, where he was answering an urgent question, he said this could happen in an informal capacity. Williamson was responding to a question from the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the Commons education committee. Halfon asked: Will [Williamson], while understanding schools won\u2019t officially be open in the summer, support the opening of summer schools over the holidays to be staffed by volunteers, graduates, an army of retired teachers, to provide catch-up tuition to these children who have been left behind? Williamson replied: [Halfon is] right to highlight the many thousands of volunteers that want to reach out, help our children in order to be able to have the knowledge to succeed in the future, and we\u2019re very closely looking at such schemes - working with schools, working with the sector - as to how we can make that available to them. British universities could be at greater risk amid the Covid-19 crisis due to an \u201cover-reliance\u201d on Chinese postgraduate students in recent years, a report has warned. A growth in first-year postgraduate students attending universities in the UK since 2008-9 has been largely driven by international students from non-EU countries such as China, according to the study by the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi). Chinese students, who formed 38% of the non-EU postgraduate cohort in 2017-18, may delay or cancel their plans to study at British university campuses from this autumn amid the Covid-19 crisis, and Hepi has warned some postgraduate courses could become \u201cunviable\u201d if international student numbers fall as institutions are reliant on their higher tuition fees. The report shows that UK-domiciled postgraduate entrants increased by 10% between 2008-9 and 2017-18, but student numbers from overseas grew faster. Non-EU international student levels grew by 33%. It warns: While the high levels of participation by Chinese students have provided much-needed stability to postgraduate numbers and fee income, the sector\u2019s over-reliance on one particular country represents a risk factor. It adds that Covid-19 has led to English proficiency exams required for new entrants being suspended within China and UK universities setting out plans for Chinese students to delay enrolling in the autumn. It comes after a survey from Prospects last week suggested that nearly half of final year students are now contemplating studying a postgraduate course amid Covid-19. The poll, of more than 1,000 final year students, shows that 58% are putting gap year and travel plans abroad on hold and 47% are now considering studying a masters, PGCE or PhD course. But Nick Hillman, director of Hepi, commented: If international postgraduate numbers fall, some courses will become unviable - this is true even if there are more home postgraduates because of the higher fee levels for international students. Car giant Ford has announced plans to restart production at a number of factories, including two in the UK, PA Media reports. Work will resume on 18 May at the company\u2019s engine plants in Dagenham, Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. Together with Valencia Engine Plant in Spain, which also restarts production next week, the resumption of production in the UK means that all of Ford\u2019s European manufacturing facilities will be back at work. A limited number of employees have continued to work on company sites in the UK over recent weeks to ensure the ongoing provision of critical services. The results of tens of thousands of Covid-19 tests carried out by the government\u2019s network of testing centres have not been shared locally, \u201cdisappearing into a data black hole\u201d and stalling efforts to control the outbreak, it has been claimed. A leaked email, seen by the Health Service Journal, said data from a new testing programme of non-NHS labs - managed by consultancy firm Deloitte - was not available, although the government said the issue has now been fixed. Sent at the weekend from a regional NHS incident centre, the email said: No new national testing programme (NTP) data will be reported in this brief from 4 May until further notice. This is due to the NTP testing numbers increasingly becoming unavailable. A reporting solution for NTP data is being built into the (Department for Health and Social Care) portal - once available, it will be captured in this testing brief again. The results of the tests were still fed into the national UK totals. However, only NHS lab results, which now account for less than half of all tests carried out, were said to be reported locally. One source told the HSJ the local intelligence which should be produced from the testing system is \u201cdisappearing into a data black hole\u201d, while a public health director from the south of England said there was no access to data from non-NHS labs. He said: The system remains a mess - multiple routes to test, multiple command structures via the NHS. How are directors of public health expected to manage and direct testing? We need to arrange testing for staff and for residents. But the NHS does some of it, mobile testing sites run by military do other bits, regional testing sites do others, but travel is a challenge. Data on regional outbreaks will be vital to the success of the \u201ctest, track and trace\u201d programme being implemented by the government, as it is meant to tell local organisations how many residents and staff in their area have tested positive and enable them to work out the capacity for more tests. The full HSJ story is here. \u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has changed the prime minister of the United Kingdom into the prime minister of England,\u201d our colleague Martin Kettle argues in a new column. You are read it in full here. The mayor of Greater Manchester, said the easing of the lockdown in England had come \u201ctoo soon\u201d for regions such as the north-west and that it was the byproduct of London-centric decision-making in Whitehall. Andy Burnham said the north-west of England currently has more patients in hospital with coronavirus \u2013 792 \u2013 than any other region in the UK and that he has not been reassured that lifting the lockdown was safe for all parts of the country. He described the UK government\u2019s easing of restrictions as a mistake, adding: I still take the view that if it\u2019s not safe everywhere, it\u2019s not safe anywhere. Burnham said the current R rate \u2013 how many people, on average, will be infected by one person \u2013 in the north-west was 0.7 to 0.76, which is broadly similar to the UK-wide rate. If that figure rises above 1, that\u2019s when the infection begins to spread more rapidly in the community. He is calling for the UK government to give local leaders a regional breakdown of data on the rate of infection in their areas. The mayor also said he was concerned that regional mayors were not represented in the government\u2019s Cobra discussions, alongside the leaders of the devolved nations, adding: Government has made a national decision on release from lockdown but has been overly influenced by the position in London, and the south-east. I think it\u2019s right that the mayor of London is on Cobra, but I am concerned that there hasn\u2019t been equal representation for the perspective from the English regions when it came to making national decisions about the release from lockdown. More than 110,000 self-employed workers have applied for income support grants within hours of the government\u2019s new scheme being launched. HMRC said applications worth more than \u00a3340m were lodged within the first four hours after the self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) opened on Wednesday. The scheme offers grants worth up to 80% of average trading profits for self-employed workers stuck at home due to coronavirus, paid in a single instalment capped at \u00a37,500 to cover three months of lost income. Claims for lost work can be dated back to March and payments are due to land within six working days, the government said. Derek Cribb, the chief executive of the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed, said: For the self-employed, coronavirus is not only a health crisis, but also a pressing income crisis. We are delighted that the government has heeded much of IPSE\u2019s advice by setting up the self-employment income support scheme, which extends a much-needed lifeline to those self-employed people who are eligible for it. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: The self-employment income support scheme represents a lifeline for the millions of self-employed people who are expected to qualify. We are particularly pleased to see the scheme opening earlier than scheduled, with a simple fast-track application and a promise for speedy payment. However, Matt Dowling, the CEO and founder of the Freelancer Club, believes the scheme needs to go further. He said: For countless freelancers, today offers nothing more than a further widening of the gap between them and the rest of society. An estimated 2 million self-employed people are ineligible for any help from the government. Those who earn too little, too much, started freelancing too late, or took time out to support children or loved ones: they\u2019ve been left high and dry. Without greatly increased, backdated financial aid they don\u2019t stand a chance of weathering this storm. The government cannot continue to support employees who happen to be on pay-roll without also addressing the wholly inadequate support system put in place for the freelance and self-employed. We urge them to act, fast. The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. Here are the main points. Unlike other lobby briefings, the post-PMQs one includes briefing from a source able to comment on political matters, as well as briefing from the PM\u2019s civil service spokesman (the official spokesman). No 10 has rejected Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s claim that Boris Johnson misled MPs at PMQs when he said it \u201cwasn\u2019t true\u201d that the care home sector had been advised it was unlikely to face an outbreak. Starmer has written to Johnson asking him to return to the Commons to correct the record. (See 1.14pm.) At PMQs Starmer said that until 12 March official guidance said it remained the case that it was very unlikely that people in care homes were going to be infected by coronavirus, but Johnson told Starmer that wasn\u2019t true. The document (see 12.47pm) clearly says: This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of Covid-19 in the community. It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected. A source said that Starmer had \u201cinaccurately and selectively\u201d quoted from the document, and that therefore the PM was right to say what Starmer said was not correct. The source said that in his question Starmer talked about it remaining the case that people in care were unlikely to be infected (the document does not use the word \u201cremains\u201d at that point) and the source said the full quote (see above) made it clear that this assurance covered a period where there was no community transmission. Starmer did not include the word \u201ctherefore\u201d, the source said. The source signalled that Johnson would not be retracting what he said. (Reminder: the document cited by Starmer was only officially withdrawn as government advice on 13 March. See 12.47pm.) The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman defended the government\u2019s decision to give up presenting a daily slide comparing the UK coronavirus death toll to other countries\u2019. He said that \u201cnumerous experts\u201d had said that reliable comparisons would not be available until a later stage in the pandemic. He quoted some examples, including what Sir Ian Diamond, the head of the ONS, told a Commons committee this morning. (See 11.46am.) But, when asked why No 10 was happy to use the slide regularly until this week, the spokesman just said that the slides were varied regularly. Asked if it had been dropped just out of \u201cembarrassment\u201d, the spokesman said: \u201cNo.\u201d The spokesman sidestepped a question about whether the PM accepted Diamond\u2019s comment about the UK being \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe. (See 11.46am.) Asked about this, he just referred to the PM\u2019s previous comments on this topic. A source played down the prospect of the government agreeing to a public sector pay freeze. This is one option set out in a Treasury document leaked to the Daily Telegraph. (See 9.30am.) The source said that people on the frontline had been doing \u201can incredible job\u201d and that the government was determined to support them. He added: \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to forget that.\u201d A source refused to say that Johnson remains committed to the \u201ctax lock\u201d policy set out in the Conservative manifesto ruling out increases to rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT. Asked about this, he just stressed that the government remained \u201ccommitted to the agenda that was set out at the budget\u201d. The leaked Treasury document suggested the government might have to abandon the tax lock promise. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman stressed that a quarantine exemption with France has not yet been agreed. On Sunday Downing Street released a joint statement from the UK and French governments implying that France would not be covered by the plan to impose quarantine on people arriving in the UK. But the spokesman said that in fact the statement said no quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France \u201cat this stage\u201d. (\u201cAt this stage\u201d no quarantine arrangements apply to anyone.) The spokesman said what had been agreed was that both countries would cooperate on this issue and consult with each other on what they do. His words suggest a French exemption is less likely than was assumed on Sunday night. (Anyone planning a holiday in France might be advised to hold off booking it quite yet.) Downing Street declined to criticise the teaching unions that have told teachers not to engage with plans to reopen schools from 1 June in England. Asked about their stance, the spokesman said: The plans for a phased return of some year groups from June 1 at the earliest have been drawn up in close consultation with the sector and we are keen to hear the concerns of teachers and have worked with the unions throughout the past seven days. We are keen to consult with the unions and to hear the concerns of teachers and I think it\u2019s important they feel free to do that. The spokesman refused to back Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s suggestion that MPs should \u201cset an example\u201d to the country by returning to work in the Commons in early June. Asked if the PM agreed with this phrase, the spokesman sidestepped the question. But he said that the government did want the Commons to be able to return to operating in a more ordinary way. He said the temporary arrangements in place (\u201chybrid scrutiny\u201d, as it\u2019s called, or the Zoom chamber) limited the ability of MPs to carry out their functions. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, is taking the afternoon government press conference this afternoon, the spokesman said. He will be with Dr Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. The spokesman said the government currently has the capacity to carry out 110,00 coronavirus tests a day. Johnson is committed to getting this up to 200,000 a day by the end of the month. The spokesman said the Labour MP Dawn Butler was wrong to say that the PM was sending people to work to catch coronavirus. Here is the quote from Butler. Greater Manchester police were called to more than 1,000 house parties and large gatherings over the bank holiday weekend, officials have said. Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester, said she was \u201cvery, very concerned\u201d that the considerable increase in social gatherings came after Boris Johnson said last Wednesday that he would announce a relaxation to the lockdown on Sunday, prompting headlines such as \u201cMagic Monday\u201d the following day. Hughes said the government\u2019s new guidelines for England were \u201cnot clear\u201d while Ian Hopkins, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said they would make policing \u201cmore complex\u201d. Hopkins said his force had issued just under 300 fixed-penalty fines across the region since the lockdown came into force, a sign of \u201cfantastic compliance\u201d. But he added: A relaxation was always going to prove to be more challenging for us given that we\u2019ve gone from what was a relatively strong message with some fairly clear legislation ... into something that\u2019s now more fluid. From a policing perspective that was always going to make it slightly more tricky, as people have more leeway around what they can and can\u2019t do. The government should \u201cstep back\u201d from its plan to reopen schools in England to more pupils from 1 June, education unions have urged. Nine unions, representing school leaders, teachers and support staff, have accused the government of showing a \u201clack of understanding\u201d about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus in schools. The joint statement, published by the Trades Union Congress, warns that staff will \u201cnot be protected\u201d by physical distancing if primary schools reopen to more year groups from next month. It says: We call on the government to step back from June 1 and work with us to create the conditions for a safe return to schools based on the principles and tests we have set out. We all want schools to reopen, but that should only happen when it is safe to do so. The government is showing a lack of understanding about the dangers of the spread of coronavirus within schools, and outwards from schools to parents, sibling and relatives, and to the wider community. The statement adds: Uniquely, it appears, school staff will not be protected by social distancing rules. 15 children in a class, combined with their very young age, means that classrooms of four and five-year-olds could become sources of Covid-19 transmission and spread. We do not think that the government should be posing this level of risk to our society. Addressing MPs on Wednesday, the education secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons: When you have medical and scientific advice that is saying it\u2019s the right time to start bringing schools back in a phased and controlled manner, it seems only the right thing to do and the only responsible thing to do. He added that the government has worked \u201cvery closely with all the teaching unions and headteachers\u2019 unions\u201d, with time made available each week to discuss matters. But he acknowledged that allowing pupils to return to school would be \u201cchallenging\u201d. He said: We continue to follow the best medical and scientific advice and believe that this phased return is the most sensible course of action to take. London minicab firm Addison Lee is to install screens between drivers and passengers from next week. The company announced that it would implement the hygiene measure across its fleet of 4,000 vehicles. The screens will be clear \u201cso as not to impede the driver\u2019s visibility and enable clear communication\u201d, according to the firm, which has already issued drivers with masks, gloves, hand sanitiser and disinfectant. The firm\u2019s chief executive, Liam Griffin, said: If London is to gradually get moving again as the government adjusts its advice, it is vital to ensure that the public transport network is not overwhelmed, and that people have a clean and safe way to travel as they go back to work. A three-day-old baby in South Wales has died in hospital after his mother contracted coronavirus, our colleague Aamna Mohdin reports. He is thought to be the UK\u2019s youngest victim of Covid-19. Across all settings in the UK, there have now been 33,186 confirmed reported deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, the DHSC said. That is a rise of 494 since yesterday. There have been a further two deaths of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said, bringing the total related fatalities there to 449. Public Health Wales said a further 22 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total there to 1,154. Another 133 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of positive cases in Wales to 11,706. A further 244 people who tested positive for Covid-19 have died, NHS England said, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 23,952. The number of deaths of patients with Covid-19 by region are as follows: East of England: 32 London: 33 Midlands: 51 North East &amp; Yorkshire: 43 North Wes: 44 South East: 28 South West: 13 Total: 244 Since 28 April, NHS England and NHS Improvement also reports the number of patient deaths where there has been no Covid-19 positive test result, but where Covid-19 is documented as a direct or underlying cause of death on part 1 or part 2 of the death certification process. This change has been introduced for deaths that occurred on 24 April and subsequently. This means the NHS England and NHS Improvement data collection provides information on all Covid related (suspected and confirmed) deaths in England hospitals. Today, 51 deaths are reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. Additional data, including listings by Trust and date of death is available on the NHS England website and can be accessed here. The takeaway firm Deliveroo has been accused by a cross-party grouping of MPs of \u201cputting thousands of people at risk\u201d by the way in which it has allegedly treated its riders during the lockdown. Forty-four MPs ranging from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to father of the House of Commons, Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley wrote to the \u2018gig economy\u2019 company to demand adequate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), full pay for riders contracting the virus or self isolating with symptoms and an end to dismissals during the crisis. In their letter, which is supporting a campaign by the the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain\u2019s (IWGB), the MPs say: Deliveroo couriers are low-paid, precarious workers, who are not able to self-isolate when sick or to protect their families, and clients and restaurant staff and other key workers including NHS staff are being potentially exposed to infection. Deliveroo, which rejected the suggestion that it put profit above the safety of its riders, said: \u201c\u201cAt Deliveroo, riders are at the heart of everything we do and we are working hard to support them during this unprecedented time. This includes distributing PPE kit to riders across the UK, supporting riders financially if they are unwell and keeping riders safe through contact-free delivery.\u201d Anti-poverty campaigners have denounced as \u201cscandalous\u201d new analysis which reveals that people living in the most deprived areas of Scotland are more than twice as likely to die from coronavirus as those living in the wealthiest parts (see 12.27pm), reflecting ONS data released at the beginning of the month which confirmed the devastating scale of the death toll in the poorest parts of England and Wales. For the first time this morning the National Records of Scotland published additional analysis looking at the impact of deprivation on coronavirus death rates. Their analysis found that people living in the most deprived areas of Scotland were 2.3 times more likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas. Guardian analysis also indicates that death rates are higher in the most deprived areas of Scotland. The non-age standardised death rate is higher in council areas with a high concentration of deprivation. Inverclyde local authority, which contains a large proportion of the most highly deprived parts of Scotland, continues to have the highest Covid-19 death rate in the country, at 13.2 per 10,000 people compared with the national rate of 5.8 per 10,000. Glasgow, which also has significant pockets of deprivation in the city, has a death rate of 8.05 by this measure. The NRS analysis also found that the gap between rich and poor was smaller when considering the rate of deaths from all causes, at 1.9 times higher in the most deprived 20% than in the least deprived 20% compared with 2.3 times for coronavirus. Muge Cevik, a clinical academic specialising in infectious diseases at the University of St Andrews, told the Guardian: Coronavirus is a magnifying glass that highlights existing health inequalities. We know that there is a correlation between deprivation, over-crowding and pandemic hotspots. With Glasgow, we know that it is the most densely populated city in Scotland, with the lowest life expectancy, very high deprivation levels as well as being the most ethnically diverse area of the country. People who face the highest deprivation also experience the highest risk of exposure and existing poor health puts them at risk of more severe outcomes. Wales will welcome back people who live in England \u201cwith open arms\u201d once the Covid-19 crisis is over, the Welsh minister for economy, transport and north Wales has said. Ken Skates said for the moment road blocks were being set up to intercept people travelling in order to exercise - which is banned in Wales. Speaking at the Welsh government\u2019s daily press conference, Skates said: We\u2019re working very closely with police forces around Wales and in England to try to minimise the instances of irresponsible behaviour. It\u2019s not just that people are travelling across the border. It\u2019s also that some people are not acting appropriately within Wales and are travelling for exercise when they should not be doing so. He said if the police felt they needed more powers the government would back them. \u201cIf further resources, further powers are required then we will support them in their endeavours.\u201d But addressing English people he said: \u201cYou will be very warmly welcomed to Wales when we are through this crisis.\u201d On public transport, Skates said the Welsh government would not ask people to avoid trains and buses in Wales because one in five people in Wales do not have a car. But he said there may be a need for key workers to be given priority on public transport. At first minister\u2019s questions in Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon responded to the new figures showing that deaths in care homes still make up 57% of the total coronavirus deaths in Scotland, which is higher than the latest figure for England. (See 12.27pm.) She defended the figures, referring to the LSE analysis published earlier this morning, which suggests that care home deaths in England and Wales have been under-reported by up to 22,000. Sturgeon said she was confident that the Scottish numbers were accurate, and that the figures were \u201cbroadly in line with evidence seen from other countries\u201d. She said: This tells us there is a particular issue here that is not unique to Scotland ... This is an intrinsic part of the really difficult nature of this virus. The most recent equivalent data for England and Wales only runs to 1 May, making it difficult to directly compare the data north and south of the border. But up to 1 May, more Covid-19 deaths had occurred in hospitals than in care homes in England and Wales. Research published by the London School of Economics in mid April found that, in Italy, Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium, between 42% and 57% of deaths from the virus had been happening in care homes. Oh dear. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Sir Keir Starmer was widely expected to outperform Boris Johnson at PMQs, and in their first encounter last week he duly managed to do so with aplomb. On their second outing you would have expected No 10 to have given some thought to how to mount a more effective response. But there was not much evidence of this, and Johnson was duly skittled. One problem for Johnson was that some of the usual tactics just don\u2019t work at Zoom PMQs. A outright untruth can win you temporary reprieve in the House of Commons if 300 MPs are cheering you on and it is going to take people a while to work out that you\u2019re mistaken or lying, but Johnson does not have the wall of sound protection he used to enjoy, and denying the existence of a document that Labour were able to circulate within seconds (see 12.47pm) was just an elementary error. Starmer is not infallible, and there are ways of beating him in an argument. But suggesting that Starmer (the archetypal \u201cswot\u201d, as the PM would put it) is wrong on a point of fact - how naive can you get? Having exhausted denial as a tactic, Johnson (in exchanges two and three) resorted to ignoring the question. But this, again, is a less reliable tactic in a largely silent House of Commons, and Johnson\u2019s failure to be able to address the point raised by the Ambrose Evans-Pritchard column in the Telegraph, or to be able to give a sensible explanation of the excess death figure, left him looking unimpressive. In the final three answers Johnson was on slightly less shaky ground. There is an argument for not using the global death comparisons chart (although one that\u2019s harder to make if you\u2019ve only just abandoned it now), he did at last acknowledge the childcare problem, and he promised to publish Sage advice. But his very partial recovery was too late. By then the damage was done. Again, none of this was particularly surprising. But Starmer has only appeared at four PMQs, and only two against Johnson, and already he has established mastership of the arena. That\u2019s a notable achievement so early in his time as opposition leader. Sir Keir Starmer written to Boris Johnson asking him to return to the Commons to correct the record about the coronavirus advice issued to care homes. (See 12.47pm.) In a letter Starmer said: At this time of national crisis, it is more important than ever that government ministers are accurate in the information they give. Given this, I expect you to come to the House of Commons at the earliest opportunity to correct the record and to recognise that this was official government guidance regarding care homes. UPDATE: Here is the letter. Judge-only trials without juries should be considered only \u201cin extremis\u201d and parliament should \u201ctake a deep breath\u201d before making such radical changes, the lord chief justice has urged. Giving evidence to the Lords constitution committee, Lord Burnett of Maldon indicated that if the pandemic continued for a long time and there were insurmountable physical distancing problems his preferred solution would be to reduce the jury size from 12 to seven. He told peers: Trial by judge alone has been mentioned and had the support of some very senior members of the legal profession and former judges. I would see [that] as an option only in extremis. The reasons we have jurors in criminal cases in England Wales is that an important aspect of it is to ensure public confidence [in trials] and to have public engagement in the administration of justice. I would hope that parliament would take a deep breath before authorising judge-only trials, even temporarily, until parliament collectively were satisfied that less radical measures to ameliorate the situation were not good enough. Asked what would happen if jurors were \u201cfrightened to attend\u201d, Burnett said judges would be sensitive in considering reasons for them to be excused. New jury trials, using two courtrooms and video links to space out participants, are due to start next Monday, 18 May. The first court centres to reopen for jury trials are expected to be the Old Bailey, Bristol, Cardiff, Manchester Minshull Street, Reading, Warwick, Winchester and Nottingham. The education secretary Gavin Williamson said all teachers and school pupils will be able to be tested for Covid-19 if they develop symptoms when they return to schools. Answering an urgent Commons question from the Liberal Democrat\u2019s education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, Williamson said: On Monday my department published initial guidance for settings on how to begin to prepare and we\u2019ll work with the sector leaders to develop this further in the coming weeks. This guidance sets out protective measures to minimise the risk of infection, including restricting class sizes and limiting mixing between groups. Crucially all children and staff will have access to testing if they develop symptoms of coronavirus. This will enable a track-and-trace approach to be taken to any confirmed cases. At PMQs Boris Johnson claimed that Sir Keir Starmer was wrong to say that government advice was saying until 12 March that people in care homes were at little risk of coronavirus. Here is the document. As you can see at the top, it says it was withdrawn on 13 March. And here is the key quote. This guidance is intended for the current position in the UK where there is currently no transmission of Covid-19 in the community. It is therefore very unlikely that anyone receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected. For reference, this is what Starmer asked: Until 12 March, the government\u2019s own official advice was - and I\u2019m quoting from it: \u201cIt remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home will become infected.\u201d Does the prime minister accept that the government was too slow to protect people in care homes? And Johnson replied: No, Mr Speaker. And it wasn\u2019t true the advice said that. A total of 1,973 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19, up by 61 from 1,912 on Tuesday, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Speaking at FMQ\u2019s, she announced 13,929 people in Scotland have now tested positive for the virus, a rise of 166 from 13,763 the day before. As of Tuesday night, 1,534 patients were in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, down 84 from 1,618 the previous day, Sturgeon added, of whom 70 are in intensive care, a fall of 11. These daily figures differ from the weekly figures published today by National Records of Scotland (see 12.27pm.) because the weekly figures include all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on death certificate. William Wragg, a Conservative, asks what is being done to ensure that patients can access the NHS for non-coronavirus conditions. Johnson says too many people are staying away from the NHS. He urges people to seek NHS treatment if they need it. And that\u2019s it. PMQs is over. The Green MP Caroline Lucas says green economic recovery policies will deliver better returns than other ones. Does the PM agree that any airline asking for a handout should meet robust climate goals? Johnson says CO2 emissions will dramatically be reduced this year. He says it is important to \u201centrench those gains\u201d. Kate Griffiths, a Conservative, asks about NHS workers and coronavirus. Johnson says the government will take steps to ensure NHS staff are properly protected. Simon Baynes, a Conservative, asks about the Llangollen steam railway. Johnson says he has a picture at home of himself on it with William Hague. He wishes it the best. The SNP\u2019s Stewart Hosie asks why the PM is being \u201cnegligent\u201d in not extending the Brexit transition. Johnson says a lot of people in the country want to see Brexit done, and the argument about it over. Fay Jones, a Conservative, says the Hay-on-Wye literary festival is going online this year. Does he look forward to it coming back? Johnson congratulates the organisers for turning it into Hay-on-Wifi. There has been a decrease in deaths related to coronavirus in Scotland, according to the latest weekly data from the National Records of Scotland. In the week up to 10 May, 415 deaths relating to Covid-19 have been registered, a decrease of 110 from the previous week. However, deaths in care homes still make up 57% of the total coronavirus deaths in Scotland, a much higher proportion than south of the border. There, Guardian data puts the figure at 40% deaths in care homes, although it is worth noting that the data in England and Wales is a week older. On this measure, which includes all deaths where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate, there have been a total of total of 3,213 deaths registered in Scotland. For the first time this week, the NRS has published additional analysis looking at the impact of deprivation on coronavirus death rates. Their analysis finds that people living in the most deprived areas of Scotland were 2.3 times more likely to die with Covid-19 than those living in the least deprived areas. Peter Bone, the Conservative, says the Electoral Commission hounded four Brexit campaigners until last week they were cleared. He says the \u201cpolitically corrupt, totally biased and morally bankrupt\u201d commission should be abolished. Johnson says people who publicised the investigation should report that no action is being taken. But he ignores the call for the commission\u2019s abolition. Labour\u2019s John Spellar says the Foreign Office is doing nothing to help people who indefinite leave to remain in the UK who are stranded abroad. Will the PM sort this out? Johnson says the government is doing everything it can to bring people back. Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, asks the government to extend support for the self-employed. He says he is glad the government has extended the furlough scheme as the Lib Dems proposed. Johnson jokes about Davey\u2019s attempt to take credit for Rishi Sunak\u2019s announcement. He says the current scheme will pay the self-employed up to \u00a37,500. Julian Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister, says 90% of the homeless are now in accommodation. Will the government ensure that is permanent. Johnson says the government wants to end rough sleeping by 2024. He says the government will invest in housing to make sure this can happen. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says people will have seen pictures of packed buses in London today. Does the PM accept that in Scotland people should stay at home? Johnson says, if you look at the totality of measures, there is much more that unites the nations of the UK than divides them. Blackford says the PM\u2019s encouragement for people to go to work is putting the progress at risk. He is risking workers\u2019 safety, he says. He says there should be sufficient levels of testing available. He says Johnson did not address the bus point. Johnson says he does not want to see crowding on buses, or anywhere else. He says he wants TfL to lay no more tube trains. On test, track and trace, he says this will be a huge operation for the whole country. Blackford should pay tribute to those involved. The UK now tests more than most other EU countries. And it will go up to 200,000 by the end of the month, he says. Johnson says he remains committed to getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Starmer says public confidence in government decisions is crucial. Will the government publish the scientific advice decisions are based on? Johnson says all Sage advice is published in due course. Sage has been involved at every stage, he says. He says we cannot risk a second outbreak. He says people can see what the government is trying to do. The common sense of the British people got us through the first stage, he says. It will get us through the next stage too. Starmer says it is the government that used to make this comparison. It is pretty obvious why the charts have been dropped, he says. He quotes Prof David Spiegelhalter saying comparisons are needed so that you can learn from other countries. If you drop the comparisons, you drop the learning. He turns to childcare, and quotes a couple who cannot go back to work when they don\u2019t have childcare. Johnson says the UK does want to learn from other countries. On childcare, he accepts that people without childcare cannot return to work. He will look into this case, he says. Starmer says you can only solve the problem if the numbers are understood. So he was disappointed the PM did not have a number, he says. He says the government used to compare the death toll with other countries. Yesterday the government stopped doing this. Why? Johnson says the government has been going through a once-in-a-century pandemic. He says he has been advised that it is too early to make reliable comparisons. But he says that when the final figures do emerge he knows they will not be \u201canything other than stark and deeply, deeply horrifying\u201d. He says Starmer should contain his impatience. Starmer quotes figures for excess deaths in care homes. The government must have looked into this. What is the government\u2019s explanation? Johnson says the ONS produces data, and the government produces data. Since the care home action plan began we are seeing an appreciable reduction in the number of deaths, he says. He says getting the R number down in care homes will be critical, he says. Starmer says he is surprised that Johnson queries his own government\u2019s advice. And he quotes from a doctor, quoted in the Telegraph. The cardiologist said: We discharged known, suspected and unknown cases into care homes, which were unprepared with no formal warning that the patients were infected, no testing available, and no PPE to prevent transmission. We actively seeded this into the very population that was most vulnerable. Starmer asks if the cardiologist was right. Johnson says people in care homes are being tested. Sir Keir Starmer says the PM said on Sunday that the government needed to reverse deaths in care homes. Yet until mid-March the advice said that people in care homes were unlikely to be affected. Does the government accept it was too slow to protect care homes. Johnson says Starmer is not right about the government advice. There is much more to do, but care home deaths are falling. Boris Johnson starts by saying yesterday was international nurses day. He thanks them for their work. He says 144 NHS staff and 131 care staff have now died from coronavirus. And he say what happened to Belly Mujinga, the railway ticket office worker who died of coronavirus after being spat at while on duty, was \u201cutterly appalling\u201d. PMQs is starting very soon. Here is the \u201ccall list\u201d (pdf) showing which MPs will be asking questions. Prof Ian Diamond, who as the UK\u2019s national statistician is head of the Office for National Statistics, has just finished giving evidence to the Commons public administration and constitutional affairs committee. Here are the main points. Diamond said the UK was \u201cat the higher level\u201d for coronavirus deaths in Europe, but that he was not prepared to say it had the worst record. Asked directly if the UK had the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, he replied: I\u2019m not prepared to say that at this time. I don\u2019t think that we have very good data in the UK and I do think that there is no doubt that we are, if you like, at the higher level for deaths. I\u2019ve no problem about saying that. Because of the great difficulty in understanding exactly whether we\u2019re comparing apples with apples, or apples with pears, I\u2019m not prepared to say that the UK has the highest. So, for example, if we look at the comparison with Italy, the most recent adjustment made in Italy only took us up to the end of March. We are much further on ... So there are very, very different data collection strategies in different countries. It will be some time, because of the way that other countries report, that I\u2019m able to give an authoritative answer to that question. Diamond also explained why comparing death rates in different countries could be misleading. He said: Let\u2019s just start with age. We know that, above all, this is a disease which really impacts the elderly members of society. So if you population has a radically different age structure, then one needs to do something about controlling for that. Ireland, for example, has a much younger age structure than some other parts of Europe. Secondly, we know from ONS data it\u2019s a pandemic which started in London. It takes much longer to move through rural areas. We need to know something about the degree of urbanisation, the degree to which people are living close together. These are areas that you really need to take into account, as well as the points that we\u2019ve that we\u2019ve already talked about, which are about making sure that the recording is comparative. The UK Statistics Authority has backed Downing Street\u2019s decision to stop publishing a daily global deaths comparison chart. At the hearing Ed Humpherson, director general for regulation at the authority, was giving evidence alongside Diamond and he was asked specifically about the move, which means No 10 no longer presents a daily chart showing the UK as having the worst record in Europe. Humpherson said: \u201cWe welcome the change that has come in in the last few days.\u201d Diamond said that if the coronavirus crisis caused an L-shaped recession, the economic impact could cause \u201ca significant number of deaths\u201d. He explained: If, and I stress if, we end up with an L-shaped recession, as opposed to a V-shape, where we come back out quite quickly, an L-shape over a long period of time could lead to a significant number of deaths as a result of people being pushed into poverty or into long-term unemployment, and we know that people in the lowest deciles of income have higher mortality rates, and if you increase that, you are likely to see an increase in deaths. He said the coronavirus death toll was not falling as quickly as people would like. He said: What we are seeing, I think now, is a reduction in deaths [directly and indirectly related to coronavirus], but not at the moment as speedy as we would perhaps like. He said the death registration process should be speeded up. He was frustrated at how long it took, he revealed. \u201cWe still receive death certificates through the post,\u201d he said.He urged the government to legislate that deaths must be registered electronically within 24 hours. He defended the decision to allow Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, to attend meetings of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. He said science was \u201calmost never black and white\u201d and \u201cif the scientists have a very detailed, nuanced conversation - those people who are going to be doing some of the policy-making, it helps that they understand the nuances\u201d. Diamond said the government\u2019s new contact-tracing app could only be part of an \u201cecosystem\u201d of measures to track the spread of the virus, rather than a total solution. He said: I fear that some of the most vulnerable members of our society will perhaps be the least likely to get the app, whether it is old people, whether it is people from disadvantaged groups. The \u201cbig four\u201d supermarket Morrisons is introducing a new \u201cspeedy shopping\u201d system from today for customers doing smaller \u201cbasket\u201d shops at all of its stores \u2013 to help them get in and out more quickly and cut lengthy queues in car parks. A separate speedy shopping lane will be introduced outside stores, allowing three customers to enter for every \u201cbig shop\u201d trolley shopper. Clear signage and dedicated staff will help guide shoppers and minimise queuing where possible. Inside there will be dedicated speedy shopper checkouts - operated by staff and self-scan. To increase the speed of payments for basket customers, more self-scan tills will offer payment by card only. The government is being urged to extend the coronavirus compensation scheme to transport workers following the death of a woman who died after being spat at on a railway concourse. Belly Mujinga was a ticket officer worker at London\u2019s Victoria station and was spat at while on duty by a member of the public claiming to have the virus. She died last month. In April, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, launched a compensation scheme for NHS and care workers who die with coronavirus, providing \u00a360,000 to the families of workers who die as a result of contracting the virus. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association has written to the prime minister asking for the scheme to be extended to transport workers. The union\u2019s general secretary, Manuel Cortes, said in the letter: Belly Mujinga was one of many transport workers bravely going to work to keep our country moving through the pandemic and ensuring that other key workers can get to their workplaces. She put herself on the front line and she has died of the virus. We\u2019re writing to ask you to extend the compensation scheme to Belly Mujinga\u2019s family and to other transport workers who die from coronavirus. While we can\u2019t change what happened to Belly, we can and should do everything in our power to prevent any more deaths from this horrific virus. Hundreds of workers have reported their employers over claims that they are fraudulently taking furlough money from the government while pressuring employees to continue working. HMRC confirmed it has received 795 reports of potential fraud related to the Job Retention Scheme and said it will now be \u201cassessing\u201d these cases in line with its usual procedures. The scheme was introduced from March, with the government pledging to pay 80% of the wages of workers affected by the pandemic, in a bid to protect jobs. On Tuesday, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, outlined plans to extend the furlough scheme until the end of October. The latest figures show that 7.5m jobs have been furloughed since its launch, with 935,000 employers choosing to furlough staff. One stipulation of the scheme is that workers must not complete any work at all for their organisations to be eligible for the payout. Bosses at whistleblower support organisations told Sky News that many workers are scared to report employers who are asking them to continue to work despite claiming furlough support. Liz Gardiner, the chief executive of Protect, said: We expect this is just the tip of the iceberg. In this time of unprecedented change, when people are really worried about their jobs, it\u2019s a really difficult thing to stand up and say: \u2018I think you\u2019re committing fraud, employer, and I\u2019m going to report you.\u2019 The Sky News story is here. Police in England have no powers to enforce two-metre social distancing. Fresh guidelines issued by the College of Policing and the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council urges officers to only enforce what is written in law and that \u201cgovernment guidance is not enforceable, for example two-metre distancing, avoiding public transport or the wearing of face coverings in enclosed spaces\u201d. However, the guidance states police in Wales can enforce two-metre distancing, apart from in the workplace, where the requirement for safe distancing lies with Welsh local authorities. The advice, set out in a document published on Wednesday after being sent out to forces on Tuesday night, follows updated coronavirus legislation coming into force. Fines for breaches of regulation in England have increased - up to \u00a3100 for first-time offences, with a maximum sum of up to \u00a33,200. However, in Wales levels of fines still start at \u00a360 up to a maximum of \u00a3120. Guidance differs still in Scotland and Northern Ireland - we\u2019ve outlined the differences in guidance across the regions. Funds to support charities during the coronavirus crisis are \u201cbedevilled by delay and a lack of transparency\u201d, according to the chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO). Karl Wilding said of the \u00a3750m package announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, \u201cit remains unclear how roughly half of the \u00a3160m allocated for distribution via central government departments is to be spent\u201d. Wilding said charities in some areas have been asked by departments to bid for funding, while others have heard nothing. \u201cThis does nothing for confidence in how decisions are being made,\u201d he said. \u201cThe process needs to be simple and open.\u201d He added it is still unclear when organisations will be able to apply for the \u00a3370m to be distributed via the National Lottery Community Fund (NLCF). \u201cReassurances that funding will be made available soon are starting to wear thin,\u201d he said. \u201cI have told the government and the NLCF that this pace isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d He is calling on the government to offer clarity on how funds will be distributed, and what criteria will be used in decision making. More than 22,000 care home residents in England and Wales may have died as a direct or indirect result of Covid-19, academics have calculated - more than double the number stated as passing away from the disease in official figures, our colleague Robert Booth reports. Today is the official start of step one of the move towards recovery set out by Boris Johnson in his coronavirus recovery plan. Theoretically the plan covers the UK, but the step one measures announced by the PM - particularly the suggestion that people who cannot work from home should go to work even if their job is non-essential - only apply to England. In London the advice may be having some impact. According to Transport for London, the number of passengers using the London Underground today from the start of service to 6am was up by 8.7% compared with the same period last week. The Cabinet Office has announced that five ministerial-led task forces will be established to determine how to reopen pubs, beauty salons, places of worship and leisure centres, as well as re-boot the aviation sector. In a statement, the Cabinet Office said it was the \u201cgovernment\u2019s ambition to open as many of these other businesses and public places as possible over the coming months, when the scientific advice provided allows us to\u201d. The five task forces will look at the following sectors: Pubs and restaurants, led by the Department for Business, Energy and industrial Strategy (BEIS). Non-essential retail, including salons (BEIS); Recreation and leisure, including tourism, culture and heritage, libraries, entertainment and sport (Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport). Places of worship, including faith, community and public buildings (Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government). International aviation (Department for Transport). These five ministerial groups will help to decide how the government moves towards steps two and three, in phase two, guided by the five tests, and the five alert levels. Sam Macrory at the Institute for Government has a good explanation. According to the Telegraph leak (paywall) the Treasury now believes the UK is more likely to get a U-shaped recovery than a V-shaped one. The paper reports: The document, drawn up by the chancellor\u2019s policy advisers, says \u201ca more realistic scenario\u201d than the idea of a V-shaped recovery is a \u201cprolonged recovery and some permanent damage to the economy\u201d \u2013 in other words, a U-shaped recovery. In the Treasury\u2019s own worst-case prediction, the economy would go through an \u201cL-shaped\u201d recovery, meaning economic output would remain below current forecasts for the next five years, leading to a large structural deficit and a budget deficit running to one third of GDP. In an interview with the BBC this morning, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, refused to deny that this reflected Treasury thinking. This is from the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam. The archbishop of Canterbury has been making undercover visits to minister to patients at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London, it has been reported. Justin Welby has regularly volunteered as a chaplain at the hospital, which is close to Lambeth Palace, his London home, according to the Daily Telegraph (paywall). He has worn PPE over his black clerical shirt and dog collar, the paper said. A source close to Welby told the paper Justin has been a volunteer chaplain at St Thomas\u2019s hospital since lockdown, working alongside other chaplains praying for the sick and dying. Tommy\u2019s is his local hospital so he walks there. He gets a lot of solace from doing it. Just being able to physically see people and pray with them during lockdown \u2013 it\u2019s what the clergy has been doing the length and breadth of the country. There is some personal risk but he doesn\u2019t really think about that. He just thinks this is what Christians should be doing, helping others. Hate crime toward south Asian and far-east Asian communities has increased 21% during the coronavirus crisis, as have reported incidents of \u201crevenge porn\u201d, ministers have told MPs. Lady Williams, minister for countering extremism, told a home affairs select committee (Hasc) session on online harms during the Covid-19 pandemic that there had not been an increase in extremism generally but there had been increases in specific types of hate crime. She said: \u201cExtremism - certainly we\u2019ve not seen an uptick in it generally but during the lockdown period, I\u2019ve been speaking to our hate crime lead, and there\u2019s been a 21% uptick in hate incident against the IC4 and IC5 community.\u201d IC codes are used by the police in radio communications and crime recording systems to describe the apparent ethnicity of a suspect or victim - IC4 relates to South Asian and IC5 relates to the Far East. Hate crime attacks against Chinese people in the UK have been well-documented during the lockdown period, including individuals being spat and assaulted. Police estimates suggest hate crime towards Chinese people is up three-fold. In addition, Caroline Dinenage, digital and culture minister, told the committee that there had been a rise in revenge porn - that is, the sharing of private, sexual materials, either photos or videos, of another person without their consent both online and offline. Dinenage said: \u201cFor adult users \u2013 we\u2019ve seen a concerning increasing trend in things like revenge porn and sexploitation, calls to helplines along the lines of things like that.\u201d Here are three economics commentators on the Telegraph story about the Treasury leak. (See 9.30am.) These are from Jonathan Portes, a former government economist who is now an economics professor at King\u2019s College London. This is from Rupert Harrison, who was chief of staff for George Osborne when Osborne was chancellor. And Paul Mason, the former Newsnight economics editor who is now a prominent Labour campaigner, has posted a Twitter thread on the leak. It starts here. And here are two of his proposals. On the first day businesses in England are encouraged to resume operations, there was a noticeable rise in numbers of commuters across the capital during rush hour. Waterloo station remained quiet, although a station shift manager told the PA Media news agency there had been an increase in passengers. The manager said footfall throughout the crisis had been around 5% the normal level, which had risen to around 7% on Monday and Tuesday and around 10% on Wednesday so far. Traffic was quick to build up during rush hour on the North Circular Road in London. When announcing the easing of lockdown restrictions on Sunday evening, Boris Johnson asked commuters to avoid public transport if they could. But this video has surfaced on social media, showing people get off a busy bus in Stratford, east London, at around 6.30am this morning. Yesterday the government admitted commuters may not be able to practise physical distancing effectively on public transport. The Department for Transport said anyone who needs to take public transport should wear face masks, keep their distance from fellow travellers and try to avoid rush hour. Here is another line from the Grant Shapps morning interview round. Expanding on something Matt Hancock said yesterday, Shapps, the transport secretary, said people who book a foreign holiday might lose all their money. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. As Rowena Mason reports, Shapps also said in a separate interview that he would not personally get on a crowded bus or tube. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. This morning the Daily Telegraph has splashed on the leak of an internal Treasury reports suggesting that tax rises or a public sector wage freeze are being considered as options that might be needed to help the government cover the cost of the coronavirus crisis. The story (paywall) is by Gordon Rayner and Anna Mikhailova. This is how it starts. A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis estimates that it will cost the exchequer almost \u00a3300bn this year and could require measures including an increase in income tax, the end of the triple lock on state pension increases and a two-year public sector pay freeze. The Telegraph can reveal that a Treasury document drawn up for Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, sets out a proposed \u201cpolicy package\u201d of tax increases and spending reductions which may have to be announced within weeks in order to \u201cenhance credibility and boost investor confidence\u201d in the British economy. The document, dated May 5 and marked \u201cOfficial \u2013 market sensitive\u201d, reveals that the \u201cbase case scenario\u201d now forecasts that Britain will have a \u00a3337bn budget deficit this year, compared to the forecast \u00a355bn in March\u2019s budget. According to the report, the document says the Conservatives might have to break the \u201ctax lock\u201d promise they made at the election. [The Treasury document] states: \u201cTo fill a gap this size [in the public finances] through tax revenue risers would be very challenging without breaking the tax lock. To raise fiscally significant amounts, we would either have to increase rates/thresholds in one of the broad-based taxes (IT, NICS, VAT, CT) or reform one of the biggest tax reliefs (eg pensions tax).\u201d And the document also floats the prospect of spending or welfare cuts, the Telegraph reports. The document suggests a two-year freeze on public sector pay could generate savings of \u00a36.5 billion by 2023-24 while \u201cstopping the rising cost\u201d of the pension triple lock would produce savings of \u00a38 billion a year. The Treasury declined to discuss the report last night, but a source said it the document \u201cdoes not reflect government policy\u201d. This morning, in an interview on LBC, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, was evasive about the possibility of tax increases. But on Sky News, echoing language used by Boris Johnson, Shapps was more emphatic about the government rejecting a return to austerity. He said: In terms of payment, we\u2019ll have to have future budgets, we\u2019ll get to that, but right now we are still in the midst of this thing and we\u2019re clear that we\u2019re not going to go back to world of austerity in order to do that. The chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales has said a public sector pay freeze to help the country\u2019s financial recovery post-coronavirus would be \u201cmorally bankrupt\u201d and a \u201cdeep and damaging betrayal\u201d. In a series of tweets this morning, John Apter said the public sector workforce had \u201cstepped up to save lives... often putting themselves at risk and making personal sacrifices\u201d. The Telegraph reported this morning (paywall) that a confidential Treasury document drawn up for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, sets out a series of proposed measures including an increase in income tax, the end of the triple lock on state pension increases and a two-year public sector pay freeze. The report said the policies may need to be announced within weeks, with the document saying it is now forecast Britain\u2019s budget deficit will rise to \u00a3337bn, compared to the \u00a355bn forecast in March\u2019s budget. Apter said doctors, nurses, paramedics, prison officers, teachers, firefighters and many more had been the glue which held the country together during the crisis, and \u201cif there is any consideration in financially punishing our public sector workers then I urge a rethink\u201d. He finished by saying: The number of vehicles sold by Aston Martin almost halved in the first three months of the year, as the British luxury carmaker was hit by the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. The company said it had sold 578 vehicles in the first quarter, down from 1,057 in the same period last year. It caused loss after tax to soar to \u00a3118.9m, up from \u00a317.3m the year before, on revenue of \u00a378.6m, down 60%. \u201cCovid-19 and the resulting global economic shutdown has had a material impact on our performance this quarter,\u201d said Dr Andy Palmer, president and group chief executive. All its manufacturing sites in the UK were closed from 25 March, and 93% of its network of dealers shut their doors at some point during the first quarter. Unsurprisingly, demand from dealers had been hit during the crisis. Sales in China dropped by 86%, with the Europe, Middle East and Africa region dropping 30%. Sales tumbled by 57% in the Americas. The UK was more resilient, falling a mere 3%. However, the company revealed what could be the first shoots of recovery. All 18 of its dealerships in China have reopened, and more than 15% of the global network are \u201cfully open\u201d. On Monday it started producing bodies for its first luxury SUV at the St Athan factory, which opened last week. Despite positive signs, most of Aston Martin\u2019s staff are still furloughed, and its factories are only working to fulfil the orders they already have. The company had already been struggling before the crisis hit, and its share price is down 93% compared to when it listed in October 2018. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has warned that the country will have to \u201cgo back to staying at home\u201d if too many people try to use the public transport system. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: If we see the R number go up again - particularly above one - we will have to take steps. We all know what that means - it means going back to staying at home. We have got a big team of marshallers going out through Network Rail, Transport for London, we have got the British Transport Police out there, and we are even bringing in volunteers to remind people that we don\u2019t want to see platforms crowded. As stark figures on Covid-19 deaths among BAME nurses emerge, we need to celebrate their generations-long contribution. Despite accounting for just 20% of the workforce, 94% of doctors and 71% of nurses who have died from Covid-19 were black, Asian and minority ethnic. It has prompted NHS England to recommend risk assessments for BAME frontline staff to reduce their exposure to the virus. Other pandemics have also proven deadly for medical staff. Health workers caught flu during both the 1918 and 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics. And while an ethnic breakdown of the data is not available, some of the casualties of the 1957 and 1968 epidemics will have been black, Asian or from ethnic minorities. It is even possible some BAME nurses working in the UK died in the 1918 epidemic. We just don\u2019t know. But nurses from BAME backgrounds have been working in the NHS for generations. Although many were part of the Windrush generation, coming from the Caribbean to the UK from 1948 to 1971 to work in the newly established NHS, they were not the first arrivals. By 1954, more than 3,000 Caribbean women were training in British hospitals. By 1959, official statistics showed 6,365 nursing students in Britain who had come here from overseas. By 1966-67 the total number of nurses and midwives from overseas who trained here had risen to 16,745. Research (Aunt Esther) by social historian Stephen Bourne has revealed that black nurses worked in the healthcare system long before the NHS was even thought of. Most would have been from within the British empire, including the Caribbean, India and countries in Africa. An \u201cextraordinary, exceptional and astonishing\u201d GP has died aged 84 after contracting coronavirus. Dr Karamat Ullah Mirza worked at Old Road Medical Practice at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. He died in hospital on Sunday. His widow, Estelle, told the Clacton Gazette: He was no ordinary man, he was an extraordinary, exceptional and astonishing man, who was absolutely fearless and daring and had enormous knowledge. He worked endlessly for the NHS and non-stop for this country, and he was known and loved by everyone in Clacton and he loved all his staff and patients and this town. She said he had been seeing patients until two weeks ago. Dr Ed Garratt, chief executive of the NHS Ipswich &amp; East Suffolk, NHS West Suffolk and NHS North East Essex clinical commissioning groups, said: We are deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dr Mirza, a respected and much-loved GP who had served the patients in his local community for more than four decades. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and practice colleagues, and all our efforts will be focused on supporting them at this difficult time. A small number of people who had contact with Dr Mirza are self-isolating at home as appropriate. The Old Road Surgery in Clacton and its branch practice in St Osyth will be closed until Wednesday of this week at the earliest. Both have undergone deep cleansing as a precaution. Food waste generated by UK restaurants dishing up takeaways during the lockdown has risen as a result of consumers\u2019 \u201cunpredictable ordering patterns\u201d during the pandemic, research has revealed. Unusual fluctuations in demand have led to an increase in food waste generated in takeaway outlets rising from an average of \u00a3111 per restaurant per week in normal times to \u00a3148 \u2013 equivalent to a \u00a316.7m rise for the sector as a whole since lockdown, according to the research. Nearly half the restaurants surveyed \u2013 45% \u2013 said they throw most food waste into the bin. Despite the erratic ordering patterns, consumers appear to be wasting less than they usually would in their own homes, the report found. Britain\u2019s fondness for takeaway food has created a \u00a35bn-a-year business that has ballooned in the past decade. In recent weeks, the options have expanded as many restaurants have turned to takeout and delivery as an alternative to closure. Parents of severely disabled children, are the \u201cforgotten families on the brink of collapse\u201d and are warning that they urgently need support as they are at the point of burnout. Families with vulnerable children are providing complex, round-the-clock care with no respite or outside help. Many have had to cancel home carers\u2019 services because of the lack of sufficient PPE or testing. Others are struggling to cope after respite and outside care services were cancelled. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough special educational needs staff at my daughter\u2019s school to send her back,\u201d said Jean Wilson, the mother of 17-year-old Emily, who is autistic, with severe learning disabilities and challenging behaviour. My husband and I have to look after her 24 hours a day with no help because the local authority carers have been furloughed, while no thought has gone into giving direct support. It has put a huge emotional and physical strain on an army of unseen parent-carers. Shapps said a line had to be drawn \u201cin order to gradually release things\u201d, when asked why people can go to property viewings but not see family members outside of their household. He told BBC Breakfast We must understand, we have done so well in the last eight weeks we cannot throw that all away, and so these are baby steps. If someone visits a home (for sale), that\u2019s likely to be a one-off, if you are starting to visit your family again, that\u2019s likely to be many more times. Somewhere there has to be a line drawn where we say this is ok but this isn\u2019t, in order to gradually release things. And this is where that line is at the moment. When asked about railway ticket officer Belly Mujinga, who died with coronavirus after being spat at while on duty at Victoria station, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said around 50 transport workers have died during the crisis. He told BBC Breakfast: My heart goes out to Belly\u2019s family. Nobody should be spat at. This is not a question of PPE, it\u2019s just disgusting and I know that the British Transport Police are investigating. So very, very sad, her death and indeed the deaths of around 50 transport workers is something I take particularly seriously. Shapps said he had sent guidance to service operators, adding that personal protective equipment (PPE) was not \u201cbroadly recommended\u201d for transport workers by Public Health England. \u201cClearly, nobody should ever be spitting at somebody; that\u2019s a criminal offence and I know that investigation is under way,\u201d he said. A 14-year-old boy with no underlying health conditions died from a Kawasaki-like disease linked to coronavirus. The teenager was part of a cluster of eight cases treated at the Evelina London children\u2019s hospital over a 10-day period in April. As of last week, the hospital has seen more than 20 children with the illness, according to a report from the Evelina medical team published in The Lancet medical journal. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said last month that experts are investigating the new syndrome in children \u201cwith great urgency\u201d but has stressed it is rare. The condition is said to be similar to Kawasaki disease, which mainly affects children under the age of five, with symptoms including a high temperature, rashes, swelling and a toxic shock style response. The 14-year-old spent six days in intensive care at the Evelina and tested positive for Covid-19 following his death, his medical team reported. His main symptoms on being admitted to the hospital were a temperature over 40C, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and headache. The youngest child in the cluster treated at the Evelina was aged four and two others were six. Two of the children in the cluster, including the boy who died, were obese. The report said: All children were previously fit and well. Six of the children were of Afro-Caribbean descent, and five of the children were boys. Medics said all the children had similar symptoms when they were admitted, including \u201cunrelenting fever\u201d, \u201cvariable rash\u201d, conjunctivitis, swelling, pain and \u201csignificant gastrointestinal symptoms\u201d. Most of the children had no significant respiratory symptoms during their time in hospital, although seven were put on a ventilator to stabilise their cardiovascular systems. All of the children survived apart from the 14-year-old. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has urged people not to \u201cflood back\u201d on to public transport as they return to work. The government said businesses in England closed because of the coronavirus pandemic should consider reopening from Wednesday if they can do so safely. However, Shapps warned that the need to maintain social distancing meant capacity on the transport network would be limited. He told Sky News: We are asking people to be very sensible and not flood back to public transport. Even with all the trains and buses back to running when they are, there will not be enough space. One-in-10 people will be able to travel without overcrowding. It is very important that we enable enough space on public transport for key workers, people who have no other option. It is very important that people don\u2019t overcrowd that system that will be extremely restricted for the time being. Park rangers and security will \u201cstep in\u201d if social distancing measures are ignored at open spaces, the boss of London\u2019s Olympic Park has warned as restrictions on outdoor activities are eased. Visitors will be watched closely, with many expected to flock to parks and recreational areas following the government\u2019s relaxation of the \u201cstay local\u201d message in England, meaning people can drive to outdoor open areas. Mark Camley, executive director of parks and venues at the London Legacy Development Corporation which runs the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London, has urged people not to travel far and to enjoy the outdoor spaces nearby. Speaking on behalf of London\u2019s major park authorities, Camley also said the police may get involved if people continually ignore the two-metre distancing advice. He told the PA Media news agency: The expectation now is that people will go out more as it gets warmer, so parks across London will have to introduce measures to ensure people stay two metres apart. Messaging has been put out on pathways and fences around Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in Stratford, for example, urging people to abide by social distancing measures, and to not engage with people outside their household. We\u2019ve even used the screen on the London Stadium to push the message out there. We are really relying on people to use their own common sense, but some will ignore the advice unfortunately, and we will be deploying security and park rangers where necessary to step in and have a quiet word reminding those to stay apart. If there are major issues, I think parks would not hesitate in getting the police involved, but we don\u2019t want to get to that, we really want people to use their common sense. An open letter to the public by park bosses, including the royal parks such as Hyde Park, advises people to \u201cstay local\u201d to avoid crowding in popular areas, and to try and walk or cycle to outdoor areas. The letter said: \u201cIt might be that on occasions those working hard to keep these spaces open will ask people to move on as areas are getting too crowded, please respect that and be kind in your response as they are only doing their job to keep open spaces safe. We ask you to support us so we don\u2019t risk losing these opportunities.\u201d Elsewhere in the UK, visitors to the South Downs national park have been advised to stick to the path, keep their dogs on their lead and take their litter home, while much further north people are being warned not to \u201crush back\u201d to the Lake District. Other authorities will be keeping car parks closed and will not be reopening tennis courts or golf courses immediately to avoid crowds of visitors congregating. Holiday giant Tui is looking to cut up to 8,000 roles worldwide with the firm calling Covid-19 the \u201cgreatest crisis\u201d the industry has faced. The UK\u2019s biggest tour operator posted losses of \u20ac845.8m (\u00a3747m) in the first half of 2020, compared with \u20ac289.1m (\u00a3255m) in the same period 12 months previously. The Anglo-German company said: We are targeting to permanently reduce our overhead cost base by 30% across the entire group. This will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced. Fritz Joussen, chief executive of the firm, said the company should \u201cemerge from the crisis stronger\u201d. He added: It will be a different Tui and it will find a different market environment than before the pandemic. This will require cuts: in investments, in costs, in our size and our presence around the world. We must be leaner than before, more efficient, faster and more digital. The company\u2019s report said: \u201cThe tourism industry has weathered a number of macroeconomic shocks throughout the most recent decades, however the Covid-19 pandemic is unquestionably the greatest crisis the industry and Tui has ever faced.\u201d It added that losses also came as a result of international air safety regulators grounding the Boeing 737 Max aircraft, after two fatal crashes. The British independent festival sector is at risk of collapsing, with many cancelled events falling through the cracks of government support measures for businesses suffering as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF), which represents 65 festivals in the UK, including Gloucestershire\u2019s 2000trees, London\u2019s Meltdown and Sheffield\u2019s Tramlines, reports 92% of its members saying they face costs that could ruin their businesses as a result of cancelled events, with the vast majority (98.5%) not covered by insurance for cancellation related to Covid-19. Costs include potential refunds of up to \u00a3800m for events that were due to take place this summer, and average non-recoupable costs of \u00a3375,000 per festival for overheads such as marketing, staffing and advertising. A member survey has revealed that the sector could be facing redundancies of 59% on average and will lose more than half of its workforce between September 2020 and February 2021 without support. The AIF chief executive, Paul Reed, says that many independent festivals aren\u2019t able to access funds through the government\u2019s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme because they are unable to meet eligibility criteria, while the bounce-back loan scheme, capped at \u00a350,000, doesn\u2019t adequately cover what they need to stay afloat without income for this year. More than \u00a310,000 has been raised for the family of a railway ticket office worker who died with coronavirus after being spat at while on duty. Belly Mujinga, who had an 11-year-old daughter, was on the concourse of Victoria station in London when a member of the public who said he had Covid-19 spat and coughed at her and a colleague. Both women fell ill with the virus, and Mujinga died in hospital in Barnet 11 days after the attack on 5 April. A fundraising page for Mujinga\u2019s family has surpassed its \u00a31,000 target and stood at \u00a310,560 on Wednesday morning. The attack on Mujinga, who had underlying respiratory problems, was widely condemned, with Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) general secretary, Manuel Cortes, saying he was \u201cshocked and devastated\u201d at the death. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: \u201cIt is despicable for a key worker to be attacked in this way while serving the travelling public.\u201d Mujinga\u2019s husband, Lusamba Gode Katalay, described how the suspect walked up to her and spat in her face on 22 March. \u201cThe man asked her what she was doing, why she was there, and she said they were working. The man said he had the virus and spat on them. They reported it.\u201d Within a week of the incident, she began to feel ill and was admitted to hospital on 2 April. He said: That was the last time I saw her. We just said: \u2018Be good,\u2019 and that God is in charge. We did a WhatsApp video in hospital, but then I didn\u2019t hear from her again. I thought she might be asleep, but the doctor phoned me to tell me she had died. Good morning, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be leading the UK live blog for the next few hours, on the first day coronavirus lockdown restrictions are being eased \u2013 in varying ways \u2013 around the country. From today in England, people are allowed unlimited exercise outside, with limited socialising in open spaces, and businesses are encouraged to reopen. But the rules aren\u2019t being relaxed to the same degree in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: here\u2019s how the lockdown now differs across the UK. Breaking news this morning has revealed the UK economy suffered its worst contraction since the depths of the financial crisis due to Covid-19. Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 2% in the first three months of 2020, new figures released by the Office for National Statistics show, the worst fall since the end of 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. Business live will be following the economic implications closely throughout the day.

      "bodyText": "Hatice Cengiz, the fianc\u00e9e of the murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, has implored Newcastle United supporters to mobilise against the prospective Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of the club. Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, has agreed a \u00a3300m deal with a consortium comprising the financier Amanda Staveley, the property company Reuben Brothers and Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund. The plan is for PIF to assume an 80% stake and, with the deal in its fifth week of scrutiny by the Premier League, completion could be close. Although the vexed issue of the kingdom\u2019s human rights record is beyond the parameters of the Premier League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, the governing body is examining allegations of broadcast piracy against Saudi Arabia. Newcastle\u2019s prospective Saudi majority owners have denied any link to the BeoutQ piracy. Cengiz, whose fianc\u00e9 was killed inside Saudi Arabia\u2019s embassy in Istanbul in 2018, believes that remit should be extended to the country\u2019s human rights abuses, already highlighted by Amnesty International. Newcastle fans have no direct power to veto the buyout but she hopes they will demand the Premier League block a deal many regard as a blatant attempt to \u201csportswash\u201d Saudi\u2019s international image. \u201cI write to you at a crucial time in the history of your famous club,\u201d wrote Cengiz in an open letter to Newcastle fans. \u201cCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the absolute ruler of Saudi Arabia, is aiming to take over your club by offering a huge sum of money. \u201cI know that many of you are tempted by his offer to get out of the dire situation that has crippled your club for so many years. But the Crown Prince is accused of ordering Jamal\u2019s murder. My plea to you is to think whether accepting [the] offer is really the right way out of the despair for your club. \u201cYou as the loyal fans do have a big say in this. I implore you all to unite to protect your beloved club and city. They are making this move not with your best interests in mind, but solely to serve themselves. Their hearts will not genuinely be in the club that means everything to you. Now is the moment to stand tall together for the game, your club, your city and your country in order to slam shut the door on this offensive deal.\u201d Saudi Arabia has described Khashoggi\u2019s murder as a rogue operation of which the heir to the throne knew nothing. An investigation by Agn\u00e8s Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, found that Saudi Arabia was responsible under human rights law for the murder and that it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d the operation that resulted in his death could not have been implemented without Bin Salman being aware a criminal mission was being launched against the journalist. Despite the late emergence of new documents related to alleged broadcast piracy, sources close to the takeover remain optimistic an agreement broadly welcomed by Newcastle fans will be approved in the near future. They maintain \u201cno red flags\u201d have been raised and that the delay has been partly prompted by the Premier League\u2019s necessary preoccupation with Project Restart. Meanwhile Ashley, who has received a \u00a317m non-refundable deposit, is understood to be eager to see the balance paid in order to help address coronavirus-induced cashflow problems in his high street retail empire. The Newcastle midfielder Jonjo Shelvey has revealed Steve Bruce\u2019s players remain in the dark about the takeover. \u201cWe\u2019re the same as the fans,\u201d said Shelvey. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Although Shelvey said Ashley had \u201calways been good to me\u201d, the former England international would welcome a buyout. \u201cI think it would be good for the fans, the club and the city.\u201d It is understood Newcastle have removed some employees from the government\u2019s furlough scheme as active staffing levels rise ahead of the squad\u2019s return to training next week.",

Conversely, others were excluded, because the extraction and analysis of data from various NHS records systems \u2013 some maintained by GPs, others by hospital doctors \u2013 failed to correctly identify their extra risk from Covid and thus the need to stay indoors. The list has also risen to 2.5 million because patients not on the original list approached their GP to request to go on it, often because they were scared of contracting Covid as a result of going into work. The government\u2019s review of shielding individuals is being led by the Department of Health and Social Care and will report by the end of next month. A spokesman for the department said: \u201cThese claims [of a large jump in numbers] are completely misleading \u2013 people are added and removed from the shielding list regularly based on their GP\u2019s clinical judgment, as they are best placed to advise on the needs of their individual patients during this time. \u201cAs each day passes we learn more about this virus and its impact on people, and we will continue to do all we can to protect people.\u201d Those currently in the shielding group include people with specific cancers, solid organ transplant recipients, those with severe respiratory conditions, people with certain conditions that suppress the immune system and pregnant women with significant heart disease. The review is likely to produce advice that is more nuanced about which categories of people are facing the greatest risk, advising some they may be able to take more risks and others that they need to be more cautious. The government\u2019s medical advisers are also considering the impact of other risk factors such as how the virus disproportionally affects older people, men, people who are overweight and those with other underlying conditions. It is conducting a separate review of the impact of coronavirus on the death rate for those from minority ethnic backgrounds.",

But it said: \u201cWe are not aware of whether government departments picked up on any of the recommendations set out.\u201d</p> \n<p>A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAs the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans \u2013 allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis. Our planning helped prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and means we are past the peak of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>The fresh allegations come as Boris Johnson was accused of downplaying the threat to care homes as recently as March, while a study from the London School of Economics (LSE) put the death toll for care home residents in England and Wales at 22,000, more than double the official estimate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity\">'Harvesting' is a terrible word \u2013&nbsp;but it's what has happened in Britain's care homes | Richard Coker</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On a day of rising pressure over the failure better to protect the elderly and vulnerable against the coronavirus outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-resorts-to-bluster-under-keir-starmer-cross-examination\">Keir Starmer used prime minister\u2019s questions</a> to ask why Public Health England (PHE) had advised in March that care home residents were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to become infected by Covid-19. This was PHE\u2019s position as the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic and people were already dying in the UK.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader said the government had been \u201ctoo slow to protect people in care homes\u201d, and Johnson was forced to admit that \u201cthe number of casualties has been too high\u201d in the sector.</p> \n<p>Stamer said the final coronavirus death toll, currently standing at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">just over 40,000</a> in the UK, including care homes, hospitals and private homes, would be \u201cdeeply horrifying\u201d.</p> \n<p>The advice on the \u201cunlikely\u201d threat posed by Covid-19 to care homes was changed on 13 March and Downing Street said it was drawn up at a time when there were no infections in the UK. But the clash highlighted growing anger over the attention and resourcing given to preparing care homes as ministers focused on preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>In a sign of shifting priorities, the government announced a \u00a3600m cash injection for care homes to help control infection.</p> \n<p>The report prepared by Adass for the government in 2018 followed a government pandemic planning exercise known as Cygnus, which uncovered the need to boost the capacity of care homes and staff numbers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5db220bd-91df-44be-8f21-f47c8505b40b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xAU2euHH8v0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>They stated that frontline care workers would need advice on \u201ccontrolling cross-infection\u201d and called for a system for mustering volunteers from families, charities and the community to help overwhelmed homes. They also called for new guidance on increasing stocks of PPE, with a prescient warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d. </p> \n<p>Care operators have struggled to limit cross-infection, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/the-observer-view-on-care-home-deaths-being-an-indictment-of-our-society\">outbreaks</a> killing more than two dozen residents in some facilities in the space of a few weeks. Staff absences have been running at 10% to 20% and early in the crisis the care industry complained that it was not covered by the government\u2019s NHS volunteering scheme.</p> \n<p>A survey of more than 100 care homes published on Wednesday by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society found 43% were still not confident of their PPE supply, with one home resorting to taping bags around carers\u2019 arms, feet and hair.

      "bodyText": "Ministers faced fresh allegations on Wednesday of failing to prepare care homes for a pandemic, as it emerged that Covid-19 may have killed 22,000 residents in England and Wales \u2013 more than twice the official toll. Council social care directors in England warned the government two years ago, in a series of detailed reports, about care homes\u2019 exposure to a pandemic, the Guardian has learned. They called for better supply plans for personal protective equipment \u2013 warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d \u2013 plus improved infection control and a system to enlist volunteers to help services expected to be stretched to breaking point. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (Adass), which represents directors of adult social services in England, told the Guardian it carried out the work to improve government planning for a flu pandemic at the request of the Department of Health and Social Care. But it said: \u201cWe are not aware of whether government departments picked up on any of the recommendations set out.\u201d A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cAs the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans \u2013 allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis. Our planning helped prevent the NHS being overwhelmed and means we are past the peak of the virus.\u201d The fresh allegations come as Boris Johnson was accused of downplaying the threat to care homes as recently as March, while a study from the London School of Economics (LSE) put the death toll for care home residents in England and Wales at 22,000, more than double the official estimate. On a day of rising pressure over the failure better to protect the elderly and vulnerable against the coronavirus outbreak, Keir Starmer used prime minister\u2019s questions to ask why Public Health England (PHE) had advised in March that care home residents were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to become infected by Covid-19. This was PHE\u2019s position as the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic and people were already dying in the UK. The Labour leader said the government had been \u201ctoo slow to protect people in care homes\u201d, and Johnson was forced to admit that \u201cthe number of casualties has been too high\u201d in the sector. Stamer said the final coronavirus death toll, currently standing at just over 40,000 in the UK, including care homes, hospitals and private homes, would be \u201cdeeply horrifying\u201d. The advice on the \u201cunlikely\u201d threat posed by Covid-19 to care homes was changed on 13 March and Downing Street said it was drawn up at a time when there were no infections in the UK. But the clash highlighted growing anger over the attention and resourcing given to preparing care homes as ministers focused on preventing the NHS from being overwhelmed. In a sign of shifting priorities, the government announced a \u00a3600m cash injection for care homes to help control infection. The report prepared by Adass for the government in 2018 followed a government pandemic planning exercise known as Cygnus, which uncovered the need to boost the capacity of care homes and staff numbers. They stated that frontline care workers would need advice on \u201ccontrolling cross-infection\u201d and called for a system for mustering volunteers from families, charities and the community to help overwhelmed homes. They also called for new guidance on increasing stocks of PPE, with a prescient warning that \u201cdemand for PPE could rapidly outstrip supply\u201d. Care operators have struggled to limit cross-infection, with outbreaks killing more than two dozen residents in some facilities in the space of a few weeks. Staff absences have been running at 10% to 20% and early in the crisis the care industry complained that it was not covered by the government\u2019s NHS volunteering scheme. A survey of more than 100 care homes published on Wednesday by the Alzheimer\u2019s Society found 43% were still not confident of their PPE supply, with one home resorting to taping bags around carers\u2019 arms, feet and hair. Some 58% of homes said they were unable to isolate residents, and one-third said they had taken in Covid-positive patients discharged from hospital. The latest assessment of fatalities in care settings by LSE academics found that more than half of all \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in England and Wales \u2013 those above the five-year average for the period from 28 December to 1 May \u2013 happened in care homes. They said that from 13 March to 1 May, care homes accounted for 19,938 excess deaths. Only 8,310 of those were specifically linked to Covid-19 by the Office of National Statistics (ONS), reflecting the declarations of care homes rather than on death certificates. The researchers added that deaths of care home residents in hospitals were not currently represented in the ONS figures, and that around 15% of deaths of care home residents happened in hospitals , bringing the total to more than 22,000. The report authors, Adelina Comas-Herrera and Jos\u00e9-Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, have been tracking virus death tolls in care homes globally since the start of the pandemic. They cited concerns raised internationally about deaths being linked to the residents being isolated in their rooms, without adequate food, drink or medical support, and not to the virus itself. The ONS appeared to support their estimate, saying its data showed just under 20,000 excess deaths registered up to 1 May in care homes since the pandemic started. \u201cOf those, 8,312 have had Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe are undertaking further analysis on all deaths of care home residents which will be published in the coming days.\u201d On Wednesday, Downing Street confirmed that the international comparison of death rates by country had been dropped from the slide at the daily press conference, but denied that it was because of embarrassment that the UK is now shown as having the second worst toll after the US.",

      "body": "<p>Self-care is a fuzzy concept, part of the fuzzy family that includes mindfulness, gratitude practices, wellness and other more or less abstract nouns frequently found in captions on Instagram under pictures of bendy people smiling at salads. It is most often used to cover activities that would be better classed under \u201cminor indulgences\u201d or \u201cacts of selfishness so profound I need to obfuscate my sociopathy immediately\u201d. But sometimes it means something closer to self-preservation. It is in this sense that I wish to advise you that \u2013 short of going out and licking a coronavirus patient\u2019s mucus membranes \u2013 to not watch Channel 4\u2019s documentary The Country That Beat the Virus would be the greatest act of self-care you could perform at this time.</p> <p>Because \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news \u2013 that country is not the UK. I know that this week the British prime minister \u2013 while announcing a revised lockdown policy that could only have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-shops-schools-june-reopening\">transliterated from a spilled tin of Alphabetti Spaghetti</a> \u2013 claimed that we had avoided catastrophe, but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">in the face of more than </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-40000-official-figures-say\">40,000 dead</a>, a flailing, heartsick populace and looming economic meltdown, this is a) not true and b) not beating the virus.</p> <p>The situation in South Korea, however, has been very different. Its death toll from coronavirus, out of a population of 51 million, compared with the UK\u2019s 67 million, currently numbers 259. The programme\u2019s format was simple yet effective, taking us painstakingly through two chronologies. The first was in South Korea, where patient zero was identified on 19 January as they arrived at Seoul airport from Wuhan, caught by the airport\u2019s heat scanners, installed as part of measures devised after previous epidemics. This triggered a comprehensive pandemic plan across the country.</p> <p>And one here in Britain: a timeline starting 10 days later when we noticed we had let someone arrive direct from Wuhan, by then known to be the centre of the new, highly infectious virus, and had done precisely nothing until they had had a good chance to walk around and establish the thing here.</p> <p>Krishnan Guru-Murthy interviewed (via video) various public health experts and journalists from the UK and South Korea, and policymaking scientists and frontline doctors from the latter (ours being largely still otherwise engaged). The difference between the two responses was breathtaking, damning and humiliating \u2013 by turns and sometimes all at the same time.</p> <p>Most viewers, of course, will have gleaned the basics of what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-asia-acted-west-dithered-hong-kong-taiwan-europe\">happened there versus what happened here</a>. The massive programme of testing, contact tracing and quarantine that made up the South Korean containment strategy is pretty much common knowledge. But to see up close and in detail how it all worked together, to be presented with a clear picture of the scale, the decisiveness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">the confidence and competence that characterised </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/south-korea-rapid-intrusive-measures-covid-19\">that response</a> gave you a new understanding of what is possible and \u2013 given the lead time we had \u2013 what should have been expected and executed here.</p> <p>Once both nations were infected, the programme interwove the two timelines and largely left them to comment on each other. The effect was unedifying. We would turn from descriptions of, say, how the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">South Koreans commandeered chemical companies</a> and had testing kits for Covid-19 ready within 17 days, to footage of our prime minister advising that bliffle blaffle and hobblobblob because bulldog spirit and jimminy jummo.</p> <p>Without ever even needing to lock down, South Korea crushes the infection rate. When it spikes \u2013 for example, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-south-korea-to-test-200000-sect-members-as-pandemic-fears-hit-markets\">the virus infiltrates a secretive Christian sect</a> of which the authorities were unaware \u2013 they countermove to crush it again.</p> <p>You can nitpick. Their powerfully successful contact tracing scheme <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/more-scary-than-coronavirus-south-koreas-health-alerts-expose-private-lives\">relied, basically, on state surveillance</a> \u2013 they were able to access phone and credit card data and work backwards through any infected person\u2019s life and outwards from any point along it. We\u2019re a different country with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing\">a different population distribution and history</a>. Those initial testing kits were only 90% accurate. Doubtless there will be fallout. Yes. Yes. But it is very hard not to look at the end results and say that the means were not justified. Difficult not to look at 259 deaths versus more than 40,000 and not agree that desperate times call for desperate measures rather than desperate bluster.</p> <p>But we are where we are. Here. Unswabbed, untested, unsure and unsafe. So, you know, um, ah \u2026 er \u2026 stay alert?</p>",

It is most often used to cover activities that would be better classed under \u201cminor indulgences\u201d or \u201cacts of selfishness so profound I need to obfuscate my sociopathy immediately\u201d. But sometimes it means something closer to self-preservation. It is in this sense that I wish to advise you that \u2013 short of going out and licking a coronavirus patient\u2019s mucus membranes \u2013 to not watch Channel 4\u2019s documentary The Country That Beat the Virus would be the greatest act of self-care you could perform at this time. Because \u2013 and I\u2019m sorry to be the bearer of bad news \u2013 that country is not the UK. I know that this week the British prime minister \u2013 while announcing a revised lockdown policy that could only have been transliterated from a spilled tin of Alphabetti Spaghetti \u2013 claimed that we had avoided catastrophe, but, in the face of more than 40,000 dead, a flailing, heartsick populace and looming economic meltdown, this is a) not true and b) not beating the virus. The situation in South Korea, however, has been very different. Its death toll from coronavirus, out of a population of 51 million, compared with the UK\u2019s 67 million, currently numbers 259. The programme\u2019s format was simple yet effective, taking us painstakingly through two chronologies. The first was in South Korea, where patient zero was identified on 19 January as they arrived at Seoul airport from Wuhan, caught by the airport\u2019s heat scanners, installed as part of measures devised after previous epidemics. This triggered a comprehensive pandemic plan across the country. And one here in Britain: a timeline starting 10 days later when we noticed we had let someone arrive direct from Wuhan, by then known to be the centre of the new, highly infectious virus, and had done precisely nothing until they had had a good chance to walk around and establish the thing here. Krishnan Guru-Murthy interviewed (via video) various public health experts and journalists from the UK and South Korea, and policymaking scientists and frontline doctors from the latter (ours being largely still otherwise engaged). The difference between the two responses was breathtaking, damning and humiliating \u2013 by turns and sometimes all at the same time. Most viewers, of course, will have gleaned the basics of what happened there versus what happened here. The massive programme of testing, contact tracing and quarantine that made up the South Korean containment strategy is pretty much common knowledge. But to see up close and in detail how it all worked together, to be presented with a clear picture of the scale, the decisiveness, the confidence and competence that characterised that response gave you a new understanding of what is possible and \u2013 given the lead time we had \u2013 what should have been expected and executed here. Once both nations were infected, the programme interwove the two timelines and largely left them to comment on each other. The effect was unedifying. We would turn from descriptions of, say, how the South Koreans commandeered chemical companies and had testing kits for Covid-19 ready within 17 days, to footage of our prime minister advising that bliffle blaffle and hobblobblob because bulldog spirit and jimminy jummo. Without ever even needing to lock down, South Korea crushes the infection rate. When it spikes \u2013 for example, when the virus infiltrates a secretive Christian sect of which the authorities were unaware \u2013 they countermove to crush it again. You can nitpick. Their powerfully successful contact tracing scheme relied, basically, on state surveillance \u2013 they were able to access phone and credit card data and work backwards through any infected person\u2019s life and outwards from any point along it. We\u2019re a different country with a different population distribution and history. Those initial testing kits were only 90% accurate. Doubtless there will be fallout. Yes. Yes. But it is very hard not to look at the end results and say that the means were not justified. Difficult not to look at 259 deaths versus more than 40,000 and not agree that desperate times call for desperate measures rather than desperate bluster. But we are where we are. Here. Unswabbed, untested, unsure and unsafe. So, you know, um, ah \u2026 er \u2026 stay alert?",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 14 May. Top stories Australian children are facing an increased risk from abusers during the Covid-19 pandemic, with predators creating and sharing an online grooming manual describing ways to manipulate and exploit the increased number of children at home and online during the lockdown, according to Australia\u2019s e-safety commissioner. Child sexual abuse material reports increased 27% in March and 37% in April 2020. \u201cSupervision is recommended for younger children as well as encouraging your child to apply critical thinking skills, like questioning suspicious behaviour or \u2018friend\u2019 requests from other users online,\u201d the Australian federal police said. The federal government faces more scrutiny over the ongoing sports rorts saga, with Sport Australia failing to find a legal basis for then sports minister Brigid McKenzie to make \u201ccaptain\u2019s calls\u201d over the allocation of $141m worth of grants. The long-running issue resurfaced in federal parliament this week after new evidence from the Australian National Audit Office implicated the prime minister\u2019s office in authorising the grants. Scott Morrison had previously told reporters that the ANAO\u2019s conclusion that McKenzie lacked authorisation to award grants was \u201cnot correct\u201d. Every country in Africa is now affected by the coronavirus, with Lesotho, the last nation without a confirmed positive infection, reporting the disease\u2019s spread. Brazil and Mexico have recorded their highest one-day death tolls, raising fears of a surge of cases across Latin America, with 881 people dying in Brazil and 353 in Mexico. Nurses have protested in Bras\u00edlia, commemorating 109 frontline staff who succumbed to the virus. Chinese authorities are preparing for \u201c10 days of battle\u201d \u2013 announcing an ambitious plan to test more than 11 million citizens in Wuhan \u2013 the site of the first recorded cases \u2013 after a cluster of new infections this week. Meanwhile, the UN has forecast that global trade will contract by 27% during the second quarter of 2020. Australia Fossil fuel concerns have prompted Norway\u2019s gigantic sovereign wealth fund to dump its stake in the Australian energy company AGL, with BHP put on an \u201cobservation list\u201d suggesting major divestment could occur in the future. The Norwegian central bank, which manages the US$1.1tn Government Pension Fund Global, dumped its $65m stake in AGL, following stricter rules about its investment in fossil fuels. Eleven Australian banks and lenders have paid out $160m in compensation over \u201cjunk\u201d insurance sold to more than 434,000 credit card customers and other borrowers. The big four banks, Bank of Queensland and Bendigo Bank are among those found to have acted unfairly. A leading business group has exhorted the federal government not to engage in \u201cmegaphone diplomacy\u201d with China, with the chief executive of the Australian Industry Group counselling that government ministers \u201cneed to find ways to make the relationship work\u201d. The world Former neighbours of the perpetrator of Canada\u2019s worst mass shooting had warned police of his violence and illegal gun collection, local media have reported. The Royal Canadian mounted police have yet to respond to the allegations. A record $73bn was spent on nuclear armaments last year \u2013 with the US spending nearly as much as the eight other nuclear-armed nations combined. The Trump administration spent $35.4bn last year \u2013 the highest expenditure on nuclear arms since the height of the cold war. The disgraced former chair of Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, Paul Manafort, has been released from prison just over a year into his seven-year sentence, after lawyers argued for home confinement due to the risk of Covid-19. Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum has released online the most detailed photograph taken of Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch, with the 44.8 gigapixel image allowing art lovers to zoom in on every brushstroke and random fleck of paint in the masterpiece. Recommended reads As Australia looks to rebuild its post-coronavirus economy there\u2019s a once-only opportunity to move towards a zero-emissions world. After a lost decade embroiled in climate wars, writes Adam Morton, it\u2019s not just climate activists, but industry, banks, energy companies, unions and major investors agitating for a fresh approach. Pencil pines are one of five species of conifer endemic to Tasmania\u2019s high country but, with climate change rendering the trees too stressed to seed, a two-man mission is harvesting by hand to give the 150m-years-old Gondwana-era plants a chance to thrive, writes Calla Wahlquist. Even before the pandemic struck, wages in Australia were struggling, and that\u2019s before we see what effect a sudden surge in unemployment will have, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cAt this point we should perhaps pause and say a small eulogy for the wage-growth predictions in December\u2019s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook. They were utterly absurd even then; now they just look sad.\u201d Listen As the world\u2019s second most-populous nation comes to terms with Covid-19, is an increasingly authoritarian Indian government looking to use a public safety app to snoop on its citizens?

      "body": "<p>A pregnant healthcare assistant is mounting a legal action against NHS Professionals, an employment agency owned by the Department of Health and Social Care, in what could be a landmark action for other vulnerable workers bearing the brunt of the lockdown.</p> <p>The mother of two, who has worked for six years at a London hospital on an agency contract, says she was sent home during the pandemic for safety reasons and has been without work or pay for eight weeks in what her lawyers say is a breach of the UK\u2019s Employment Rights Act. She was instead advised to apply for universal credit.</p> <p>The case exemplifies some workers\u2019 experiences, with some employers and agencies ignoring health and safety legal protections for pregnant women, according to the charity Maternity Action, which is supporting the woman.</p> <p>Andrew Hillier QC, a pro bono adviser at the South West London Law Centre, which is working for the healthcare assistant, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that NHS Professionals, a key provider of staff to the NHS, is grossly abusing the concept of zero-hours contracts \u2013 and that experienced, committed healthcare professionals like \u2018Ms A\u2019 are suffering because of it.\u201d</p> <p>The case comes as other frightened workers who are isolating, either to protect themselves or loved ones with underlying health conditions, have spoken of coming under pressure to return to work, in some cases at public bodies.</p> <p>On the day when the government\u2019s easing of lockdown began, and increasing numbers of workers braved public transport, unions highlighted cases of key workers threatened with the sack or being put on unpaid leave.</p> <p>The warning came as the takeaway firm Deliveroo was accused by a cross-party grouping of MPs of \u201cputting thousands of people at risk\u201d with its alleged treatment of its riders during the lockdown.</p> <p>Forty-four MPs, from the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, to the father of the Commons, the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, wrote to the gig economy company to demand adequate PPE and full pay for riders contracting the virus or self-isolating with symptoms, and an end to dismissals during the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cDeliveroo couriers are low-paid, precarious workers, who are not able to self-isolate when sick or to protect their families, and clients and restaurant staff and other key workers including NHS staff are being potentially exposed to infection,\u201d<a href=\"http://ridersroovolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IWGB-CLB-MP-Letter-to-Deliveroo-CEO.pdf\"> they say in the letter</a>, supporting a campaign by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain.</p> <p>Deliveroo, which rejected the suggestion that it put profit above the safety of its riders, said: \u201cAt Deliveroo, riders are at the heart of everything we do and we are working hard to support them during this unprecedented time. This includes distributing PPE kit to riders across the UK, supporting riders financially if they are unwell, and keeping riders safe through contact-free delivery.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, employers, including councils and schools, have been accused by the Unison union of using Public Health England guidance to compel frightened staff to go to work. Those involved include a school caretaker whose wife and young child are both shielding on government advice, who has not been paid for more than a month.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re forgotten. I told my manager I\u2019d start early or work at the end of the day to limit my exposure to the threat of the virus, because there\u2019s little chance of social distancing in a primary school \u2013 you can\u2019t stop kids sneezing and coughing \u2013 but they said no.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no income and we\u2019re getting into debt. I\u2019m low-paid anyway, so not having any money coming in is causing massive amounts of stress and anxiety.\u201d </p> <p>In a letter to health secretary, Matt Hancock, the Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, asked the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond private companies. \u201cThrough no fault of their own, some low-paid workers are having to choose between putting food on the table or protecting loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cVague public health guidance is giving unscrupulous employers the wriggle room to pressure those who should really be off to go into work.\u201d</p> <p>NHS Professionals said: \u201cThe first priority of NHS Professionals is always the health, safety and welfare of all our bank members, particularly those who may be vulnerable. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on this case, as South West London Law Centres has provided no specifics, which means we are unable to investigate.</p> <p>\u201cOur policy for where one of our bank members is unable to work either because they are shielding, because they are in their third trimester of pregnancy or they are defined by Public Health England as high risk and other work cannot be found for them, NHS Professionals are paying for pre-booked shifts and then transition to an average weekly payment based on the 12 weeks prior to them notifying us they cannot work.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A pregnant healthcare assistant is mounting a legal action against NHS Professionals, an employment agency owned by the Department of Health and Social Care, in what could be a landmark action for other vulnerable workers bearing the brunt of the lockdown. The mother of two, who has worked for six years at a London hospital on an agency contract, says she was sent home during the pandemic for safety reasons and has been without work or pay for eight weeks in what her lawyers say is a breach of the UK\u2019s Employment Rights Act. She was instead advised to apply for universal credit. The case exemplifies some workers\u2019 experiences, with some employers and agencies ignoring health and safety legal protections for pregnant women, according to the charity Maternity Action, which is supporting the woman. Andrew Hillier QC, a pro bono adviser at the South West London Law Centre, which is working for the healthcare assistant, said: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that NHS Professionals, a key provider of staff to the NHS, is grossly abusing the concept of zero-hours contracts \u2013 and that experienced, committed healthcare professionals like \u2018Ms A\u2019 are suffering because of it.\u201d The case comes as other frightened workers who are isolating, either to protect themselves or loved ones with underlying health conditions, have spoken of coming under pressure to return to work, in some cases at public bodies. On the day when the government\u2019s easing of lockdown began, and increasing numbers of workers braved public transport, unions highlighted cases of key workers threatened with the sack or being put on unpaid leave. The warning came as the takeaway firm Deliveroo was accused by a cross-party grouping of MPs of \u201cputting thousands of people at risk\u201d with its alleged treatment of its riders during the lockdown. Forty-four MPs, from the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, to the father of the Commons, the Tory MP Sir Peter Bottomley, wrote to the gig economy company to demand adequate PPE and full pay for riders contracting the virus or self-isolating with symptoms, and an end to dismissals during the crisis. \u201cDeliveroo couriers are low-paid, precarious workers, who are not able to self-isolate when sick or to protect their families, and clients and restaurant staff and other key workers including NHS staff are being potentially exposed to infection,\u201d they say in the letter, supporting a campaign by the Independent Workers\u2019 Union of Great Britain. Deliveroo, which rejected the suggestion that it put profit above the safety of its riders, said: \u201cAt Deliveroo, riders are at the heart of everything we do and we are working hard to support them during this unprecedented time. This includes distributing PPE kit to riders across the UK, supporting riders financially if they are unwell, and keeping riders safe through contact-free delivery.\u201d Separately, employers, including councils and schools, have been accused by the Unison union of using Public Health England guidance to compel frightened staff to go to work. Those involved include a school caretaker whose wife and young child are both shielding on government advice, who has not been paid for more than a month. He said: \u201cWe feel like we\u2019re forgotten. I told my manager I\u2019d start early or work at the end of the day to limit my exposure to the threat of the virus, because there\u2019s little chance of social distancing in a primary school \u2013 you can\u2019t stop kids sneezing and coughing \u2013 but they said no. \u201cWe have no income and we\u2019re getting into debt. I\u2019m low-paid anyway, so not having any money coming in is causing massive amounts of stress and anxiety.\u201d In a letter to health secretary, Matt Hancock, the Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, asked the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond private companies. \u201cThrough no fault of their own, some low-paid workers are having to choose between putting food on the table or protecting loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cVague public health guidance is giving unscrupulous employers the wriggle room to pressure those who should really be off to go into work.\u201d NHS Professionals said: \u201cThe first priority of NHS Professionals is always the health, safety and welfare of all our bank members, particularly those who may be vulnerable. Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on this case, as South West London Law Centres has provided no specifics, which means we are unable to investigate. \u201cOur policy for where one of our bank members is unable to work either because they are shielding, because they are in their third trimester of pregnancy or they are defined by Public Health England as high risk and other work cannot be found for them, NHS Professionals are paying for pre-booked shifts and then transition to an average weekly payment based on the 12 weeks prior to them notifying us they cannot work.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units.</p> \n<p>The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/nhs-warns-of-rise-in-children-with-new-illness-that-may-be-linked-to-coronavirus\">issued an alert</a> to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/\">toxic shock</a> and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, medics at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital announced the death of a 14-year-old boy, the first known fatality from the condition in Britain. Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country.

      "bodyText": "Doctors in Italy have reported the first clear evidence of a link between Covid-19 and a rare but serious inflammatory disorder that has required some children to undergo life-saving treatment in intensive care units. The mysterious condition emerged last month when NHS bosses issued an alert to doctors after hospitals admitted a number of children with a mix of toxic shock and symptoms seen in an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease. On Tuesday, medics at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital announced the death of a 14-year-old boy, the first known fatality from the condition in Britain. Between 75 and 100 children are now receiving treatment across the country. Typical symptoms include a fever, skin rashes, red eyes, cracked lips and abdominal pain. Doctors suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction in the children, but there was no proof that the two were linked. The latest evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the city with the highest rate of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy. Medical records at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital showed that since the outbreak reached Bergamo, cases of Kawasaki-like disease rose to about 10 per month compared with one every three months in the previous five years. Of 10 children treated for the disorder between mid-February and mid-April, eight tested positive for antibodies to the virus. The two negative cases may be explained by faulty test results, the doctors believe. \u201cOur study provides the first clear evidence of a link between Sars-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,\u201d said Dr Lorenzo D\u2019Antiga, director of child health at the hospital. \u201cI have no doubt that Kawasaki disease in these patients is caused by Sars-CoV-2.\u201d Writing in the Lancet, the medics warn that the \u201cstrong association\u201d between the virus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account when governments ease their lockdown restrictions. They stress, however, that the disorder is very rare, affecting no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. A fraction of these require intensive care. Dr Annalisa Gervasoni, a paediatric specialist at the hospital, said: \u201cIn our experience, only a very small proportion of children infected with Sars-CoV-2 develop symptoms of Kawasaki disease. However, it is important to understand the consequences of the virus in children, particularly as countries around the world grapple with plans to start relaxing social distancing policies.\u201d Kawasaki disease, which overwhelmingly affects infants, causes inflammation of the blood vessels and in some cases a swelling of the heart. Swift treatment can prevent potentially lethal coronary aneurysms. The cause is not known, but studies suggest it is a post-infection inflammatory response that turns against the body. The rise in cases points to a form of Kawasaki disease that affects young schoolchildren more than infants and is triggered specifically by coronavirus. Since the first cases were reported in Britain, dozens more have emerged in the US, France, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. Health officials in Britain launched a surveillance study this week to monitor cases of the disorder, which they have tentatively named PIMS-TS, for Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with Sars-CoV-2. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of paediatrics and child health, said it remained the case that children were largely unaffected by Covid-19, but that surveillance for the new syndrome would shed light on who it affects, how, and what the longer-term outcomes are. \u201cThe great majority of children with this condition have been well treated and are getting better and have gone home,\u201d he said.

The best were said to have been 70% accurate and most no more than 50%. Health secretary Matt Hancock, who had bought 3m of them, was said to be seeking the government\u2019s money back. Roche\u2019s test was approved at the start of May by the EU and by the Food and Drug Administration in the USA as being 99.8% specific for Covid-19 \u2013 so it is not confused by antibodies against other coronaviruses which cause colds \u2013 and 100% sensitive, so it will pick up any antibodies that are present. It will work on blood samples taken by a healthcare professional at least 14 days after the person developed Covid-19. The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology test is processed in laboratories using Roche analysers that hospitals already have. Roche says its fully automated systems can provide results in approximately 18 minutes for one single test, with a capability to do 300 tests an hour, depending on the analyser. Prof John Newton, national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, told the Telegraph that experts at PHE\u2019s Porton Down labs had evaluated the test and confirmed the 100% accuracy. \u201cThis is a very positive development, because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear,\u201d Newton said. Scientists will hope to obtain very valuable data on the spread of the pandemic through mass antibody testing, which could reveal how many people have had the virus but without experiencing any symptoms. Looking at those particular groups will help in the search for vaccines and treatments. Roche, based in Switzerland, already has orders from around the world, following the US approval and the granting by the EU of a CE kite mark. It had \u201calready started shipping the new antibody test to leading laboratories globally and will ramp up production capacity to high double-digit millions per month to serve healthcare systems in countries accepting the CE mark as well as the US\u201d, it said in a statement on 3 May. \u201cRoche is deeply committed to supporting the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Timely availability and fast access to reliable, high quality tests are essential for healthcare systems,\u201d Dr Thomas Schinecker, CEO of Roche Diagnostics, told the Guardian. \u201cThe antibody test is an important next step in the fight against Covid-19 and Roche\u2019s antibody test can be quickly scaled and made broadly available as more than 40,000 of our instruments are already in use in many laboratories around the world.\u201d",

That has prompted concern that under-18s are struggling to get care at the same time that levels of anxiety and depression in that age group have risen sharply. The findings have emerged from a survey by the charity YoungMinds of 1,850 parents and carers around the UK, 750 of whom have a child who had received support and treatment for mental health issues in the previous three months. Out of those 750 parents, 25% said their child was no longer able to access help from the NHS, private providers, helplines, school counsellors or charities even though they still needed it. Many NHS mental health services are suspended or restricted, or have changed to involve mainly remote consultations by telephone or video. \u201cThe pandemic has turned the lives of millions of children and young people upside down. Many young people are finding it hard to cope with isolation, a loss of routine, anxiety about the future, a disruption to their education, and in some cases difficult or traumatic experiences at home,\u201d said Emma Thomas, chief executive of YoungMinds. \u201cDespite huge efforts from mental health professionals, young people with existing mental health needs often can\u2019t get the same level of support as they had before the crisis. \u201cAs our survey shows, many parents and carers are deeply worried about the long-term impact of the pandemic on the young people in their care, and don\u2019t know where to turn for advice and support\u201d, she added. The results come a week after Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national director for mental health, disclosed that the number of under-18s being referred to NHS child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) had fallen by 30% to 40% since the pandemic began. Some of that reduction will be because schools, which make many such referrals, are closed. But Murdoch told MPs on the Commons health select committee that more parents of troubled children may be \u201chunkering down at home\u201d and not wanting to seek care for their child through the usual referral routes, with some believing that help was not available. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said parents and troubled children should continue to seek help from the NHS in the usual way. \u201cWe are absolutely committed to supporting the mental wellbeing of families and children, especially during these extraordinary times. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re ensuring our mental health services are adapting to best support families and children, and recently provided \u00a35m to leading mental health charities to help them expand and reach those most in need. \u201cFamilies and children should still feel able to contact their GP or CAMHS for support.\u201d",

London\u2019s largest private hire car operator, Addison Lee, claims to be the first in the industry to make the move, announcing that it would be fitting screens to all 4,000 vehicles in its fleet at a likely cost of hundreds of thousands of pounds. At the same time, the ride-hailing company and app Uber will on Thursday unveil plans to install partitions in 400 of its drivers\u2019 cars in Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham, in order to \u201cbuild a better understanding of how people can travel from A to B as safely as possible\u201d. Three drivers with Addison Lee, which carries more than 10 million London passengers every year, have died of coronavirus. And three Uber drivers have been confirmed to have died from Covid-19 in the capital, but there have been reports of several more. The dividing screens in Uber\u2019s pilot will be installed by the AA motoring group, which will also deep-clean and sanitise every car as part of the installation process, in line with advice and guidance issued by Newcastle, Durham and Sunderland city councils. Commercial and private drivers of passenger vehicles have been among the groups worst affected by the disease, because of the difficulties of social distancing in a confined space. New data released on Monday by the Office for National Statistics covering England and Wales revealed that the highest rate of deaths was among male security guards (45.7 deaths per 100,000), followed by 36.4 deaths per 100,000 among male taxi drivers and chauffeurs. But as commuters return to work this week as the lockdown eases and are advised to avoid public transport, demand for private hire services in major City and town centres is likely to soar. London\u2019s estimated 21,000 black taxis are already fitted with partitions between drivers and passengers, but the majority of minicabs in London do not have dividing safety screens installed.

The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Former UK spy chief dismisses Wuhan lab conspiracy theory. </strong>In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a coronavirus research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan.</li> \n   <li><strong>Public Health England approves antibody test \u2013 report. </strong>Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement.

The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. </p> \n  <p>Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. </p> \n  <p>An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbbe068f08d99d46a15f24\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/emmanuel-akinwotu\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:34:56.619Z\">10.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. </p> \n  <p>In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether.</p> \n  <p>Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. <br><br>\u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world.</p> \n  <p>Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. </p> \n  <p>\u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d<br><br>In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. </p> \n  <p>The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebbba898f08d99d46a15ef8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T09:15:35.176Z\">10.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Reuters have filed this update from Poland:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday.</p> \n   <p>Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then.

Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future.</p> \n  <p>This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Naomi Klein: How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb75ce8f08a55ecde58e3c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T05:00:58.509Z\">6.00am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Nature is healing in San Jose, California: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">oh my goat <a href=\"https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz\">https://t.co/bvcaMIAHgz</a></p>\u2014 Helen Sullivan (@helenrsullivan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan/status/1260410385452187649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb7d148f08a55ecde58e5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:54:56.152Z\">5.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. </p> \n  <p>Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and<strong> </strong>56 deaths, according to <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a> data. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a27ed82876dc5e0d74d4027305f041ef8a0eb5a/0_237_5296_3176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street food sellers stand behind plastic divider sheet in Bangkok, Thailand, Wednesday, 13 May 2020.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gemunu Amarasinghe/AP</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ebb76a68f08d99d46a15d56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-13T04:45:47.425Z\">5.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. </strong>According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began.<strong> </strong>The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes.</li> \n   <li><strong>More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. </strong>A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil reports record deaths. </strong>Brazil reported a record <a href=\"https://covid.saude.gov.br/\">881 Covid-19</a> deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">figures</a>. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. </strong>US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</li> \n   <li><strong>Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. </strong>The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times.</li> \n   <li><strong>Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/12/twitter-coronavirus-covid19-work-from-home\">Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d</a>, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday.

accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization.</p> \n  <p>Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns.</p> \n  <p>Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this outbreak started.

Here are the main developments from the last few hours: At least 4.3 million people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, while at least 295,671 people have died. The figures collected by Johns Hopkins University are likely to be a great underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Trump describes Fauci\u2019s warning over reopening the economy too soon as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday described as not acceptable a warning given by top US infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci this week about the dangers of reopening the economy too quickly. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House, noting he was surprised by the response Fauci gave to lawmakers in testimony to the US Senate on Tuesday. Virus may never be eradicated \u2013 WHO. The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. Every African country is now affected by the outbreak, after Lesotho announced its first case. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said. Former UK spy chief dismisses Wuhan lab conspiracy theory. In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a coronavirus research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Public Health England approves antibody test \u2013 report. Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement. The kit is made by the Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG, the Daily Telegraph has reported. The newspaper added that it understands the UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of the kits. Afghanistan reached 5,000 confirmed cases, as the country\u2019s health ministry warned that easing lockdowns would bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648. Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workersto address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. Mexico said it would reopen parts of economythe economy after 51 days of lockdown, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324. Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. The EU executive called for a \u201cgradual and careful easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent\u201d. The car manufacturer Ford announced plans to restart production, including at two factories in the UK.

The move, along with the reopening of the Valencia engine plant in Spain, will open all of Ford\u2019s European manufacturing facilities. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be blogging for the next few hours \u2013 get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. According to White House press pool reporters, the Donald Trump also called Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s message yesterday cautioning against opening the economy too soon \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cI was surprised by his answer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cTo me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer especially when it comes to schools.\u201d Yesterday, the top public health official contradicted Trump, who urged schools and businesses to reopen and said the White House has set a target of having 100m vaccine doses by the autumn. Fauci disputed that timeline, indicating that neither a vaccine nor treatment could be developed and distributed in time to facilitate the reopening of schools in the fall. The president said: I think they should open the schools, absolutely. I think they should. It\u2019s had very little impact on young people. And I think that if you\u2019re an instructor, if you\u2019re a teacher, a professor over a certain age like let\u2019s say 65 or maybe even if you want to be conservative, 60, perhaps you want to stay out for a little while longer. But I think you should absolutely open the schools. Our country has got to get back and it\u2019s got to get back as soon as possible, and I don\u2019t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed. US authorities are accusing Chinese hackers of trying to steal Covid-19 vaccine research, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) warned: China\u2019s efforts to target these sectors pose a significant threat to our nation\u2019s response to Covid-19. Neither offered evidence or examples to support the allegation. Washington has increasingly blamed Beijing for the outbreak caused by the virus that first emerged in China late last year. Asked on Monday about earlier reports that the US believed Chinese hackers were targeting US vaccine research, the president Donald Trump replied: What else is new with China? What else is new? Tell me. I\u2019m not happy with China. Beijing has repeatedly denied the US accusations. Of all the thousands of golfers and tennis players who were reacquainted with the reassuring swoosh and snap of club and racket on ball on Wednesday, few surely heard a sweeter sound than the 18-handicapper Ed Sandison. When the 34-year-old stepped on to the 176-yard first hole at the Styal Golf Club in Cheshire at 9.04am, he was merely happy to be back after eight weeks of lockdown, happier still when he made good contact with his ball, and stunned to the point of disbelief when he realised he had made his first ever hole-in-one. He told the Guardian: At first I couldn\u2019t find my ball anywhere so I was getting a little annoyed \u2013 until I checked the cup. I spent the next 17 holes laughing with my father-in-law Tony. But everyone I saw seemed to be in such a good mood \u2013 and no wonder with golf being back. Peru\u2019s rate of cases is peaking and will begin a slow decline, its president Mart\u00edn Vizcarra has said, as the country moves into a \u201cfinal stage\u201d of lockdown more than two months after its first case was detected. Peru, which has the second greatest number of cases in Latin America, will continue to enforce social distancing, particularly in markets, banks and public transportation, Vizcarra said. In this last stage of the state of emergency, we have to ratify all the good that we have done, which is enough, and to correct the defects. Cases in Peru rose to 76,306 on Wednesday, up by 4,247 from a day earlier. The death toll was 2,169, up by 112, according to data from the Ministry of Health. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, at 177,589 confirmed cases. The French drugmaker Sanofi SA is working with European regulators to speed up access to a potential vaccine in Europe after its chief executive suggested Americans would likely get the vaccine first. The company said it is in talks with the European Union and the French and German governments to speed up regional vaccine development. Sanofi, whose Pasteur division has an established track record of producing influenza vaccines, teamed up with British rival GlaxoSmithKline last month to come up with a candidate it hopes will be ready next year. They have received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the US Health Department. As a result, doses produced in the United States are expected to go to US patients first; a prospect that has raised concern in Europe. Sanofi\u2019s chief executive Paul Hudson has told Bloomberg: The US government has the right to the largest preorder because it\u2019s invested in taking the risk. We are very encouraged to see the mobilisation of the [European commission] over the past weeks, exploring similar measures that could expedite both vaccines development and access to the European population. The company said that remainder of its vaccine manufacturing capacity will cover Europe and the rest of the world. Public Health England (PHE) has reportedly approved an antibody test kit, the first to receive such an endorsement. The kit is made by the Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG, the Daily Telegraph has reported. The accuracy of the test was given approval by experts at PHE\u2019s Porton Down facility last Thursday, the newspaper said. The newspaper added that it understands the UK\u2019s Department of Health and Social Care is in negotiations with Roche to buy millions of the kits. Brazilian media outlets have published the results of negative coronavirus tests taken by the country\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro following a Supreme Court ruling. The result backs up the president\u2019s previous claim of a clean bill of health, but doubts lingered over the results after it was revealed that the three tests also were carried out nearly two months ago \u2013 since when Bolsonaro has repeatedly flouted social distancing advice and mixed with crowds of supporters and ordinary Brazilians. The tests were performed on 12, 17 and 18 March, the O Globo newspaper reported. In the following weeks, Bolsonaro greeted demonstrators and ordinary Brazilians without a mask, posed for selfies, visited a supermarket and a bakery and even shook hands with an elderly woman after wiping his nose on his wrist. Last weekend he rode a jet-ski and stopped by a floating barbecue. Bolsonaro initially refused to release his tests results after 23 people who were on his trip to the United States in March tested positive. He has dismissed the rising Covid-19 death toll in Brazil with a casual \u201cso what?\u201d Brazil\u2019s Health Ministry reported a record 881 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday night and the country has 177,589 confirmed cases. In March, Bolsonaro said his athletic background meant that, if he did catch Covid-19, he would barely feel it. Yet his government turned down a Freedom of Information request from the UOL news site, arguing the information was \u201csecret\u201d. The tests were made public on Wednesday by the Supreme Court judge Ricardo Lewandowski following a request from the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper. It won rulings in lower courts but was overruled by a High Court judge. Lewandoski overturned that decision. Italy\u2019s top flight football clubs have voted in a favour of resuming the season on 13 June during a general assembly, although the final decision rests with the government. Serie A has been suspended since 9 March and, although the government has authorised teams to hold collective training sessions from next Monday, it has not yet decided if and when the championship can resume. Serie A said: As far as the resumption of sports activities is concerned, the date of 13 June for the resumption of the championship has been indicated ... in accordance with medical protocols for the protection of players and all those involved. The young migrants and asylum seekers swim across the Rio Grande and clamber into the dense brush of Texas, across the US-Mexico border. Many are teens who left Central America on their own. Others were sent along by parents from refugee camps in Mexico. They are as young as 10. Under US law they would normally be allowed to live with relatives while their cases wind through immigration courts. Instead the Trump administration is quickly expelling them under an emergency declaration citing the coronavirus pandemic, with 600 minors expelled in April alone. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 1,426 more deaths and 21,467 more confirmed infections, taking the totals to 82,246 and 1,364,061, respectively. Talks to ease restrictions in South African by the end of May and downgrade its alert level from four to three are set to begin, the country\u2019s president Cyril Ramaphosa has said. Ramaphosa added that parts of the country with the highest rates of infection would remain at alert level four and that changes to that level of restrictions would be announced in the coming days. In the UK, the former director general of the domestic intelligence service has poured cold water on White House speculation that Covid-19 may have emerged via a leak from a research laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Andrew Parker who was the director general of MI5 until two and half weeks ago, told a webinar: I\u2019m just not aware of any evidence that it is anything other than what people think it is: It came via markets. There are all sorts of hypotheses around, but I just think it is not useful to speculate, worry about all that. The former British spy chief said it was the business of intelligence agencies to find out if there was ever a point when a state or non-state actor was trying to deliberately spread a dangerous disease. In that case, he said, there \u201cshould be an expectation that the agencies will somehow uncover that\u201d. But, in remarks that could have been addressed directly to the US president Donald Trump or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Parker concluded: Conspiracy theories right now are not helpful. Both Trump and Pompeo have publicly pushed the lab leak theory without offering supporting evidence. British intelligence agencies have been saying for the past couple of weeks they don\u2019t subscribe to the lab leak theory, although the idea is nevertheless being pushed in news media in the UK, US and Australia. Parker was speaking at a webinar organised by the Royal Society of Medicine. Chile\u2019s government has announced plans for the strictest lockdown measures seen in the country yet, with compulsory quarantine for the entire zone of greater Santiago \u2013 an area with a population of 6.5m people. \u201cThe battle of Santiago is crucial in the war against coronavirus,\u201d said Health Minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, announcing the measures. The move comes as a record 2,660 cases were confirmed in 24 hours; a 60% increase on the previous day\u2019s figure that brought the total number of cases to 34,381. That is the third highest in South America. In total, 346 people in Chile have died. The surge in numbers has piled fresh pressure on health officials who have enacted a \u201csuppress and lift\u201d strategy, limiting lockdowns to affected areas. Health workers have been calling for a total lockdown in Santiago since March but the Health Ministry has argued the strategy was keeping cases under control, while preventing the economic fallout of a total closure of the city. While new cases outside of Santiago have been falling, the localised lockdown measures have proved unsuccessful in curbing the spread in the capital, where 85% of new cases are concentrated. Political opponents trace the surge back to the government\u2019s steps to return to normal under a month ago. \u201cPremature messages from the government confused people who are now paying the price\u201d tweeted Carolina Goic, the president of the Christian Democratic Party. Sebastian Pi\u00f1era has pleaded the public to respect the new quarantine measures, which will come into effect Friday night from 22pm. \u201cWe need your collaboration,\u201d he tweeted. At least 95,000 people have entered the UK from overseas since the country\u2019s lockdown was imposed, one of the government\u2019s chief scientific advisers has revealed, while repeatedly failing to provide an estimate of how many of these people had Covid-19. Appearing before MPs on the science and technology committee, Prof John Aston, the chief scientific adviser at the Home Office, admitted that had tougher restrictions been introduced at the border, the peak of the virus may have been delayed \u2013 but he did not say by how long, or if this would have saved lives. A nationwide study of more than 60,000 people in Spain suggests about 5% of the population \u2013 approximately 2 million people \u2013 have had the virus. According to the provisional results of tests designed by the health ministry and the Carlos III public health institute, 5% of those tested had produced antibodies. While the prevalence of the antibodies was similar in men and women, it was lower in children and babies. There were also significant regional variations: while Murcia, Melilla, Asturias and the Canary islands showed an infection rate of less than 2%, the proportion rose to more than 10% in the regions of Madrid and Castilla-La Mancha. As the health minister Salvador Illa made plain on Wednesday evening, the study shows herd immunity has not been achieved. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, added: The trajectory is in our hands, and it\u2019s everybody\u2019s business, and we should all contribute to stop this pandemic. Ryan said \u201cvery significant control\u201d of the virus was required in order to lower the assessment of risk, which he said remained high at the \u201cnational, regional and global levels\u201d. As countries around the world seek a way to ease lockdown measures, public health experts say extreme caution is needed to avoid new outbreaks. Ryan said opening land borders was less risky than easing air travel, which was a \u201cdifferent challenge\u201d. \u201cWe need to get into the mindset that it is going to take some time to come out of this pandemic,\u201d the WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said. The coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could become endemic like HIV, the World Health Organization has said, warning against any attempt to predict how long it would keep circulating and calling for a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to counter it. The organisation\u2019s emergencies expert, Mike Ryan, said: It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away. I think it is important we are realistic and I don\u2019t think anyone can predict when this disease will disappear. I think there are no promises in this and there are no dates. This disease may settle into a long problem, or it may not be. However, he said the world had some control over how it copes with the disease, although this would take a \u201cmassive effort\u201d even if a vaccine was found \u2013 a prospect he described as a \u201cmassive moonshot\u201d. More than 100 potential vaccines are being developed, including several in clinical trials, but experts have underscored the difficulties of finding vaccines that are effective against coronaviruses. Ryan noted that vaccines exist for other illnesses, such as measles, that have not been eliminated. France\u2019s cumulative death toll has risen by 83 to 27,074, with the rate of increase slowing after accelerating the three previous days, local authorities have said. The number of hospitalised people fell again to 21,071 from 21,595 on Tuesday, continuing an uninterrupted downward trend now entering its fifth week, according to the health ministry. On the third day after the end of a 55-day lockdown, the number of people in intensive care also continued a similar downtrend and fell by 114 or 4.7% to 2,428. Confirmed cases were up 0.4% at 140,374. Here are the latest lines in our global coronavirus coverage: At least 4.3 million people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, while at least 293,514 people have died. The figures collected by Johns Hopkins University are likely to be a great underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Every African country is now affected by the outbreak, after Lesotho announced its first case. The virus was detected in one of 81 people tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, Lesotho\u2019s health ministry said. Afghanistan reached 5,000 confirmed cases, as the country\u2019s health ministry warned that easing lockdowns would bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d. Out of 619 suspected patients tested in the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll reached 132, after five more patients died overnight. The number of recoveries is 648. Sweden announced it would hire up to 10,000 more care workers to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of Sweden\u2019s 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. Mexico said it would reopen parts of the economy after 51 days of lockdown, despite the country reporting its highest number of daily deaths so far. Mexico has confirmed 1,992 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total death toll to 3,926 and the total number of cases to 38,324. Hotels and restaurants across Europe have been asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. The EU executive called for a \u201cgradual and careful easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent\u201d. The car manufacturer Ford announced plans to restart production, including at two factories in the UK. Work will resume on 18 May at the company\u2019s engine plants in Dagenham in Essex and Bridgend in south Wales. The move, along with the reopening of the Valencia engine plant in Spain, will open all of Ford\u2019s European manufacturing facilities. A zoo in Canada is to send two giant pandas back to China after disruptions to international travel meant it was unable to import enough bamboo to feed them, Reuters reports. The pandas, Er Shun and Da Mao, arrived in Canada in 2014 as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China. After spending five years at Toronto zoo, the two adult giant pandas arrived at Calgary zoo in March 2018 with cubs Jia Panpan and Jia Yueyue. Calgary zoo officials now fear a second wave of Covid-19 could cut off the pandas\u2019 food supply entirely. Giant pandas consume 40kg of bamboo a day and it makes up 99% of their diet, the zoo said. The zoo\u2019s president and CEO, Cl\u00e9ment Lanthier, said in a statement: We believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao to be during these challenging and unprecedented times is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access. On Wednesday, Canada reported 329 new cases of coronavirus and 40 new deaths. So far 71,486 people in the country have tested positive for the virus, of whom 5,209 have died and 34,496 recovered. Australia\u2019s e-safety commissioner has warned that child abusers have created and shared an online grooming manual describing ways to manipulate and exploit the increased number of children at home and online during Covid-19, writes Melissa Davey, the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief. Covid-19 restrictions have coincided with a significant increase in reports to the eSafety Office about child sexual abuse material, Julie Inman Grant told Guardian Australia. She said investigators had seen a jump in searches by predators on the dark web seeking information on how to abuse children. \u201cI think of it like bees in a hive, gathering around the honey,\u201d Inman Grant said. \u201cAbusers see Covid-19 as a honeypot for them, with at-risk boys and girls spending much more time at home and online, often without supervision, and often while feeling isolated and lonely.\u201d The Covid-19 predator handbook contained details about how to coerce children online to share sexual images and videos of themselves, she said. \u201cThe handbook advises predators to get their kicks online rather than trying to meet children face-to-face because of restrictions and heightened vigilance of law enforcement on the streets,\u201d Inman Grant said. Yemen\u2019s Saudi-backed government reported the first coronavirus case in Marib province and four other infections elsewhere, taking the tally of cases in areas under its control to 70, including 12 deaths, according to Reuters. Parks in Turkey filled with the sound of children on Wednesday as authorities allowed those aged 14 and under to leave their homes for the first time in 40 days, the Associated Press reports. The country\u2019s children were allowed to venture out for four hours between 11am and 3pm as Turkey eased some restrictions in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Youngsters between the ages of 15 and 20 will be able to leave homes for a few hours on Friday, while older people were briefly allowed out for the first time in seven weeks on 10 May. In the city\u2019s Birlik Mahallesi neighbourhood, two children were seen riding their scooters up and down a street while a voice from a loudspeaker on the top of the minaret of a nearby mosque called on the public not to be \u201cfooled by the arrival of spring and good weather\u201d. \u201cThe danger of infection is not over yet,\u201d the announcement said. Health officials reported 58 more deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as 1,639 further people tested positive for the coronavirus that causes it. It brings the total number of cases in Turkey to 143,114, of whom 3,952 have died. Infections peaked last month, with 5,138 reported on 11 April, and since then have declined steadily. Shopping centres, hairdressers, barber shops and hair salons were allowed to reopen on Monday, as part of a \u201cnormalisation plan\u201d set out by the government. Nightly curfew hours in Tunisia are to be relaxed after the country recorded three consecutive days without detecting any new coronavirus infections, according to Reuters. The north African democracy imposed the curfew in March, aiming to slow the spread of the virus by keeping people at home, combined with a lockdown that shuttered all but key shops and services. The president, Kais Saied, has cut the curfew hours to 11pm to 5am, instead of 8pm to 6am, the state news agency TAP reported, 10 days after the start of a gradual reopening of the bureaucracy and economy. It follows the government\u2019s announcement that no new coronavirus cases have been recorded for three days in a row. So far it has reported 1,032 confirmed cases in total and 45 deaths. Senior health and hospital officials in different parts of the country told Reuters there were very few coronavirus patients still in care, indicating the reduction in the number of new cases is not down to a lack of testing. Chile is to implement a general quarantine across Santiago, the national capital, and a nationwide quarantine for all people over 75, after a surge in coronavirus infections, Reuters reports. The \u201cextraordinary, tough new measures\u201d were announced by the health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, on Wednesday, after 2,660 new cases of the virus were recorded in the country overnight, up 60% from the previous day. \u201cThe month of May is proving very tough on our country,\u201d said Ma\u00f1alich, who added that the quarantine, which takes effect on Friday, was necessary to bring down the contagion rate. Chile has 34,381 total confirmed cases and 14,865 recovered victims of the virus. Eleven new deaths have brought the total toll from Covid-19 in the country to 346. Ma\u00f1alich called on citizens to pull together and take the measures seriously, and report anyone not wearing masks or observing physical distancing. \u201cIn reality the battle for Santiago is the crucial battle in the war against coronavirus,\u201d said Ma\u00f1alich. Some 313,750 PCR tests have been carried out on the population of 18 million people. Asked about claims that some public hospitals were close to collapse, he insisted that patients and medical resources had already been transferred to avoid overwhelming particular areas. Global trade is forecast to fall by a record 27% in the second quarter of the year following a slump in the export of cars, machine parts and oil, reports Guardian economics writer Philip Inman. The coronavirus pandemic has hit the supply and demand for products across the world leading to a severe decline in world trade, said Unctad, the United Nations organisation that tracks trade flows. Almost every category of goods is expected to suffer a fall in trade over the coming months, adding to a 3% decline in the first quarter of the year. Unctad said the data revealed the huge shock to the global economy from the Covid-19 pandemic. Cuba is betting a biotech sector begun by the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro can give it an edge in a global race to find effective treatments for the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. It is especially touting an interferon it produces, a decades old antiviral agent that boosts the immune system. The island nation says the drug has been successful in treating Covid-19 at home and in China, and that 80 countries have already expressed an interest in buying its interferon alpha 2b. The government is hoping its interferon and other treatments it is developing will provide a lift to its struggling economy, which is subject to a six-decade-old US trade embargo. \u201cWe have good products like interferon alpha 2b that we are exporting and that open possibilities,\u201d the trade minister, Rodrigo Malmierca, said during a recent televised roundtable. Interferons have long been used internationally to treat dengue fever, cancer and hepatitis B and C. Studies during the Sars epidemic in 2003 suggested interferons might also be useful against coronaviruses. Interferons can cause serious side effects when administered in their usual forms \u2013 injections or infusions \u2013 some of which may mirror Covid-19 symptoms, such as fever and breathing difficulty. Cuba, however, says it has treated nearly all of its patients with interferon injections and credits the medicine for helping it achieve a lower mortality rate among its 1,804 confirmed Covid-19 cases \u2013 4.1% versus an average of 5.9% for the rest of the Americas. On Wednesday, Cuba reported six new cases of coronavirus and one death. The UK has reported 494 more deaths from coronavirus, bringing the total in the world\u2019s second worst-affected country to 33,186. Montreal, a city touted by tourist guides as \u201cnorth America\u2019s Europe\u201d for its rich culture and joie de vivre, is Canada\u2019s centre for Covid-19. Of the entire country\u2019s 70,000 cases and 5,000 deaths, the city of 2 million people has 20,000 cases and more than 2,000 deaths, or about 64% of the entire Quebec province\u2019s death toll. Those numbers have catapulted Quebec into an unfavourable position: it is now the seventh deadliest place in the world for daily coronavirus deaths, according to Quebec newspaper La Presse. If Peter McCabe\u2019s recent Empty Montreal photo project is any evidence, the city has largely obeyed stay-home orders. His streetscapes devoid of human activity show a side of Montreal almost no one sees. \u201cThe air is crystal clear. That\u2019s not normal,\u201d he said. But if people are genuinely staying home, the elevated infection rate isn\u2019t normal either. Why are so many people getting sick and dying here? Tracey Lindeman, a journalist based in the city, has looked for answers. The European parliament will discuss Hungary\u2019s controversial coronavirus laws on Thursday, the latest showdown between Brussels and Budapest over rule of law under Hungary\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, write Shaun Walker in Budapest and Jennifer Rankin in Brussels. In late March Hungary\u2019s parliament gave Orb\u00e1n the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting coronavirus. The law was criticised for failing to include a sunset clause to give a clear time limit to the state of emergency and for introducing potential jail sentences for people who spread false information, which in recent days has led to raids on individuals criticising the government on Facebook. The one-hour debate in Brussels will have no formal consequences but is likely to deepen antagonism between the Orb\u00e1n government and the European parliament, which in September 2018 triggered a sanctions procedure against Hungary. We now have more details on the situation in Lesotho, which reported its first case of coronavirus earlier on Wednesday. The government has said there is a likelihood that more cases could be recorded before the end of the week after the health ministry said it was awaiting results for 301 cases where tests had been done and sent to neighbouring South Africa, writes Silence Charumbira in Maseru, the country\u2019s capital, for the Guardian\u2019s foreign desk. The tiny southern African mountain kingdom had until Tuesday enjoyed the tag of being the only country on the continent to be free of Covid-19. But the enviable distinction evaporated with the government saying one suspected case had come back positive from 81 samples sent for testing in South Africa on Saturday. The tests were for people returning from South Africa and parts of the Middle East. A spokesperson said on Wednesday: On 9 May 2020, the ministry [of health] conducted 81 tests for Covid-19 from travellers from South Africa and Saudi Arabia. On 11 May 2020 the samples were shipped to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa and results were obtained on 12 May 2020. Eighty people tested negative for Covid-19 while one tested positive. There were 195 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Wednesday, 23 more than on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to 31,106, reports Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections rose by 888, down by 514 since Tuesday. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte\u2019s cabinet is expected to soon approve a \u20ac55bn (\u00a348bn) package to revive Italy\u2019s economy. The much-anticipated package will go towards helping small businesses, families that have been struggling under the lockdown, furloughed workers, the self-employed, the health sector and culture and tourism. The government has also reached an agreement on legalising migrant agricultural workers and carers, according to the news agency Ansa. Ursula von der Leyen has conceded that companies in rich countries such as Germany have been given an unfair advantage following the relaxation of the EU\u2019s state aid rules, writes Daniel Boffey, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief. In a speech to the European parliament in Brussels, the European commission president suggested the single market was in danger of breaking up as wealthier member states spent their way out of the crisis. She said: Every member state has supported workers and companies as best as possible \u2013 in large part thanks to the European level being fast and forceful: we triggered the general escape clause and we gave full flexibility on EU fund and state aid rules. But it\u2019s also true that each member state has a different fiscal space \u2013 so the use of state aid is very different. What we start to observe now is an unlevelling of the playing field in our single market. Therefore, in response, we need to support those that need it the most, we have to push for investment and reform. Brussels suspended the EU-wide state aid restrictions on subsidies to companies in mid-March. Germany accounts for more than half of the state aid approved by the European commission since the pandemic began. Hotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce physical distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday, reports Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. Announcing a set of measures intended to rescue Europe\u2019s crisis-hit tourism industry, the European Union executive called on Wednesday for a \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201ccareful\u201d easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent, while issuing advice to hotels, resort managers, restaurant owners and travel companies. Hotels are being asked to consider enabling guests to book slots at the pool, in the gym or the restaurant. Large public spaces, such as buffets, should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events, such as concerts, are discouraged. During their stay, guests should also be advised on \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, and issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to ensure contact tracing if there is an outbreak of coronavirus. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people and sell tickets online. Passengers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport, in airports and stations, while duty free shops should restrict customer numbers. Transport workers are asked to wear masks and gloves, while operators should limit the numbers of people in waiting areas. \u201cThis is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us,\u201d said the European commission vice-president, Margrethe Vestager. She urged governments and businesses to follow recommendations from Brussels, so \u201cwe don\u2019t have to face a summer stuck at home or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry\u201d. Doctors in Vietnam have decided to carry out a lung transplant on a 43-year-old British man who is the country\u2019s most critically ill Covid-19 patient, VN Express reports. Computed tomography scans have shown that the patient, a pilot for Vietnam Airlines, has just 10% lung function after fibrosis solidified both lungs. He has been on life support for 38 days. Nguyen Van Vinh Chau, director of the hospital for tropical diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, said the decision to give the man a lung transplant was confirmed on Tuesday, at a meeting of medical experts led by Vietnam\u2019s ministry of health. The ministry has been seeking a donor. After an aggressive and proactive response to the coronavirus outbreak, Vietnam recorded just 288 confirmed cases of the disease, of whom 252 have recovered. So far it has reported no deaths from Covid-19. Patient 91, as the British patient has been designated, fell ill on 18 March. Doctors said he suffers from a blood-clotting disorder and that as his condition worsened he also suffered a cytokine storm syndrome, where the immune system overreacts to the infection. Hi, this is Caroline Davies handing the blog back to my colleague Damien Gayle . Italy\u2019s government on Monday introduced a decree that will send back to prison dozens of Mafia bosses released due to the risk of Covid infection, writes Lorenzo Tondo in Palermo. Since the beginning of the outbreak, Italian judges set free hundreds of ageing mobsters suffering from specific illnesses because they are \u201cat risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection\u201d and moved them to house arrests. Prosecutors, anti-mafia associations and parties have protested against the judges\u2019 decisions, fearing mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release. Italian opposition parties last week filed a motion of no-confidence in Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede. Although Bonafede clarified last week that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and called for a new norm to revise rules on releasing mafia bosses to house arrest, centre-right opposition filed a motion of no-confidence. Bonafede, who is a member of the 5-Star Movement (M5S) told wire agency Ansa that the centre right\u2019s move would mean \u201cundermining confidence in the fight against corruption, the fight against the mafias, reforms to make trials shorter and more efficient, and measures to make sure no one goes unpunished\u201d. Therefore, on Monday, Italy introduced a new decree that will send back to jail the mobsters released during the pandemic and on Wednesday the first Mafia boss, a member of the Sicilian Mafia, was moved back to prison. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Italian police arrested 91 suspected members of the Sicilian Mafia that were trying to exploit economic woes triggered by the Covid pandemic. Charges range from mafia association to extortion, fraudulent assets possession, receiving stolen goods, money laundering, drug trafficking, sporting fraud and fraud and arrests were made in Palermo and Milan. According to Sicilian investigators, who launched the operation, mobsters were laundering extortion and drug trafficking revenue. The magistrates said bosses were preparing to use ill-gained cash to buy struggling businesses that shut down during the lockdown. Hotels, restaurants and beaches across Europe are being asked to enforce social-distancing between guests to allow Europeans to take their annual summer holiday. Announcing a set of measures intended to rescue Europe\u2019s crisis-hit tourism industry, the European Union executive called on Wednesday for a \u201cgradual\u201d and \u201ccareful\u201d easing of lockdown restrictions across the continent, while issuing advice to hotels, resort managers, restaurant owners and travel companies. Hotels are being asked to consider enabling guests to book slots at the pool, in the gym or the restaurant. Large public spaces, such as buffets, should ensure guests not in the same family can remain at least 1.5 metres apart, while big events, such as concerts, are discouraged. During their stay, guests should also be advised on \u201crespiratory etiquette\u201d, namely sneezing or coughing into a tissue or a bent elbow, plus issued with frequent reminders to wash their hands. Hotels would also be expected to keep address records to ensure contact tracing if there is an outbreak of coronavirus. Buses, trains and ferries are encouraged to run with fewer people and sell tickets online. Passengers are being asked to wear face masks on all modes of transport, in airports and stations, while duty free shops should restrict customer numbers. Transport workers are asked to wear masks and gloves, while operators should limit the numbers of people in waiting areas. \u201cThis is not going to be a normal summer, not for any of us,\u201d the European commission vice president, Margrethe Vestager, told journalists. She urged governments and businesses to follow recommendations from Brussels, so \u201cwe don\u2019t have to face a summer stuck at home or a completely lost summer for the European tourist industry\u201d. The commission is calling for a phased lifting of border closures, meaning countries with similarly low levels of coronavirus open to each other\u2019s tourists. Austria has already announced its intention to welcome visitors from Germany and the Czech Republic, while the three Baltic states will open their frontiers to each other\u2019s citizens from 15 May. The commission is urging neighbouring countries to coordinate decisions to ease the lockdown, in contrast to the haphazard and sudden border closures when the crisis began. \u201cOur guidance doesn\u2019t try to prescribe exactly what governments and business should do, instead it\u2019s about coordinating the steps that are taken throughout Europe,\u201d Vestager said. As countries look to ease school and play restrictions, Hannah Devlin, the Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, looks at the evidence that children react differently to coronavirus. You can read her report here . Thousands of sub-Saharan migrants in Morocco are trapped by coronavirus and poverty, AFP reports. Deprived of work and access to aid, they are struggling to make ends meet under COVID-19 restrictions. \u201cThe misery is across the board,\u201d , AFP quoted Ousmane Ba, head of the Collective of sub-Saharan Communities in Morocco. \u201cThose who worked as vendors are under lockdown without financial resources and the situation is getting worse for illegal migrants living in camps. \u201cThey can\u2019t go anywhere and non-government organisations can\u2019t come to help them.\u201d The north African kingdom has long been a transit country for migrants and refugees seeking a better life in Europe, and it has also become a host country for many. At least 20,000, the vast majority from sub-Saharan Africa, are trapped \u201cin a humanitarian emergency\u201d, said sociologist Mehdi Alioua of the anti-racism foreigners\u2019 support group GADEM, AFP reports. Many of them work in the informal sector, which accounts for more than 20 percent of Morocco\u2019s economy, and tend to live precariously, hand to mouth, even in normal times. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the live blog from Damien Gayle for a while. You can contact me on caroline.davies@theguardian.com if you have any tips or suggestions. The forced repatriation of migrants should be suspended for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic to protect the health of migrants and their communities, and guarantee human rights, a coalition of supranational agencies and NGOs has said. In a statement released on Wednesday, the UN network on migration said it was concerned about reports of states using the forced return of migrants as a measure to respond to the pandemic. In the statement, hosted on the International Organization for Migration website, the network added: Forced returns can intensify serious public health risks for everyone \u2013 migrants, public officials, health workers, social workers and both host and origin communities. Forced returns place additional strain on countries of return. Many health systems are already stretched and lack capacity to protect returnees and their communities, including through testing upon arrival and quarantine and self-isolation measures that preserve family unity and ensure the best interests of children. Returnees may face additional risks during transfer and upon return, such as lack of access to adequate healthcare, poor water and sanitation systems, halted ground transportation, additional restrictions on movement and violent discrimination and stigma in communities of return. In some contexts, returned migrants and asylum seekers may also be at risk of experiencing protracted displacement, trafficking in persons, and extreme financial hardship with increases to already high levels of unemployment due to Covid-19. Hairdressers, restaurants and cafes will reopen in Poland next week, the government announced on Wednesday \u2013 despite a recent increase in infections. The prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said that wearing masks outdoors and social distancing would still be mandatory when the new measures, which also include a return to school for some children, take effect on 18 May, according to AFP. The country of 38 million people, where testing for coronavirus has been limited, recorded a spike in infections this week after a wave of lockdown measures were suspended 10 days ago. On Tuesday, the health ministry reported 595 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, the highest daily number so far, and announced 28 more deaths from Covid-19. However, by Wednesday numbers swung back down, with 148 new cases reported, the lowest number in about six weeks, and eight new deaths. Poland has so far recorded 17,062 cases of coronavirus, with 6,410 patients recovering and 847 deaths. Hotels, shopping centres and childcare facilities reopened last week but a 10 May presidential election was postponed after preparations for a postal ballot became mired in chaos. Police in Montenegro detained a bishop of the Serbian Orthodox church and seven priests on suspicion of violating lockdown measures by organising a procession, AFP reports. The coastal Balkan state of 620,000 people has had 324 recorded coronavirus infections, of whom nine have died and 298 have recovered. Lockdown measures were eased this week, allowing churches to hold mass again, providing worshippers adhere to social distancing rules, including staying 10 sq metres apart and wearing face masks. But all other large public gatherings are still not permitted. Bishop Joanikije and the seven priests were remanded in custody for 72 hours after several thousand people took part in the procession held on Tuesday evening in the north-western town of Niksic. They are accused of \u201cfailing to comply with health regulations to combat a dangerous infectious disease\u201d, a prosecutors\u2019 statement said. The eight \u201cviolated the ban on public gatherings and organised a religious service in the streets of Niksic, attended by a large number of citizens\u201d, the statement added. If found guilty they face up to 12 years in jail. Schools, museums and hairdressers in Belgium will be allowed to reopen under strict conditions from next week, as part of a wide-ranging easing of the national lockdown, reports Jennifer Rankin, the Guardian\u2019s Brussels correspondent. Following a meeting of Belgium\u2019s national security council on Wednesday, the government announced a move to phase two of the lockdown-lifting plan from 18 May. From that day primary and secondary schools will reopen to selected years, but with extra hygiene measures in place. Marriages and funerals can take place with no more than 30 guests and social distancing in place. Markets can start trading again, with a maximum of 50 traders, who must wear masks. Hairdressers and beauticians can open to customers with appointments, but staff and customers will have to wear face coverings. Museums and zoos can open to the public, as long as they sell tickets online and take steps to keep people distanced, while any onsite cafes and restaurants must remain closed. Since the start of the week, non-essential shops have been allowed to reopen, while limited socialising has been permitted, as part of the first tentative steps to ending the lockdown. Authorities have warned these measures could be reversed if the pandemic worsens. The number of infections has been on a slow downward trend since the end of March. In the last 24 hours Belgium has recorded 70 new hospital admissions, compared with 400-500 a day at the peak of the crisis. The prime minister, Sophie Wilm\u00e8s, has said \u201cthere will probably be no return to normal for the summer\u201d. Large cultural and sporting events remain banned. Any reopening of bars and restaurants will not happen before 8 June, when the next phase of steps to end the lockdown could come into force. After 51 days of lockdowns, Mexico is preparing for \u201cthe new normality\u201d, its president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, said on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press \u2013 despite reporting its highest number of new deaths so far. On Wednesday the country reported 1,992 new cases of coronavirus and 353 new deaths from Covid-19, the highest daily figures since its outbreak began. The figures bring the total death toll to 3,926, while the total number of cases stands at 38,324, of whom 25,935 have recovered. However, AP reported, officials have acknowledged the real figure is many times higher. Mexico has been under pressure from US officials to reopen auto plants because without them, integrated supply chains would make it hard for plants in the US and Canada to reopen. At the country\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing, the economy secretary, Graciela M\u00e1rquez, included car and truck manufacturing among the first industries that would be allowed to resume, following a \u201cgradual, orderly and cautious\u201d reopening. M\u00e1rquez said that about one-tenth of Mexico\u2019s townships that have no recorded cases of coronavirus would be allowed to resume business and school activities, but would be surrounded by health checkpoints. There are about 269 such \u201ctownships of hope\u201d, that neither have active cases in their own territory nor in adjoining townships. They are largely located in rural areas in north-central and south-eastern Mexico. The health secretary, Jorge Alcocer, said: \u201cWe are in the critical part of the pandemic, but we are doing well.\u201d The education secretary, Esteban Moctezuma, said: \u201cWe are not going to return to classes until it is safe.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s US live blog has now started, with news of a gulf opening between the country\u2019s public health body, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the White House on how to safely reopen the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. My colleagues across the Atlantic report that advice from the nation\u2019s top disease control experts included detailed instructive guidance and more restrictive measures than the plan released by the White House last month. The guidance, which was shelved by Trump administration officials, also offered recommendations to help communities decide when to shut facilities down again during future flareups of Covid-19.

The Japan Sumo Association (JSA) confirmed the death and identified the wrestler as Shobushi, whose real name was Kiyotaka Suetake. The association said he died of multiple organ failure. He is reported to have been the first sumo wrestler to die from the virus, and the first person in his 20s to die in Japan from Covid-19. The JSA said the wrestler developed a fever on 4 April but could not get a test or find a hospital until his symptoms worsened and he was accepted four days later. He was moved to an intensive care unit on 19 April. The JSA said he suffered from diabetes. The JSA chairman, Hakkaku, said: I can only imagine how hard it must have been, battling illness for over a month, but like a wrestler he endured it bravely and fought the disease until the end. I just want him to rest peacefully now. The Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, guardians of the French language, have said a major non to le Covid. Not the actual disease, but the use of the masculine definitive article \u201cle\u201d, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. While many in France have been referring to \u201cle Covid\u201d, the so-called \u201cImmortals\u201d who make up the academy have ruled otherwise. Covid, they insist, is most definitely feminine. \u201cCovid is the acronym for coronavirus disease and acronyms have the genus of the name that forms the core of the phrase of which they are an abbreviation,\u201d the academy ruled in a statement on its website under the heading \u201cSay, don\u2019t say\u201d, aimed at stopping the French language being infected with Anglicisms. For example, it continued, the national rail company SNCF (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de Fer) is \u201cla\u201d because the nucleus of this group is \u201csociety\u201d, which is feminine in French. However, the IOC (International Olympic Committee) is \u201cle\u201d because the nucleus \u201ccommittee\u201d is masculine. It said: When this syntagm is composed of foreign words, the same principle applies. We can distinguish the FBI, Federal Bureau of Investigation, from the CIA, Central Intelligence Agency, since in one case the core word is translated by a masculine noun, bureau, and in the other by a feminine noun, agency. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry on Wednesday recorded 21 more coronavirus deaths and 268 additional infections. In a bulletin, the ministry said total deaths from the novel coronavirus have reached 772 while confirmed cases have risen to 11,618. But 145 more patients have recovered, increasing total recoveries to 2,251. The latest figures came as the government ordered an investigation into a birthday party thrown by the chief of police in Manila, after photos posted online showed him and dozens of fellow officers flouting the country\u2019s ban on socialising, Reuters reports. Photographs posted on the force\u2019s Facebook page on 8 May showed Debold Sinas, the chief of the national capital region\u2019s police office, along with dozens of people sitting closely together without masks, with beer cans on their tables despite a liquor ban, while a band entertained them. The photographs were taken down as the backlash mounted on social media, but by Wednesday the police chief\u2019s party had become the Philippines\u2019 second most trending topic on Twitter with more than 22,000 tweets. Sinas apologised for \u201ccausing anxiety to the public\u201d, but the national police chief and justice minister ordered separate investigations into the incident. \u201cIt was never my intention to disobey existing protocols relative to the implementation of the enhanced community quarantine,\u201d Sinas said in a statement. Sweden\u2019s public health authority reported 147 more deaths from Covid-19 on Wednesday, as the government announced it would hire up to 10,000 more nursing assistants and care workers to address shortcomings in elderly care exposed by the pandemic. About half of the 3,460 coronavirus-related deaths reported in Sweden have been among nursing home residents, and another quarter among those receiving care at home. The country\u2019s approach to the outbreak has been controversial, after the government eschewed a wide-ranging lockdown of society in favour of keeping the economy open. So far the country\u2019s public health authority has reported 27,909 confirmed cases, more than a third of which have been in the capital Stockholm, which has also accounted for about half of deaths. (A good daily analysis of Sweden\u2019s coronavirus statistics is available on the SVT Nyheter website) The boost in staff is the result of a deal between the government, Sweden\u2019s largest labour union Kommunal, and the country\u2019s municipalities which are tasked with managing elderly care, according to AFP. \u201cThe virus outbreak has shown that elderly care is vulnerable, and that has structural explanations,\u201d the health minister, Lena Hallengren, told reporters. The failure to protect vulnerable nursing home residents has been widely debated in the Nordic country. Some critics have blamed staff working conditions, with reports that many had to work without protective gear. In March, Kommunal said that 40% of staff at nursing homes in Stockholm \u2013 the centre of the Swedish epidemic \u2013 were unskilled workers employed on short-term contracts, with hourly wages and no job security, while 23% were temps. These were people who often could not afford not to go to work even if they were sick, they argued. Fifty-two more patients have died from Covid-19 in the Netherlands, with 227 more people testing positive for the coronavirus, health authorities said on Wednesday. The latest update from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) brings the total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus to 43,211, and the death toll to 5,562. As of Wednesday morning, more than 69,000 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed across Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office. Of those infected, more than 23,000 have recovered and about 2,300 have died. The last country in Africa left unaffected by the coronavirus pandemic, Lesotho, has announced its first case, AFP reports. The virus was detected in one of 81 people who were tested after arriving last week from Saudi Arabia and neighbouring South Africa, the health ministry said in a statement. \u201cThe Ministry of Health informs the Basotho nation and the entire community living in Lesotho, that the country now has the first confirmed case of Covid-19,\u201d said the director general, Dr Nyane Letsie. The patient is a Lesotho national studying in Saudi Arabia. Lesotho went into lockdown on 29 March to protect itself from a potential spread of the virus from South Africa, which entirely surrounds the kingdom and has the highest number of confirmed cases on the continent. Prime Minister Thomas Thabane loosened the restrictions on 6 May, allowing \u201call non-essential services and enterprises\u201d to \u201ctemporarily open shop\u201d. From this Saturday Germany will relax controls on all of its borders, most of which have been completely closed since the middle of March to all but regular commuters and essential travel in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. The interior minister, Horst Seehofer, said that regulations were still being worked out with some countries, but in essence, borders with France, Austria and Switzerland will effectively be reopened, with all but random checks on both vehicles and their passengers taking place. The border with Luxembourg will be free from any controls, and a similar solution is being negotiated with authorities in Denmark, he said. Border police reacted to the news by opening five border crossing points between the southern German state of Bavaria, and Austria, on Wednesday morning. Earlier, the Austrian government had announced it was opening its borders with Germany, following a telephone meeting between the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Austrian counterpart, Sebastian Kurz, on Tuesday. The overall aim, said Seehofer, was to return to \u201cunrestricted tourism\u201d by 15 June. The news offers fresh perspectives both for businesses, especially in agriculture and forestry, and holidaymakers, for whom a summer holiday beyond Germany had seemed all but a faint possibility but is now looking like a much more realistic prospect. Seehofer said the restrictions could be easily tightened again if the virus was seen to be out of control. \u201cThis is on condition that the virus\u2019s progress continues to develop in a manageable way,\u201d Seehofer said. \u201cIf the situation worsens, we would have to react to that.\u201d Travel to Germany from third countries will continue to be restricted until at least the middle of June, he said, in compliance with the foreign ministry\u2019s global travel warning, which means that German citizens should not embark on foreign holidays to more distant locations. Greek health and civil protection authorities have rushed to a Roma camp in the country\u2019s heartland where an outbreak of coronavirus has caused consternation, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Infections are believed to have spread through the settlement, in the central city of Larissa, after more than 150 people attended the funeral of a man who died of the virus. About 3,000 men, women and children live in highly congested conditions in the camp. State TV reported that, so far, around 500 residents had been tested for Covid-19 following the detection of a new outbreak over the weekend and 10 new cases on Tuesday. Contract tracing is also being conducted. Positive cases were being transferred for quarantine to a medical centre specially installed in the area, according to the civil protection authority. The camp, in a locale known as Nea Smyrni, was initially placed under quarantine last month after a 32-year-old man tested positive for the virus. The man is believed to have broken lockdown regulations ordered by the government. At the time, the nation\u2019s chief infectious disease expert, Prof Sotiris Tsiodras, had described the outbreak as indicative of the dangers at large in dealing with a highly contagious disease. \u201cThe example of Larissa shows just how fragile the situation is,\u201d he said. By adopting strict restrictions and lockdown measures \u2013 now being gradually eased \u2013 Greece to date has handled the coronavirus pandemic well, recording 2,744 confirmed cases and a death toll of 152. The head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies has recommended wearing face masks in public spaces amid reports that the government is considering making their use compulsory, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, masks must only be worn on public transport and have been handed out at train and metro stations. But according to various newspapers, the Spanish health ministry is consulting with regional governments to see whether the use of masks should become mandatory. Speaking at his daily press conference on Wednesday morning, Fernando Sim\u00f3n said: \u2018The use of face masks is very advisable and everyone who can should use them in public spaces.\u201d However, Sim\u00f3n has also pointed out that masks may not be suitable for children, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or other breathing difficulties, or those who are prone to anxiety. Rightwing extremists and Islamic militants could exploit the coronavirus crisis by staging attacks on medics and hospitals, the European Union\u2019s top counterterrorism official has warned. In a confidential briefing, obtained on Wednesday by the Associated Press, the counter-terrorism coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, said extremists could view attacks on medical staff as an effective way of generating shocks to society. He noted that in the US, the FBI in March shot and killed a white supremacist while trying to arrest him for plotting to blow up a hospital treating Covid-19 patients, after initially considering an attack on an African-American school, mosque or synagogue. From past experience, he said it is known that terrorists and violent extremists, aiming to change societies and governmental systems through violence, seek to exploit major crises to achieve their objectives. De Kerchove noted that the Islamic State group, for example, emerged after the US-led invasion of Iraq and then gained strength during the Arab spring uprisings. In Europe, leftwing extremists are paying extensive attention to the pandemic, blaming governments and the capitalist system as a whole for it, saying politicians have underfunded healthcare services, de Kerchove wrote in the analysis. The document was circulated among EU member states on 7 May and first reported on Wednesday by Germany\u2019s Die Zeit newspaper\u2019s online edition. Day one of post-lockdown in France and the pavements flanking Paris\u2019s Canal Saint-Martin and the pedestrianised roads along the banks of the Seine were invaded with newly liberated Parisians on Monday, forcing the police to evacuate the popular spots and issue a hastily drawn up ban on drinking alcohol in public places, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. Day two, and police moved in to shoo away people sitting on the steps leading to Sacr\u00e9 Coeur on Tuesday evening. City Hall says people are not actually breaking the rules, but \u201cif everyone decides to go to the same place at the same time, that\u2019s a problem\u201d, an official said. French ministers have urged everyone to behave \u201cresponsibly and civically\u201d. Day three, and Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo repeated her wish to see the capital\u2019s parks and gardens opened. Hidalgo has been lobbying the government for this, but without success. Health minister Olivier V\u00e9ran said it would be too much of a health risk, given that the Paris region remains \u201cred\u201d on the coronavirus map, where the virus is still circulating and hospital intensive care units are saturated. On Wednesday, Hidalgo told BFMTV: \u201cWe have to open the parks and gardens as a matter of public health. You can take the metro but not walk in a park? If we don\u2019t open them, Parisians will gather in other spaces, like pavements and (river) banks.\u201d The mayor agrees the end of lockdown measures have to be \u201cprogressive and with extreme care\u201d, and said she would make it mandatory to wear a mask in parks and gardens if they were allowed to reopen. There was a small spike in the number of Covid-19 hospital admissions reported at the daily update on Tuesday evening and an increase of 348 deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total to just under 27,000. France has so far recorded 178,225 confirmed cases of coronavirus. In a vision of what may become the future for workers in many sectors, Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, its chief executive officer, Jack Dorsey, said in a company-wide email on Tuesday, according to a report by Guardian US technology writer Kari Paul. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian, saying the company was \u201cone of the first companies to go to a work-from-home model\u201d due to Covid-19, but does not anticipate being one of the first to return to its offices. The company said in a blogpost: We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralisation and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. Eight more people have been found to be infected with coronavirus in Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry reports, as people there prepare to enter a four-day \u201ctotal lockdown\u201d to try to curtail a recent increase in infections. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country is now 878, of whom 26 have died and 236 have recovered. After Lebanon began tentative steps last month to emerge from its coronavirus lockdown, on Tuesday the government said it would impose an almost total ban on movement from 7pm local time on Wednesday until 5am on Monday. It came after the country recorded more than 100 new infections over four days, but also after protests erupted. According to a report by Martin Chulov, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor, earlier this month, a freeze on many salaries, controls on bank withdrawals and slashed spending on social services have ravaged household incomes. The Lebanese government estimates that 75% of the population are now in need of aid, including food aid. Among refugee communities, the need for food aid rises to 90%, according to the International Rescue Committee. Fifty more people have died from Covid-19 in Iran, the country\u2019s health ministry spokesman said on Wednesday, while 1,958 more people tested positive for coronavirus, in what has been the worst outbreak so far in the Middle East. In his daily televised address, reported by the Islamic Republic News Agency, Kianoush Jahanpour said the total number of infections detected in Iran had reached 112,725, of whom 89,428 have recovered. The total death toll in the country is now 6,783. Of those still ill with the disease, 2,735 cases are in a critical condition, Jahanpour said. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed 5,000 in Afghanistan as the health ministry warned that easing lockdowns will bring a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat. Out of 619 suspected patients tested over the last 24 hours, 259 came back positive, pushing the total number of infections to 5,226. The death toll now stands at 132, after five more patients died overnight,. There has so far been 648 recoveries. Wahid Majrooh, the deputy health minister, warned people to heed the precautions and stay at home, adding: \u201cIf people continue to crowd on the streets and don\u2019t heed [warnings], the catastrophe of coronavirus will continue to surge in cities.\u201d The northern province of Balkh recorded its worst day, after 49 patients tested positive. There have so far been 437 infections and 17 deaths in the province. The number of transmissions continued to surge in Kandahar on Wednesday, with 29 new cases confirmed in the southern province. The governor of Kandahar is also struggling with the virus after he was infected last week. The capital, Kabul, which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected area with 1,368 confirmed cases, reported 27 new infections. Kabul has so far recorded 18 deaths from Covid-19. The western province of Herat, which has the highest number of deaths, recorded 22 new confirmed cases. The first case of Covid-19 in Afghanistan was reported in Herat and thousands of Afghan migrants poured back from Iran in February and March, fanning out across the country without being tested or quarantined. Confirmed cases in the remote province of Zabul reached 30 after three more infections confirmed today. The province\u2019s only hospital was destroyed in a Taliban attack last year. Majrooh also said the death toll of Tuesday\u2019s attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul reached 24, with 16 wounded, while 18 newborn babies were rescued from the scene. Scientists say that the dramatic improvements in air quality associated with the coronavirus lockdown may bring warmer temperatures and heavier monsoon rains this year, writes Kate Ravilious for the Guardian\u2019s science desk. With factories closed and roads relatively empty, air pollution in cities across Asia, Europe and the US has dropped by as much as 60% in recent weeks. The lack of haze has made skies bluer and some people in northern India have been able to see the Himalayas for the first time in 30 years. It also means that with fewer particles and polluting gases to hinder its path, more sunlight is able to reach the Earth\u2019s surface. Earlier this year, scientists confirmed that cleaner skies in recent decades have caused a brightening of the Earth\u2019s surface. Satellite measurements show that Europe experienced a surface dimming effect until the late 1980s, followed by a brightening effect as air pollution regulations kicked in. China followed a similar pattern, but had to wait until 2005 for brightening to set in. The cleaner skies resulting from lockdown are likely to have enhanced the brightening effect even further, but measuring the impact on climate is not straightforward. \u201cAerosols can scatter and absorb radiation. They can also modify clouds to make them more reflective and longer lived,\u201d explains Laura Wilcox, a climate scientist at the University of Reading. Surging death tolls in northern Nigeria have sparked fears that coronavirus is spreading out and combining with established diseases to pose a lethal threat in a region where medical care is poor, AFP reports. In the past month, the city of Kano, the most populous city in the north of the country, has witnessed hundreds of deaths, particularly among older people. At first authorities blamed the fatalities on ailments including diabetes, hypertension and malaria \u2013 but a team of government investigators later said most were suspected to be linked to coronavirus. Kano state has officially confirmed 666 infections and 32 deaths from coronavirus, making it the hardest-hit region in Nigeria after megacity Lagos. Testing has been severely limited but as capacity has picked up in recent days so the number of cases has climbed steadily. Now the surge in unexplained deaths has spread to neighbouring areas, sending local authorities scrambling to figure out the cause. As a whole, Nigeria has so far reported 4,787 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 158 deaths. Rightwing militia groups in Michigan plan to rally at the state capitol building on Thursday to protest Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s stay-at-home orders, writes Tom Perkins in Detroit. Thursday\u2019s demonstration will be the latest in a series of protests that started as a demonstration against the lockdown policy but are now generating fears of an eruption of political violence. The state is currently investigating what the Michigan attorney general, Dana Nessel, characterized on Monday as \u201ccredible threats\u201d against state Democratic politicians. Her comments followed a report of threats of violence on rightwing social media pages. Residents posting in the Michiganders Against Excessive Quarantine Facebook page called for Whitmer\u2019s assassination. \u201cWonder how long till she\u2019s hit with a shotgun blast,\u201d one wrote. Another said they hope Thursday\u2019s protesters are \u201carmed to the teeth\u201d because \u201cvoting is too late\u201d. Dramatic images from a 30 April protest showed militia members carrying assault rifles while glaring and shouting from the galleries of the state legislature as an emotional debate over extending a stay-at-home order took place. In response, a black lawmaker last week came to Michigan\u2019s capitol with an escort of armed black citizens. Spain\u2019s daily death toll from the coronavirus inched up on Wednesday to 184 fatalities from 176 on Tuesday, Reuters reports. The overall death toll from the disease rose to 27,104, according to the health ministry\u2019s daily report, while the overall number of diagnosed cases rose to 228,691 from 228,030 the prior day. The latest figures came as two foreign ministry sources told Reuters that Spanish authorities are planning to keep borders closed to most travellers from abroad until July, in a move to try and avoid a second wave of epidemic. Land borders with France and Portugal have been closed since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March to fight the pandemic, pushing the economy to a near stand-still and hitting its key tourism sector hard. Spain has started easing the lockdown for its residents as the pandemic gets under control and decided in parallel to apply a two-week quarantine for foreign travellers, practically shutting the border to air and maritime travel to avoid importing new cases from other countries. The quarantine measure is due to expire on 24 May when the state of emergency lapses, but both can be extended. In any case, restrictions on travel are likely to remain in place for much longer, no matter how crucial tourism is for the Spanish economy, the sources told Reuters. \u201cWhen we reach the new normal we can start opening borders with Schengen countries, we are talking about opening to these countries in early July,\u201d one of the sources said.

Here\u2019s something from Reuters about the relaxation of Germany\u2019s border controls: Germany will start to ease some of the border controls introduced to slow the spread of the coronavirus from Saturday with the aim of having free travel in Europe from 15 June, Interior Minster Horst Seehofer said on Wednesday. Seehofer said that general border controls agreed with France, Switzerland and Austria due to end on 15 May would be extended until 16 June but as many crossings as possible would be reopened. \u201cThe goal is that from mid-June we want to have free travel in Europe,\u201d he said, adding that controls could be re-imposed if there are new outbreaks. We have previously reported on the boom in bicycle sales in Britain and in Australia. This just in from the US: Such is the demand for bicycles that Denver bike shop co-owner Phillip Brown and his colleagues can\u2019t build them quick enough. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this industry 15 years and nothing even close,\u201d says Brown, 36. \u201cThis is, I would say, twice the demand increase that we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March, a cycling boom has been under way across the US. The National Association of City Transport Officials (NACTO) says they are seeing an \u201cexplosion in cycling\u201d in many American cities. Eco-Counter, which collects bike data, reports that bicycle counts have \u201csignificantly increased\u201d across most of North America compared to usual. In the two weeks to 4 May, it found the US region with the most growth was the south-west, which was up by over 100%. More here: New coronavirus hotspots are emerging in Republican heartland communities across multiple states, contradicting Donald Trump\u2019s claims that infection rates are declining across the nation. At a fraught press briefing on Monday, the president declared: \u201cAll throughout the country, the numbers are coming down rapidly.\u201d Yet county-specific figures show a surge in infection rates in towns and rural communities in red states such as Texas, Tennessee, Alabama, Kentucky and North and South Dakota, according to data tracking by the New York Times. Trump\u2019s claim is also contradicted by data used by the White House\u2019s own pandemic taskforce to track new and emerging hotspots. More here: A Russian healthcare watchdog has suspended the use of a domestically manufactured ventilator suspected to have caused two deadly fires in Russian hospitals in the last week. Six people died and hundreds were forced to evacuate hospitals in Moscow and St Petersburg after the Russian-made ventilators were said to have ignited, apparently while patients were attached. On Wednesday, Russia\u2019s federal service for surveillance in healthcare said it would suspend the use of new Aventa-M ventilators produced after 1 April pending a safety review, a decision that will affect hundreds of machines. Aventa-M ventilators were also sold to the United States last month during a controversial aid mission negotiated by Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. US hospitals reportedly had not used the ventilators because they were manufactured for the wrong voltage. It is not clear when those ventilators were produced. The US federal emergency management agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday that the ventilators were not in use in US hospitals and that local authorities would return the machines to FEMA. Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee has said it is investigating the fires in Russian hospitals. The decision by the Russian watchdog could affect hundreds of ventilators that have been produced since April as Russian hospitals sought new supplies to prepare for a flood of coronavirus cases. Five coronavirus patients, some reportedly attached to ventilators, died in the early hours of Tuesday after a fire broke out at the St George hospital in St Petersburg. A fire last week at a Moscow hospital treating coronavirus patients also killed one person. That fire may also have been tied to a faulty ventilator. Both hospitals were reportedly using Aventa-M ventilators produced by a state-run factory in Russia\u2019s Urals region. An April tender showed that last month the St George hospital had ordered 237 ventilators from the factory, which is the only manufacturer of that ventilator in the country. The continuing ban on public and religious gatherings in Nigeria has led to increasingly divided reactions from Churches in Nigeria. In recent weeks, two of the most influential mega-church pastors in the country have grown in hostility to the government\u2019s lockdown measures, and questioned the severity of the pandemic altogether. Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle has been among the most ardent critics of the ban on places of worship. Its main branch on the outskirts of Lagos draws 50,000 people. Earlier this week Oyedepo said the closure of churches while hospitals and markets were open amounted to a conspiracy against Churches. \u201cThere is something wrong; for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can\u2019t be in church for two hours. I can smell a rat,\u201d he said this week. \u201cThe voice of darkness is influencing people at various levels, targeting the church because the growth and expansion of the church is the greatest headache of the devil. I declare churches open.\u201d Pastor Chris Oyakhilome\u2019s Christ Embassy is spread around the world with a main branch in Lagos seating 30,000 people. The pastor has been a consistent critic of measures to tackle the pandemic. \u201cThe lockdown is not science,\u201d he said in a sermon on Tuesday. The wearing of facemasks in public was \u201can embarrassment to science\u201d, he added. He has also previously linked Covid-19 to 5G mobile phone networks, fuelling a conspiracy theory that has spread around the world. Both church leaders have faced criticism for their comments, not least from fellow church pastors. Pastor Tunde Bakare, the head of The Citadel Global Community Church, where the main hall in Lagos seats 5,000, this week donated two church buildings and a private residence to Nigerian states for isolation centres. \u201cChurches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticising the government should collaborate with them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey must be prepared to offer some of their halls to the government as isolation centres, in support of the efforts of the government.\u201d In a further boost to Nigeria\u2019s Covid-19 response, the Catholic Church in Nigeria this week donated all of its 425 medical facilities across the country to the government to serve as isolation and treatment centres. Nigeria\u2019s predominantly deeply religious population is evenly split between Christians and Muslims according to government surveys. The effect of the lockdown on religious life has been immense. Yet many Nigerian Christians are increasingly calling on the country\u2019s mega churches to donate their now empty auditoriums as the country rushes to build its health capacity. New infections of Covid-19 in Nigeria are growing, now at 4,787, doubling in the last 12 days. 158 people have lost their lives and 959 people have recovered. Reuters have filed this update from Poland: Poland will extend its strict border controls until 12 June due to the coronavirus pandemic, its Interior Ministry said on Wednesday. Poland closed its borders to foreigners in March to stop the spread of the coronavirus and has extended the restriction four times since then. Polish citizens, diplomats, foreigners with the legal right to live in Poland and foreign professional drivers can enter Poland at selected checkpoints. While keeping borders closed, Poland is easing some other curbs imposed earlier. It has reopened shopping malls, hotels, outdoor playgrounds and allowed kindergartens to restart. The government is expected to announce on Wednesday the lifting of further restrictions on schools, restaurants and hairdressers. Poland now has 17,062 confirmed coronavirus cases and 847 deaths. On Tuesday, the country saw its largest spike in new coronavirus cases in one day due to a rapid growth in infections among coal miners. Malaysia has reported 37 new cases of coronavirus, taking its cumulative total to 6,779 infections. The health ministry has also reported two new deaths, raising the total number of confirmed fatalities from the outbreak to 111. Iceland is preparing to ease their immigration restrictions, with some professionals including scientists, filmmakers and athletes eligible for a modified quarantine from Friday, and more widespread changes starting no later than 15 June. Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, minister of tourism, industry and innovation, said: \u201cWhen travellers return to Iceland we want to have all mechanisms in place to safeguard them and the progress made in controlling the pandemic. Iceland\u2019s strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far. We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us.\u201d The new rules to be introduced next month are expected to consist of visitors being given a choice between a coronavirus test on arrival or a two-week quarantine, as well as the use of the country\u2019s official tracing app. The country has recorded 1,801 cases and 10 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins, with only three new cases confirmed so far this month. When James, 34, started looking for a house near his new workplace in Malawi\u2019s capital, Lilongwe, he was not expecting any hurdles. As a new medical doctor with a job at a public hospital he would normally be an ideal tenant for any landlord. When he called about an apartment, the landlady confirmed it was vacant but when he said he was a doctor, she seemed to cool. When he arrived the next day to view the apartment, she said somebody else was taking it. \u201cThat was when I realised that I had made a blunder \u2026 by announcing my profession. Her response just confirmed the fears that doctors like me looking to rent have \u2013 that they will be refused out of fear of the virus,\u201d said James, who asked to use only his first name. Health workers, once held in high regard in Malawi, are being stigmatised because of of the coronavirus pandemic. More here: Russia registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, continuing a grim trend that has seen the country become a global virus hotspot, AFP reports. Health officials reported 10,028 new cases over the last 24 hours, bringing Russia\u2019s total number of infections to 242,271. The Kremlin this week eased a national lockdown to slow the spread of the virus, despite a steady rise in numbers that has brought Russia to second place in a global tally of infections, behind the United States. A majority of Russia\u2019s new cases were registered in the capital, a government virus tally said, where Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, has extended a lockdown until the end of May. Despite the steady rise in new cases, Russia\u2019s reported mortality rate is significantly lower compared to other European countries hit hard by the pandemic, with 96 new deaths and a total of 2,212 dead from the coronavirus as of Wednesday. Authorities say the low mortality rate is because Russia was able to learn lessons from the experiences of western Europe, moving quickly to isolate travellers and people at risk, convert hospitals for virus patients and launch a vast campaign to test and quarantine those infected. Authorities on Monday said they had carried out nearly six million tests. But critics have cast doubt on the figures, accusing authorities of under-counting by blaming virus-related deaths on other causes. Here are the latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom: Tui plans to cut up to 8,000 jobs in response to the coronavirus chaos engulfing the tourism industry. Europe\u2019s largest travel group said it needed to reduce costs permanently to tackle \u201cunquestionably the greatest crisis the industry and Tui has ever faced\u201d. It lost \u20ac740m (\u00a3650m) in the first three months of the year, requiring a rapid German state bailout as the company bled cash and cancelled most of its holidays until June. Travel restrictions in most of its main markets have destroyed demand for holidays, with nine in 10 Tui employees furloughed or given pay cuts in a desperate attempt to lower costs. Tui had more than 70,000 employees in September. More here: Here\u2019s a summary of all the latest data on coronavirus in Australia, which hopefully gives a picture of how Covid-19 is affecting Australians and helps track the impact of government measures: As French schools reopen this morning, there\u2019s still no sign of activity at the country\u2019s Amazon warehouses. Amazon plans to extend the closure of its French warehouses until 18 May, the company has announced. Its six French warehouses have been closed since 16 April following court rulings that ordered it to restrict deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic or face hefty fines. Amazon said it was continuing to consult with staff representatives and was also reviewing a request for an additional independent expert report. Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed another 675 cases of confirmed coronavirus infections, taking the city-state\u2019s tally to 25,346. 21 people have so far died. The border between Austria and Germany will be completely opened from 15 June, Austria\u2019s tourism minister, Elisabeth K\u00f6stinger, has told the country\u2019s public service broadcaster, ORF. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, have agreed on a two-step plan to ease travel restrictions, she said, with some restrictions on border traffic to be eased from Friday and controls to be completely lifted from 15 June. The former Fortescue Metals chief executive Nev Power, handpicked by the Australian prime minister Scott Morrison to be his Covid-19 coordination adviser, is being paid $500,000 (about \u00a3264,000) for six months\u2019 work. Power\u2019s remuneration was revealed at a hearing of the Senate inquiry into the management of the coronavirus crisis, where senators focused on whether there were proper processes in place for members of the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission to declare any conflicts of interest, given that many are company directors. It was also revealed during the inquiry that Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, who has been engaged as a special adviser to the NCCC on manufacturing, was not required to declare potential conflicts in the way that commissioners were. The British Office for National Statistics has announced that UK economy contracted by 2% in the first quarter of 2020 after plunging 5.8% in March as the coronavirus crisis took hold: Good morning. Simon Burnton here, taking over for the next few hours. You can contact me on Twitter @Simon_Burnton or by email here. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thank you to those of you who sent tips via email and Twitter. I hope your day goes better than it did for the owners of these gardens: Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,261,955 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 291,964 have died since the pandemic began. The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes. More than 147,000 Americans could die by early August \u2013 study. A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans could die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The current US death toll stands at 82,376. Brazil reports record deaths. Brazil reported a record 881 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest. US Senate threatens sanctions on China over Covid-19 accounting. US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian. India PM announces US$270bn virus economic package. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP. The package came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths. Global report: Brazil and Mexico record deadliest day from Covid-19 Brazil and Mexico have both seen deaths from Covid-19 spike on their deadliest days yet as the coronavirus pandemic threatened to worsen throughout the Americas. The health ministry in Brazil on Tuesday reported 881 fatalities from the disease in 24 hours, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country for deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Brazil\u2019s total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the seventh highest in the world. The United States remains by far the worst affected country and now has almost a third of the world\u2019s 4.26m cases, with a national death toll of 82,339. The fatality figure could rise much higher according to modelling from the University of Washington that predicted more than 147,000 Americans would die from Covid-19 by early August \u2013 up nearly 10,000 from the last projection. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert, has told senators that the real death toll was probably higher and Americans could face \u201cserious consequences\u201d if safeguards were relaxed too soon. Fashion police: South Africa\u2019s minister for trade and industry, Ebrahim Patel, has published a list of the clothing items people are allowed to buy under Level 4 restrictions in the country. The list, which seems to mainly include winter clothing items, is at times oddly specific, with one item \u2013 \u201ccrop bottoms worn with boots and leggings\u201d \u2013 provoking mockery (and confusion) online. Among the other items included are: short sleeved knit tops, where promoted and displayed as worn under cardigans and knitwear; short sleeved t-shirts, where promoted and displayed as under garments for warmth; shirts, either short- or long-sleeved, where displayed and promoted to be worn under jackets coats and/or knitwear; The minister later said that the list had been published at the request of clothing retailers. The UN Security Council is trying again to reach agreement on its first resolution since the coronavirus pandemic started circling the globe over two months ago, but a dispute between the US and China over mentioning the World Health Organization remains unresolved, AP reports. The United States on Friday objected to a proposed resolution drafted by France and Tunisia after diplomats said it had agreed to compromise language with China that didn\u2019t directly mention the UN health agency. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has arrived in Israel for talks on regional security and the Jewish state\u2019s controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. In a rare foreign trip during the coronavirus pandemic, Pompeo plans to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and incoming defence minister Benny Gantz a day before a unity government agreed between the two men is scheduled to be sworn in. How big tech plans to profit from the pandemic It has taken some time to gel, but something resembling a coherent pandemic shock doctrine is beginning to emerge. Call it the Screen New Deal. Far more hi-tech than anything we have seen during previous disasters, the future that is being rushed into being as the bodies still pile up treats our past weeks of physical isolation not as a painful necessity to save lives, but as a living laboratory for a permanent \u2013 and highly profitable \u2013 no-touch future. This is a future in which, for the privileged, almost everything is home delivered, either virtually via streaming and cloud technology, or physically via driverless vehicle or drone, then screen \u201cshared\u201d on a mediated platform. It\u2019s a future that employs far fewer teachers, doctors and drivers. It accepts no cash or credit cards (under guise of virus control), and has skeletal mass transit and far less live art. It\u2019s a future that claims to be run on \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, but is actually held together by tens of millions of anonymous workers tucked away in warehouses, data centres, content-moderation mills, electronic sweatshops, lithium mines, industrial farms, meat-processing plants and prisons, where they are left unprotected from disease and hyper-exploitation. It\u2019s a future in which our every move, our every word, our every relationship is trackable, traceable and data-mineable by unprecedented collaborations between government and tech giants. Nature is healing in San Jose, California: Thailand has recorded zero new coronavirus cases for the first time since 9 March, Rueters reports. Thailand has 3,017 confirmed cases and 56 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000.

US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization. Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus, according to local media. It was widely believed that this will be done within 10 days. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times. Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019. Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. Twitter has \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d working from home since 2 March and mandated employees to work from home starting 11 March. Those who want to return to the office will probably need to wait until at least September. India PM announces US$270bn virus economic package.

French schools reopen. Thousands of schools have reopened throughout France as the government eased its lockdown rules, despite fears of a second waves of infections, Agence France-Presse reports. Podcast: do we need more than one Covid-19 vaccine? Hannah Devlin speaks to Prof Andrew Pollard about the work being done by different teams around the world to create a vaccine for Covid-19, and where his team at Oxford University fit into this international effort Yemen faces spectre of coronavirus amid aid cuts Ramadan is a quiet affair in Yemen this year. \u201cPeople are very afraid,\u201d said Ahmed, an aid worker in the Houthi rebel-controlled capital, Sana\u2019a, who asked for his last name to be withheld. \u201cThere\u2019s no money, there\u2019s no healthcare and now you can\u2019t even celebrate iftar with family because of the coronavirus.\u201d Yemen, where five years of war have already created the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, is uniquely vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a unilateral ceasefire announced by Saudi Arabia last month, there has been an uptick in fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition fighting on behalf of Yemen\u2019s government, as well as renewed hostilities between the coalition and separatist forces in the country\u2019s south. The fresh violence, combined with humanitarian funding shortfalls and cuts, means Covid-19 could not have arrived at a worse time: EU faces \u2018existential threat\u2019 if coronavirus recovery is uneven The risk of an uneven economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis poses an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the European Union, one of its most senior economic policymakers has said. Paolo Gentiloni, a former Italian prime minister and now the EU\u2019s economy commissioner, said the bloc also had a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d as it charts a plan to rescue Europe\u2019s economy. In an interview a few days after the commission said Europe had entered \u201cthe deepest economic recession in its history\u201d, Gentiloni said the EU needed a \u201csound recovery plan\u201d to avoid the risks of economic division. Shuttered shops and factories, grounded planes and stay-at-home consumers as a result of lockdown restrictions mean the EU economy is expected to shrink by 7.5% in 2020, a deeper fall than the 2009 financial crisis. Chinese authorities are preparing to test all 11 million residents of Wuhan, after a small outbreak in the city earlier this week. It\u2019s been widely believed that this will be done within 10 days - an extraordinary undertaking for a city of 11 million people. However, Chinese media reports have given some more clarity today, suggesting that while there is a citywide testing plan, the time limit is for each region on staggered start times. \u201cEach district shall make arrangements for nucleic acid screening plan for all members within 10 days,\u201d said a Wuhan government notice. Caixin Global reported some districts will start this week, and some next.The article cited Wuhan disease control officials saying the testing will be done by third party companies and some hospital and disease control employees. However, it said the rate of testing couldn\u2019t see more than 100,000 a day. On Tuesday Yicai news said Wuchang district was to be screened between 13 May and 20 May, but with the intention of finishing by the 17 may to allow three days \u201cto find out and fill in the gaps\u201d. A resident of Jianghan, once the worst-hit district of Wuhan, told media he\u2019d received a registration form on Tuesday for himself and his family to either report having been tested or register for testing. Peng Zhiyong, director of the intensive care unit at the Wuhan University\u2019s Zhongnan Hospital, told the Global Times that he hadn\u2019t received any details of the testing plan as of Tuesday. The lifting of coronavirus lockdowns in China has given the stuttering auto industry a jumpstart, with sales rising for the first time in two years as buyers return as the health crisis eases, AFP reports. Sales in the world\u2019s biggest car market began to slide in 2018 and plunged further when the pandemic paralysed the economy, but they have rebounded as the country tames the virus and lifts restrictions on travel and businesses. Sales rose 4.4% year-on-year in April, the latest figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show, driven by strong demand for commercial vehicles, which soared more than 30%. The recent uptick came as China emerged from months of lockdown and restrictions on movement imposed around the country earlier this year to curb the spread of the virus. Passenger car sales suffered at the time, plunging close to 80% from a year ago in February, according to China Passenger Car Association data. Asian markets fell again Wednesday after Donald Trump\u2019s top virus adviser warned that easing lockdown measures too early could spark another dangerous wave of infections and batter the economic recovery, AFP reports. Brewing tensions between the US and China added another layer of concern for traders after lawmakers in Washington proposed giving the president powers to impose fresh sanctions if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak. Tokyo ended the morning down 0.8%, while Hong Kong dropped 0.2% and Shanghai slipped 0.3%. Sydney shed 0.9%, while there were also losses in Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Jakarta and Wellington. The second day of selling followed losses on Wall Street and eats into recent gains driven by slowing infection and death rates, and the lifting of economy-strangling measures that kept billions at home. The recent optimism that has flowed through markets, helped by trillions of dollars in worldwide stimulus and central bank backstopping, has been given a jolt by data showing fresh outbreaks in South Korea, China and Germany. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 798 to 171,306, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 101 to 7,634, the tally showed. Launched amid the mounting scare over the coronavirus, a Japanese video chat website designed for hosting virtual drinking parties has soared in popularity while bars and pubs remain shut, Reuters reports. Nomikai, or drinking gatherings, are seen by many Japanese as central to building strong relationships among friends and workmates to bond. Tapping into that culture, Tacnom - which means drinks at home in Japanese - has attracted 2.4 million users in its first two months. \u201cI really didn\u2019t expect this impact and I\u2019m extremely happy,\u201d Takashi Kiyose, chief executive of Tacnom\u2019s operator 1010 Inc, told Reuters. Tacnom does not require downloads or registrations unlike other online video platforms, but its users can create a URL link and share with their friends to join virtual gatherings of up to 12 people. \u201cI hope our service can help users meet people they cannot see now. I would be very happy if their time at home due to self-restraints from going out will be enriched,\u201d Kiyose said. Japan remains under a state of emergency until end of May. The move allows local municipalities to urge people to stay inside, but without punitive measures or legal force. The country has reported about 15,000 coronavirus cases, and 633 deaths from the virus. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. China reported seven new coronavirus infections on the mainland on 12 May, versus one a day earlier, the national health authority said on Wednesday. Of the seven new cases reported by mainland China today, six are people who were infected by local transmission in Jilin province, which borders Russia and North Korea. Authorities have now ordered stricter lockdown measures in response. According to Beijing News, residents of Jilin city must get tested for the virus at their own expense and obtain a negative result before being allowed to travel to other cities. They must also complete strict self quarantine. There are new requirements for entering and leaving residences, gatherings like dinner parties have been banned and public transportation has been suspended. It comes after the province\u2019s Shulan city was reclassified as high risk and ordered to partially shut down this week after confirming 12 cases. Mexico\u2019s government gave the green light on Tuesday for the key automotive industry to restart production after weeks of disruption by the coronavirus pandemic, a decision that should pave the way to reopen North American supply chains, Reuters reports. The government\u2019s health committee, which issues binding sanitation rules, said it agreed to add makers of transport equipment, a category that includes automotive and aerospace industries, to the list of activities considered essential. Mexican auto output fell nearly 99% in April, and the government is under pressure from the United States to synchronize its restart with American companies that rely on supply chains from south of the border. The virus outbreak in Mexico is several weeks behind the US epidemic however, and health authorities have been cautious to avoid moving too fast and putting more lives at risk. Mexico\u2019s Social Security Institute said 555,247 people registered with it lost their jobs in April, while Mexico\u2019s daily death toll on Tuesday was its highest yet from the outbreak. Podcast: What does the biggest economic slump in 300 years mean for Britain As the chancellor announces plans to extend the unprecedented scheme to pay the wages of millions of workers, whole sectors of the economy remain shut because of Covid-19, causing a recession unseen in Britain for centuries. Larry Elliott explains what it will mean for the country: Foreign Policy has obtained a leaked data set from a Chinese military university which it says could give extraordinary insight into the accuracy of China\u2019s published statistics \u2013 but is not being shared with other countries or the World Health Organisation. \u201cBeijing claims that since the coronavirus pandemic began at the end of last year, there have been only 82,919 confirmed cases and 4,633 deaths in mainland China,\u201d the report says. \u201cThose numbers could be roughly accurate, and in that case a detailed account would be an important tool in judging the spread of the virus. But it\u2019s also possible that the numbers presented to the rest of the world are vastly understated compared to Beijing\u2019s private figures.\u201d According to Foreign Policy, the dataset has incredibly detailed breakdowns of the country\u2019s epidemic, with more than 640,000 information updates from 230 cities. \u201cEach update includes the latitude, longitude, and \u2018confirmed\u2019 number of cases at the location, for dates ranging from early February to late April,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe dataset, though it contains inconsistencies\u2014and though it may not be comprehensive enough to contradict Beijing\u2019s official numbers\u2014is the most extensive dataset proved to exist about coronavirus cases in China. But more importantly, it can serve as a valuable trove of information for epidemiologists and public health experts around the globe\u2014a dataset that Beijing has almost certainly not shared with US officials or doctors.\u201d Lives have been lost in the coronavirus pandemic because of the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) exclusion of Taiwan and refusal to allow it to share best practices and information, a top US government commission on China said in a new report. The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow non-WHO member Taiwan, claimed by China as one of its provinces, full access to the body, becoming another source of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing, Reuters reports. Taiwan says China and the WHO have conspired for political purposes to lock it out of key meetings, that the WHO has not responded to its requests for coronavirus information and that the WHO has previously misreported Taiwan\u2019s virus case numbers. The WHO and China strongly dispute this, saying Taiwan has been given all the help it needs, but that only China has the right to represent the democratic island in the WHO. In a report released on Tuesday, the US Congress\u2019 US-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Taiwan\u2019s exclusion contributed to \u201ccritical delays\u201d in timely receipt and accurate guidance for WHO members in the early stages of the outbreak. \u201cHad the WHO allowed Taiwan\u2019s health experts to share information and best practices in early January, governments around the world could have had more complete information on which to base their public health policies,\u201d it said. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: \u201cThere is no playbook for the recovery we are about to embark on but nor do we need one,\u201d Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, has said in a speech the day before her government unveils its annual Budget. \u201cWhen it has come to Covid-19 we have carved a path based on our people, our health system, and our economy. And now that is exactly what we will do again, as we recover and rebuild.\u201d Her comments came as New Zealand recorded a second consecutive day of no new Covid-19 cases, and prepares to loosen lockdown restrictions further on Thursday. Warning that her finance minister\u2019s spending plan would be unveiled during \u201cthe most challenging economic conditions faced by any government since the Great Depression,\u201d Ardern said the government would respond not with austerity but with investment. \u201cWe will run the ruler over every line of expenditure, no question we need to ensure our expenditure provides value for money and supports our primary goal of jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the notion that at this time of need we would make cuts to the essential services so many New Zealanders need more than ever is not only immoral, it is economically wrong.\u201d Her government yesterday made a pre-Budget announcement of $4 billion NZD for New Zealand\u2019s health system. Grant Robertson, the finance minister, has already allocated a stimulus of $22 billion NZD -- half of it on wage subsidies -- since Covid-19 reached New Zealand. You can read our preview of Robertson\u2019s Budget here: In other New Zealand news: the country\u2019s ban on large funerals and tangi has been described as \u201cinhumane\u201d by the opposition leader, and \u201cdisappointing\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d by indigenous funeral directors. New Zealand is set to exit the coronavirus lockdown and resume many parts of normal life on Thursday, but restrictions on funerals and tangi remain, with only ten mourners permitted. The same rules also apply to weddings. Simon Bridges, the National party leader and a M\u0101ori man,said the limit of 10 mourners would cause added grief and pain for families wanting to say goodbye to a loved one. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you can have 30 people on a rugby field playing close contact sport but you can\u2019t have more than ten people at a funeral so they can grieve together,\u201d Bridges said in a statement: The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has reported a second consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19, the day before the government further loosens lockdown restrictions on the country. 94% of the 1,147 people in New Zealand confirmed to have Covid-19 have recovered, said Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, at a news conference in Wellington. 20 people have died of the coronavirus in New Zealand. There were no additional deaths on Wednesday. New Zealand\u2019s government has drawn praise for its strict and early lockdown of the country when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and no one had died. A stringent month-long national shutdown followed. While restrictions have been loosened slightly already, the country will open further tomorrow, with New Zealanders allowed to socialise outside of their homes for the first time in groups of no larger than 10. Many more businesses will re-open, including cafes, shops and restaurants. Next week, schools and bars will re-open; schools had been operating in a limited capacity in recent weeks. India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiled a $270bn stimulus package for labourers and small businesses on Tuesday, to boost flagging growth as the country grapples with the impact of the coronavirus and weeks-long lockdown. The package \u2013 worth about 10% of India\u2019s GDP \u2013 came as the country was set to mark its 50th day in the world\u2019s biggest lockdown as the number of virus cases topped 70,000 with 2,200 deaths. \u201cThis economic package is for India\u2019s self-reliant movement. It is for the cottage, small and medium scale industries,\u201d Modi said in a televised address. The funding includes a $2bn relief package announced at the start of the lockdown in late March and stimulus efforts by the central bank, Modi said. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman would unveil further details in the next few days, he added. Israeli police arrested over 300 people Tuesday as officers attempted to control crowds that had assembled at a religious site in northern Israel in violation of coronavirus restrictions, AP reports. Police said that despite regulations against large assemblies at Mount Meron and police checkpoints on roads near the site, hundreds of religious Jews turned up and some threw stones and other objects a police officers at the scene. Jews observed the holiday of Lag B\u2019Omer, on which ultra-Orthodox Jews customarily gather at the tomb of a prominent rabbi in antiquity on Mount Meron. Celebrations are typically marked with enormous crowds, dancing and the lighting of bonfires. Thousands of ultra-Orthodox Israelis marked the holiday in Jerusalem with large assemblies despite bans on public gatherings of more than 20 people due to the pandemic. Israel\u2019s ultra-Orthodox community has been hit especially hard by the coronavirus outbreak. Interior Minister Aryeh Deri said earlier this week that around 70% of the country\u2019s more than 16,500 confirmed cases were ultra-Orthodox, who make up around 12% of Israel\u2019s population. Israel started easing restrictions on movement and gathering earlier this month. Israel has reported 260 deaths from Covid-19. More than half of those infected in Israel have recovered. Something a little lighter now, from AFP: A lovesick 20-year-old American man tried dressing up as a cleaner to cheat coronavirus border controls in Germany so he could see his girlfriend, police said Tuesday. After arriving at Frankfurt airport from Washington on Sunday, the young US national donned a high-visibility vest and picked up two bags of rubbish. \u201cHe then tried to convince security staff that he was a cleaner and was supposed to empty the bins behind the security area,\u201d federal police said in a statement. However, his plan was foiled when a member of staff noticed he was not wearing a security pass and couldn\u2019t speak German. He confessed at a police station that he was desperate to see his girlfriend and couldn\u2019t think of another way of entering the country. Even if he had managed to reach the bins, the man would still have been in the airport\u2019s transit area, police said \u2013 meaning he would still have faced more border controls. After being questioned, the young romantic was sent back to Washington on Monday. \u2018A generation-defining moment\u2019: delivering New Zealand\u2019s pandemic budget When Grant Robertson, New Zealand\u2019s finance minister, unveiled his last annual budget he told the country that its success would no longer be measured by economic growth and productivity, but instead by the wellbeing of the nation\u2019s population. A year on and one day before he reveals his new spending plan, Robertson\u2019s so-called wellbeing budget \u2013 a concept he intended would frame his fiscal policy for every future year of his term managing the country\u2019s books \u2013 faces an extraordinary and unexpected test: a dire global economic outlook caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, with local jobless numbers already topping those seen during the 2008 global financial crisis. It is a high-stakes document ahead of an election in September, which will function as a referendum on Robertson\u2019s ability to cushion the economy from fallout from plummeting tourism and paralysed industry. But far from abandoning the wellbeing approach, Robertson told the Guardian that the \u201chorrendous crisis that no one would have wanted to go through\u201d presented an opportunity for change in a country that appears to have largely quashed the spread of Covid-19. He cited child poverty, expensive housing, polluted waterways and rising emissions as matters to address in a pre-budget speech to a business audience early this month. \u201cIn other words, we are not quite the nation we like to think we are,\u201d he said. US Republican senators proposed legislation Tuesday that would empower President Donald Trump to slap sanctions on China if Beijing does not give a \u201cfull accounting\u201d for the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for the detrimental role they played in this pandemic,\u201d said Senator Jim Inhofe, one of the sponsors of the \u201cCovid-19 Accountability Act.\u201d \u201cTheir outright deception of the origin and spread of the virus cost the world valuable time and lives as it began to spread,\u201d he said in a statement. The legislation will give Trump 60 days to certify to Congress that China has provided a full accounting on the Covid-19 outbreak to an investigation that could be led by the United States and its allies, or a United Nations body like the World Health Organization. Trump must also certify that China has closed its highest-risk wet markets and released Hong Kong activists arrested in post-Covid-19 crackdowns. Without certification, Trump would be authorised under the legislation to impose sanctions like asset freezes, travel bans and visa revocations, as well as restricting Chinese businesses\u2019 access to US bank financing and capital markets. \u201cChina refuses to allow the international community to go into the Wuhan lab to investigate,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham, another sponsor of the bill. \u201cThey refuse to allow investigators to study how this outbreak started. I\u2019m convinced China will never cooperate with a serious investigation unless they are made to do so.\u201d Twitter announces employees will be allowed to work from home \u2018forever\u2019 Twitter will allow its employees to work from home \u201cforever\u201d, chief executive officer Jack Dorsey said in a company-wide email Tuesday. A spokesperson from Twitter confirmed the decision to the Guardian, saying the company was \u201cone of the first companies to go to a work-from-home model\u201d due to Covid-19, but does not anticipate being one of the first to return to its offices. \u201cWe were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere,\u201d the company said in a blogpost. \u201cThe past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen.\u201d Brazil reported a record 881 Covid-19 deaths in 24 hours on Tuesday, its health ministry said, taking its total to 12,400 and making it the world\u2019s sixth worst-affected country in terms of deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Its total of 177,589 confirmed cases is the world\u2019s seventh-highest. Earlier far-right president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who has attacked social isolation measures introduced by state governors \u2013 issued a decree declaring beauty salons, gyms and barbers \u201cessential services\u201d that could open. Several governors said they would ignore the decree. Bolsonaro was also battling his latest political crisis \u2013 fears that a supreme court judge could release a video of an expletive-filled ministerial meeting held on April 22 which reportedly includes his foreign minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo blaming China, Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner, for the pandemic he dubbed a \u201ccomunavirus\u201d (or \u201ccommunist virus\u201d), aimed at dominating other nations. Ara\u00fajo had debuted the term in a lengthy text on his \u201canti-globalist\u201d blog the same day. \u201cThe coronavirus was again woken us up to the communist nightmare. The comunavirus has arrived,\u201d he wrote. Brazil\u2019s attorney-general\u2019s office had argued against handing over the video to the Supreme Court, claiming it contained \u201cpotentially sensitive and reserved state subjects, including foreign relations\u201d, but was overruled. Adding to the widening sense that Brazil\u2019s far right is increasingly disconnected from the horrific reality of the pandemic as it spreads into poorer, densely packed communities, the presidential family\u2019s guru Olavo de Carvalho questioned its very existence on Tuesday. \u201cThe fear of a supposedly deadly virus is nothing more than a horror story to cow the population and make them accept slavery as a gift from Santa Claus,\u201d tweeted the Richmond, Virginia-based, far-right astrologer-turned-philosopher, believed to have recommended Ara\u00fajo to the post, to his 291,000 followers. A newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts more than 147,000 Americans will die from Covid-19 by early August, up nearly 10,000 from the last projection, as restrictions for curbing the pandemic are increasingly relaxed, researchers said on Tuesday. The latest forecast from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) reflects \u201ckey drivers of viral transmission like changes in testing and mobility, as well as easing of distancing policies,\u201d the report said. The current US death toll stands at 82,246. The revised projection reinforced public health warnings, including US Senate testimony on Tuesday from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, that prematurely lifting lockdowns could lead to more outbreaks of the respiratory virus. Fauci and other medical experts have urged caution in relaxing restraints on commerce before diagnostic testing and the ability to trace close contacts of infected individuals can be vastly expanded, along with other safeguards. Still, IHME researchers acknowledged that precise consequences of moves to reopen shuttered businesses and loosen stay-at-home orders remains difficult to gauge. Coronavirus in the Pacific: weekly briefing Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain report for the Guardian: Infection numbers in the region remain low, with minimal increase. New cases have been recorded in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), bringing the total across the region to 274. A number of countries have now been provided with GeneXpert testing cartridges by the World Health Oganization (WHO). They will allow for in-country testing and rapid processing of results. However, due to the global demand, there are only small numbers available in most places. For example, Tonga (where there are no confirmed cases) has requested 6,000 cartridges and has received 120. The idea of including Pacific island countries in a proposed trans-Tasman bubble being mooted by Australia and New Zealand has received a lot of attention among commentators, despite warnings from Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, that any relaxation of international border closures is still some way off. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting countries worldwide. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. Get in touch in Twitter @helenrsullivan. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus over a period of just 10 days, according to local media. Officials were ordered to submit urgent plans to test all Wuhan\u2019s inhabitants after authorities reported six new cases in a residential compound, the first cluster of new Covid-19 infections since the city reopened on 8 April after 76 days of strict lockdown. Meanwhile in Brazil, where president Jair Bolsonaro has underplayed the dangers of the virus, a record 881 people died in one day, bringing the total number of deaths to 12,400. Confirmed infections stand at 177,589. Here are the other main developments from the last few hours. Confirmed deaths worldwide pass 290,000. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 4,247,709 people around the world are known to have contracted the virus, while at least 290,838 have died since the pandemic began. The numbers, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing recording and testing regimes. Wuhan prepares to test 11 million residents. The Chinese city of Wuhan, the original centre of the pandemic, plans to test all 11 million residents for coronavirus over a period of just 10 days, according to local media. Brazil confirmed a record 881 people deaths on Tuesday, bringing the total number of deaths to 12,400. Confirmed infections stand at 177,589. Pence avoiding Trump after aide\u2019s positive test. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, is keeping his distance from Donald Trump after the former\u2019s press secretary tested positive, the White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany has confirmed. Fauci warns of serious consequences if US states reopen early. Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned of serious consequences if US states reopen before building capacity to deal with new Covid-19 outbreaks. French schools reopen. Thousands of schools have reopened throughout France as the government eased its lockdown rules, despite fears of a second waves of infections, Agence France-Presse reports. Covid-19 R number falls below 1 in Germany. The reproduction rate for the coronavirus pandemic in Germany fell below the critical threshold of 1 with an estimated value of 0.94 on Tuesday after 1.07 on Monday, the Robert Koch Institute for public health and disease control said. UK official death toll passes 40,000. The Office for National Statistics says 35,044 deaths involving Covid-19 have been registered in England and Wales up to 9 May. Adding the latest figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland and more up to date fatalities from the four nations, the total official UK death toll now stands at 40,496. Spain\u2019s new daily cases lowest in two months. The health ministry identified 594 new cases, bringing the total since the country\u2019s epidemic began to 228,030. The number of fatalities related to the disease rises by 176 to 26,920. \u201cPotentially positive data\u201d on drugs, WHO says. The World Health Organization says some treatments appear to be limiting the severity or length of suffering caused by Covid-19 and that it is focusing on learning more about four or five of the most promising ones. \u201cWe do have some treatments that seem to be, in very early studies, limiting the severity or the length of the illness, but we do not have anything that can kill or stop the virus,\u201d its spokeswoman Margaret Harris says. Saudi oil profits plunge 25%. Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, has posted a 25% dip in profits following the collapse of global oil markets triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Kremlin spokesman in hospital. Dmitry Peskov, the Russian government\u2019s spokesman, is admitted to hospital with Covid-19, local media report. \u201cYes, I got sick, I\u2019m being treated,\u201d Peskov is quoted as saying. He is at least the second person in Vladimir Putin\u2019s administration to test positive. Lebanon orders \u2018total lockdown\u2019. People in the eastern Mediterranean country are told to stay at home for four days after an increase in infections followed an easing of restrictions. Lebanese health authorities have officially announced 870 cases of Covid-19, including 11 newly detected on Tuesday, and 26 deaths. UK recession \u2018already happening\u2019 The UK is effectively in the midst of a recession, its chancellor says. Rishi Sunak tells the BBC: \u201cWe already know that many people have lost their jobs and it breaks my heart. We\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happening with universal credit claims already. This is not something that we\u2019re going to wait to see; it\u2019s already happening.\u201d Top US adviser testifies. Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert, warned that official figures are underestimating the death toll in the US and that \u201cthe consequences could be really serious\u201d if the country relaxes safeguards too abruptly. Fauci delivered testimony to the Senate on Tuesday as the US president, Donald Trump, encouraged businesses to reopen. Virus hits South Sudanese camp. For the first time, Covid-19 has been confirmed in a crowded civilian protection camp in South Sudan\u2019s capital, the United Nations says.
