Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off.</p> \n<p>As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city.</p> \n<p>It was not until three days later that they put out a <a href=\"https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=6864153\" title=\"\">public warning</a> about a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/\" title=\"\">with the World Health Organisation</a>.</p> \n<p>In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia.</p> \n<p>But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication.</p> \n<p>She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful.</p> \n<p>Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source.</p> \n<p>The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and <a href=\"http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319\" title=\"\">released the genetic sequence</a> of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis.</p> \n<p>There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\" title=\"\">not identified any new cases for over a week</a>; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier.</p> \n<p>If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear.</p> \n<p>But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-chinese-hospitals-not-testing-patients-say-relatives\" title=\"\">not testing widely</a> for the new virus as the month progressed.</p> \n<p>There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-timeline-from-wuhan-to-washington-state\" title=\"\"> early days of the outbreak</a> could have <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3047606/coronavirus-response-highlights-flaws-way-chinas-bureaucracy\" title=\"\">helped the virus spread</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a77dcb662bbe5d211b9cae7f4f0b8fe46bd6f1a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a77dcb662bbe5d211b9cae7f4f0b8fe46bd6f1a/0_59_3569_2142/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scanning the body heat of passengers at Rome airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scanning the body heat of passengers at Rome airport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/AEROPORTO DI ROMA/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released.

Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help.</p> \n<p>Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes.</p> \n<p>That was the day China confirmed the disease <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/china-confirms-human-human-transmission-coronavirus-200120162507948.html\" title=\"\">could be spread between human</a>s, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source.</p> \n<p>The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country\u2019s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be \u201cresolutely contained\u201d.</p> \n<p>Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times.</p> \n<p>Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb6a68e-3f3a-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\" title=\"\">stopped most private cars from leaving</a> either.</p> \n<p>Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease.

      "bodyText": "In the final days of 2019, Xia Qingqing joined her parents for a late-night dinner just 200 metres away from the now-notorious South China seafood market, in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. It has since been identified as the source of the new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,400 people worldwide, killed more than 40 and plunged China into chaos. Just as hundreds of millions of people should be reuniting with their families to celebrate the biggest holiday of the year, the lunar new year, swathes of the country have been put on lockdown and celebrations all but called off. As Xia and her parents tucked into a special winter rice and egg porridge on 27 December, even city authorities may not have known that the virus had started spreading around the city. It was not until three days later that they put out a public warning about a \u201cpneumonia of unknown cause\u201d which doctors had identified in Wuhan, and four days later that national authorities filed their first report about the outbreak with the World Health Organisation. In early January, 36-year-old Xia started running a low fever. By then, authorities had closed the seafood market for disinfection, and identified 44 patients with the unknown pneumonia. But when she went to a local hospital on 4 January for a check-up, no one asked Xia about possible links to the market, or mentioned the mystery new illness. Doctors told her to go home, rest and take over-the-counter medication. She followed their advice but her condition continued to worsen. Her fever intensified, she started having respiratory problems, and eating or drinking became painful. Her illness was developing in tandem with knowledge about the mysterious new outbreak. On 9 January, China announced it had identified a new coronavirus, from the same family that caused the 2002 Sars outbreak, in one of the Wuhan patients. Like all viruses in the corona family, it had originated in an animal; scientists were already racing to uncover the source. The next day, authorities announced the first death from the disease and released the genetic sequence of the new virus online for study, winning plaudits for an approach that seemed very different from the official cover-up that exacerbated the Sars crisis. There were even hopes that Beijing might have managed to stop the outbreak before it had really begun. On 13 January, Chinese authorities said they had not identified any new cases for over a week; and although a first case was reported outside the country in a traveller to China, she had first developed symptoms days earlier. If the disease came only from eating some kind of infected animal, and the market where it had originated was shut, there was perhaps a real possibility that no further cases would appear. But it has now emerged that even though China freely shared details of the cases it had identified in the early days of January, doctors on the ground in the city where the disease began were not testing widely for the new virus as the month progressed. There is growing concern that a failure to carry out comprehensive testing during the early days of the outbreak could have helped the virus spread. Xia believes she is one of many victims who do not show up in statistics; she was finally admitted to hospital on the day after the genetic code was released. Despite her link to the market at the centre of the outbreak, and symptoms that matched those of confirmed victims, she was never tested. \u201cBefore there were any testing kits, which was before 16 January, I was regarded as a highly suspected case, meaning that I showed almost all of the symptoms,\u201d Xia told the Observer. But the hospital was already struggling with a sharp increase in patients showing symptoms that matched the reported coronavirus ones. Xia estimates that there were only two doctors on staff to check hundreds of people seeking help. Terribly overstretched, they focused only on the most serious cases and so on 20 January doctors discharged Xia into the care of her parents, without even formally noting her link to the South China seafood market on medical notes. That was the day China confirmed the disease could be spread between humans, rather than just picked up direct from an animal source. The number of patients had tripled, cases had appeared in other major cities, including the capital Beijing, and in a sign of official concern, the country\u2019s authoritarian president, Xi Jinping, made his first comments on the virus, saying it must be \u201cresolutely contained\u201d. Yet Xia was sent home, still sick, without having been tested. She is being cared for by her parents, but is terrified she might infect them; they try to protect themselves by staying five metres away from her at all times. Three days later, China stunned its citizens and the world by putting Wuhan under quarantine. From the morning of 23 January, no trains, planes or public transport would be allowed to leave the city; roadblocks later stopped most private cars from leaving either. Closing off a major industrial and commercial hub, home to 11 million people, was the bluntest possible admission that Beijing was now extremely worried about the new disease. Further decisive action included a pledge to build a new 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to the disease in under a week, and a second within two weeks. Work has already started on the first, and given China\u2019s track record of throwing up a similar hospital in Beijing during the Sars crisis, there is little doubt that the prefabricated facility will be finished in this extraordinary timescale. And in a sign that authorities had shifted from trying to downplay the disease, a very last-minute tribute to the doctors and nurses battling the disease was included in the new year television gala show, one of the most high-profile broadcasts of the year. By the time lunar new year\u2019s day dawned , the government had gone even further. More than 50 million people were in lockdown across the country, and nearly every province in China had declared a \u201clevel 1\u201d health emergency, the most serious kind, which allows quarantines and other serious measures.

This time I\u2019m scared,\u201d Yi, who heads the University of Hong Kong\u2019s state key laboratory of emerging infectious diseases, told China\u2019s influential Caixin magazine. He visited Wuhan expecting to find the city on a \u201cwar footing\u201d but instead was met with chaos and incompetence. \u201cI don\u2019t think the local government has done what it should do,\u201d he said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even been handing out quarantine guides to people who were leaving.\u201d The coronavirus could hardly have emerged at a worse time for Chinese authorities, appearing in the weeks before the lunar new year, China\u2019s most important holiday. It is usually the occasion for the biggest human migration on the planet \u2013 up to 3 billion trips \u2013 as people race home to celebrate with family, travelling on packed trains, buses and planes. For the army of migrant workers from rural towns and villages who have powered decades of economic growth in China, it can be the only time in the year they get to return home and see their children and parents who have stayed behind. Even as the scale of the crisis became apparent, millions whose travel plans did not take them near Wuhan packed their bags and set off for the annual reunion, although many journeys were longer than usual. Evidence that patients may be able to carry the disease without any fever, cough or other common symptoms has added to concern. Tests have showed that a child in one family who did not appear unwell was in fact carrying the disease, the Lancet has reported. But widespread apprehension has changed the nature of the celebration. Normally a time for parties and celebration, banquets and fireworks, instead across the country \u2013 even in places far from the centre or any reported cases \u2013 people were cancelling their party plans and staying home. Streets, malls and restaurants were empty, attractions from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City and Shanghai\u2019s Disneyland had closed, and from Monday all group tourism \u2013 domestic and foreign \u2013 will be suspended. Instead, many people stayed at home, and took to the internet to find out more about the crisis. From the early days of the outbreak, warnings were appearing on China\u2019s vibrant but censored social media. In early January, eight people were arrested for \u201cspreading hoaxes\u201d about what came to be known as the coronavirus, AFP reported. Weeks later, vast numbers of people were turning to the internet for information about the crisis, as state media downplayed it and kept it off the front page of official papers, such as the People\u2019s Daily, and out of the main headlines on key television news programmes. On Saturday, discussion about the disease on micro-blogging site Weibo had reached 8 billion views, according to the What\u2019s on Weibo website. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare to see news topics get this big,\u201d site editor Manya Koetse said on Twitter. By Saturday evening, China had confirmed it was dealing with a total of 1,372 confirmed cases, and a death toll of 41.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus\u2019s ability to spread appears to be getting stronger, the country\u2019s health commission minister has said. He added that the incubation period is one to 14 days and that unlike Sars, it is infectious during that period. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to 56, while authorities said just over 2,000 have been infected. Health experts believe the real number of cases to be higher, as hospitals across Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have experienced shortages of testing kits. Another 1,000 cases are expected in Wuhan, the city\u2019s mayor said. Zhou Xianwang said it was stepping up construction of specialist hospitals. He added that 5million people had left the city for new year celebrations. The US, France and Japan said they were arranging evacuation flights for people trapped in Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine. The US and Japan each reported a new case, taking the number of people infected to three and four respectively. Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea each confirmed a new case, while Thailand said it had identified three new cases. In the UK, 52 people have tested negative for the coronavirus, the Department of Health and Social Care said. No one in the UK has tested positive. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning to evacuate more than 200 of its citizens in Wuhan. The foreign office has advised against travel to Hubei province. A nationwide ban on trading wildlife has been imposed in China after experts warned that the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics. Residents of Hubei province are to be banned from Hong Kong. The city state will also ban entry from Monday to people who have visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, the city\u2019s government said. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Long-distance buses have been suspended in the eastern province of Shandong, which has a population of 100 million people. Long-distance buses have also been banned from departing from or arriving at Beijing and Shanghai. The financial hub of Shanghai, which has extensive international air connections, on Sunday reported its first death: that of an 88-year-old man who already had health problems. Beijing said that the reopening of schools and universities after the new year holiday had been indefinitely suspended. Upcoming tennis (Fed Cup) and football (Women\u2019s Olympic qualifying) events have been moved from China. Boxing and basketball events had already been relocated because of the coronavirus. Two of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they would close indefinitely. The city state reported its sixth case of coronavirus on Sunday. Jonathan Ashworth, the UK\u2019s shadow health secretary, urged the government to reassure the public it is sufficiently prepared as the NHS is already struggling in the flu season. He told the Guardian: The NHS is currently under immense strain this winter with staff already working flat out and hospitals overcrowded. We need urgent reassurance from ministers they have a plan to ensure we have capacity in place to deal with Coronavirus should we need to, AFP\u2019s Hong Kong correspondent is reporting what is believed to be the youngest person - a baby girl - infected so far. This gives an idea on how difficult it may be to prevent the coronavirus spreading despite the quarantine. Hong Kong has imposed new restrictions on people from the province at the centre of the outbreak, AFP\u2019s correspondent there reports: Another sporting event has been moved from China as a result of the coronavirus: Earlier, I reported on protests in Hong Kong against a plan to turn a newly built but currently empty public housing block in Fanling into a quarantine facility for people with coronavirus. Here ia an update from AFP: Dozens of local residents and protesters opposed to the idea held rallies outside the complex on Sunday, with some setting up road blocks. In the evening, police said assailants threw petrol bombs at the buildings. An AFP photographer on the scene saw fierce flames coming from the entrance of two apartment blocks before firefighters got the blaze under control. Riot police were on scene and protesters had left, although some local residents were arguing with officers who used pepper spray. The Centre for Health Protection said the plan to turn the housing estate into a quarantine zone would be suspended. The agency has already turned a holiday park in an isolated rural area into a working quarantine facility. Two other holiday parks located away from major housing estates are also ready to be used as similar facilities. But officials say they have struggled to find hotels and spare rooms for doctors and nurses working on the isolation wards where patients are being treated. The virus outbreak comes at a time when Hong Kong is already boiling with widespread anti-government sentiment after seven months of often violent pro-democracy protests. This is from Reuters: As of Sunday afternoon, 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had been tested for the new coronavirus, but all tests were confirmed as negative, the Department for Health and Social Care has just said. It said it will be providing an update on the figures every day at 2pm. Nathalie MacDermott, NIHR (National Institute for Health Research) academic clinical lecturer, at King\u2019s College London, has said the suggestion that coronavirus is infectious during the incubation period is \u201cnot surprising\u201d, adding: This was taken account of in some of the modelling exercises undertaken by colleagues recently, and was likely given the degree of spread of the outbreak within China. There is often the question of whether individuals who may be infected with the virus but never show any symptoms (asymptomatic or subclinical cases) may also be contagious to others. The report from Zhejiang suggests this may be the case, but further confirmation is required. This report highlights the importance of identifying individuals who may have travelled from affected regions or had contact with a known case of 2019-nCoV infection to establish if they may have symptoms and to request they limit their attendance at public gatherings in order to try and contain the spread of infection. While these findings may cause concern, the possibility of transmission of virus during the incubation period and from asymptomatic individuals has been considered by public health authorities and the WHO, and has been included as a factor within response plans to tackle an outbreak of an airborne virus. AFP has a report from an overwhelmed-sounding hospital in Wuhan: At one Wuhan hospital AFP visited, there were long queues of sick patients, many coughing, with overwhelmed staff unable to process them quickly. Outside the Red Cross facility - which is one of the hospitals people are sent to for initial tests if they show signs of infection - patients told AFP they felt exasperated and helpless. \u201cIt has been two days since I slept, and I have been wandering from hospital to hospital,\u201d said a man in his 30s, who was trying to see a doctor because he was worried he might be infected. \u201cAt this rate, my turn will be tomorrow morning at best.\u201d Those who spoke to AFP told of extremely long queues and disorganisation. One spoke of a fear that sick patients with fevers will infect each other while waiting in long queues, even if they didn\u2019t have the coronavirus when they first arrived at the hospital. Another man said he had seen several people faint while waiting. Many people carried their own plastic stools to sit on, while one pragmatic man had brought a lounge chair with him. \u201cIt takes at least five hours to see a doctor,\u201d one woman, who didn\u2019t want to be named, told AFP. The woman, who was with her son, said the management of the hospital was \u201creally messy\u201d. An old man wearing a Mao cap said he had waited all day to see a doctor, only to be sent home because of a \u201clack of room\u201d. AFP saw some patients inside the hospital who were without masks, despite city orders that anyone going out must wear them. Patients were taking their own temperatures with mercury thermometers, by mouth or armpit, and there were no checks on anyone entering or leaving the hospital. \u201cThere is no more space, the staff are overwhelmed, there is a shortage of some medicine, and patients are being left to fend for themselves,\u201d said one 30-year-old. The coronavius\u2019s ability to spread appears to be getting stronger, the country\u2019s health commission minister has said. He added that the incubation period is one to 14 days and that unlike Sars, it is infectious during that period. The death toll from the outbreak has risen to 56, while authorities said almost 2,000 have been infected. Health experts believe the real number of cases to be higher, as hospitals across Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, have experienced shortages of testing kits. The US, France and Japan said they were arranging evacuation flights for people trapped in Wuhan, which has been placed under quarantine. The US and Japan each reported a new case, taking the number of people infected to three and four respectively. Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea each confirmed a new case, while Thailand said it had identified three new cases. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning to evacuate more than 200 of its citizens in Wuhan. The foreign office has advised against travel to Hubei province. A nationwide ban on trading wildlife has been imposed in China after experts warned that the sale of sometimes endangered species for human consumption is the cause both of the new coronavirus outbreak and other past epidemics. Long-distance buses have been suspended in the eastern province of Shandong, which has a population of 100 million people. Long-distance buses have also been banned from departing from or arriving at Beijing and Shanghai. The financial hub of Shanghai, which has extensive international air connections, on Sunday reported its first death: that of an 88-year-old man who already had health problems. Beijing said that the reopening of schools and universities after the new year holiday had been indefinitely suspended. Two of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest attractions, Hong Kong Disneyland and Ocean Park, announced they would close indefinitely. The city state reported its sixth case of coronavirus on Sunday. World Animal Protection has welcomed China\u2019s decision to impose a wildlife trade ban, effective from today. Kate Nustedt, the organisation\u2019s global wildlife director, said: We commend China\u2019s decision to impose a nationwide ban on wildlife trade in response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. This ban will prevent the terrible suffering endured by millions upon millions of wild animals across the country. Crucially, it will also put a stop to the horrific conditions that serve as such a lethal hotbed of disease. We hope that this courageous step is made permanent and extended to all wildlife imports and exports, to help prevent any future crises of this nature. Wild animals belong in the wild. This wildlife trade ban by China will help keep them there. Thailand, the country with the most confirmed cases outside China of the new coronavirus, said on Sunday that three of the people infected were being treated and five had recovered and gone home. The public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, called an emergency meeting on Sunday, pledging: We can control the situation and are confident in our ability to handle the crisis. The Thai government has faced accusations that it is prioritising tourism - China is Thailand\u2019s biggest source of tourists with nearly 11 million visitors last year - over public health. The hashtag #crapgovernment was top trending on Twitter in Thailand on Saturday with more than 400,000 tweets. Users complained about the management of the virus and other health issues. Anutin insisted the government would not prioritise tourism revenue over health. If it reaches a point where public health is in danger, we will take (more) action ...Detecting infected patients is a good sign because it shows that our system is efficient. All but one of the eight cases in Thailand were tourists from Wuhan, the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak. One Thai national, who had visited Wuhan over the New Year, contracted the disease. There have been no cases of human-to-human transmission in Thailand. The government is scanning passengers arriving on flights from Guangzhou across five airports including the main Suvarnabhumi airport, Chiang Mai, Phuket, Don Muang and Krabi. Based on numbers during the Sars outbreak in 2003, three months of reduced travel from China would result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the minister of tourism and sports, Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn, said. Major shopping malls in Thai tourist spots have introduced hygiene measures. Mass transit operators including the Bangkok skytrain and subways are increasing the frequencies of wipedowns and spraying disinfectant in trains, the Transport Ministry said. China has withdrawn as host of the qualifiers for this year\u2019s Olympic football tournament for women. The pope has prayed for the victims of coronavirus, while praising China\u2019s response to the outbreak. From Reuters: \u201cI would like also to be close to and pray for the people who are sick because of the virus that has spread through China,\u201d Pope Francis told tens of thousands of people in St Peter\u2019s Square for his weekly message and blessing. \u201cMay the Lord welcome the dead into his peace, comfort families and sustain the great commitment by the Chinese community that has already been put in place to combat the epidemic,\u201d he said. Relations between the Vatican and Beijing have improved since September, 2018 when the two sides signed a historic pact on the naming of bishops. Conservative Catholics have objected to the pact, accusing the Vatican of having sold out to the communist government. Chinese associations in Paris cancelled Sunday afternoon\u2019s Chinese new year\u2019s parade in the centre of the city following the coronavirus epidemic. The mayor Anne Hidalgo said Paris\u2019s Chinese community was \u201cvery emotional and concerned\u201d so decided it was best for the parade not to go ahead. The city of Bordeaux also cancelled Chinese new year celebrations to limit infection risk and as a gesture of support for victims in China, the mayor said. France has identified three cases, currently being treated in hospital: two in Paris and one in Bordeaux. The French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said that she was expecting new cases to be detected in the country. She said that on Sunday morning five people were undergoing assessment in hospital, where they were isolated from others. She said a total of ten cases were under observation. The French prime minister will hold discussions with ministers on Sunday on measures to limit spread of the virus. AFP reports that some of the private cars on the road in Wuhan have been given special dispensation to travel to ferry the sick: Defying the threat from a contagious respiratory illness that broke out in the city and has killed dozens of people, Zhang Lin and other Wuhan residents are pitching in by driving sick fellow citizens to hospital. \u201cWe\u2019re from Wuhan, and even though you guys are here to help us, our own citizens should also come out to (help),\u201d Zhang Lin told AFP journalists as he waited for a patient to emerge from a clinic for the drive back home. \u201cThere has to be someone who does this.\u201d The 48-year-old Zhang and others have been enlisted by the government to provide the free service, and it is sorely needed. Wuhan has for days been the nucleus of a transport lockdown that began in the city of 11 million and has since been expanded to much of the rest of Hubei province, in an attempt to cut off transmission routes for the virus. Wuhan\u2019s public transport system has been halted, taxi services curtailed and, on Sunday, new restrictions were introduced banning most cars from the streets. Difficulty getting around adds another challenge for sick people who, even after they reach overwhelmed hospitals, may need to wait hours to see hard-pressed doctors. But drivers like Yin Yu have obtained special dispensation to drive for humanitarian reasons. \u201cThere are no cars, so we are responsible for sending them there ... and taking them back. This is all for free,\u201d said Yin, 40. A public announcement blaring from a loudspeaker in the city on Sunday offered tips on hygiene and seeking medical care, but also a dose of civic pride. \u201cWuhan is a city that dares to face difficulties and keeps overcoming them,\u201d said a female voice. \u201cThis is not the first time we have faced a similar situation. In 1998 we fought against extreme (Yangtze River) flooding. In 2003 we fought SARS,\u201d it said, referring to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a national viral epidemic similar to the current one. \u201cWe\u2019ve come a long way and have had great results!\u201d The FT\u2019s Tom Hancock says some people are flouting the lockdown in Wuhan. Another province of China, Hainan, has shut down all inter-province buses. It is the latest in a series of cities and provinces to take similar steps in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Japan is reporting its fourth case of the new coronavirus. The case was confirmed in a resident of Wuhan in his 40s who had arrived in Japan on 22 January on holidays, NHK said, citing the health ministry. The man was hospitalised in Aichi prefecture, central Japan, and tested positive for the virus, it said. Earlier today, Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said the country would evacuate any of its citizens in Wuhan who wished to return to Japan. Here is a full quote from the press conference today, from Ma Xiaowei, China\u2019s health commission minister. The transmissibility shows signs of increasing and the \u2018walking source of infection\u2019 [where patients have few signs of disease] has made it difficult to control and prevent the disease. For this new coronavirus we have not identified the source of the infection and we are not clear about the risk of its mutation and how it spreads. Since this is a new coronavirus there might be some changes in the coming days and weeks, and the danger it poses to people of different ages is also changing. The semi-autonomous region of Macau has imposed new restrictions on vistitors from mainland China, AFP\u2019s Hong Kong correspondent reports. Hubei province has suspended inter-province and inter-city buses intensifying the lockdown designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese state media is reporting. Shandong province and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin an Xi\u2019an had earlier suspended inter-city and chartered buses from crossing their borders. In Hong Kong, residents are protesting about the construction of a quarantine camp for people infected with the coronavirus. The reference in the first tweet to yellow and blue, alludes to the colours adopted by supporters of the city\u2019s protest movement against Chinese interference and those who suppport the police, respectively. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent paints a vivid picture of life inside Hubei province in this video: The prime minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, has said the country will evacuate any of its citizens in Wuhan who wish to return to Japan. Beijing is postponing the reopening date of the city\u2019s kindergartens, schools and universities, China National Radio is reporting (via Reuters). The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, refused to confirm or deny reports that Britain is planning an airlift of its citizens from China. She would only tell Sophy Ridge on Sunday, on Sky News: \u201cWe are looking at all options.\u201d The UK foreign office has advised citizens against all travel to Hubei province. Hong Kong has reported a sixth case, according to AFP\u2019s correspondent in the city state. A third case of coronavirus has been identified in the United States. The latest case is in Orange County, Southern California. The Orange County Health Care Agency announced the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed a traveler from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, tested positive for the virus. The patient is in isolation at a hospital and in good condition, a release from the agency said. That patient had been in contact with the local health agency and was provided guidance to reduce exposure to others while health officials awaited laboratory confirmation. After consulting with the CDC and the California Department of Public Health, the Orange County agency will follow up with people who have had close contact with the patient. Guidance from the CDC advises that people who have had casual contact with the patient are at minimal risk for developing infection. There\u2019s no evidence that person-to-person transmission occurred in Orange County, and the risk of local transmission remains low, the release said. The previous two cases in the US were in Chicago and Washington state. Taiwan has further tightened restrictions on visitors from China to prevent the spread of a new coronavirus, suspending entry for many apart from business travellers and a few other exceptions like people married to Taiwanese, Reuters reports. Taiwan has already stopped Chinese tour groups from visiting, and has now banned all people from Hubei from coming to the island. Most other Chinese citizens will not be allowed in for the time being, aside from people involved in fighting the virus or on humanitarian grounds, the island\u2019s newly established Central Epidemic Command Centre said in a statement. Chinese business travellers will also be permitted entry, but have to agree to have their health monitored for two weeks after entry, the command centre said. Spouses from Hubei will have to stay in quarantine at home for the same period, it said. Chinese students studying in Taiwan will have to postpone their return to the island for two weeks, it added, while students from Hubei cannot return at all until further notice. China\u2019s national health minister Ma Xiaowei said the new coronavirus is also infectious during incubation, which is different from Sars. He said authorities\u2019 knowledge of the new virus was limited and they are unclear on the risks posed by mutations of the virus. The press conference ended with a promise to live up to \u201cthe expectations of the people\u201d and to increase transparency. To that end, they said there would be a press conference every morning. I will now be handing over to my colleague Haroon Siddique in London who will be covering the latest updates on the outbreak At a press conference by the State Council Information Office of China, they confirmed that there have been 2,057 cases of coronavirus globally. China\u2019s national health minister Ma Xiaowei said that it is possible the pathogen causing the virus came from a wild animal, and that 1,600 medical professionals were being dispatched to Wuhan to help handle the rising number of cases. Ma admitted that the virus\u2019s ability to spread seemed to be getting stronger and that they were not clear about the risks of the virus mutating. The incubation period is between 1 and 14 days, he said, and said it was likely the number of cases would continue to rise. The markets watchdog, agricultural ministry, and forestry bureau said in a joint statement that China has banned wildlife trade nationwide in markets, supermarkets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reports. Any places that breed wildlife should be isolated, and the transportation of wildlife should be banned, said the statement. The ban will take effect from Sunday. The US Embassy in China has confirmed it is making arrangements to relocate people working at the US Consulate General in Wuhan. There is a flight due to fly from Wuhan to San Francisco on Tuesday but the embassy warned that not all US citizens would be able to board. \u201cIf there is insufficient ability to transport everyone who expresses interest, priority will be given to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus,\u201d the embassy said in a statement on their website. Hong Kong now has a sixth confirmed case of coronavirus. According to reports, the patient, who was admitted to Ruttonjee Hospital in Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, had recently travelled to Wuhan on a high speed train before returning to Hong Kong Some more pictures from the news wire. Local state media is now reporting that the city of Shantou will now not be banning cars, ships and people from entering the city tomorrow but will instead strengthen disease controls such as disinfection efforts. This contradicts earlier statements by the local government, which have now been removed from Shantou city\u2019s website In a bid to contain the spread of the virus, China has banned long distance buses between several major cities, including Beijing. The eastern Shandong province, with a population of 100 million people, will suspend long-distance buses entering the province, state broadcaster CCTV reported, following the announcement of similar measures in the cities of Tianjin, Beijing and the historic Xi\u2019an. Authorities have confirmed that China\u2019s coastal city of Shantou in Guangdong province, over 500 miles away from Wuhan, will be the next city to be put on lockdown to control the spread of coronavirus. People, cars and ships will all be banned from entering Shantou from first thing Monday, and this afternoon all buses, taxis and ferries were suspended in the city. There are now 15 partially or fully locked down cities but Shantou is the first outside Hubei province to be placed under restrictions. This footage from AFP captures how Wuhan, a city of 11 million, has become a ghost town as the new restrictions on vehicles are imposed and people have confined themselves to their homes We have a interesting insight into how the outbreak first affected people in Wuhan as a local woman tells us how she contracted the virus after eating near the now infamous market in the city. This liveblog is now moving from Australia (where it\u2019s Australia Day, somewhat controversially) to India, where it\u2019s Republic Day. My colleague in New Delhi, Hannah Ellis-Petersen, is taking over. You can correspond with her by the usual channels. My best, Ben. The state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper says China has started to develop a vaccine for 2019-nCoV, the novel coronavirus that has so far claimed 56 lives across the country and infected another 2000. The paper also reports the Chinese government has sent 450 military medical staff, including many with experience dealing with the Sars and Ebola outbreaks, to the epicentre of the pandemic in Wuhan. More from Australia (where your current correspondent is): Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister Marise Payne has said the Australian government is working with Chinese authorities to \u201cconsider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions\u201d. \u201cGiven the circumstances of the spread of the coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers.\u201d Other countries, including the US and France, are putting into place plans to evacuate their citizens. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer has warned it is likely there will be more cases of the coronavirus in the country, following confirmation of four cases. Professor Brendan Murphy said he would be sending out a message to GPs across the country on how to handle patients who present with symptoms of the deadly illness. Three men are in hospital in Sydney after flying in from China, while another man in his 50s is being treated in Melbourne. All have a direct link to Wuhan, having either visited the city recently or been in direct contact with a confirmed case from that city. Coronavirus has killed 56 people in China and the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, remains in lockdown. More than 2,000 people in China have been infected. Cases have also been confirmed in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France and Malaysia. \u201cThere is no cause for general concern,\u201d Murphy told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday. \u201cI would not be surprised if there are some more cases ... it\u2019s highly likely that we may see them some more. \u201cWe are incredibly well-prepared to isolate and deal with that.\u201d More details on countries trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan city and from Hubei province. The US government is flying its personnel out, directly to San Francisco, with a limited capacity for other Americans most at risk from coronavirus. From AP: The US consulate in the epidemic-stricken Chinese city of Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday. A notice Sunday from the embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport US citizens on the flight that will proceed directly to San Francisco. It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals \u201cat greater risk from coronavirus\u201d, a new respiratory disease that has sickened 1,975 people and killed 56, almost all in Wuhan. China\u2019s travel restrictions to restrict the spread of coronavirus appear to be widening further. At least 13 cities, covering 36 million people, are already living under lockdowns and travel restrictions. Now reports are emerging that the city of Shantou in Guangdong Province, population 5.3 million, will be put on lockdown. Starting at 2pm local time on Saturday, buses, ferries, and taxi services will cease. From Monday (27 January) no cars, boats or people will be allowed into the city, except for emergency purposes. Shantou is more than 800km from Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic. China\u2019s second-largest city Shanghai, now has 40 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Asian stock markets have so far taken a bit of a hit from concerns about the coronavirus. There were some steep losses on Chinese and Hong Kong markets especially, but nothing to upset the global equilibrium so far. The Dow Jones industrial average is only around 400 points of its all-time high of 29,369 earlier this month. That could change on Monday when markets reopen after a weekend that has seen the outbreak worsen in China and spread to Europe and Australia. However, Chinese markets will be closed all week for the lunar new year so will be insulated from any losses for now. If history is any guide, and somewhat extraordinarily, global pandemics appear to have little impact on markets: Hong Kong has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The city has reported five confirmed cases of coronavirus: all of those patients have direct links to Wuhan. Health authorities say there are a further 122 patients being treated as potentially having the disease. The city\u2019s chief executive Carrie Lam said her government had cancelled Lunar New Year\u2019s celebrations, and that it would close primary and secondary schools for two further weeks beyond the new year holiday. Schools will reopen 17 February. Lam said all direct flights and trains from Wuhan would be blocked from entering Hong Kong. France and a major car manufacturer said Saturday that they are moving to get citizens out of a locked-down Chinese city where a deadly outbreak of a new virus originated and has spread worldwide. French automaker PSA Group says it will evacuate its employees and their families from Wuhan in central China, quarantine them in another major Chinese city and then bring them back to France. The Foreign Ministry said French officials were studying \u201ceventual options\u201d for all its nationals to leave if they wish. It comes a day after France announced three cases of the new virus were being treated in two French hospitals, the first confirmed cases in Europe. All the patients are Chinese nationals who had recently returned from China. Other countries have made similar moves. The United States is preparing to evacuate its consular staff and citizens from Wuhan. About 1,000 US citizens are estimated to be in Wuhan. The US consulate in the city is closed and all diplomats have been ordered to leave. The logistics of how the Americans will leave, where they will go and what will be allowed by Chinese authorities, is currently being worked through by the US State Department, as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. AFP have filed a few pictures from Wuhan, which has been in lockdown for several days. Chinese president Xi Jinping says his country faces a \u201cgrave situation\u201d in tackling the escalating coronavirus crisis. He has called for a greater centralisation of containment efforts, and increasing government control. \u201cLife is of paramount importance. When an epidemic breaks out, a command is issued. It is our responsibility to prevent and control it,\u201d Xi told a meeting of the standing committee of the political bureau of the Chinese Communist party, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. The World Health Organization has not altered its alert level for 2019-nCoV From the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonell, who is in Hubei province: (Australian readers will remember Stephen from his long service with the ABC...) From the BBC\u2019s Stephen McDonnell: deserted streets in Hubei province Sunday has brought an increase in the proportion of deaths outside of Hubei province, the epicentre of the pandemic. State media is reporting that Shanghai has recorded its first death, as well as Henan province. Tianjin city has announced it will shut all inter-provincial shuttle buses from 27 January (Monday) to curb the coronavirus outbreak. State media in China is now reporting the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak is 56. All of the known deaths from the virus have occurred within China. Nearly 2,000 cases have been confirmed, and there are another 2,600 suspected cases. To Canada next where health officials in Toronto have added a slight qualification to their initial statements saying that they had a confirmed case of novel coronavirus. They say the case is \u201cpresumptive\u201d which means they\u2019re waiting for definitive lab tests after initial tests at a provincial lab showed it was the virus. Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre had said on Saturday night local time that it was caring for a man is his 50s who had recently flown from Wuhan to Guangzhou and then on to Toronto on 23 January. \u201cHe really wasn\u2019t in Toronto very long. He wasn\u2019t feeling well. I think he was at home and the people that live with him are in self isolation,\u201d said Dr Barbara Yafe, Ontario\u2019s associated chief medical officer. But Eileen de Villa, head of the city\u2019s public health agency, said at a press conference in the last hour that \u201cWe have the first presumptive case confirmed of this novel coronavirus here.\u201d More on the latest figures on victims in China. The toll stood at 41 on Saturday but 13 fatalities have been added overnight to make 54 deaths so far. The Hubei health ministry says seven of the latest deaths were from that province with the remainder elsewhere in China, marking a rise in the proportion of deaths outside the epicentre region. There were also another 323 people infected, taking the nationwide total to more than 1,600. Only 46 of the new confirmed cases were in Hubei, the ministry said. Welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in China and around the world. These are the main developments today: Officials in China said on Sunday that the death toll has risen to 54 and the number of people infected is more than 1,600. Chinese president Xi Jinping says the country faces a \u201cgrave situation\u201d as it battle to contain the fast-spreading contagion. Lunar new year celebrations were subdued across China on Saturday with an estimated 50 million people subject to travel restrictions in the epicentre Wuhan and the rest of Hubei province. The outbreak has spread to many other Asian countries and three other continets with cases confirmed in Australia, France and the United States. A man in his 50s was confirmed as the first case in Canada on Saturday night. He had recently flown from Wuhan to Guangzhou in southern China and then on to Toronto on 23 January. The British Foreign Office has advised citizens against all travel to Hubei province. French carmaker PSA, which makes brands including Peugeot and Citroen, on Saturday said it would repatriate expat staff from the Wuhan region where it has 38. Researchers are racing to work out if infections have been caused by animal to human contact, which would limit the spread, or whether the majority are being caused by human to human transmission. Li Bin, vice minister at the national health commission, will hold a media conference in Beijing about the outbreak at 3pm local time today.",

In the long term, strict restrictions also risk causing resentment and distrust of authorities and the health messages they deliver.</p> <p>There are also fears for vulnerable groups including elderly people who rely on regular visits from relatives, and foreign students who may be less likely to have stocked up on food. \u201cThe decision [to ban traffic from the roads] didn\u2019t take medical staff, existing patients [or] pregnant people who need public transportation into consideration,\u201d Huang said.

Middle-aged and elderly people would have felt that the official said that it\u2019s OK, so they don\u2019t need to wear masks or take any precautions,\u201d said Huang. It is mostly older people who have died in the outbreak. \u201cIf the information is transparent, there won\u2019t be so many rumours,\u201d Huang added.</p> <p>In Beijing on Sunday, officials said they still knew very little about the virus and the risks it poses. Residents cooped up at home in Wuhan were following updates on the news and social media, but no one knows how long the quarantine is going to last.</p>",

There are also fears for vulnerable groups including elderly people who rely on regular visits from relatives, and foreign students who may be less likely to have stocked up on food. \u201cThe decision [to ban traffic from the roads] didn\u2019t take medical staff, existing patients [or] pregnant people who need public transportation into consideration,\u201d Huang said. Her friend had recently been bitten by a dog and was due to receive a third rabies vaccine but was still awaiting permission to get it. The US, France and Japan are preparing to evacuate citizens from the city but Warren said he had decided against the idea, fearing he could pick up the virus at the airport and take it back to his mother. \u201cI don\u2019t feel safe doing that,\u201d he said. Others, though, were desperate to leave, including one British citizen who questioned why the UK government was not acting more quickly. Among residents who do not have the option of flying out of the city, there was growing anger at the local government for not sharing information more quickly. \u201cThey only said the epidemic was preventable and controllable. Middle-aged and elderly people would have felt that the official said that it\u2019s OK, so they don\u2019t need to wear masks or take any precautions,\u201d said Huang. It is mostly older people who have died in the outbreak. \u201cIf the information is transparent, there won\u2019t be so many rumours,\u201d Huang added. In Beijing on Sunday, officials said they still knew very little about the virus and the risks it poses. Residents cooped up at home in Wuhan were following updates on the news and social media, but no one knows how long the quarantine is going to last.",

      "body": "<p>About 100,000 people could be infected with the new coronavirus around the world, experts have warned, as the UK government faced calls to reassure people that the NHS is ready to deal with any British cases within days.</p> \n<p>Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, said his \u201cbest guess\u201d was that there were 100,000 affected by the virus even though there are only 2,000 confirmed cases so far, mostly in the city of Wuhan in China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/26/wuhan-residents-keep-wary-eye-on-each-other-during-lockdown\">where the virus first appeared</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cSooner or later we will get a case,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now. Unless the Chinese manage to control this, and I\u2019m sceptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although no one has yet tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, Labour called on the government to reassure the public that the NHS could cope with an outbreak when it is already struggling with the winter flu season.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe NHS is currently under immense strain this winter with staff already working flat out and hospitals overcrowded. We need urgent reassurance from ministers they have a plan to ensure we have capacity in place to deal with coronavirus should we need to.\u201d</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/26/priti-patel-uk-coronavirus-precautions-wuhan\">insisted on Sunday that the government was taking \u201call precautions\u201d</a>, despite criticism it had been slow off the mark to find and give information to the thousands of people in Britain who had flown back from Wuhan in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>Prof Martin Dove, a British academic, said no one from the UK government had tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak despite recently returning home from working in Wuhan. </p> \n<p>Others have said the UK authorities have been difficult to contact with the British embassy in Beijing shut on Friday and over the weekend, as well as Monday and Tuesday for the lunar new year. A Foreign Office spokesman said there would be some staff working despite the official closure and pointed to its 24-hour emergency assistance number.</p> \n<p>There was also no clarity on Sunday over whether the government would evacuate the estimated 200 Brits trapped in Wuhan, with the Foreign Office advising against all travel to Hubei province but providing scant information on how to leave the affected areas. This is in contrast to France, the US and Japan, who are putting in place logistics to get their citizens out.</p> \n<p>Patel said the government was \u201clooking at all the options\u201d, which could include airlifting UK citizens out of the worst-affected area.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

      "bodyText": "About 100,000 people could be infected with the new coronavirus around the world, experts have warned, as the UK government faced calls to reassure people that the NHS is ready to deal with any British cases within days. Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, said his \u201cbest guess\u201d was that there were 100,000 affected by the virus even though there are only 2,000 confirmed cases so far, mostly in the city of Wuhan in China where the virus first appeared. \u201cSooner or later we will get a case,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very large numbers of Chinese tourists across Europe right now. Unless the Chinese manage to control this, and I\u2019m sceptical about whether that is possible, we will get cases here.\u201d Although no one has yet tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, Labour called on the government to reassure the public that the NHS could cope with an outbreak when it is already struggling with the winter flu season. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said: \u201cThe NHS is currently under immense strain this winter with staff already working flat out and hospitals overcrowded. We need urgent reassurance from ministers they have a plan to ensure we have capacity in place to deal with coronavirus should we need to.\u201d Priti Patel, the home secretary, insisted on Sunday that the government was taking \u201call precautions\u201d, despite criticism it had been slow off the mark to find and give information to the thousands of people in Britain who had flown back from Wuhan in recent weeks. Prof Martin Dove, a British academic, said no one from the UK government had tried to contact him regarding the coronavirus outbreak despite recently returning home from working in Wuhan. Others have said the UK authorities have been difficult to contact with the British embassy in Beijing shut on Friday and over the weekend, as well as Monday and Tuesday for the lunar new year. A Foreign Office spokesman said there would be some staff working despite the official closure and pointed to its 24-hour emergency assistance number. There was also no clarity on Sunday over whether the government would evacuate the estimated 200 Brits trapped in Wuhan, with the Foreign Office advising against all travel to Hubei province but providing scant information on how to leave the affected areas. This is in contrast to France, the US and Japan, who are putting in place logistics to get their citizens out. Patel said the government was \u201clooking at all the options\u201d, which could include airlifting UK citizens out of the worst-affected area. So far there are around 40 cases outside China, including three each in the United States and France. All 56 deaths have occurred in China, mostly in people who were older and had underlying health problems that made it hard to fight off the virus. The Department of Health and Social Care said on Sunday that 52 people had been cleared after testing in the UK and the \u201crisk to the public remains low\u201d. But in spite of the rigorous containment measures China has taken, its ban on flights and the UK checks on travellers from China at Heathrow, experts say it is only a matter of time until there is a case in the UK, given the ease with which the new coronavirus is now believed to pass from one person to another \u2013 possibly transmitted by people with mild or even no symptoms at all. Ferguson, whose team have been modelling the disease for the World Health Organization, said they estimated the virus had a reproductive rate of 2.5-3, meaning that each person infected would potentially transmit it to up to three others. \u201cMy best guess now is perhaps 100,000 cases right now,\u201d he said, although it could be between 30,000 and 200,000. \u201cAlmost certainly many tens of thousands of people are infected.\u201d Most of the cases that have been exported to other countries from China have been mild, he said.

We should receive the results from the second round of testing today.\u201d Hunt said it was likely there would be more confirmed cases, but he would not be drawn on how many more people were likely to test positive for the virus. \u201cThe advice from the chief medical officer is we suspect there could well be other cases in Australia,\u201d he said. The World Health Organisation is yet to declare to a public health emergency, but the virus has prompted massive disruption in China, where events have been cancelled during the lunar year festival. The Asian Football Confederation has also moved games away from Nanjing, meaning Sydney will now host the Matildas\u2019 Olympic qualifying group matches against China, Taiwan and Thailand. In Sydney, three men aged 35, 43, and 53 are being treated in hospital but are listed as being stable. Authorities have now spoken to all but two people who have been in close contact with the three men since they arrived from China. In Victoria, a man in his 50s is being treated at Monash Medical Centre while four of his family members are being quarantined at home. A further 11 patients are now awaiting test results. Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said authorities were attempting to contact four people who may have come into contact with the Victorian patient after sharing the same flight.
