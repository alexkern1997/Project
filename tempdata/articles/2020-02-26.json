      "bodyText": "As the CDC warned of \u201csevere disruption\u201d in case of a coronavirus update, lawmakers criticized the administration\u2019s response plan as inadequate. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was grilled earlier today by senators and criticized for lacking substantive answers to questions about how the US would handle an outbreak. Two abortion bills failed in the Senate; one would have banned abortions after 20 weeks, and the other players into misconceptions about the procedure in mandating that doctors treat babies that survive failed abortions. Doctors do not provide abortions to patients in labor and it is pretty much impossible for a baby to be born alive after a failed abortion. Ahead of the Democratic debate and the South Carolina primary, the civil rights leader Rev Jesse Jackson defended Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as well as the idea of \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d. Frontrunner Sanders is bracing for attacks from his opponents tonight during the crucial primary debate in Charleston, South Carolina. The Guardian\u2019s politics team will be providing live updates and analysis during the debate. Follow our debate liveblog: Mike Bloomberg to speak at pro-Israel lobby\u2019s conference Bloomberg will be speaking at the conference for the influential pro-Israel lobby group, the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (Aipac), the group confirmed. This weekend, Bernie Sanders, who has never attended an Aipac conference, said that the group gives a platform to leaders who \u201cwho express bigotry and oppose basic Palestinian rights\u201d. The pro-Israel group has previously run Trun ads targeting the Vermont senator\u2019s campaign in California, Texas and Florida. In response to Sanders\u2019 recent comments, Aipac put out a statement condemning his views as \u201ctruly shameful\u201d. In 2016, all the presidential candidates except Sanders address the conference and in 2012, Barack Obama and all the GOP candidates participated despite the event overlapping with Super Tuesday (as it will this year). Elizabeth Warren has also said she\u2019s not going, and the other candidates have yet to confirm their attendance. Reverend Jesse Jackson: \u2018Democratic socialism isn\u2019t socialism, it\u2019s democratic\u2019 Ahead of the South Carolina primary, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has written an op-ed for the Chicago Sun-Times to clarify that Bernie Sanders \u201cisn\u2019t talking about making America into Cuba or Venezuela\u201d. Sanders is \u201ctalking about extending social guarantees like those offered in most other advanced industrial states, invoking Denmark or Sweden. These countries have universal health care at a lower cost, paid family leave, guaranteed paid vacations, higher minimum wages, more generous public retirement programs,\u201d Jackson writes. \u201cThey also have vibrant and competitive economies, lower inequality, less poverty, and higher life expectancies.\u201d The Vermont senator recently drew bipartisan criticism for emphasizing the literacy drives under Fidel Castro and claiming \u201cit\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad\u201d about the communist state. Jackson emphasized that Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are proposing a \u201cmodern version of what Franklin D Roosevelt called the Economic Bill of Rights: Medicare for all, tuition-free public education, universal daycare, a Green New Deal to generate jobs while addressing climate change.\u201d San Francisco declares a state of emergency over coronavirus concerns Although no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in San Francisco, \u201cthe global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness\u201d, said mayor London Breed. \u201cWe see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm.\u201d Lawmakers in DC have been arguing over the administration\u2019s plan to stem coronavirus, which Democrats have said isn\u2019t enough. The extent to which the virus could spread in the US is unclear, though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that an outbreak could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d and urged communities to start preparing. \u201cAs more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, the head of immunization at the CDC Donald Trump, in India earlier today, told journalists that the coronavirus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. Second abortion bill fails in Senate Another abortion bill, which would have required medical providers to \u201cexercise the proper degree of care\u201d if a child survives an abortion has been blocked in the Senate. Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Doug Jones of Alabama voted with all the Republicans in this case. Jones, a vulnerable Democratic senator from a red state, has found himself in the difficult position of either alienating his own base of Democrats or anti-choice independents whose votes he needs to keep his seat. The \u201cborn alive\u201d bill in question here plays into misconceptions about late abortions. Doctors do not provide abortions to patients who are in labor. And It is essentially impossible for babies to survive failed abortions, and if a baby did survive the process, it\u2019s would be standard procedure to care for the infant like any other patient. Here\u2019s everything that\u2019s happened today: After coming out with a plan to dedicate $2.5bn to fighting and preventing coronavirus, Donald Trump and Democrats have been in a spat about whether the White House\u2019s measures will be strong enough to prevent an outbreak. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has been the most vocal critic, saying Trump isn\u2019t taking the issue seriously. In response, Trump said that Schumer would complain if he asked for more. Though Roger Stone was sentenced to 40 weeks in prison last week, his trial continues as a judge rules whether the former political operative can have a new trial due to alleged juror misconduct. The judge criticized Trump for tweeting about a juror on the case, while Trump said the judge is biased. The Democratic candidates are gearing up for a heated debate tonight, one that will likely see blows dealt to senator Bernie Sanders, who is thought of as the current front-runner in the case. Mike Bloomberg, who was seen as the punching bag of last week\u2019s debate, sent out surrogates today to criticize Sanders. Meanwhile, Bloomberg\u2019s long-term partner Diana Taylor told a reporter in an interview that those who are concerned about allegations against him should \u201cget over it\u201d. A group of former US senators are calling on the men and women they once called colleagues to come together and rise above the partisan moment. \u201cCongress is not fulfilling its Constitutional duties,\u201d the letter says. \u201cMuch of the responsibility rests on the Senate.\u201d The letter encourages the 100-person body to create a \u201cbipartisan caucus\u201d committed to breaking the partisan gridlock that has paralyzed Congress in recent years. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s abdication of its legislative and oversight responsibilities erodes the checks and balances of the separate powers that are designed to protect the liberties on which our democracy depends,\u201d the letter states. They write that morale is low and that they\u2019ve spoken to incumbents who have doubted whether there is \u201cany point in continuing to serve\u201d and potential candidates have questioned whether \u201cthe reality of Senate membership is worth the considerable effort and expense of running for office. Among those who signed the letter are former senators Jeff Flake, the Arizona Republican whose criticism of Donald Trump hampered his re-election, Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska and the former Secretary of Defense under Obama, Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota who lost her seat in 2018, and Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who also lost her seat in 2018. \u201cOversight and public policy are responsibilities of the legislative branch,\u201d Hagel wrote in a statement. \u201cThis is the Senate\u2019s constitutional duty. Anything less is an abdication of its responsibilities.\u201d The writers nodded to the deeply partisan reality of the moment, when Republicans\u2019 fear of reprisal from the president has forced many of them to toe the party line. \u201cWe know that accepting this challenge may put some of you at political risk,\u201d they write. \u201cBut we are also confident that each of you chose to serve in public life to advance the cause of a \u2018more perfect union.\u2019 Our hope is that all of you will accept this challenge to advance that timeless and higher purpose. The Senate\u2014and the proper functioning of our Republic\u2014are simply too important to be allowed to continue on their present course.\u201d Bill banning abortions after 20 weeks falls in Senate A bill banning abortion at after 20 weeks failed to get enough votes in the Senate this afternoon. Sixty votes were needed for the bill. Though abortion is a highly partisan issue in Washington, two people from each party crossed party lines. Democrats Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia voted in favor of the bill, while Republicans Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted against it. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell likely brought the bill, and a second anti-abortion bill that requires medical providers to \u201cexercise the proper degree of care\u201d if a child survives an abortion or attempted abortion, to spark energy around the issue amongst conservatives. DHS secretary grilled over coronavirus preparedness Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was grilled earlier today by a Republican senator about coronavirus and the US preparedness against the spread of the illness. The department has been put in charge of coordinating efforts to taper the spread of coronavirus. \u201cYou\u2019re head of homeland security, do we have enough respirators or not?\u201d asked Republican Senator John Neely Kennedy. \u201cI would refer you to [Health and Human Services] for that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cSecretary, you\u2019re supposed to keep us safe,\u201d Kennedy said in response. In a Tweet reply, a DHS spokesperson said: \u201cThe Senator should direct medical questions to HHS and CDC. DHS\u2019s role is primarily related to air, land and sea ports.\u201d Tweeting while aboard Air Force One on his way back from India, Donald Trump just doubled down on his attack against the jury foreman in the case of Roger Stone, long-time GOP political operative and former Trump confidant, and said the judge in the case is also biased against him. This afternoon, the judge on the case, Amy Berman Jackson, criticized Trump\u2019s original tweet attacking Tomeka Hart, who revealed herself to by the jury foreman on the case earlier this month. Trump said that the \u201cfore person in the jury, in the Roger Stone case, had significant bias\u201d and criticized the justice department for its handling of the case. Jackson rebuked Trump for attacking Hart, who he did not mention by name, in a public matter. \u201cIn a highly publicized political climate\u2026 the risk of harassment and intimidation of any juror\u201d is high, she said. While Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison for seven felony charges, including lying to Congress and tampering with a witness, Stone has not been sent to prison. He is currently waiting on a request to have a new trial, which his team is trying to get by alleging juror misconduct. That Trump said in his Tweet this afternoon that he believes Jackson is biased against him furthers a rift between Trump and his attorney general, Bill Barr, who heads the justice department. In an interview with ABC News, Barr said that \u201cpublic statements and tweets made about the department\u2026 about cases pending in the department and about the judges before whom we have cases make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the department that we\u2019re doing our work with integrity.\u201d He also said, \u201cI think it\u2019s time to stop tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases\u201d -- advice that Trump has clearly not heeded. Back to the 2020 election: Comments made by Diana Taylor, Mike Bloomberg\u2019s long-time partner, on the reported nondisclosure agreements with women who accused his company of discrimination and harassment is giving ammunition to his critics. In an interview with CBS News, Taylor said that none of the nondisclosure agreements accuse Bloomberg of \u201csaying something nasty to a woman\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not who he is. Life has changed. I grew up in that world. It was bro culture,\u201d Taylor said. When asked what she would say to people who have concerns about the allegations. \u201cIt was 30 years ago, get over it!\u201d she said. In a later statement, a spokesperson for Taylor said that she \u201coffered her personal view from her forty years working in finance, not the view of the campaign.\u201d Mitt Romney: US is \u2018substantially underinvesting\u2019 in preventing coronavirus outbreak Senator Mitt Romney, who recently made headlines for being the sole GOP senator to vote for Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office, said that the US is \u201csubstantially underinvesting\u201d in preventing an outbreak, according to The Hill. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in the degree to which we\u2019ve prepared for a pandemic both in terms of protective equipment and would help people once they are infected,\u201d Romney said. Romney\u2019s fellow Republicans have indicated they are happy with the president\u2019s response to the illness. \u201cIt\u2019s $2.5bn. If it\u2019s not enough, we\u2019ll appropriate more. We have to have a balance here,\u201d said senator Lamar Alexander, chair of the Senate\u2019s Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions Committee, earlier today. Senator Chuck Schumer took his criticisms of Donald Trump\u2019s response to coronavirus to the Senate floor this afternoon, saying that the administration\u2019s response to the virus has been tainted with \u201ctowering and dangerous incompetence\u201d. \u201cThe Trump administration has no plan to deal with the coronavirus, no plan and seemingly no urgency to develop one,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe Trump administration is trying to build an airplane while already mid-flight.\u201d Earlier this morning, Trump tweeted that \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer\u201d is \u201cincompetent\u201d and would complain if Trump asked for more funding. The political battle over the US response to coronavirus began yesterday when the White House announced they are requesting Congress approve $2.5bn to address a potential outbreak, with $1.25m coming from new funding and the rest coming from other areas within the Department of Health and Human Services budget. Republicans have indicated they are happy with this plan, while Democrats have said it\u2019s not enough. Earlier this afternoon, officials from the US Center for Disease Control warned in a press conference that an outbreak could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d in the lives of ordinary Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen,\u201d an official said about the potential spread of the illness. Roger Stone to make case for a new trial At 2pm, Roger Stone, a longtime Republican political operative and confidant to Donald Trump, will be asking a Washington D.C. court for a new trial. Stone was sentenced last week to 40 months in prison for seven felony charges, including lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. But a Facebook post from the jury foreperson has complicated the trial\u2019s end. Tomeka Hart identified herself on a Facebook post and said that she wanted to break her silence. Hart, a program officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said that she \u201ccan\u2019t keep quiet any longer\u2026 I want to stand up for Aaron Zelinsky, Adam Jed, Michael Marando and Jonathan Kravis \u2013 the prosecutors on the Roger Stone trial.\u201d Other Facebook posts from Hart showed she called the president and his supporters racist and had mentioned Stone\u2019s arrest before she was seated on the jury. Trump said later that it was clear that Hart \u201chad significant bias\u201d. Stone is fighting for a new trial while outside of prison, though he was already sentenced. Bloomberg team revving up battle with Bernie The battle billionaire Michael Bloomberg is preparing to launch against senators Bernie Sanders is slowly being revealed today in anticipation of tonight\u2019s debate. Timothy O\u2019Brien, a senior advisor on Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, told CNN that though Sanders has risen in the polls because of his track record, he has \u201call this loopy stuff in his background.\u201d \u201cSaying things like you know, women get cancer from getting too many orgasms or toddlers should run around naked and touch each others genitals,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what?\u201d the host asked incredulously. O\u2019Brien continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the loony side of Bernie,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. He continued on with attacks on Sanders policies, saying that he has \u201cnot been good on immigration\u201d and backed that 1994 crime bill that was largely seen as discriminatory toward black and brown Americans. The attacks on Sanders shows the effect that the candidate is having on his fellow candidates, who see him as the current front-runner. In South Carolina, a group of Bloomberg surrogates held a press conference, saying that people will \u201csee a 180 degree shift tonight\u201d during the debate. Responding to a question about Stop and Frisk, US Rep Greg Meeks told reporters, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to question Michael Bloomberg for what he\u2019s done in the past, you have to question everyone else.\u201d At a press conference in India, Donald Trump covered a broad range of topics, including the recent conviction of disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein. \u201cI think that from the standpoint of women, I think it was a great thing,\u201d Trump said of the conviction, which found Weinstein guilty of two sexual assault charges. \u201cIt was a great victory and sends a very strong message \u2013 a very, very strong message.\u201d Trump named the Democrats that Weinstein was tied to, including Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Before his downfall, Weinstein was known as a major Democratic donor, helping to finance Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. From India, Donald Trump lashed out this morning at US senator Chuck Schumer for criticizing him on his response to the coronavirus. In a tweet, Trump calls the senator, who he refers to as \u201cCryin\u2019 Chuck Schumer\u201d, \u201cincompetent\u201d. Trump is asking Congress for $2.5bn to respond to the illness. The administration is requesting $1.25bn of new funding and get $535m from the Ebola preparedness account and the rest of the money from the Department of Health and Human Services budget. In India, Trump told reporters that the US is in \u201cvery good shape\u201d to handle coronavirus and that the US has \u201cvery few people with it\u201d. \u201cI think the whole situation will start working out. Lots of talent, lots of brain power is being put behind it,\u201d he said. Democrats have been vocal critics of the White House\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying the money allocated to preventing a more severe outbreak is not enough. Schumer tweeted that Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus is \u201ctoo little too late\u201d and slammed Trump for \u201ctrying to steal funds dedicated to fight Ebola\u201d, saying that it is proof that the administration is not taking the coronavirus seriously. A barrage of criticism from the Democrats followed. \u201cAmericans need a coordinated, fully-funded, whole-of-government response to keep them and their loved ones safe,\u201d Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted last night. The virus has 14 confirmed cases in the United States. In response to Schumer, Trump said \u201cIf I asked for more he would say it is too much.\u201d Schumer bit back at Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t just criticize Pres. Trump\u2019s pathetic, inadequate funding request. I noted his incompetence, how he has no plan to deal with coronavirus.\u201d Democrats and Republicans who were in the closed-door briefing that was given to senators on the status of the outbreak had divided reaction to the briefing. \u201cThere would be an outcry and outroar if the American people heard what we been told,\u201d Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said after the briefing. \u201cProtection, preparedness, prevention all seem to be inadequate. In South Carolina, the contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination are preparing for tonight\u2019s debate and seeking to connect with voters ahead of the primary on Saturday. While they do that, a word about polling averages. Which is to say, they\u2019re useful. Here\u2019s a screenshot of the realclearpolitics.com polling average for South Carolina as of midmorning Tuesday: As you can see, Joe Biden is still leading in a state most analysts agree he must win if he is to remain in the primary \u2013 he says he never called it his firewall, but he did \u2013 but Bernie Sanders has narrowed the gap considerably over the past few months. Among other things you can also see the impact of Tom Steyer\u2019s concentration on the state \u2013 as well as the billionaire\u2019s purchasing power when it comes to buying ads \u2013 and Pete Buttigieg\u2019s inability to make any sort of mark. Here\u2019s another average from another site: fivethirtyeight.com\u2019s average of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity: Which, to non-Trump supporters, might be a little worrying. The president is still underwater but since impeachment proceedings gathered pace in October, through to his acquittal in the Senate and after, his approval rating has risen. This is what CNN\u2019s Harry Enten, formerly of this parish, has to say about it all. More from Trump\u2019s press conference in India: another testy exchange with Jim Acosta of CNN about who is more fake news than the other. Acosta asked the president about reports that Russia is trying to boost his campaign again, and about reports of a purge of non-loyalists from his administration. \u201cFirst of all I want no help from any country,\u201d the president said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been given any help from any country.\u201d And then, duly, he attacked CNN for having to apologise for errors in stories \u2013 something most media companies end up having to do. \u201cMr President,\u201d Acosta retorted, \u201cI think our record on delivering the truth is a lot better than yours sometimes, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d Trump did mind. \u201cYour record is so bad you ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d the president said. \u201cYou probably have the worst record in the history of broadcasting.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of anything,\u201d Acosta said, \u201cand our organization is not ashamed, Sir.\u201d Trump then answered, after a fashion, the question about the reported purge. Acosta and Trump have history, so much so that last year Acosta got a book out of it: The Enemy of the People: A Dangerous Time to Tell the Truth in America. The book deals with Trump\u2019s antagonistic stance with the mainstream media via the medium of Acosta\u2019s run-ins with Trump that culminated in the CNN correspondent having his White House pass revoked. It also echoes other books in saying Trump seems to have admitted, via an intermediary, that the whole thing is something of a performative act. Here\u2019s how we reported the book: In The Enemy of the People, Acosta writes that after an early confrontation, close Trump aide Hope Hicks called him to say the president wanted him to know he was \u201cvery professional today\u201d. \u201cHe said, \u2018Jim gets it,\u2019\u201d Hicks is quoted as saying. Trump, Acosta writes, had just called the reporter \u201cfake news\u201d and \u201cvery fake news\u201d after being asked about Russian election interference at a press conference in February 2017. \u201cWhen he called us \u2018fake news\u2019,\u201d Acosta writes, \u201cit was, in his mind, an act.\u201d On the subject of Trump calling people and organisations \u201cfake news\u201d when his own relationship with the truth is somewhat, um, tenuous, here\u2019s a link to the Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker column. It says that in his first three years in office, the 45th president made more than 16,000 false or misleading claims. It might be a stretch to say Donald Trump is in hot water over his criticism of supreme court justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 this being America in the age of Trump, his tweets and remarks at a presser in India will be old news before your average desk editor can try to remember what it was Paul Manafort was found guilty of, what that jacket he had was made of, or which ex-national security adviser is next due out with a book. Plus, y\u2019know, Trump doesn\u2019t seem to be being held to account much by anyone these days, let alone his own political party. But here\u2019s a key take on the supreme court story from University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck, a particularly well-informed and worthwhile presence in the Twittersphere: In short, because Fox misrepresented Sotomayor\u2019s words, Trump is misrepresenting Sotomayor\u2019s words, which means much of the media is misrepresenting Sotomayor\u2019s words. Here\u2019s a link to Sotomayor\u2019s dissent, so you can read it for yourselves. A new ad from Mike Bloomberg titled \u201cSupports Women\u201d features women who have worked at Bloomberg\u2019s company or on his staff while he was mayor of New York City praising the presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s important to talk to the people who know him personally,\u201d says Erana Stennett, who is the director of the Bloomberg Media Initiative Africa, in the video. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody that I respect more and felt respected by,\u201d says Jacki Kelly, a former Bloomberg LP employee. The ad is a response to mounting criticism against Bloomberg over allegations of mistreatment and discrimination in his company, sparked by rumors of nondisclosure agreements the candidate\u2019s company signed with women. The allegations put a target on Bloomberg\u2019s back during last week\u2019s debate and will likely continue to weigh on the candidate as the race continues: Having earlier said that India wasn\u2019t having much of a problem with coronavirus, Trump has just now gone on the attack against somebody criticising his own administrations\u2019s preparedness for the outbreak - in this case Sen. Chuck Schumer. The row over US moves to deploy low-yield nuclear missiles on submarines continued in Geneva today, with criticism of the decision from Iran. In a move unlikely to further endear the Iranians to the Trump administration, Iran\u2019s deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs Mohsen Baharvand told the Conference on Disarmament in the UN building in Geneva said that \u201cSuch provocative actions must be condemned\u201d. \u201cA new nuclear arms race is being accelerated\u201d, he added. The US Defense Department confirmed earlier this month that the Navy had fielded a low-yield, submarine-launched ballistic missile warhead. Low-yield nuclear weapons have a strength of less than 20 kilotons, which is about the same as the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Moscow has already expressed alarm at the decision. A set of polling figures suggests that while Andres Oppenheimer thinks Sanders is going to be a problem for Democrats in Florida (see below), that may not be the case in California. David Lauter at the LA Times has written about the widespread support Sanders enjoys among communities of colour in California, outstripping his nearest Democratic rivals. Of the poll he says: \u201cThe survey offers an unusual level of detail on the views of Latino, African Americans and Asian and Pacific Americans in California, groups that in many opinion surveys are too small to analyze. It provides strong evidence of the Vermont senator\u2019s ability to build a multiracial, multiethnic coalition in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\u201d It also reveals that support for Sanders is generationally split, regardless of ethnicity: \u201cAmong Latinos younger than 50, for example, Sanders enjoyed roughly a 3-1 lead over Bloomberg when poll respondents were asked whom they would most like to see as the next president. Latinos 50 and older were divided closely between Sanders, Biden and Bloomberg. Similar age divisions showed up among blacks, Asian Americans and whites in the poll.\u201d Read the piece here: \u201cBernie Sanders has broad support in diverse California communities, new poll finds\u201d There\u2019s a strong opinion piece in the Miami Herald from Andres Oppenheimer, picking at two of the threads where Sanders has faced criticism in recent days - his comments about Cuba on 60 Minutes, and his decision to skip the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s (AIPAC) annual policy conference. He doesn\u2019t mince his words about how he thinks that will play for Sanders in Florida. \u201cIn short, the Democrats can kiss Florida \u2014 and maybe other swing states \u2014 good-bye if they pick Sanders as their nominee. It will be political suicide \u2014 and a godsend to Trump, the worst president in America\u2019s recent memory.\u201d Read the full blast here: \u201cSanders praised Cuba, spurned Israel group. If he\u2019s the nominee, he just lost Florida\u201d There\u2019s more detail coming from Julian Assange\u2019s lawyers in London about the way the Wikileaks founder has been treated while being detained. They claim he was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice and had his case files confiscated after the first day of his extradition hearing yesterday. My colleague Ben Quinn has more from the court in London, where the US is attempting to extradite Assange from the UK. President Trump has begun giving a press conference in India. It is typically wide-ranging. So far he has said that India doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch of a problem\u201d with coronavirus, and has suggested that there has been tremendous praise for the peace efforts in Afghanistan. He says he plans to bring the troop presence down to 8,600 in the country. On other foreign policy issues he has urged Iran to crack down on Isis, and says that he has a \u201cvery good relationship\u201d with Pakistan\u2019s prime minister. He says he is willing to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. Trump also says he has discussed the issue of religious freedom with India\u2019s Narendra Modi. The bakdrop to this Trump visit has included violent scenes on India\u2019s streets as people protest a new citizenship law which many say is discriminatory against Muslims. On trade Trump declares that India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world. He singles out Harley Davidson, saying they have to pay a \u201cTremendous tariff\u201d when they sell to India. If a trade deal is to happen with India, he says, it will be towards the end of the year. Trump insists that the \u201cUnited States has to be treated fairly\u201d and that deals have to be reciprocal. \u201cWe have a large deficit of $24bn with India. That is very high.\u201d He has also mentioned yesterday\u2019s Harvey Weinstein verdict, describing it as \u201ca great victory, sends a very very strong message\u201d. Trump himself stands accused of sexually inappropriate behaviour by more than a dozen women. Trump has denied the allegations. Trump had joked that he would be \u201cvery, very conservative\u201d in his answers to avoid distracting from his \u201cfantastic two days\u201d in the country. But he also waded into domestic issues, including criticizing Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how they can not recuse themselves for anything Trump or Trump-related,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWhat Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was highly inappropriate. She\u2019s trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way.\u201d He said that Ginsburg had gone \u201cwild\u201d against him during the 2016 campaign. It is going to be a slightly unfamiliar meal for the president and his wife in India today. Trump is well known for his love of burgers and steaks, but cows are considered sacred in the Hindu religion. The main dish at the banquet tonight will be goat. The banquet is for around 90 guests, and a spokesman for India\u2019s president\u2019s office says the chefs will prepare food with \u201ca careful combination of spices to suit Indian and American palates.\u201d While Trump has been focussed on talks with prime minister Modi and Indian businessmen, first lady Melania has been visiting a \u201chappiness class\u201d at a government-run school in the Indian capital. The curriculum dovetails with her \u201cBe Best\u201d initiative to teach children and young adults to be kind, avoid drugs and take care of themselves. It has been clear for a few days now that the main Mike Bloomberg campaign strategy was going to be to turn his fire specifically on Bernie Sanders. With Sanders out in front in polling, to stand a chance of winning the nomination one of the chasing pack needs to peg him back urgently before he amounts an unassailable lead. Bloomberg\u2019s attack today is that some internal polling that suggests Sanders\u2019 nomination could drag down vulnerable House Democrats trying to hold onto their competitive districts. Here\u2019s an analysis of the tactic and the data by Christopher Cadelago and Laura Barr\u00f3n-L\u00f3pez for Politico: \u201cBloomberg internal poll claims Bernie would sink downballot Dems\u201d It isn\u2019t traditional for US presidents to comment on domestic politics while at events on foreign trips, but that\u2019s what the US president has been doing in India. At a meeting of Indian business leaders today he has told them that the US economy is being held back by the upcoming presidential election. Warning of economic turmoil at home if he loses his November election, Trump told his hosts \u201cif the wrong person gets elected, everything will come to a halt\u201d and unemployment will rise. He blamed the recent fall in US stock markets on the coronavirus outbreak, and predicted that the stock market will soar if he wins a second term. Here are a few interesting reads from around the internet to set you up for the day. Ben Mathis-Lilley over on Slate is arguing that the Democrats who are so worried that Sanders might grab the nomination should think hard about whether they\u2019ve been doing the right thing in backing Biden. If you sincerely hold the belief that [Sanders\u2019 \u201cdemocratic socialism\u201d] will [repel swing voters], what should you have been doing for the past year to actually prevent the socialist from winning the nomination? Probably finding and supporting a nonsocialist nominee who\u2019s shown themselves ready to run a dynamic general-election presidential campaign, right? Perhaps one like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, or even Elizabeth Warren? Sally Goldenberg on Politico has a bit on the inside track of how Mike Bloomberg is preparing for tonight\u2019s debate with a simple plan - \u201cNuke Bernie\u201d. That\u2019s why his team is getting ready to launch a fusillade at Sanders before and during the debate, and why Bloomberg\u2019s prep sessions were focused on aiming his fire at the liberal Vermont senator. \u2018We\u2019ve trained our eyes on him. Something the rest of the field has failed to do eight debates prior and a year in a campaign,\u2019 a top aide said in an interview. The Democratic challenger field is notably on the elderly side, with Biden, Bloomberg and Sanders all in their late 70s. Is that too old to run the country? Not according to John H Rowe, a professor of health policy and ageing at Columbia University. In the Washington Post he has argued that: The older people become, the less like each other they become. While many physical and mental functions might decline with advancing age on average, for most measures there are many older persons who perform as well as the average young adult, and well-educated, financially secure individuals are especially likely to be among them. Trump\u2019s visit to India has been high on pomp and ceremony, and a little short on substance. The president started the day with an elaborate outdoor welcome ceremony in front of the grand Rashtrapati Bhavan Presidential Palace in New Delhi, where he was welcomed with canon fire and horseback soldiers. The Trumps then went on to visit a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi where the president and first lady paid their respects in a petal throwing ceremony. The memorial is at Raj Ghat where the famed independence leader was cremated after his assassination in 1948. Trump also signed a guest book and was presented with a bust of Gandhi. Meeting prime minister Narendra Modi later on, Trump commented that he thought the crowds at the joint mass rally yesterday had been there more for Modi than for him. He said there were cheers every time he mentioned Modi\u2019s name, \u201cso they love you in India and that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Modi went on to say that the two had a productive exchange on issues including defence cooperation, energy and technology, and said talks will continue. He said that he and Trump have now met five times over the past eight months and said ties between the two nations is the \u201cmost important partnership of the 21st century.\u201d Good morning. It\u2019s been another showy day already for Donald Trump as he continues his whirlwind 36-hour trip to India to meet prime minister Narendra Modi. The two have posed for photos together in New Delhi, but there have been violent clashes on the streets. Trump is due to attend a banquet in the evening, and then at 10pm local time (11.30 ET) he flies out. Back at home the Democrats are preparing for the next TV debate ahead of Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. Businessman Tom Steyer has made the cut, meaning there will be a crowded field of seven challengers. Will anyone be able to cut through the noise and make a decisive move against current frontrunner Bernie Sanders? It\u2019s not just about South Carolina either. It is the last TV showdown before the 3 March Super Tuesday primaries. The debate is on from 8pm to 10:15pm ET, and is being hosted by CBS News. There are details on how to watch here. In London, the second day of a court hearing into the extradition of Julian Assange from the UK to the US will take place.",

      "bodyText": "An Australian university is offering up to $7,500 in grants to students stranded in China due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus. The University of Melbourne has offered to reimburse expenses related to forfeited flights, accommodation and remote study workarounds by those students who have been affected by the Australian government\u2019s continuing ban on entry to foreign nationals who have travelled through mainland China. The ban has been in force since 1 February and extended twice. It is due to expire on 29 February but is being reviewed weekly. Australian citizens and permanent residents are exempt from the ban. The University of Melbourne is the third Australian university to offer financial assistance to stranded students. The University of Adelaide emailed its affected students last week to offer \u201ccare packages\u201d including discounted fees and a financial contribution towards air fares of up to $2,000. It also offered to completely refund semester fees to any student who couldn\u2019t make it onto campus by the end of semester due to the outbreak. On Friday, Western Sydney University announced it was \u201cencouraging its students \u2013 who are currently offshore, and impacted by travel restrictions \u2013 to consider the option of travelling to Australia via another country\u201d and that it was offering a one-off $1,500 subsidy to assist them. Australian universities have come under particular pressure from the effects of the coronavirus outbreak due to their economic reliance on international, full-fee-paying students. Universities are facing an estimated $1.2bn hit to fee revenue from an estimated 65,800 students at risk of cancelling their enrolment due to being stuck outside the country. The University of Melbourne provost, Prof Mark Considine, said in a statement that the university\u2019s \u201cnumber one priority\u201d was the health and wellbeing of the university community. \u201cWe understand this has been a difficult time for students who have been affected and we are working hard to ensure they can complete their studies on time,\u201d Considine said. \u201cThe student support grants are intended to help students with unanticipated expenses incurred as a result of the travel restrictions related to Covid-19 and to help students transition to or return to study at the University of Melbourne,\u201d he said. The grant would help students with accommodation costs, fees associated with flight changes, costs incurred during the mandatory 14-day self-isolation period, and technology upgrades to help with remote study. Students needed to be scheduled for on-campus study in the summer term or semester one of this year to be eligible to access the grant. The government has said it will consider relaxing the travel ban at the end of the month. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, announced a slight relaxation to the ban on Saturday to allow Chinese students in years 11 or 12 \u2013 other than those from Hubei province, the locus of the outbreak \u2013 to return to Australia. An estimated 400 year 12 students and 360 year 11 students enrolled in Australian schools were stuck outside the country due to the travel ban and are now eligible to apply for an exemption. The travel ban is due to be reviewed again in the coming days.",

      "body": "<p>The Democratic presidential candidates engaged in a series of chaotic and fiery exchanges on Tuesday night, in the final debate before the critical South Carolina presidential primary and Super Tuesday contests that could represent a make-or-break moment.</p> \n<p>Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner who cruised to victory in Nevada last week, bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals, including the former vice-president Joe Biden, the ex-New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.</p> \n<p>Buttigieg labelled Sanders a polarizing figure in the primary and warned of a race between the self-declared Democratic socialist and Trump, who has already sought to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/31/trump-iowa-socialism-bernie-sanders\">weaponise the spectre of socialism</a> in the run-up to the November election.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The Vermont senator denied his policies were radical, and acknowledged the heat he attracted, stating wryly: \u201cI\u2019m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why.\u201d</p> \n<p>In one of the earliest exchanges, Bloomberg \u2013 who is not on the ballot in South Carolina but is seeking to make gains in the 16 states and territories voting next Tuesday \u2013 referenced recent reports to suggest that Sanders\u2019 campaign was benefiting from Russian interference in the 2020 primary.</p> \n<p>\u201cRussia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him [Trump]\u201d Bloomberg told Sanders, in an early attempt to recover from his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/20/michael-bloomberg-elizabeth-warren-new-york-mayor-trump\">disastrous first debate performance last week</a>, as members of the audience jeered.</p> \n<p>Addressing his response directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Sanders said: \u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, trust me, you\u2019re not going to interfere in any more American elections.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad2ee4e8-496c-4576-a432-2d90af53c20f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 78-year-old Vermont senator turned a long-shot, anti-establishment bid for the presidency into a \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d that has energized the Democratic party\u2019s progressive base.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>The self-proclaimed Democratic socialist began his political career nearly 40 years ago. But it wasn\u2019t until his 2016 bid for the presidency that Sanders became a national figure as a new generation of Democrats embraced his populist economic policies.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Many of his ideas, which were once called radical, have also been embraced by his rival 2020 contenders. His signature Medicare-for-all plan for universal healthcare would eliminate private health insurance and create a free at the point of care system, and he pledges a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Sanders was hospitalized after a heart attack in October, but only took a short break away from the campaign trail.&nbsp; Can the anointed \u201cgodfather of the progressive movement\u201d go all the way in 2020?</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The South Carolina primary on Saturday marks the first vote in the deep south and in which African American voters form a majority of the electorate for the first time. On Super Tuesday \u2013 3 March \u2013 the candidates will be vying for more than a third of the available delegates that are key to securing the nomination \u2013 a high stakes day that has the potential to propel one candidate to solid frontrunner status and see others drop out.</p> \n<p>Biden has long courted voters in the black community, touting his record as vice-president to America\u2019s first African American president, Barack Obama. But <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/02/24/polls-bernie-electibility-trump-african-american-voters/4861722002/\">recent polling</a> has suggested that Sanders, buoyed by success in a multicultural electorate in Nevada, is the frontrunner with black voters nationally.</p> \n<p>Biden, who holds a slim lead in South Carolina according to recent polling, said he intended to win in the state on Saturday, and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. But he also tried to tear strips off Sanders, his closest rival in the state.</p> \n<p>Referencing the 2015 terror attack at Mother Emanuel AME church, which stands a few dozen feet from the debate stage in downtown Charleston, Biden pointed to Sanders\u2019 mixed voting record on gun control, and touted his own 1994 legislation implementing five-day waiting periods for firearms purchases.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying he [Sanders] is responsible for the nine deaths [at Mother Emanuel],\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut that man [the white supremacist Dylann Roof] would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest[ed].\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Biden<strong> </strong>for his record on trade deals, prompting more boos from the audience, before saying: \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was a bad vote.\u201d</p> \n<p>As with much of the debate there was little follow-up questioning after Sanders\u2019 significant acknowledgement, as moderators struggled to keep the candidates from interrupting each other, talking over each other, shouting, and speaking for longer than their assigned time limits.</p> \n<p>The Trump campaign quickly seized on the disorder, issuing a statement saying: \u201cThe Democrat party is a hot mess and tonight\u2019s debate was further evidence that not one of these candidates is serious or can stand toe-to-toe with President Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive, also took aim at Sanders, saying the pair agreed on a lot of things, but that she would be a \u201cbetter president\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cProgressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,\u201d Warren said.</p> \n<p>Warren also renewed her attacks on Bloomberg over the billionaire philanthropist\u2019s treatment of female employees. Warren, who benefited from a surge in fundraising after her criticism of Bloomberg at last week\u2019s debate, resurfaced an allegation that he had once told a pregnant subordinate to \u201ckill it\u201d.</p> \n<p>A visibly riled Bloomberg replied: \u201cCategorically never said it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, returning to the debate stage as recent polls place him third in South Carolina, was also drawn into an angry exchange with Biden, who questioned his record investing in a private prison company, a move Steyer said he also regretted.</p> \n<p>In a withering put-down, Biden referred to Steyer as \u201cTommy come lately\u201d as the billionaire pushed back and argued he had done more to support minority communities than the former vice-president.</p> \n<p>As the debate wound to a close, the candidates began to move the focus towards more pointed criticism of the Trump administration, particularly the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>The Minnesota senator, Amy Klobuchar, criticized the administration\u2019s funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government agency responsible for helping prevent global outbreaks.</p> \n<p>She argued that the president \u201chasn\u2019t really yet addressed the nation on this topic\u201d and urged the administration to work on better quarantine and treatment plans.</p> \n<p>Shortly after the debate, Trump, seemingly listening in to the discussion, tweeted: \u201cCDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job handling Coronavirus \u2026\u201d</p>",

Senator Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner who cruised to victory in Nevada last week, bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals, including the former vice-president Joe Biden, the ex-New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Buttigieg labelled Sanders a polarizing figure in the primary and warned of a race between the self-declared Democratic socialist and Trump, who has already sought to weaponise the spectre of socialism in the run-up to the November election. \u201cIf you think the last four years has been chaotic, divisive, toxic, exhausting, imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump,\u201d he said. The Vermont senator denied his policies were radical, and acknowledged the heat he attracted, stating wryly: \u201cI\u2019m hearing my name mentioned a little bit tonight. I wonder why.\u201d In one of the earliest exchanges, Bloomberg \u2013 who is not on the ballot in South Carolina but is seeking to make gains in the 16 states and territories voting next Tuesday \u2013 referenced recent reports to suggest that Sanders\u2019 campaign was benefiting from Russian interference in the 2020 primary. \u201cRussia is helping you get elected, so you will lose to him [Trump]\u201d Bloomberg told Sanders, in an early attempt to recover from his disastrous first debate performance last week, as members of the audience jeered. Addressing his response directly to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, Sanders said: \u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, trust me, you\u2019re not going to interfere in any more American elections.\u201d The South Carolina primary on Saturday marks the first vote in the deep south and in which African American voters form a majority of the electorate for the first time. On Super Tuesday \u2013 3 March \u2013 the candidates will be vying for more than a third of the available delegates that are key to securing the nomination \u2013 a high stakes day that has the potential to propel one candidate to solid frontrunner status and see others drop out. Biden has long courted voters in the black community, touting his record as vice-president to America\u2019s first African American president, Barack Obama. But recent polling has suggested that Sanders, buoyed by success in a multicultural electorate in Nevada, is the frontrunner with black voters nationally. Biden, who holds a slim lead in South Carolina according to recent polling, said he intended to win in the state on Saturday, and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. But he also tried to tear strips off Sanders, his closest rival in the state. Referencing the 2015 terror attack at Mother Emanuel AME church, which stands a few dozen feet from the debate stage in downtown Charleston, Biden pointed to Sanders\u2019 mixed voting record on gun control, and touted his own 1994 legislation implementing five-day waiting periods for firearms purchases. \u201cI\u2019m not saying he [Sanders] is responsible for the nine deaths [at Mother Emanuel],\u201d Biden said. \u201cBut that man [the white supremacist Dylann Roof] would not have been able to get that weapon with the waiting period had been what I suggest[ed].\u201d Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Biden for his record on trade deals, prompting more boos from the audience, before saying: \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was a bad vote.\u201d As with much of the debate there was little follow-up questioning after Sanders\u2019 significant acknowledgement, as moderators struggled to keep the candidates from interrupting each other, talking over each other, shouting, and speaking for longer than their assigned time limits. The Trump campaign quickly seized on the disorder, issuing a statement saying: \u201cThe Democrat party is a hot mess and tonight\u2019s debate was further evidence that not one of these candidates is serious or can stand toe-to-toe with President Trump.\u201d The Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, a fellow progressive, also took aim at Sanders, saying the pair agreed on a lot of things, but that she would be a \u201cbetter president\u201d. \u201cProgressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,\u201d Warren said. Warren also renewed her attacks on Bloomberg over the billionaire philanthropist\u2019s treatment of female employees. Warren, who benefited from a surge in fundraising after her criticism of Bloomberg at last week\u2019s debate, resurfaced an allegation that he had once told a pregnant subordinate to \u201ckill it\u201d. A visibly riled Bloomberg replied: \u201cCategorically never said it.\u201d The billionaire former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer, returning to the debate stage as recent polls place him third in South Carolina, was also drawn into an angry exchange with Biden, who questioned his record investing in a private prison company, a move Steyer said he also regretted. In a withering put-down, Biden referred to Steyer as \u201cTommy come lately\u201d as the billionaire pushed back and argued he had done more to support minority communities than the former vice-president. As the debate wound to a close, the candidates began to move the focus towards more pointed criticism of the Trump administration, particularly the president\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The Minnesota senator, Amy Klobuchar, criticized the administration\u2019s funding cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US government agency responsible for helping prevent global outbreaks. She argued that the president \u201chasn\u2019t really yet addressed the nation on this topic\u201d and urged the administration to work on better quarantine and treatment plans. Shortly after the debate, Trump, seemingly listening in to the discussion, tweeted: \u201cCDC and my administration are doing a GREAT job handling Coronavirus \u2026\u201d",

The Vermont senator\u2019s status as the one to beat in the nominating contest appears to be unchanged.</li> \n   <li>The CBS News moderators were sharply criticized for their inability to maintain control of the debate as candidates tried to wrest control of the discussion by shouting over each other. A number of commentators also bemoaned the lack of questions on key issues like climate change and immigration.</li> \n   <li><strong>Republicans </strong>reveled in the \u201cchaos\u201d of the night, dismissing all the Democratic candidates as unworthy of ascending to the Oval Office.</li> \n   <li>Coming off his disastrous first debate performance last week, <strong>Mike Bloomberg </strong>faced the lowest expectations of any candidate but still managed to inflict some damage upon himself. For example, Bloomberg said in response to criticism from <strong>Elizabeth Warren </strong>that he was \u201cprobably wrong\u201d to make sexist jokes about his employees.</li> \n   <li>The candidates repeatedly tried to address racial issues in light of Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina, where more than half the Democratic electorate is African American.

He\u2019d fought <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> to a virtual tie in Iowa - no small feat for a little-known senator running a longshot presidential campaign. Then he trounced Clinton in New Hampshire, which neighbors Vermont. There was chaos at the Nevada caucuses, which Clinton won by a narrower-than expected margin. </p> \n  <p>But then came South Carolina. Defeat was resounding. The margin \u201374% to 26% \u2013 was so wide that there would be no spinning the result. Sanders won only 14% of the black vote there, compared to Clinton\u2019s 86%, according to exit polls.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e0aac67854e7fc22ebc503a47be983b4cfa53d0\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e0aac67854e7fc22ebc503a47be983b4cfa53d0/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hillary Clinton addresses supporters after winning the 2016 South Carolina primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hillary Clinton addresses supporters after winning the 2016 South Carolina primary.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>It was a KO from which Sanders never recovered. Even though the race dragged on for several more months, South Carolina was Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Clinton lost to <strong>Trump</strong> and Sanders effectively never stopped running for president. And in the intervening years, he spent much more time in the south, investing in the community there and making efforts to strengthen his ties with the black community.</p> \n  <p>He\u2019s tweaked his famously consistent message to specifically address race and racial justice. Even in his landslide defeat, Sanders showed signs of strength with young black voters, and he has continued to cultivate his support with this constituency, organizing on historically black colleges around his plans for free-college tuition and a Green New Deal.</p> \n  <p>All of these efforts will face their first real test in South Carolina, the first primary contest featuring a majority black electorate.</p> \n  <p>Recent polling shows Sanders within striking distance of <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, who has portrayed the state as his \u201cfirewall\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Biden is still favored to win the Palmetto State , but if Sanders can breach his \u201cfirewall\u201d it may be the beginning of his march to the nomination. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e55981d8f08e1332474a2a5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T00:40:18.270Z\">12.40am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Here\u2019s the format of tonight\u2019s debate</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The format of tonight\u2019s debate is very similar to past debates, with candidates receiving time for responses to direct questions and rebuttals to opponents\u2019 answers.<br></p> \n  <p>Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions, and moderators will decide when to award candidates 45 seconds for rebuttals.</p> \n  <p>CBS News has said candidates will not make opening or closing statements, but all the debate participants will get a closing question, which will likely be used as a sort of final pitch to voters.</p> \n  <p>We are about 20 minutes away from the first question, so stay tuned. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e55b78d8f086a28115b294b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T00:35:25.917Z\">12.35am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Bernie Sanders\u2019 </strong>allies are pushing back against <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/02/sanders-obama-primary-challenge/606709/\">an Atlantic report</a> that the Vermont senator considered a primary challenge against <strong>Barack Obama </strong>in 2012.</p> \n  <p>According to the Atlantic, Sanders was seriously considering launching a White House bid against the Democratic president and had to be talked out of it by then-Senate majority leader <strong>Harry Reid.</strong></p> \n  <p>Sanders himself dismissed the story last night, saying it was \u201cnot true at all.\u201d But <strong>Joe Biden</strong>\u2019s campaign is already out with an ad highlighting the report:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J2pTaPtdZM\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J2pTaPtdZM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Patrick Leahy, </strong>a fellow Vermont senator who reportedly spoke with Sanders about his plans in the summer of 2011, said he did not \u201crecall\u201d discussing the subject:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1232456672204840960\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sen.

The stakes are high for him. He\u2019s generally polled further behind his rivals in national polls, and his campaign struggled through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. </p> \n  <p>But recent polling has shown Steyer faring better in South Carolina. He\u2019s averaging in <a href=\"https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/election/article240100868.html\">third place</a> going into Tuesday\u2019s debate. </p> \n  <p>Steyer has been directing his recent attacks at both Sanders and Biden. One ad warns Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialist plans won\u2019t beat <strong>Trump</strong>\u201d and that nothing would change in a Biden administration. The ad then pivots to Steyer\u2019s work helping \u201cblack and brown communities\u201d.</p> \n  <p>In essence, the ad is an encapsulation of how the former hedge fund manager has approached South Carolina: pick at Biden\u2019s base while also contrasting himself with Sanders. He\u2019s likely to go after both candidates during Tuesday\u2019s debate. </p> \n  <p>Steyer is hoping it will do more than place him behind two other candidates on election night. In an interview with NBC Nightly News set to air Tuesday night, Steyer said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get third place in South Carolina. I want to win South Carolina.\u201d </p> \n  <p>\u201cI am pushing as hard as I can to see as many people and push as hard as I can to move forward in South Carolina because I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d Steyer added. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a diverse state.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from me tonight after the 10th Democratic debate, the last debate before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. Here are some key takeaways from the night: Early in the night, Bernie Sanders was the main target of his opponents\u2019 attacks, but the frontrunner then seemed to fade into the background as the debate repeatedly devolved into bickering. The Vermont senator\u2019s status as the one to beat in the nominating contest appears to be unchanged. The CBS News moderators were sharply criticized for their inability to maintain control of the debate as candidates tried to wrest control of the discussion by shouting over each other. A number of commentators also bemoaned the lack of questions on key issues like climate change and immigration. Republicans reveled in the \u201cchaos\u201d of the night, dismissing all the Democratic candidates as unworthy of ascending to the Oval Office. Coming off his disastrous first debate performance last week, Mike Bloomberg faced the lowest expectations of any candidate but still managed to inflict some damage upon himself. For example, Bloomberg said in response to criticism from Elizabeth Warren that he was \u201cprobably wrong\u201d to make sexist jokes about his employees. The candidates repeatedly tried to address racial issues in light of Saturday\u2019s primary in South Carolina, where more than half the Democratic electorate is African American. Most notably, Joe Biden promised to nominate an African-American women to the Supreme Court. But the direct appeals to black voters from the seven white candidates on stage struck some critics as blatant pandering. Thanks for following along with our debate coverage, and tune back in tomorrow morning for more of the Guardian\u2019s live analysis of the 2020 election. MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews pushed Elizabeth Warren on her accusation that Mike Bloomberg told an employee to \u201ckill it\u201d when he learned of her pregnancy. But as previously noted, the woman\u2019s accusation, which Bloomberg denied, is well documented: Wondering why Bloomberg didn\u2019t do so badly this time? It may be due to his debate prep (although it didn\u2019t seem to help too much): An aide to Pete Buttigieg said the presidential candidate had canceled a planned trip to Florida because he is sick. During tonight\u2019s debate, the former Indiana mayor could be heard coughing and sneezing as other candidates delivered their answers. Speaking to the Guardian\u2019s Oliver Laughland in Charleston, Tom Steyer defended his record on private prisons. \u201cI worked to get rid of any use of private prisons,\u201d Steyer said of his activism in his home state of California. \u201cWe successfully did it.\u201d During the debate, Joe Biden attacked Steyer, who is rising in the South Carolina polls, for previously investing in a private prison system. \u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve thought for 15 years, long before other people were talking about it,\u201d Steyer said on his opposition to private prisons. \u201cI made the right decision, and I\u2019ve been working on it ever since.\u201d Asked by another reporter whether he would reconsider his candidacy if he fell short in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, Steyer would not give a clear answer. The billionaire activist predicted the primary in South Carolina, where more than half of Democratic voters are African-American, would provide a \u201ccourse correction\u201d in the race. During the debate, Pete Buttigieg condemned the \u201crevolutionary politics of the 1960s\u201d, in an implicit dig at Bernie Sanders. The former Indiana mayor also tweeted and then deleted a tweet in which he said the US \u201ccan\u2019t afford a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950\u2019s and Bernie Sanders with his nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960\u2019s.\u201d Buttigieg repeated the line again when he spoke to reporters in the debate spin room. But the \u201crevolutionary politics\u201d of the 60s include the civil rights movement and the Stonewall riots. In South Carolina, during Black history month, the comments came off as tone deaf. The Sanders campaign picked up on Buttigieg\u2019s point, as well. Nina Turner, a top Sanders surrogate, addressed the former South Bend mayor in a tweet: \u201cCheck your history!\u201d Buttigieg has previously been criticized by LBGTQ+ activists. As The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reported earlier this month, \u201cButtigieg may be the first openly gay candidate to sweep the national stage and perform as well as he has in Iowa and New Hampshire, but more and more young queer voters say they feel he is not representative of them or their experiences.\u201d Pete Buttigieg has canceled a planned trip to Florida, which will hold its primary on 17 March. Buttigieg\u2019s campaign sent a memo to donors earlier today that seemed to downplay expectations for Super Tuesday, which appears to be very favorable for frontrunner Bernie Sanders. The Buttigieg campaign said its strategy was to \u201cminimize Sanders\u2019 margins on Super Tuesday\u201d, but that may not be enough to halt Sanders\u2019 march toward the nomination. Even while Joe Biden\u2019s campaign celebrated his debate performance tonight, the former vice president\u2019s advisers were struggling to explain his outlandish claim about being arrested trying to see Nelson Mandela. Biden has repeatedly claimed in the past month that he was arrested while trying to visit the late South African leader in prison. The New York Times reported last week: But if Mr. Biden, then a United States senator from Delaware, was in fact arrested while trying to visit Mr. Mandela, he did not mention it in his 2007 memoir when writing about a 1970s trip to South Africa, and he has not spoken of it prominently on the 2020 campaign trail. A check of available news accounts by The New York Times turned up no references to an arrest. South African arrest records are not readily available in the United States. Andrew Young, a former congressman and mayor of Atlanta who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations from 1977 to 1979, said that he had traveled with Mr. Biden over the years, including to South Africa. But Mr. Young said that he had never been arrested in South Africa and expressed skepticism that members of Congress would have faced arrest there. Now Biden\u2019s campaign is claiming the former vice president was referring to how he was separated from fellow Congress members during the trip: There wasn\u2019t a single question from the CBS moderators on climate change tonight, and it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Most notably, Bernie Sanders has quote retweeted Alexandria Ocasio Cortez after she called its absence from the debate \u201chorrifying\u201d. However, Tom Steyer has been acknowledged for bringing it up nonetheless: Steyer also seems to have a good source of information for his latest climate crisis coverage Elizabeth Warren ended the debate by invoking Matthew 25 \u2014 as she\u2019s done many times before. \u201cIn as much as ye have done to one of these, the least of my brethren, ye have done it unto me,\u201d she quoted, when asked what she considers her motto. Warren has evoked the Gospel of Matthew many times, but she\u2019s far from the only Democratic candidate to do so. As the Associated Press\u2019 Elana Schor reported last week, the biblical passage is a favorite for Dems. Pete Buttigieg evoked Matthew in a political ad, saying in a voice over: \u201cWhatever happened to, \u2018I was hungry and you fed me? I was a stranger and you welcomed me?\u2019\u201d Cory Booker referenced it when he was still in the running. Barack Obama, back in 2008, referenced Matthew. And a political action committee that helped Obama\u2019s campaign that year was dubbed the Matthew 25 Network. The gospel\u2019s message is a way to speak to Democrats\u2019 progressive ideas of building up the social safety net while trying to connect with and appeal to a solid bloc of Christian voters. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said it saw its best online fundraising day since the former vice president launched his White House bid. Biden is counting on a win in South Carolina to reinvigorate his campaign after dismal performances in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second-place finish in Nevada. Biden predicted during tonight\u2019s debate that he would win Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. If he does, the money he raises today will help him try to compete against frontrunner Bernie Sanders on Super Tuesday next week. Here are the final speaking times for each candidate now the debate is over, via the New York Times\u2019 live tracker. What\u2019s most noticeable is how much less time Elizabeth Warren spoke for this time. As the final table for last week shows, she was down by four minutes tonight, putting her in fourth place. Viewers may have noticed the boisterous cheers and applause for Mike Bloomberg. The debate audience clapped enthusiastically when Bloomberg mentioned a gun control group he founded. They also booed Bernie Sanders \u2014 Bloomberg\u2019s biggest competition. The display prompted some viewers to wonder if the billionaire candidate had stacked the audience. After all, the Bloomberg has paid Instagram influencers to promote his candidacy and paid people to text their friends to drum up support. But the Democratic National Committee\u2019s communications director clarified that each candidate is allocated the same number of tickets. \u201cNo one is packing the debate hall,\u201d said the DNC\u2019s Xochitl Hinojosa. \u201cThis is how conspiracy theories get started.\u201d But Bloomberg was able to boost his message outside the debate hall: by running campaign ads during the commercial breaks. In a post-debate interview, Bernie Sanders repeated his final debate answer, arguing his policy proposals are not radical because other countries have already adopted them. \u201cThe truth is, nothing I am saying is radical,\u201d Sanders said. The Vermont Senator also once again stood by his flattering comments on Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy programs, while condemning the \u201cauthoritarian\u201d leader\u2019s regime. But Sanders\u2019 comments have attracted some criticism from fellow Democrats, including this freshman House member who was born in Poland during the Cold War: Joe Biden used his final debate answer to pledge that he would nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court. The unexpected promise -- which is likely meant to win over voters before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, where more than half of the 2016 electorate was African American -- was quickly praised over Twitter: But far-right commentator Ann Coulter seized on Biden\u2019s promise to try to dissuade white male Democrats from supporting the former vice president: Here\u2019s how some viewers have been responding to tonight\u2019s debate on Twitter, starting with Andrew Yang, who until recently was on the stage. Like many, he wasn\u2019t happy with CBS\u2019 moderation: Republicans are celebrating the chaotic nature of tonight\u2019s debate, which featured many moments of Democratic candidates yelling over each other to be heard. The Trump campaign called the debate a \u201chot mess,\u201d and the chairwoman of the Republican National Commitee said the night proved none of the candidates deserve to be president. The 10th Democratic debate has concluded, but the blog will have more updates and analysis coming up, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters praised his final answer on the biggest misconception about himself. The Vermont senator, who has been criticized by some of his opponents for being too far left for the Democratic Party, pushed back against the notion that his ideas are \u201cradical.\u201d Sanders said his proposals exist \u201cin one form or another\u201d all around the world. The moderators\u2019 last question is a bizarre two-parter: what is the biggest misconception about you, and what is your motto? There have been some funny answers, such as when Amy Klobuchar said the biggest misconception about her was that she is \u201cboring.\u201d But most candidates have used the odd question to deliver an unofficial closing statement. Most notably, Joe Biden pledged to put an African American woman on the Supreme Court, prompting loud applause from the South Carolina audience. Elizabeth Warren has remained focused on bringing down Mike Bloomberg \u2014 and has largely avoided bringing down frontrunner Bernie Sanders, whose support she needs to chip away at if her campaign is to remain viable. The question is: Why? So far, Bloomberg has served as a good foil to Warren, who has been equating him with the New York businessman currently occupying the White House. But strategically, it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll sway moderates who support Bloomberg. It\u2019s almost as if Warren is more worried about stopping the billionaire former mayor than stealing the progressive vote. It could be that Warren\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t want to risk directly taking on Sanders again. The last time the two progressive senators clashed, progressives were left feeling betrayed and confused. Earlier tonight, Mike Bloomberg criticized Elizabeth Warren after she called on him to release more employees from non-discloure agreements. \u201cWith this senator, enough is never enough,\u201d Bloomberg said. Some of Warren\u2019s fans celebrated the flippant comment over Twitter, and it has now been turned into campaign merch. Responding to a question on Middle East policy, Bernie Sanders called Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201ca reactionary racist.\u201d The Vermont senator added that he would consider moving the US embassy in Israel back to Tel Aviv after Trump moved it to Jerusalem. Sanders argued the United States\u2019 Middle East policy should focus on \u201cprotecting the independence and security of Israel, but you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people.\u201d As the debate moderators questioned Democratic presidential candidates about the proper response to coronavirus, Trump weighed in over Twitter. According to the White House pool report, the Democratic debate is similarly being played on the televisions on Air Force One as the president returns from India. Here are the latest speaking times for each candidate via the New York Times: The moderators questioned Bernie Sanders about his flattering comments on the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Sanders once again said Castro supported some positive policies, such as literacy programs, which prompted boos from the audience. \u201cReally? Literacy programs are bad?\u201d Sanders said. Pete Buttigieg tried to pick up the criticism by saying Democrats would not win by spotlighting the \u201cbright side of the Castro regime,\u201d but the attack was largely lost in a flurry of crosstalk with Sanders. Elizabeth Warren used a question on whether to allow Chinese firms to build parts of American technological infrastructute to bash Michael Bloomberg for not releasing his tax returns. \u201cWe know that Mayor Bloomberg has been doing business with China for a long time, and he is the only one on this stage who has not released his taxes,\u201d Warren said. \u201cHe plans to release them after Super Tuesday. It is not enough to say just trust me on this.\u201d Bloomberg responded by saying he would release his tax returns \u201cin a couple of weeks,\u201d but that would mean they are not available until after Super Tuesday. Chaos is still one of the main themes of tonight\u2019s Democratic debate, although the bickering has died down slightly since it first erupted earlier tonight. But candidates are still going over time on their answers, being abruptly cut off, and speaking over one another. Some former Obama administration officials are praising Joe Biden\u2019s debate performance, but they have one suggestion: stop yelling. CBS News\u2019 Gayle King has asked the night\u2019s first question about the coronavirus after two days of stock market losses because of the health threat. King asked senator Amy Klobuchar whether she would close borders to Americans who have been exposed to the virus. Klobuchar responded by saying that the focus needs to be on helping infected Americans. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna give you my website, I\u2019m going to give the CDC\u2019s site, it\u2019s cdc.gov,\u201d the Minnesota senator said. Some viewers have spotted quite an overstatement from Joe Biden: Mike Bloomberg was the first candidate to bring up the coronavirus after two days of steep stock market losses due to fears about the spreading health threat. But the CBS News moderators have not yet asked any questions about coronvirus, which has not escaped the attention of Twitter commentators. Meanwhile, the virus has now reached into the ranks of the US military: Here\u2019s where tonight\u2019s Democratic debate stands so far: It\u2019s looking like a good night for Bernie Sanders, who has often faded into the background as his opponents bicker and yell over each other. The Vermont senator\u2019s frontrunner status currently appears safe. The CBS News moderators have been criticized for failing to keep the debate on track as candidates try to seize the stage by launching into answers when they have not been addressed. Elizabeth Warren once again criticized Mike Bloomberg for his reported history of making sexist comments, so the billionaire has not escaped scrutiny after his widely panned debate performance last week. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. While the last debate was defined by the heavy blows the candidates were landing on each other, this one has so far been defined by its disorderly chaos. Ironically, it\u2019s also the first debate to be sponsored by Twitter which, as some have noted, it is increasingly starting to resemble. Asked about his anti-junk food campaign as mayor of New York, Mike Bloomberg said the policy may not work well for the entire country. Bloomberg noted New York \u201cisn\u2019t like all other cities, otherwise you would have a Naked Cowboy in every city.\u201d The billionaire candidate\u2019s obviously pre-written jokes are attracting some mockery on Twitter: The moderators appear to be trying to take back control of the debate after candidates spent the first hour cutting each other off and yelling to deliver answers. As Pete Buttigieg tried to interject himself into the discussion, CBS News\u2019 Margaret Brennan told him to \u201chonor the rules of the debate.\u201d Questions are being asked about how tickets were made available for tonight\u2019s debate. Some reports suggest that certain tickets were priced between $1,750 - $3,200. Some are saying that might account for the unexpected enthusiasm being shown for billionaire candidate Bloomberg ... Mike Bloomberg tried to make a joke about his widely panned debate performance last week by suggesting he actually did a great job pushing back against his opponents. But the joke was poorly timed and did not appear to land with the Charleston audience: Did Mike Bloomberg fall prey to an unfortunate Freudian slip earlier, and say he bought 21 Democratic seats in 2018? Donald Trump Jr has already jumped on the moment, but watch the clip and decide for yourself (it happens just towards the end): There is a sense of desperation to tonight\u2019s debate, as candidates repeatedly cut each other off to launch attacks at each other. Here\u2019s how much each candidate has spoken tonight, via the New York Times\u2019 live tracker: Once again turning their attention to frontrunner Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg criticized the frontrunner for not supporting an elimination of the Senate filibuster. \u201cHow are we going to deliver a revolution if you won\u2019t even support a rule change?\u201d Buttigieg asked. Eliminating the Senate filibuster would lower the threshold required to pass legislation, and the proposal has another high-profile supporter -- Donald Trump. The debate moderators are coming in for a lot of heat tonight. Viewers\u2019 criticisms have included the lack of control over the bickering candidates, and the fact no-one has yet been asked about the global panic over coronavirus. Bernie Sanders was asked why he voted to protect gun manufacturers from legal liability, which other candidates have criticized him for. Sanders initially tried to pivot to criticizing Joe Biden for his record on trade deals, which prompted boos from the Charleston audience. \u201cI have cast thousands of votes, including bad votes,\u201d Sanders then said. \u201cThat was a bad vote.\u201d Elizabeth Warren has so far directed more criticism at Mike Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders, the frontrunner in the primary race. As another progressive senator, Warren will likely need to pick off some of Sanders\u2019 supporters to have any chance of the nomination. But Warren cannot criticize Sanders\u2019 agenda too harshly -- because it aligns so closely with her own -- so she has decided to continue slamming the billionaire former mayor of New York. While tonight\u2019s debate hasn\u2019t been quite as fierce as last week\u2019s, it has featured the most cross-talk, shouting and overall bickering. At one point the candidates spoke over one another for about 20 seconds as they argued over the cost of Bernie Sanders\u2019 healthcare plans. And it\u2019s not just the candidates on stage \u2013 the audience is also far more vocal and unruly than before: Joe Biden just went after Tom Steyer for his past support for private prisons, a clear effort to stop the billionaire activist\u2019s rise in the South Carolina polls. Biden pointed to Steyer\u2019s past investment in a private prison system to argue he was not in sync with Democratic voters on criminal justice. Steyer responded by saying he no longer supports private prisons, which prompted Biden to give him a new nickname: \u201cTommy come lately!\u201d It\u2019s round two of Warren v Bloomberg, and this time it\u2019s just as personal as it was last week. Similar to her first attack on the billionaire media mogul in the previous debate, Warren started off by highlighting one of the disturbing remarks Bloomberg allegedly made to a female employee in 1995 (which he denies): Warren has also gone after Bloomberg over his electability with Democratic voters, and whether they can trust him: Elizabeth Warren was asked for evidence to back up her accusation that Mike Bloomberg responded to news of an employee\u2019s pregnancy by telling her to \u201ckill it.\u201d But the claim has been thoroughly reported: Asked about reports of his sexist comments, Mike Bloomberg said he was \u201cprobably\u201d wrong to make jokes that sparked complaints against him. Elizabeth Warren used her first answer to criticize Bernie Sanders, but she has now turned her attention to Mike Bloomberg, who she targeted in the last debate. \u201cI don\u2019t care how much money Mayor Bloomberg has,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThe core of the Democratic Party will never trust him. He has not earned their trust. I will.\u201d Warren then resurrected reports of Bloomberg\u2019s history of sexist remarks, specifically an allegation that the billionaire responded to news of an employee\u2019s pregnancy by telling her to \u201ckill it.\u201d Bloomberg denied the claim and criticized the senator for once again raising the issue of his company\u2019s non-disclosure agreements, accusing Warren of continually moving the goalposts. Amy Klobuchar was just been asked her first question of the night. But while the other candidates have been going back and forth over the last eighteen minutes, it\u2019s the first chance she\u2019s had to speak. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar both agreed \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d the controversial policy supported by Mike Bloomberg while he was New York\u2019s mayor, was racist. \u201cI\u2019m conscious of the fact that there are seven white people on this stage talking about racial justice,\u201d Buttigieg added. \u201cStop and frisk\u201d has been repeatedly criticized for unfairly targeting young men of color. Bloomberg has apologized for supporting the policy, but his controversial record on race could be an issue in the South Carolina primary, where more than half of voters were African American in 2016. Asked about his declining support among African American voters, Joe Biden expressed confidence he would win Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary. Biden noted polls indicate he still leads the Democratic field with black voters. \u201cI\u2019ve worked like the devil to earn the vote of the African American community,\u201d Biden said. The former vice president then unequivocally predicted he would be victorious on Saturday. \u201cI will win South Carolina,\u201d Biden said. Elizabeth Warren has taken aim at Bernie Sanders tonight. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s tried to contrast herself with him, but it\u2019s definitely her sharpest rebuke of the senator yet. And it hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed: Everyone is clearly focusing their attacks on Bernie Sanders tonight after his landslide victory in Nevada. Elizabeth Warren used her first debate answer to try to distinguish herself from her fellow progressive senator. \u201cBernie and I agree on a lot of things, but I think I\u2019d be a better president,\u201d Warren said, arguing she would be the best option to implement a progressive agenda. \u201cProgressives have one shot, and we need to spend it on a leader who will get something done,\u201d Warren said. Mike Bloomberg used his first debate answer to criticize Bernie Sanders over recent reports that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to help his campaign. Trying to recover from his disastrous first debate performance, Bloomberg said Russia\u2019s efforts showed Sanders is the weakest candidate Democrats could put up against Trump. \u201cThat\u2019s why Russia is helping you get elected so you\u2019ll lose to [Trump],\u201d Bloomberg said. Moderators Norah O\u2019Donnell and Gayle King kicked off the debate by explaining the rules and underscoring the signficance of tonight\u2019s event. King called the debate the \u201clast, best chance for candidates to make their case\u201d to South Carolina and Super Tuesday voters. The first question went to Bernie Sanders, who was asked how he would reassure voters concerned the democratic socialist would halt the country\u2019s economic growth. Sanders said the economy was working well for \u201cMr Bloomberg and other billionaires\u201d but not everyday Americans, lamenting the country\u2019s stagnant wage growth. Sanders pledged to create an economy that works for American families and not just the wealthy few. If you want to see for yourself how much trouble Joe Biden is in at the moment \u2013 and how much Bernie Sanders is surging \u2013 then you can take a look at this graph from Real Clear Politics, which aggregates all the reliable primary polls (Sanders is in blue and Biden is green). Going back to the December 2018 it shows just how spectacular and how sudden Biden\u2019s fall has been. You can see the full interactive graph for yourself here. The tenth Democratic debate, the last debate before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday, is now under way. With minutes to go before things kick off here in Charleston, the spin room is in a mild degree of panic as the WiFi, provided by the DNC, has been down for over an hour. As such, I\u2019m now in a grand ballroom behind the debate stage, with a few hundred panicking journalists, scrambling to figure out how they\u2019ll file stories. Luckily, here at the Guardian, we\u2019re supported by a crack team in Washington and New York who are taking my words straight off my phone. We\u2019ll see what happens when things kick off, but this is already seeming like a bit of a logistical meltdown as crews of DNC tech support people continue to swarm around their a single laptop to get it fixed. In a new memo to donors, Pete Buttigieg\u2019s campaign appears to be lowering expectations for Super Tuesday. If Sanders\u2019 opponents cannot sufficiently slow his momentum between Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and next week\u2019s Super Tuesday contests, the Vermont senator could be unstoppable. After all, winning generally begets more winning in presidential primaries, and Sanders\u2019 opponents need to start landing victories if they want to stop him from running away with the nomination. The 10th Democratic debate is about 10 minutes away, so here is how you can watch the candidates face off for the last time before the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday. Tonight\u2019s debate is hosted by CBS News and the Congressional Black Caucus Institute, so it can be watched on CBS stations and streamed on CBSN, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. The moderators of the debate are CBS Evening News anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell and CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King, and three other CBS correspondents \u2013 Margaret Brennan, Major Garrett and Bill Whitaker \u2013 will join them in questioning the candidates. The debate is scheduled to run for two hours and will kick off shortly, so stay tuned. Tonight\u2019s debate, at the Galliard Center in downtown Charleston, is taking place just a few dozen feet from the Mother Emanuel AME church. This historic building, built in the early nineteenth century, is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the southern United States and has long been a centre for resistance against white supremacy and racism in South Carolina. In 1822, its founder Denmark Vesey was a lead organizer in a planned slave revolt, and the church was a hub of activity during the civil rights era. It was also the site of the 2015 church massacre, when a white supremacist terrorist murdered nine black churchgoers in a mass shooting that shook the nation and led to the then Republican governor Nikki Haley to remove the confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse. As such, it\u2019s likely the legacy of that horrific terror attack will be referenced at a number of policy junctures at tonight\u2019s debate -- namely the candidates\u2019 plans for gun control and what they hope to do to combat the rise in white nationalist terror in the US. A few candidates are going into tonight\u2019s debate still bruised from last Wednesday\u2019s clash in Las Vegas. Elizabeth Warren managed to land two of the night\u2019s biggest blows on Mike Bloomberg, who was roundly attacked by everyone on stage. Her first attack came right at the start of the night, when she highlighted his previous remarks about women: Warren later rounded on Bloomberg once again, and called on him to release all the women who had signed NDAs with him: But these weren\u2019t the only big clashes of the night. Biden also went after Bloomberg over his stop and frisk policy while mayor of New York. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar repeatedly went up against each other. Warren went after everyone over their healthcare plans. Bernie Sanders suggested Bloomberg shouldn\u2019t exist. And Bloomberg slammed Sanders for owning three homes while also being a socialist. In 2016, Bernie Sanders rolled into South Carolina with the wind at his back. He\u2019d fought Hillary Clinton to a virtual tie in Iowa - no small feat for a little-known senator running a longshot presidential campaign. Then he trounced Clinton in New Hampshire, which neighbors Vermont. There was chaos at the Nevada caucuses, which Clinton won by a narrower-than expected margin. But then came South Carolina. Defeat was resounding. The margin \u201374% to 26% \u2013 was so wide that there would be no spinning the result. Sanders won only 14% of the black vote there, compared to Clinton\u2019s 86%, according to exit polls. It was a KO from which Sanders never recovered. Even though the race dragged on for several more months, South Carolina was Clinton\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d But Clinton lost to Trump and Sanders effectively never stopped running for president. And in the intervening years, he spent much more time in the south, investing in the community there and making efforts to strengthen his ties with the black community. He\u2019s tweaked his famously consistent message to specifically address race and racial justice. Even in his landslide defeat, Sanders showed signs of strength with young black voters, and he has continued to cultivate his support with this constituency, organizing on historically black colleges around his plans for free-college tuition and a Green New Deal. All of these efforts will face their first real test in South Carolina, the first primary contest featuring a majority black electorate. Recent polling shows Sanders within striking distance of Joe Biden, who has portrayed the state as his \u201cfirewall\u201d. Biden is still favored to win the Palmetto State , but if Sanders can breach his \u201cfirewall\u201d it may be the beginning of his march to the nomination. The format of tonight\u2019s debate is very similar to past debates, with candidates receiving time for responses to direct questions and rebuttals to opponents\u2019 answers. Candidates will have one minute and 15 seconds to answer direct questions, and moderators will decide when to award candidates 45 seconds for rebuttals. CBS News has said candidates will not make opening or closing statements, but all the debate participants will get a closing question, which will likely be used as a sort of final pitch to voters. We are about 20 minutes away from the first question, so stay tuned. Bernie Sanders\u2019 allies are pushing back against an Atlantic report that the Vermont senator considered a primary challenge against Barack Obama in 2012. According to the Atlantic, Sanders was seriously considering launching a White House bid against the Democratic president and had to be talked out of it by then-Senate majority leader Harry Reid. Sanders himself dismissed the story last night, saying it was \u201cnot true at all.\u201d But Joe Biden\u2019s campaign is already out with an ad highlighting the report: Patrick Leahy, a fellow Vermont senator who reportedly spoke with Sanders about his plans in the summer of 2011, said he did not \u201crecall\u201d discussing the subject: The 10th Democratic debate is just 30 minutes away. Here is a refresher on who will be on stage tonight: Bernie Sanders, the definitive frontrunner in the presidential primary who will likely be the top target for his opponents tonight after his landslide victory in Nevada last week. Joe Biden, the former vice president who is counting on a victory in South Carolina to reinvigorate his campaign after disappointing performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who suffered a disastrous debate performance last week and will need to improve tonight before Super Tuesday, on which his candidacy depends. Pete Buttigieg, the former Indiana mayor who performed well in Iowa and New Hampshire but needs to prove he can win in more racially diverse states. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who was widely praised for her debate performance last week but needs to start turning those plaudits into votes as soon as possible. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator who exceeded expectations in New Hampshire but finished in single digits in Nevada last week as she struggles to attract voters of color. Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who is returning to the stage tonight after failing to qualify for the Nevada debate and has been climbing in the South Carolina polls. Those seven candidates will soon take the stage, so stay tuned. For weeks, billionaire Tom Steyer has been pouring campaign resources into South Carolina, hoping to rally conservative Democrats and African American voters away from former vice-president Joe Biden and toward him. And now he has one more big opportunity to contrast himself not only with Senator Bernie Sanders, the new frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary, but also Biden. Steyer did not qualify for the last Democratic debate but Tuesday night he will rejoin his rivals on the stage in South Carolina. The stakes are high for him. He\u2019s generally polled further behind his rivals in national polls, and his campaign struggled through the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. But recent polling has shown Steyer faring better in South Carolina. He\u2019s averaging in third place going into Tuesday\u2019s debate. Steyer has been directing his recent attacks at both Sanders and Biden. One ad warns Sanders\u2019 \u201csocialist plans won\u2019t beat Trump\u201d and that nothing would change in a Biden administration. The ad then pivots to Steyer\u2019s work helping \u201cblack and brown communities\u201d. In essence, the ad is an encapsulation of how the former hedge fund manager has approached South Carolina: pick at Biden\u2019s base while also contrasting himself with Sanders. He\u2019s likely to go after both candidates during Tuesday\u2019s debate. Steyer is hoping it will do more than place him behind two other candidates on election night. In an interview with NBC Nightly News set to air Tuesday night, Steyer said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to get third place in South Carolina. I want to win South Carolina.\u201d \u201cI am pushing as hard as I can to see as many people and push as hard as I can to move forward in South Carolina because I think it\u2019s really important,\u201d Steyer added. \u201cIt\u2019s a diverse state. There are a lot of black people here, there are a lot of Latinos here. I think I\u2019m talking directly to them about the issues that matter and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to keep trying to do.\u201d The candidates are gathered in Charleston tonight in advance of Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary, but a much more crucial test awaits them on Tuesday. Next week, 16 states and territories will hold contests for Super Tuesday, when more than 1,300 delegates will be awarded to the presidential candidates. (As a reminder, candidates need 1,991 delegates to clinch the nomination.) Although nearly five months remain until the Democratic convention, more than 60% of all delegates will be awarded by 17 March, so the next few weeks will be critical in determining the eventual nominee. That tight timeline has led many establishment Democrats to express panic that Bernie Sanders may soon gain an insurmountable delegate lead. Tonight is the last debate before Super Tuesday, so it may be the final opportunity for Sanders\u2019 opponents to throw some roadblocks in his path to the nomination. Joe Biden has long portrayed South Carolina as his \u201cfirewall,\u201d fortified by his support among black voters and particularly older black voters. But after disastrous performances in Iowa and New Hampshire \u2013 overwhelmingly white electorates that Biden said did not reflect the diversity of his support \u2013 and a distant second-place in Nevada, South Carolina has emerged as a must-win for the former vice president who was recently overtaken by Bernie Sanders as the frontrunner. According to several recent surveys, Biden has been bleeding support in South Carolina, so much so that he\u2019s started to say that the state is not his campaign\u2019s \u201cfirewall.\u201d An NBC News/Marist poll released yesterday showed Biden leading Sanders by just 4 points in South Carolina. Tom Steyer, the billionaire from California, has gained ground on Biden in recent weeks by spending heavily on advertising in the state. After missing a debate, Steyer qualified on Tuesday. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is you have Steyer spending hundreds of millions, tens of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars, out campaigning there,\u201d Biden said in an interview on CBS News\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cAnd so I think a lot is happening in terms of the amount of money being spent by the billionaires to try to cut into the African American vote. I think that has a lot to do with it.\u201d In the interview, Biden refused to \u201cpontificate\u201d on whether a second- or first-place finish is necessary for his campaign, though many Democrats believe a win is essential to his survival at this point. Firewall or no firewall, Biden was defiant: \u201cI\u2019m going to go all the way through this thing.\u201d Of the seven candidates on stage tonight, no one needs a strong showing more than Mike Bloomberg. The billionaire former New York mayor suffered a disastrous performance in last week\u2019s debate, his first appearance on stage since launching his campaign in late November. Bloomberg fumbled his responses to obvious lines of attack, such as his past support for \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d and his reported history of making sexist comments. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a worse showing for a presidential candidate appearing in his first debate than the one Mr Bloomberg had last week,\u201d the New York Times wrote. Bloomberg is not actually competing in the South Carolina primary, instead focusing on the 16 states and territories that will hold contests on Super Tuesday next week. However, if Bloomberg cannot improve upon his last debate performance, it may cost him votes in crucial states like California and Texas, which will each award hundreds of delegates on Tuesday. Bloomberg has previewed his strategy in recent days, releasing a digital ad criticizing Bernie Sanders\u2019 record on gun control and accusing the frontrunners\u2019 supporters of deploying divisive rhetoric. The billionaire is hoping those attack lines will land tonight. Otherwise, his campaign may turn out to be a $500m mistake. Good evening, live blog readers! The tenth Democratic debate has arrived, marking the third debate this month and the second in a week. However, the dynamics of the race have shifted since the candidates faced off last week in the most contentious debate of the election cycle yet. Bernie Sanders has cemented his status as the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination after a landslide victory in Nevada, where he defeated second-place Joe Biden by 27 points. A number of commentators have said Sanders could gain an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday next week, meaning this may be the last chance for the Vermont senator\u2019s opponents to slow his momentum. Sanders will likely find himself on the receiving end of a number of attacks, and his effectiveness at responding could determine his success in Saturday\u2019s South Carolina primary and beyond. The candidates will take the stage in Charleston at 8 pm ET, so stay tuned.",

      "bodyText": "A young boy in Hubei province has witnessed his grandfather die and remained at home alone afterwards because of coronavirus restrictions, according to local media. The news of the child\u2019s ordeal prompted an outpouring of anger online in China. In Zhangwan district in the city of Shiyan, which has implemented \u201cwartime control\u201d to prevent the spread of the virus, local community workers on Monday afternoon found an elderly man surnamed Tan who had died at home. His five or six-year-old grandson was also at home, Guo Ruibing, vice deputy director of the publicity department of Zhangwan district, told local media. The official did not confirm details posted online that the man had died several days earlier and that the grandson had survived on biscuits. When asked by community workers why he did not seek help, the child reportedly said: \u201cGrandpa said not to leave. There is a virus outside.\u201d Guo told Hongxing News, a government-affiliated media platform, that it was not possible that Tan had died days earlier. Under the lockdown measures in which residents cannot to leave their homes, community workers had been making daily visits to check on residents, asking for their temperatures and if they needed any food supplies. Guo said the time and cause of Tan\u2019s death was still being investigated. He said the grandson was being taken into care \u201caccording to procedure\u201d by the district. The child\u2019s father is in Guangxi province and because of the lockdown measures on the area cannot return. When asked whether Tan\u2019s temperature was normal before his death, Guo said: \u201cCertainly, it was normal.\u201d The news caused a flood of criticism online, underlining public frustration and mistrust. \u201cWhy do they always do such a crappy job of \u2018dispelling rumours\u2019?,\u201d one user on Weibo wrote, pointing out that the official could have used the community records to back up his statement. \u201cThe government always says, \u2018impossible\u2019 or \u2018absolutely\u2019 but who can believe you?\u201d Another blamed misinformation from the government, adding: \u201cThe reason why rumours are so common among the people is because they are so en vogue among the government.\u201d \u201cThe lesson from Wuhan is that you cannot trust them. You can only trust your own,\u201d one commenter posted. Earlier this month Zhangwan district was the first to implement official \u201cwartime\u201d quarantine measures in response to the coronavirus, which emerged in nearby Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. Commercial and residential buildings in Zhangwan were sealed and no unapproved outside cars could enter. Only healthcare workers and those providing essential supplies were able to be out on the streets, policed by public security. Local committee districts were to arrange food and medicine for residents. Those who broke the rules would be detained, an official notice said. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

The baboons \u2013 a 15-year-old male who was scheduled to have a vasectomy, and two females brought along to keep him calm \u2014 escaped in the car park of the Royal Prince Alfred hospital on Tuesday afternoon, causing localised alarm and widespread bafflement. Many questions were left unanswered after their swift recapture by staff from Taronga Zoo. Where did the baboons come from and how did they get out? The baboons are part of the national baboon colony at Wallacia, 68km west of the Sydney CBD, which supplies baboons for scientific testing. Information about the colony is scant \u2013 the number of baboons at the facility is not publicly available and animal welfare organisations told Guardian Australia that requests to tour the facility have been refused. Much of the medical research using the baboons is conducted at an animal research laboratory at the RPA. The vasectomy was due to be carried out by specialist vets in an area of the RPA set up for veterinary surgery. In a statement, NSW Health said it took the safety of animals and the public seriously. \u201cThe animals were uninjured and have now safely returned to veterinary care and their families.\u201d Colony management did not respond to requests for comment. Helen Marston, the chief executive of Humane Research Australia, said she believed the number of baboons at the colony was \u201cin the hundreds\u201d. Marston said she understood the baboons were kept in family groups in cages with some outside access, and \u201cwould have to be supplied with some environmental enrichment\u201d, such as tyre swings and food toys. All facilities involved in animal testing in NSW are inspected by authorities every four years. The details of those inspections are not published. There are other primate colonies in Australia that breed animals for research purposes: a colony of marmosets and macaques in Gippsland, Victoria; and a colony of owl monkeys in Queensland used in malaria research. These particular baboons are in a family group of seven \u2013 the three who escaped and four other females. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the group would be reunited on Friday, after the male\u2019s vasectomy, which was delayed by a day.

Marston said that even if these animals had not been used in animal testing, their offspring would have been. Emma Hurst, an Animal Justice Party MP from NSW, said the animals \u201cmay have undergone multiple experiments and been involved in multiple protocols\u201d over their lifetime. Hurst said she hoped the escape would draw attention to the lack of transparency around the use of animals in medical testing in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s possibly the least transparent animal-use industry that we have,\u201d she said. What do we know about the use of primates in medical testing? According to figures collated by Humane Research Australia, 272 primates were used in \u201cinvasive experiments\u201d in Australia in 2017. National figures are not compiled by any official body. South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT do not provide data. \u201cWe really do need the Australian government to collect these figures and provide them,\u201d Marston said. \u201cThere is no benchmark to see if we are increasing the number of tests, there\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just an estimate based on what we can get.\u201d The most common primate species used are baboons, macaques and marmosets. Australia does not allow medical or scientific testing on great apes. According to the latest NSW data, 38 primates were used in research in NSW in 2017. The total number of animals involved in animal testing and research in that state in 2017 was 2.63m, of which 1.7m were involved in \u201cenvironmental studies\u201d and 1.6m were described as tests with \u201cobservation involving minor interference\u201d. Animal testing and research in NSW is overseen by the 12-member Animal Research Review Panel, of which the director of the baboon colony is a member. According to its 2017-18 annual report, there are 166 accredited animal research establishments and 34 licensed animal suppliers in NSW. NSW Health said research on animals was subject to a \u201crigorous ethics process\u201d. \u201cAnimals are only used in medical research when it is scientifically warranted and there are no appropriate alternatives,\u201d NSW Health said. \u201cResearch using non-animal systems such as computer or cell-based systems are used as a replacement for animal research where possible.\u201d According to published scientific studies, compiled by the HRA, tests involving baboons at the RPA included: the testing of radioactive material on four baboons; a blood pressure study involving 109 baboons as part of research into the effects of hypertension in pregnancy; a study involving nine baboons where researchers attempted to induce preeclampsia, which resulted in the death of one mother and one baby baboon; and a study on shoulder injuries which involved the surgical cutting of the shoulder tendons of eight baboons that were then euthanised to allow post-mortem study of the healing process. The most controversial study involved the transplant of pig organs into baboons. Dr Kevin Coleman, a retired GP who also worked in public health, is a member of a group that opposes the continued use of animal experiments at RPA and holds regular protests at the hospital on the first Friday of the month. Coleman said he was concerned about the public health risks posed by xenotransplantation (the transplanting of organs from one species to another) in particular, and the animal testing in biomedical research more broadly. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases specialist from the Australian National University, has also raised concerns about the risk of zoonotic diseases from xenotransplantation. He told Guardian Australia those concerns were particularly relevant as the world grapples with another coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIf something is there [in the transplanted organ] that we don\u2019t know about, that could be not only a disaster for the person who has the transplant, that could be a public health crisis,\u201d Collingon said.",

So none of them really made a mark.</p> <p>Biden did himself no harm but did not deliver the sort of performance that could propel him into Super Tuesday and stunt Sanders\u2019s rise. Bloomberg looked bad enough that it should give African Americans serious doubts about whether to abandon Biden for him. Sanders won by not making any big mistakes and by offering a reasonable defense of his comments about Latin America, and Biden held his own on friendly ground in South Carolina.</p> <ul> <li><p>Art Cullen is editor of The Storm Lake Times in northwest Iowa, where he won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing.

Ahead of the first primary that tests the candidates\u2019 appeal to a significant black electorate in South Carolina, this came across as virtue signaling instead of meaningful engagement with the issues at hand. Candidates used Bloomberg\u2019s stop-and-frisk policy, for instance, to discuss virtually every racial inequality under the sun and plug various race-centric plans they are running on. Will black voters buy it? We\u2019ll soon find out. Malaika Jabali is a public policy attorney, writer and activist \u2018Sanders won an awful debate\u2019 What a wretched debate, two hours of shouting and interrupting and pandering from which it was hard to discern much sense. All that noise worked for Bernie Sanders. He remains the frontrunner because nobody else made a point. The others had their chance to bash him as a Fidel Castro sympathizer, but didn\u2019t manage to pull it off. None took him down over healthcare, since it appears to be the issue that has driven him to the front. Elizabeth Warren would have ground Michael Bloomberg into dust over sexism (and failure to release his tax returns) if the moderators had allowed her. But the moderators had no control over candidates desperate to make a mark just before South Carolina and Super Tuesday. So none of them really made a mark. Biden did himself no harm but did not deliver the sort of performance that could propel him into Super Tuesday and stunt Sanders\u2019s rise. Bloomberg looked bad enough that it should give African Americans serious doubts about whether to abandon Biden for him. Sanders won by not making any big mistakes and by offering a reasonable defense of his comments about Latin America, and Biden held his own on friendly ground in South Carolina.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Afghanistan\u2019s national security council announced on Monday that all air travel to and from Iran <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-middle-iran-denies-cover-up-qom-refugees\">had been suspended</a> and borders had been closed.</p> \n<p>However, an estimated 3,000 people cross between Iran and Afghanistan illegally every day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-middle-iran-denies-cover-up-qom-refugees\">Coronavirus fears grip Middle East as Iran denies cover-up</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Oral swabs have been sent from Herat to Kabul\u2019s central public health laboratory for testing.

The room buzzes with chatter, as Collins \u2013 who says she has been awake and working since 5.30am, when she fashioned a makeshift eye mask out of her dressing gown cord and got into a taxi \u2013 summons various members of her team.</p> <p>It is little wonder Collins lives a double life. In 2011, the former car salesperson joined the cast of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-only-way-is-essex\" title=\"\">The Only Way Is Essex</a>, the wildly popular ITV reality soap opera, in which real people from Essex play themselves in plotlines and scenarios invented by the show\u2019s producers (succinctly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/28/towie-itv-transformed-brentwood-essex\" title=\"\">described </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/sep/28/towie-itv-transformed-brentwood-essex\" title=\"\">by one comedian</a> as \u201ca never-ending hen night mixed with Waiting for Godot\u201d).

We then head to a local cafe, where she holds open the door for me. On the way there, the zingers continue to flow like prosecco in an Essex nightclub. \u201cI was supposed to be going to China this month, but, with the coronavirus, I don\u2019t wanna risk it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThen again, when it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s your time.\u201d She sounds somewhere between a reality star and Julia Davis in Nighty Night.</p> <p>Collins is warm and open. As we wait for our mugs of hot chocolate, a fan stops to ask her what she is doing here. She tells him about our interview and they natter until our drinks arrive. She is a far cry from the woman denounced in the tabloids for her supposedly monstrous conduct. \u201cGemma Collins\u2019 \u2018extreme diva behaviour forces Dancing on Ice staff to work through lunch\u2019,\u201d reads one headline. Another says: \u201cGemma Collins, you\u2019re going to be single for ever if you don\u2019t stop being a dating diva\u201d, claiming that, \u201cif she really wants to find love, she should stop being so awful\u201d to men. A third headline reads: \u201cGemma Collins labelled a \u2018rude bitch\u2019 as she kicks camera crew out of shop during Diva Forever premiere,\u201d after she asked a crew filming her for a reality show to leave her Brentwood boutique. For every instance where she has been portrayed as rude or arrogant, there are another 10 headlines about her body, her weight or her fertility. \u201cGemma Collins \u2018will have a surrogate because she doesn\u2019t want to put on weight\u2019\u201d claimed one story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbe5e9a850254a040d2d50f16a87cce3bc45beb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbe5e9a850254a040d2d50f16a87cce3bc45beb7/0_0_4254_3031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Collins and Matt Evers on Dancing on Ice in 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing a routine with the professional skater Matt Evers on Dancing on Ice in 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Frost/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere was a time where I just thought: \u2018This is all getting a bit much,\u2019\u201d she says of the tabloid coverage. \u201cI had to grow a very thick skin very fast. I think that\u2019s where the GC came about.\u201d It may seem difficult to tell the GC and Collins apart, but for her the differences are clear. \u201cI try not to bring any attention to myself. I like to cook, I like nature, I like to read. I do like to shop, don\u2019t get me wrong, every now and then. I like a good day out in London, but, yeah, they are two very different people \u2013 massively.\u201d Her close friends, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t even ask about the GC. But when my best friend drops her kids at school, people in the playground ask her: \u2018What\u2019s she like?\u2019 That\u2019s the million-dollar question that everyone wants to know. The truth is, in day-to-day life, I\u2019m just grinding like everyone else.\u201d</p> <p>It must be extraordinarily difficult to keep \u201cGemma Collins\u201d going in the face of a media industry that wants headlines. Her partner, James Argent \u2013 known as Arg \u2013 also appeared on Towie and his problems with addiction have featured in gossip columns in recent years. A few weeks after we meet, Collins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/missgemcollins/status/1229056428855435264\">posts on Twitter</a> about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-the-sparky-presenters-death-is-a-stomach-churning-shock\" title=\"\">the tragic death of the Love Island host Caroline Flack</a>, commenting on her own experience of being \u201cpersonally hounded\u201d by a tabloid reporter.</p> <p>When we speak on the phone a few days later, Collins says that she has hardly stopped thinking about Flack. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows exactly what went on, but it did affect me, because I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me. It\u2019s easy for someone to say: \u2018Ignore it, it will go away tomorrow,\u2019 but it can have huge implications on a person, and a lot of time what [the papers are] saying isn\u2019t true.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThe press is a double-edged sword in this industry, but I hope everyone is going to be a lot more mindful and respectful regarding celebrities \u2013 we\u2019re doing a job.\u201d She thinks that perhaps it\u2019s time for \u201ca rethink\u201d where Love Island is concerned. \u201cOr maybe they should pull it off air. They\u2019ve had three people pass \u2013 it\u2019s got a taint over it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now 39, Collins was working at a BMW showroom when she was approached about appearing on Towie. She had always been a performer; she went to the highly competitive Sylvia Young theatre school in London in her teens, where alumni include Amy Winehouse and Rita Ora. Even so, she thought the offer to join the nascent reality show was a wind-up. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my 30th birthday and the producers called me up and said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a right character; will you come into the office?\u2019 I thought someone was messing about, so I put the phone down twice. The third time, they said: \u2018Gemma, we\u2019re not messing about; here\u2019s our email address.\u2019\u201d Collins had a hunch that this was not just any old offer. \u201cIt was like someone stood next to me and whispered in my ear: \u2018Your life is about to change.\u2019 All the hairs stood up on my neck; I was like \u2013\u201d She gasps for effect. \u201cIt was one of them moments where you\u2019re like: who was that? I\u2019m in some twilight zone.\u201d Collins is an avid proponent of \u201cangels and stuff\u201d, something she expands on via her podcast, where she has tackled subjects including \u201cWhat animal was I in a past life?\u201d, \u201cWho do I need to call to become the Illuminati?\u201d and whether houses have feelings. She says she believes in the supernatural \u201c1,000%\u201d and that a future episode of the show will involve going to a haunted house \u00e0 la <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/derek-acorah-obituary\" title=\"\">Derek Acorah</a>, the medium from the TV show Most Haunted, whose death in January left Collins \u201cdevastated\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps her belief in fate and destiny is a way to rationalise how she has gone from earning \u00a350 a day on Towie to amassing a fortune estimated at \u00a33m. Collins was born in Romford, on the border of London and Essex, to a working-class family \u2013 her parents, Alan and Joan, and her older brother, Russell \u2013 that she describes as \u201cvery grounded\u201d. Even now, her dad, who has watched only one episode of Towie, keeps an eye on her finances for her (\u201cHe called me last Christmas and was like: I can\u2019t believe you spent \u00a32,000 in Harrods\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1ac01d3d9b5838f14c39e5e7de108654b5765c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1ac01d3d9b5838f14c39e5e7de108654b5765c6/0_615_5947_3567/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018People can look down all they want, but there\u2019s a lot of successful people in Essex\u2019 ...

My dad had to do an extra shift in the pub to put shoes on my feet. I used to go round my nan\u2019s and she\u2019d have HP sauce in the cupboard and a bit of bread \u2013 I\u2019d have an HP sauce sandwich and it was the best times ever. There wasn\u2019t luxuries.\u201d Reading between the lines, it seems to have informed Collins\u2019s relentless work ethic: as well as her boutique, she has her own perfume, Diva Pink, and <a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">a clothing line for the</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\"> retaile</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">r Boo</a><a href=\"https://www.boohoo.com/womens/looks/gemma-collins\" title=\"\">hoo</a>. She even lists her castoffs on <a href=\"https://www.depop.com/gemmacollins/\" title=\"\">the online marketplace Depop</a>; items recently for sale included a camisole from Missguided (\u00a37) and a New Look T-shirt (\u00a35).</p> <p>Collins is also far more understated than the GC when it comes to material goods. The GC, she says, would love to be \u201ccruising around in a Bentley\u201d; Collins just bought a used car (\u201cThree years old, so it had already depreciated in value\u201d) and was papped last year driving her sister-in-law\u2019s Nissan Micra (\u201cThe papers kindly said the car was worth \u00a3695 \u2013 it was more like \u00a3395\u201d). \u201cPeople just think I lay in bed every day with people fanning me down or bathing in asses\u2019 milk like Cleopatra,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case: I work, I work and I work.\u201d</p> <p>I wonder what it must be like for Collins to have two personas. Is everyday life ever overwhelming? \u201cI\u2019ve been to shopping centres before where people all start crowding round. They get excited, obviously, but when I go to the shopping centre, I\u2019m not the GC. I\u2019m just there with my mum, and then I\u2019ll have had so many selfies that I\u2019m like: shit, I\u2019ve left the shop and I\u2019ve not got what I\u2019ve needed to get. Some days I do just want to go to the market with my friends, but then people will be like: what\u2019s she doing at the market?\u201d</p> <p>She is keen to emphasise that she is always happy to interact with fans, but she thinks they can cross a line. \u201cSometimes they bark at you like a rottweiler: give us a picture, give us a picture ... all they have to say is: \u2018All right, Gem, how are you? Can I have a picture?\u2019 and I\u2019d be like: yeah, course. When they start grabbing and mauling it, it\u2019s a bit ... it\u2019s scary, you know? I would never say that to someone, or pull someone.\u201d Ever the stoic, she describes such interactions as like \u201cloading the dishwasher. It\u2019s just a part of life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af8ae927198e2cc46ecc28526a97f7981cb7df92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af8ae927198e2cc46ecc28526a97f7981cb7df92/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gemma Collins visits a doctor with Jonathan Cheban (left) for her show Gemma Collins: Diva Forever\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Visiting a doctor with the reality star Jonathan Cheban <em>(left)</em> for her 2019 show Gemma Collins: Diva Forever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Collins calls herself the \u201cunderdog\u201d of Towie \u2013 and it is easy to see why. \u201cSomeone said to me once: you know, it just don\u2019t stack up \u2013 you\u2019re the fat one, you\u2019re not the most prettiest, but you\u2019ve been the most successful,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like: that\u2019s charming!\u201d</p> <p>Criticism of her image was one thing, but Towie also provoked a classist brand of disdain among audiences and critics alike, who reached for a decades-old cliche of Essex\u2019s inhabitants as coarse and uncultured. How did Collins react to this wave of criticism? \u201cI was very proud to come from Essex, at the end of the day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a lot of lovely people in Essex \u2013 just look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/25/gavin-and-stacey-christmas-special-review-absolutely-crackin\" title=\"\">Gavin and Stacey</a>.

      "bodyText": "\u2018You get the wig on, you put the lipstick on, you get the big eyelashes on and that\u2019s the GC,\u201d says Gemma Collins, explaining her alter ego. \u201cIt\u2019s like Paul O\u2019Grady when he does Lily Savage ... But when I\u2019m not working, I don\u2019t wear a scrap of makeup.\u201d It is hard to imagine that today, as the GC strikes a pose in a photo studio laden with rails of clothes. A makeup artist, a hairdresser, a photographer and multiple agents fan around her. \u201cPull down my sleeve, Jeff!\u201d she calls out to her stylist. The room buzzes with chatter, as Collins \u2013 who says she has been awake and working since 5.30am, when she fashioned a makeshift eye mask out of her dressing gown cord and got into a taxi \u2013 summons various members of her team. It is little wonder Collins lives a double life. In 2011, the former car salesperson joined the cast of The Only Way Is Essex, the wildly popular ITV reality soap opera, in which real people from Essex play themselves in plotlines and scenarios invented by the show\u2019s producers (succinctly described by one comedian as \u201ca never-ending hen night mixed with Waiting for Godot\u201d). In the 10 years since, she has become a titan of British pop culture, a bombastic blonde known for hilarious one-liners, calamitous public falls (disappearing down a trapdoor at a Radio 1 event, for example) and over-the-top demands of the people who work for her. In August, she launched a podcast with BBC Sounds, which zoomed straight to the top of the iTunes chart, completing her transformation from bit-part actor on reality TV to the biggest podcaster in Britain. Now on its second series, the Gemma Collins Podcast is a riot of bizarre chat, hilariously meandering stories and motivational speeches. \u201cI think it\u2019s been one of my most proudest jobs that I\u2019ve done in my career, to be honest, because I get to be myself on it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not really overly scripted or directed, it\u2019s like: right, what do you want to talk about this week?\u201d It also means connecting with her audience on a closer level: she offers unbridled body positivity (\u201cJust be you \u2013 if you just be you, nothing can go wrong,\u201d she implored listeners in a recent episode) and an agony aunt section, in which she advises listeners on their life and relationship woes. \u201cDear Deidre, eat your heart out!\u201d she says with a laugh, although it is clear that she has embraced the role. \u201cI\u2019m here for a reason and I think it\u2019s to reach out to people \u2013 whether that\u2019s to give people a little bit of confidence if they\u2019re having a terrible day, or to give them advice, or just to make them laugh.\u201d As I wait for her to finish the photoshoot, she gestures to a pink fleece blanket in the studio and tells me to put it on in case I am cold. We then head to a local cafe, where she holds open the door for me. On the way there, the zingers continue to flow like prosecco in an Essex nightclub. \u201cI was supposed to be going to China this month, but, with the coronavirus, I don\u2019t wanna risk it.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThen again, when it\u2019s your time, it\u2019s your time.\u201d She sounds somewhere between a reality star and Julia Davis in Nighty Night. Collins is warm and open. As we wait for our mugs of hot chocolate, a fan stops to ask her what she is doing here. She tells him about our interview and they natter until our drinks arrive. She is a far cry from the woman denounced in the tabloids for her supposedly monstrous conduct. \u201cGemma Collins\u2019 \u2018extreme diva behaviour forces Dancing on Ice staff to work through lunch\u2019,\u201d reads one headline. Another says: \u201cGemma Collins, you\u2019re going to be single for ever if you don\u2019t stop being a dating diva\u201d, claiming that, \u201cif she really wants to find love, she should stop being so awful\u201d to men. A third headline reads: \u201cGemma Collins labelled a \u2018rude bitch\u2019 as she kicks camera crew out of shop during Diva Forever premiere,\u201d after she asked a crew filming her for a reality show to leave her Brentwood boutique. For every instance where she has been portrayed as rude or arrogant, there are another 10 headlines about her body, her weight or her fertility. \u201cGemma Collins \u2018will have a surrogate because she doesn\u2019t want to put on weight\u2019\u201d claimed one story. \u201cThere was a time where I just thought: \u2018This is all getting a bit much,\u2019\u201d she says of the tabloid coverage. \u201cI had to grow a very thick skin very fast. I think that\u2019s where the GC came about.\u201d It may seem difficult to tell the GC and Collins apart, but for her the differences are clear. \u201cI try not to bring any attention to myself. I like to cook, I like nature, I like to read. I do like to shop, don\u2019t get me wrong, every now and then. I like a good day out in London, but, yeah, they are two very different people \u2013 massively.\u201d Her close friends, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t even ask about the GC. But when my best friend drops her kids at school, people in the playground ask her: \u2018What\u2019s she like?\u2019 That\u2019s the million-dollar question that everyone wants to know. The truth is, in day-to-day life, I\u2019m just grinding like everyone else.\u201d It must be extraordinarily difficult to keep \u201cGemma Collins\u201d going in the face of a media industry that wants headlines. Her partner, James Argent \u2013 known as Arg \u2013 also appeared on Towie and his problems with addiction have featured in gossip columns in recent years. A few weeks after we meet, Collins posts on Twitter about the tragic death of the Love Island host Caroline Flack, commenting on her own experience of being \u201cpersonally hounded\u201d by a tabloid reporter. When we speak on the phone a few days later, Collins says that she has hardly stopped thinking about Flack. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely devastating,\u201d she says. \u201cNo one knows exactly what went on, but it did affect me, because I remember a time when a reporter hounded me every three hours \u2013 it was like they hated me. It\u2019s easy for someone to say: \u2018Ignore it, it will go away tomorrow,\u2019 but it can have huge implications on a person, and a lot of time what [the papers are] saying isn\u2019t true.\u201d She sighs. \u201cThe press is a double-edged sword in this industry, but I hope everyone is going to be a lot more mindful and respectful regarding celebrities \u2013 we\u2019re doing a job.\u201d She thinks that perhaps it\u2019s time for \u201ca rethink\u201d where Love Island is concerned. \u201cOr maybe they should pull it off air. They\u2019ve had three people pass \u2013 it\u2019s got a taint over it.\u201d Now 39, Collins was working at a BMW showroom when she was approached about appearing on Towie. She had always been a performer; she went to the highly competitive Sylvia Young theatre school in London in her teens, where alumni include Amy Winehouse and Rita Ora. Even so, she thought the offer to join the nascent reality show was a wind-up. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was my 30th birthday and the producers called me up and said: \u2018We\u2019ve heard you\u2019re a right character; will you come into the office?\u2019 I thought someone was messing about, so I put the phone down twice. The third time, they said: \u2018Gemma, we\u2019re not messing about; here\u2019s our email address.\u2019\u201d Collins had a hunch that this was not just any old offer. \u201cIt was like someone stood next to me and whispered in my ear: \u2018Your life is about to change.\u2019 All the hairs stood up on my neck; I was like \u2013\u201d She gasps for effect. \u201cIt was one of them moments where you\u2019re like: who was that? I\u2019m in some twilight zone.\u201d Collins is an avid proponent of \u201cangels and stuff\u201d, something she expands on via her podcast, where she has tackled subjects including \u201cWhat animal was I in a past life?\u201d, \u201cWho do I need to call to become the Illuminati?\u201d and whether houses have feelings. She says she believes in the supernatural \u201c1,000%\u201d and that a future episode of the show will involve going to a haunted house \u00e0 la Derek Acorah, the medium from the TV show Most Haunted, whose death in January left Collins \u201cdevastated\u201d. Perhaps her belief in fate and destiny is a way to rationalise how she has gone from earning \u00a350 a day on Towie to amassing a fortune estimated at \u00a33m. Collins was born in Romford, on the border of London and Essex, to a working-class family \u2013 her parents, Alan and Joan, and her older brother, Russell \u2013 that she describes as \u201cvery grounded\u201d. Even now, her dad, who has watched only one episode of Towie, keeps an eye on her finances for her (\u201cHe called me last Christmas and was like: I can\u2019t believe you spent \u00a32,000 in Harrods\u201d). \u201cWe was really poor growing up,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe it when I say it.\u201d She mentions an appearance on the Jonathan Ross Show last year, where she mentioned that the family didn\u2019t have a toaster in their kitchen when she was growing up. \u201cPeople sort of laughed like I was joking around, but I\u2019m not: it\u2019s the truth. My dad had to do an extra shift in the pub to put shoes on my feet. I used to go round my nan\u2019s and she\u2019d have HP sauce in the cupboard and a bit of bread \u2013 I\u2019d have an HP sauce sandwich and it was the best times ever. There wasn\u2019t luxuries.\u201d Reading between the lines, it seems to have informed Collins\u2019s relentless work ethic: as well as her boutique, she has her own perfume, Diva Pink, and a clothing line for the retailer Boohoo. She even lists her castoffs on the online marketplace Depop; items recently for sale included a camisole from Missguided (\u00a37) and a New Look T-shirt (\u00a35). Collins is also far more understated than the GC when it comes to material goods. The GC, she says, would love to be \u201ccruising around in a Bentley\u201d; Collins just bought a used car (\u201cThree years old, so it had already depreciated in value\u201d) and was papped last year driving her sister-in-law\u2019s Nissan Micra (\u201cThe papers kindly said the car was worth \u00a3695 \u2013 it was more like \u00a3395\u201d). \u201cPeople just think I lay in bed every day with people fanning me down or bathing in asses\u2019 milk like Cleopatra,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case: I work, I work and I work.\u201d I wonder what it must be like for Collins to have two personas. Is everyday life ever overwhelming? \u201cI\u2019ve been to shopping centres before where people all start crowding round. They get excited, obviously, but when I go to the shopping centre, I\u2019m not the GC. I\u2019m just there with my mum, and then I\u2019ll have had so many selfies that I\u2019m like: shit, I\u2019ve left the shop and I\u2019ve not got what I\u2019ve needed to get.

The tax and spending thinktank says the government is on track to borrow about \u00a363bn next year \u2013 \u00a323bn more than the most recent official forecasts.

Schools could close and travel around the UK might be restricted under stepped-up government plans to deal with the coronavirus as its spread accelerates across Europe. Switzerland, Austria and Croatia are among countries that have reported their first cases and the death toll has risen in Italy to at least 11. At least a dozen schools across the UK have sent students and staff into self-isolation at home after they returned from virus-hit northern Italy. Plans have been announced to test flu patients in an attempt to spot whether Covid-19 is spreading in Britain. In Geneva, Dr Bruce Aylward, head of the WHO-Chinese mission to Wuhan, called for countries to \u201cprepare for a potential pandemic\u201d by readying hospital beds, isolation zones and respirators. He said hundreds of thousands of people did not get Covid-19 because of China\u2019s aggressive response but other nations were \u201csimply not ready \u2026 Access the expertise of China. They have done this at speed and they know what they are doing. They are really, really good at it.\u201d You can find the latest updates at our live blog. * * * IFS call to raise taxes in budget \u2013 The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should fund Boris Johnson\u2019s spending promises with tax rises in next month\u2019s budget, rather than entrench austerity or break Conservative election promises by increasing borrowing. The tax and spending thinktank says the government is on track to borrow about \u00a363bn next year \u2013 \u00a323bn more than the most recent official forecasts. It says the Tories are heading towards breaking their election pledge to balance day-to-day government spending with tax income by the middle of the current parliament. To help balance the books Sunak could abolish entrepreneurs relief, which costs \u00a32.3bn and only benefits as few as 5,000 individuals, and reform council tax to target the most expensive homes, says the IFS. Tory MPs who wrested \u201cred wall\u201d seats from Labour are warning Sunak not to \u201cclobber\u201d their blue-collar communities with a mooted rise in fuel duty. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Democratic candidates have bickered and shouted over each other in a series of chaotic exchanges in the final debate before the South Carolina presidential primary and Super Tuesday contests. Bernie Sanders bore the brunt of criticism from a number of his centrist rivals including Joe Biden, who has declared he intends to win in the state on Saturday and pledged to nominate an African American woman to the supreme court if elected. &gt; A coalition of business, politicians and campaigners is demanding the government stamp out the \u201ccurse\u201d of those single-use plastic sachets used for everything from ketchup to shampoo \u2013 855bn of which are discarded every year globally, often unopened and enough to cover the entire surface of the Earth. &gt; At a Labour leadership hustings in Manchester, frontrunner Sir Keir Starmer has come under sustained fire from Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy over what Nandy called Labour\u2019s \u201ctone deaf\u201d approach to Brexit in the general election. Starmer rejected this analysis, saying that \u201cfairly or unfairly, rightly or wrongly\u201d, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was the number one issue on the doorstep, as well as what he called \u201cmanifesto overload\u201d. The race to succeed Corbyn is intensifying as party members start to cast their ballots. &gt; The singer Duffy has broken a lengthy absence from public life with an Instagram post saying she had been drugged, held captive and raped over a number of days and had spent a long time recovering. Duffy did not give details but said she planned to post a spoken interview explaining her story. &gt; Seagulls are more likely to peck at discarded food if a person pretends to eat it before dropping it, researchers have found. This was established using some flapjacks in blue wrappers, a supply of blue sponges and a pair of sunglasses. * * * \u2018Corridor nursing\u2019 \u2013 A&amp;E units are so overcrowded that growing numbers of patients have to be looked after in hospital corridors, with nurses and doctors warning of the risks of harm.

It was eventually bricked up and covered with wooden panelling \u2013 but not before someone put in a large 1950s-era Osram lightbulb marked \u201cHM Government Property\u201d that still lit up when amazed historians got in and flicked the switch. Experts working on the restoration found the passage when they noticed a tiny keyhole, had a key made and swung the panelling open.

Sports Australia will be there. And so will we, covering that, as well as everything else that happens. Whatever that may be. Except legislation, because that doesn\u2019t seem to be something that is happening at the moment. Not a lot on the agenda. A very big thank you to Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Mike Bowers and Katharine Murphy and all the moderators, producers and Guardian brains trust members for all that they do. And to you. If you need me before tomorrow, I\u2019ll be here and here. Until then \u2013 take care of you. The leftwing Peter Dutton (because leftwing apparently covers anything from the left to the right, according to the home affairs minister) didn\u2019t explain his leftwing terrorism is Islamic terrorism comments today, but that is par for the course of the most secretive department in this nation, which just gets more and more power, almost unchecked. The Senate has set up an inquiry into domestic violence. From Rex Patrick\u2019s office: The inquiry will examine the existing programs undertaken and funded by the Australian government, state and territory governments and non-government organisations to reduce family violence. This examination will inform the committee in its primary focus of identifying what needs to be done and the resources required to drive and achieve real change to prevent violence against women and their children. Linda Burney talks about the vigil for Hannah Clarke with Patricia Karvelas: We all thought it was very appropriate, given the shocking circumstances of Hannah and her children and the way in which it\u2019s touched all Australians. To hold something here in the parliament, as you say, in the nation\u2019s capital, it will be a very simple vigil, candles and flowers and a song and some speakers. But it\u2019s got another purpose and that\u2019s to remind people the scourge of domestic violence happens every day, every hour, every minute for thousands of women across this country. And we\u2019re remembering women and children that have been touched by this terrible abuse. The leaders are attending. It\u2019s a bipartisan event, where, for a rare occasion, politics are being put to the side. As seen by Mike Bowers: Matt Canavan, the former resources minister, tells Patricia Karvelas he knows buttloads (the technical term) of farmers who are against the National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. Well, actually, I\u2019ve been inundated with support from farmers about their rejection and disagreement with the NFS\u2019s position. I think I\u2019m solely on the side of future farming in this country, the development of our nation. The CSIRO report that the Labor party relies on in this debate to say net zero emissions is achievable, that report says agricultural production would experience substantial decline under a net zero emissions model. That\u2019s just to offset all the carbon emissions that will occur in cities and people flying around, you have to plant lots of trees. That will cost thousands of jobs in regional Australia. The Labor party have long since deserted support for workers. It\u2019s not just for mining workers, or the manufacturing sector, it\u2019s also all in the food industries as well. Not just on farm, the jobs in sugar mills, the cotton gins, the meat processing facilities. Those are good paying regular jobs that I want to defend. I mean, the resources sector and mines have never, ever impacted farming in this country. No. Of course not. There is plenty of water to go around. Plenty of it. It\u2019s all great. Matt Canavan has found another camera. The senator for Queensland hasn\u2019t been more than 10 metres away from a camera since resigning from the cabinet during the latest Barnaby Joyce leadership challenge. The cruel summer continues. A vigil will be held for Hannah Clarke and her children in parliament tonight. I think we all know which way Zed Seselja went when it came to Malcolm Turnbull. Asked about the former prime minister\u2019s climate warning, the ACT senator says: Well, look, I guess I agree with the former PM, Malcolm Turnbull, on one thing, when he made a point of saying that former PMs who hung around and gave lots of ongoing commentary on current events weren\u2019t all that useful. And Malcolm has a different view than he had when he was in government. I noticed some of his commentary over the summer referring to the bushfire crisis when there were bushfires when he was PM and he pointed out that no single weather event could be attributed directly to climate change. He\u2019s changed his views since he left government. Good luck to him. But we\u2019re going to get on with what are very, very strong targets, what is very, very strong action, whether it\u2019s in the delivery of renewable energy, the 50% per capita. Patricia Karvelas: You\u2019re saying he\u2019s a hypocrite? ZS: No. You can make commentary as you like. I\u2019m just pointing to the facts. PK: So you\u2019re saying that he\u2019s got a different view to the one he had when he was PM? ZS: It would clearly appear so. Patricia Karvelas is questioning Zed Seselja over the \u201cBack in Black\u201d budget boasts \u2013 which are now looking decidedly pink-faced, on ABC TV. Seselja says there is no way the government could have known what was coming. Including, the bushfires. We\u2019ve underestimated where our budget position would be over the last few years. And we have tended to overdeliver. No one could have foreseen the bushfire disaster we\u2019ve had on the back of drought, with coronavirus. As I say, we don\u2019t know where the final position will be but we are in a radically better position with a balanced budget already achieved in order to respond to all of these issues. We\u2019ve taken our fiscal responsibilities very seriously, whilst also seeking to grow the economy. So the Australian people can have great confidence that when we take spending decisions, we are very, very careful so that we can ensure that we can respond to these crises as they arise. Except the government was warned about a terrible bushfire season being due. It thought it was going to happen the season before. MPs have said that themselves. And then there were the former fire chiefs, who banded together to write a letter saying the bushfire season was going to be pretty terrible. But sure. . We are still working out how to call out rightwing terrorism as a country, though. Which is not being helped along by political leaders who find it difficult to find the words to do so. Bill Shorten is not letting robodebt go. He has left question time and released this statement: This directly contradicts the argument being made in court by government lawyers in defending the robodebt scheme against a class action brought by 11,000 Australians. Government lawyers on February 14 stated their policy in the robodebt class action was that the government does not owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care. Today in parliament Mr Morrison was asked by Labor: \u201cPrime minister, does the government owe a duty of care or not to Centrelink recipients.\u201d He responded with a rambling monologue prefaced by the statement: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the duty of care we have to the Australian people including those who depend on their social services payments.\u201d Who is lying about whether the victims of robodebt were owed a duty of care by their government \u2013 the Prime Minister or his lawyers? And will the prime minister match his talk inside the parliament by instructing his lawyers to amend their defence to confirm the commonwealth does owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care? All summer we\u2019ve heard revelation after revelation about the rorting of government grant programs. In the case of the sports rorts affair, the then sports minister Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office was found to have ignored the recommendations of her department and instead delivered grants in a way that would boost the Coalition\u2019s election prospects. The Greens senator Larissa Waters is now seeking a Senate order of continuing effect that would prevent that from happening again. The Greens want to compel ministers to provide an explanation to the treasurer if they award grants in a way that deviates from the advice of relevant officials. Such explanations would also be made public. \u201cFor weeks, the prime minister has refused to explain how funds allocated for sports facilities and infrastructure ended up going mostly to marginal seats,\u201d Waters said. \u201cColour-coded spreadsheets and funding for mates has replaced proper process and integrity. \u201cTaxpayer money is not just a slush fund for ministers to further their own interests. If a minister ignores the advice of officials, the public deserves to know why.\u201d But the government appears keen to kill off the Greens\u2019 proposal. Waters says the government, with One Nation support, is attempting to knock off the proposal and is blocking an attempt to postpone its consideration until tomorrow. Scott Morrison has raised the Malka Leifer case in his meeting with the Israeli president, Reuven Rivlin, in Canberra on Wednesday, ahead of court hearings this week. The two leaders expressed a \u201cstrong commitment\u201d to seeing justice for the victims of Leifer in a meeting that also canvassed the two countries\u2019 commitment to democracy and the rule of law. The six-year impasse over Leifer\u2019s extradition has also been raised by other MPs who met with the president, including Australia\u2019s former ambassador to Israel, Liberal MP Dave Sharma, and the Macnamara MP, Josh Burns. Rivlin has committed to emphasising the priority of the case when he returns home, and has told MPs he will meet personally with Israel\u2019s chief justice to try to progress the matter if it remains unresolved. Morrison said the meeting with Rivlin demonstrated the \u201cgreat friendship\u201d between Israel and Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a friendship between peoples; a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced,\u201d Morrison said. And question time ends. Scott Morrison says something to Anthony Albanese across the table and leaves. We have reached the inevitable conclusion of the Labor motion failing, and question time moves into a dixer to Karen Andrews. The punishment does not fit the crime. Croquet didn\u2019t do so well. \u201cAircraft sports\u201d, on the other hand, seem to be on the rise. Other MPs are taking the opportunity to hit Twitter As we go through the final stages of the divisions, the MPs take the chance to sledge each other. Richard Marles just accused the prime minister of being \u201cmore nervous than a baboon in Camperdown\u201d. Who says Australia has no culture. While it is interesting that there were 136 emails exchanged between Bridget McKenzie and Scott Morrison\u2019s office, it\u2019s important to keep it in perspective. On the one hand \u2013 the Australian National Audit Office found the prime minister\u2019s office made both direct and indirect representations about which projects should be funded. On the other, the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions and the ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. On 13 February Hehir told a hearing: \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister was the decision-maker ... If we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d Hehir concluded that the community sport infrastructure grant program was \u201cnot informed by appropriate assessment process and sound advice\u201d. Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese no longer be heard, which will pass, and then Labor will have another go, which will also be shut down, before we get to the final vote, where question time will resume for one or two more dixers. The motion (which will fail) I seek leave to move the following motion \u2014 That the House: 1) notes: a) the prime minister claims his only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was the passing of information by his office; b) the Audit Office found there were 136 emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office over a six-month period about the corrupt sports rorts scheme; c) the Audit Office also found the prime minister\u2019s office emailed Senator McKenzie\u2019s office about projects under the corrupt sports rorts scheme indicating \u201cthese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects\u201d; d) the Audit Office found the colour-coded spreadsheet was shared between Senator McKenzie\u2019s office and the prime minister\u2019s office; and e) in preparing his report, the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff and now secretary of his department relied on only one version of the colour-coded spreadsheet when there were dozens of versions; and 2) therefore, calls on the prime minister to: a) correct his repeated misleading statements to the parliament that only eligible projects were funded under the corrupt sports rorts scheme when paragraphs 4.32 and 4.33 of the audit of the scheme show 280 ineligible projects were funded; b) explain how his story can withstand the findings of the Audit Office; and c) explain why he has used taxpayer money as though it was his own personal marketing fund. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders over the sports grants affair. This is the document the opposition is referring to. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Why did his office received copies of the multiple versions of the colour-coded spreadsheet of the corrupt sports rorts affair program? Why did Mr Gaetjens rely on just one version of the spreadsheet when the auditor general said there were dozens. Did he ignore the other versions of the spreadsheet or was he not ever given them? Christian Porter tries to stop the question. But he probably should spend less time practicing his dixer replies (which are remarkably similar) and more time studying the standing orders, because you are allowed to ask the prime minister about inquiries he has instigated, involving the head of his own department. Morrison: As would be appropriate because it was a serious inquiry and I note that the head of prime minister and cabinet, Mr Speaker, he was able to have whatever document he sought to conduct the inquiry and the prime minister\u2019s office complied with all requests of the Secretary, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, what I can go back to highlight again, what the auditor general said about the matters of the leader of the opposition, settle down, settle down! What he said was for us to see that there was some driver in this that we would have to identify those representations that there was a bias and there was a correlation in what was in those representations and the outcome, he said that they did not see that. The auditor general has been quizzed on these very matters and he has found no correlation, Mr Speaker, with the representations that were made from my office with these outcomes. Mr Speaker, the leader of the opposition is trying to throw mud while he himself sits in an absolute swamp, Mr Speaker! We know that the leader of the opposition had a spreadsheet in his office when he ran a similar program which had a column on it that said Labor or Liberal, Mr Speaker. That is what he had and then he threw the rulebook away and gave the money to the project he wanted to. Morrison is made to withdraw his final remark, which I missed, but I think involved the word \u201chypocrite\u201d. Scott Morrison, who told journalists to settle down in a press conference lately, is now telling the opposition to settle down. Paul Fletcher says some things. On what? Who knows. There are words. Scott Morrison: I want to refer to the evidence provided by the ANAO to the committee ... he [the auditor general] says it was not the case that we could see that those which came directly from the prime minister\u2019s office were more successful than those that came from the local member\u2019s office. I hope that the leader of the opposition would be more truthful about these things. I would certainly hope that when he had to appear as a witness at the Labor committal conspiracy trial, Mr Speaker, that he was more truthful there. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister and it follows his extraordinary answer to my last question. The prime minister has said about the corrupt sports rorts affair program and said that: \u201cAll we did was provide information.\u201d Why did the office tell the [minister] and I quote: \u201cThese are the ones we think should be included in the list of approved projects.\u201d Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I repeat what I just said. I said that our office ... Mr Speaker, what I just said to the House in response to the last question, is that we passed on information about other funding options or programs relevant to project proposals and provided proposals based on representations made to us. Why does the leader of the opposition have an issue with the government talking to people in communities about what their priorities for community projects should be? Mr Speaker, what I know, and I make reference to my earlier answer, Mr Speaker, I and the auditor general reported that the leader of the Labor Party in response to the program ... There is also this (given that Melissa McIntosh was the Lindsay candidate at the time, not the MP) It\u2019s time for Just How Safe Are You with leftwing warrior, Peter Dutton. After all, as Dutton himself says: \u201cYou can use leftwing to describe everybody from the left to the right. \u201cI said today, I don\u2019t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians, then they are in our sights.\u201d One of the points of relevance is Scott Morrison\u2019s use of the \u2018member for Lindsay\u2019, given that the member for Lindsay at the time was Emma Husar. Morrison: I\u2019m happy to take the leader of the opposition\u2019s interjection, what I know about the member for Lindsay even if she isn\u2019t in this place she knew what was right, and guess what, Mr Speaker? The people of Lindsay agree with me. Because they elected the member for Lindsay because the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community. Morrison again brings up the auditor general report critical of Anthony Albanese released about 10 years ago. Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance, so Morrison ends with this: I have set out the role my office played, all I know is that when the leader of the opposition was a minister, he threw the book away and knowingly funded ineligible projects. You want to talk about corruption! Totally normal discourse. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison The prime minister has claimed his office\u2019s only involvement in the corrupt sports rorts scheme was to pass along information, why has the audit office told the Senate today there were 136 emails about sports rorts going back and forth between the prime minister\u2019s office and Senator McKenzie\u2019s office in under six months. Morrison: Neither I nor my office were decision-makers in the process that governs the sports grants program, the decision-maker as has been identified through the audit office was the sports master. As I stated at the [time], what prime ministers have always done is support their judgement and colleagues because I know they know what is best for their communities. I know the member for Petrie and the member for Boothby know best for their communities, the member for Lindsay knows what\u2019s best for her community. I know what is best for our communities right across the country. There is a back and forth over whether the prime minister is being relevant. Christian Porter is delivering the next dixer, but he appears to have practiced this once too many times in front of the mirror, because it seems a bit stale. The human vision board is entertaining the prime minister though, so he can count that as a brownie point. Tanya Plibersek to Scott Morrison: Why have nearly 140,000 apprentice and trainee places been lost under the seven-year-old government? Morrison: Thank you for your question about apprentices and the trends we are seeing in apprenticeship numbers and I am pleased to inform the House that in the 2019-20 budget the government provided $585m for skills measures to implement long needed reforms in the veteran sector and created up to 80,000 new apprenticeship places through the new incentive scheme, kicked off on July 1, 2019, which is after the period of the trends that the member is referring to. So the funding the government has put in place to do with these issues commenced and went in place from 1 July, 2019. Apprentices and their employees have readily taken up the new scheme with almost 6,000 additional apprentices signed up just the six months. I note that at the same time we have increased the funding when it comes to the vet sector, states and territories responsible for the delivery of that, including Tafe funding have withdrawn funding from $4bn in 2013 and down to $3.1m in 2017 The Commonwealth is stepping up a meeting up commitment to ensure we get more apprentices in place and to address the issues that the member has raised but I do note to compare and contrast, that when the Labor party was last in power, between 2011 \u2013 2013, Labor cut employer incentives to businesses that employ apprentices nine times, totalling $1.2bn and when the leader of the opposition was deputy prime minister, Labor cut $241m from incentives to encourage employers to take on apprentices and in 2012-13, the number of apprentices and trainees in training collapsed under Labor by 22%, or $110,000. I am not going to cop lectures from a Labor party that does not know how to manage money and run an economy and does not have a plan. Angus Taylor attempts to answer a question (he\u2019s a Rhodes scholar, don\u2019t you know) and the similarity to a test pattern is uncanny. We are investing in new and storage projects like Snowy 2.0 to make sure we have a secure, reliable grid. Yup. And you know what we need to make snowy viable? Katharine Murphy does: Josh Frydenberg ends his dixer with another attack on the \u201cwellbeing\u201d budget, which Jim Chalmers said Labor would look at delivering, at the same time as the budget budget. New Zealand has announced it will deliver one. It basically lists what the government is doing to tackle well-being issues impacting its population \u2013 things like mental health, suicide prevention, child welfare, indigenous welfare, homelessness and equality. Frydenberg thinks this is hilarious: Picture this alternative, the Member for Rankin is about to deliver his first wellbeing budget. He walks in, therefore, into the Chamber and robes are flowing. Incense is burning, Mr Speaker. These are in one hand and gone are the seats, gone are the benches, Mr Speaker and in their place, meditation mats for all, Mr Speaker. Meditation mats for all and the Member for Rankin stands up to address the Chamber to announce that his wellbeing tour has gone national, hugs for all, Mr Speaker! Hugs for all! There is a warning to every Australian, Mr Speaker, when the Member for Rankin provides him with a hug and a kiss he will take away their wallets. This is the same government that scrapped the women\u2019s statement in the budget (the one which worked out how the budget would impact women) under Tony Abbott (before Kelly O\u2019Dwyer insisted it be reinstated) so sure. Let\u2019s attack wellbeing. How about we kick some puppies into the sun a bit later? Maybe burn some kid\u2019s art? Adam Bandt delivers a question which covers War and Peace and everything in between, which just gives the prime minister carte blanche to talk about whatever he wants. Bandt: Now the coronavirus is hurting us as well. This is on top of the underemployment crisis in the country plus wage stagnation and an inequality crisis. With the risk of the economy heading towards recession and the Reserve Bank running out of bullets, will you back a Green New Deal to fight the threat of recession and lift public-sector wages to boost wage growth across the economy, will you start by at least $95 a week to encourage retail spending and invest $6bn to remove the grid bottlenecks holding back renewable energy investments and grow construction and manufacturing jobs?\u201d Scott Morrison: It would be a great relief that we are not going to adopt the policy of the Greens! It would be a great relief for the people, I cannot speak for the Labor party because they are known to like quite a few of the Greens ideas when it comes to economic policy so I do not think they can provide that same assurance.\u201d Morrison then wanders into dixer territory about why his government is the greatest government to govern ever in the history of governments. Julie Collins to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, why is the prime minister privatising aged care assessments? Greg Hunt gets the nod: We reject the proposition put forward by the member that is inaccurate, untrue, and it is false. I will make this point, what we are doing \u2026 is making sure we are having a system which actually delivers better, better outcomes for patients who are seeking to enter residential aged care or have some kind of aged care assessment, that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. In terms of the implementation we will work with states, I make this offer ahead of Coag at the end of this week, we are looking forward to working with the states in a constructive fashion, what the opposition are saying is that they will abandon the practice they had when they were in government on using non-government providers to assist with the assessment process, that\u2019s the change, or are they not? Here is the question for the opposition to take away from this, are they now saying they would abandon all of those current, non-government providers which were in place when they were in government, which they did not propose to change at the election, or is this a case of simply making it up as they go along? Because we know one thing, when they had the opportunity, only a few months ago, the current shadow minister was the current minister going into the election, they had a chance to invest in aged care, what did they provide for residential care, nothing. For home care, nothing, they know that we know that and the Australian public knows that. Michael McCormack\u2019s performance is so bad, even the Speaker alerts him to the concept of the inside voice. Can I assure the deputy prime minister his microphone is in good working order, so far. We were so preoccupied with whether or not we could turn a loaf of bread into a politician, we didn\u2019t stop to think if we should. Michael McCormack is now pretending to be a leader by acting as if he has just discovered hands and wants you all to know about it. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: The government social security law guide, which was released on 10 February this year, states Australian government employees have a duty of care to the public in performing their duties. But government lawyers on February 14 stated the policy in the robodebt class action does not owe Centrelink recipients a duty of care. Does the government owe a duty of care to Centrelink recipients? Morrison: The duty of care to the Australian people including those who depend on their social services payment which enables them to deal with the difficulties in their lives and at a time like this, when the country is facing some very difficult challenges \u2013 I refer to the impact of the bushfires and coronavirus which means more and more Australians because of the automatic stabilisers of social security payments which go to those impacted by the economic shocks we are now experiencing. What they deserve from a government is to be able to pay their bills and make sure we can make the payments we can make to them, as we have, and we make sure we do that, one of the ways, as a government, we have been able to make sure people can rely on the services of the essential government delivers with a Centrelink payers or other support payments, aged care payments as you need to know how to manage money, that means when you are making payments to those, you pay them If anyone is managing to pay their bills on Newstart, let me know. Scott Morrison answers a dixer on how amazing the government is as an economic manager by talking about Labor. Bill Shorten asks about the government\u2019s duty of care in regards to robodebt and Stuart Robert loses his mind: \u201cLet me say we will not be lectured on duty of care by those opposite who have presided over 1,200 deaths at sea and those opposite have the hypocrisy to...\u201d Tony Smith tells him to pull his head in and Robert\u2019s withdraws his comment. Robert again starts talking about the wonderful social safety net, so Shorten raises a point of order on direct relevance. Smith once again tells Robert to get on with it. Robert: The members question goes to technical legal matters before the court. It would be inappropriate to comment further when the matter is under actual judicial review. Labor groans. Remind you of anyone in Australian politics? I regret to inform you the Liberal party store $35 \u2018Back in Black\u2019 coffee mug, is now sold out. DEIDRE CHAMBERS Universities Australia chair Deborah Terry has just spoken at the National Press Club about the need for science and expertise to guide Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus and climate change, although she steered clear of political commentary when asked why some politicians refuse to believe the science. Terry had a few pointed lines on the issue of freedom of speech on campus: \u201cLast April, a review by a former high court chief justice [Robert French] found that claims of freedom of speech crisis were \u2018Not substantiated\u2019. But offered a guide for each university to consider how its existing policies breathed life into those freedoms. So, in the 10 months since, each university has carefully and thoughtfully mapped that guide against its own policies.\u201d Earlier today the education minister, Dan Tehan, spoke to the Universities Australia conference, and revealed the government would include freedom of speech in the school experience survey. Asked if the university sector would seek some form of federal funding to compensate for the impact of coronavirus, Terry responds that the first priority is the wellbeing of students, but does not rule out seeking assistance in future. She said: \u201cYes, in the background, we are looking at what the implications of it might be, [we\u2019re] doing some modelling in the background. But that is not what is taking up our time at the moment. It is too early to tell. It is too early to tell what effects some mitigating arrangements might have. It\u2019s too early to tell what, for instance, might be something that will come out of the fact that actually, our semester two starts earlier than the northern hemisphere teaching periods. So it\u2019s too early. What I want to say is here - our focus is on the students and what they need at the moment. They are our students. They are part of our community and we must keep our focus there.\u201d New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern will be in town later this week. She has already said she won\u2019t be \u201cwaggling\u201d her finger at Australia over our climate policies. I would expect Australia\u2019s immigration policies will come up, though. It is still a pretty big bone of contention that Australia is deporting people who may have been born in New Zealand but lived here their whole life, if they are imprisoned. Personally, I hope this is suitably brought up, and lauded: The health minister was also asked about the baboons: Greg Hunt: Other than the story as reported through the ABC, and it is where I\u2019d learned about the baboons, I don\u2019t have any extra information. My heart was with the baboons, I have to say. ... They operated as a modern relationship. And I\u2019m fine with that. Some more baboon content for you. Because we all need it. Turns out the baboon has six wives. If anyone hits me with a \u201cno wonder he was trying to escape\u201d joke, you too will be tarred with the boomer brush. It is the downhill slide into question time. Economy, economy, economy from both sides, will most likely be the order of the day. Greg Hunt says Australia has changed its travel advisory for northern Italy, because of the impact coronavirus is having in the region. To repeat, the Australian government, on medical advice, has lifted our travel advisory for northern Italy, in particular. That is exercise a high degree of caution \u2013 level two, of our travel advisory \u2013 for the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto. In addition, with regards to Iran, we have higher levels of travel advisory for non-medical reasons, but we have issued additional advice with regards to exercising a high degree of caution in relation to any travel to Iran, where we have had an increase in the numbers and significantly high number of deaths, which as the chief medical officer indicated yesterday, may be a strong guide that the number of cases is greater than those that have been reported. The Sydney baboons are in the mind of Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi, who wants the Senate to acknowledge the three who made a bid for freedom and also raise awareness of animal testing and research in Australia. This is her latest motion: The Senate will vote on the motion on Thursday. I give notice that on the next day of sitting, I shall move \u2013That the Senate: 1. Notes: a. Three baboons made a bid for freedom in Sydney this week, b. The baboons were from a colony bred for use in research, c. Animal testing causes harm and suffering to animals, and d. The episode has highlighted the community\u2019s concern for the welfare of animals used in experimentation and research; 2. Wishes the baboons well; and 3. Calls on the government to: a. Ensure national transparency and accountability in the use of animals in research, and b. Invest in the methods and technology needed to end the use of animals for research purposes. Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff has taken to the Senate to call for an immediate review of all the anime and manga available in Australia. The Japanese animation has caught his eye because of some of the themes which run through it \u2013 Griff says the depiction of young characters in some stories amounts to the glorification of child sexual abuse. \u201cThey contain depictions of wide-eyed children, usually in school uniforms, engaged in explicit sexual activities and poses, and often being sexually abused,\u201d Griff said. He wants a review of the ratings. \u201cThe classification board appears to be making decisions in isolation to criminal law. This must stop.\u201d Griff has written to communications minister Paul Fletcher over the issue. In this quiet, quiet time, let\u2019s take a look at the latest ABS figures. You may have noticed Shane Wright\u2019s tweet a few posts down, pointing out construction work as a whole fell 3% in December, which was worse than the 1% predictions. Over the year, construction work (building) is down 7.1% Private residential construction fell 4.6% in the December quarter, bringing its downward trend to 12.8% over the year. Greg Hunt will be giving the next coronavirus update at 1.10pm. Meanwhile, the lights keep flickering in Parliament House, which can only mean that my moods have begun to physically manifest. Australia is also warning it will not risk the health of athletes, if the coronavirus reaches pandemic levels Quoting an IOC official which would bring a tear to Roy and HG\u2019s fans\u2019 eyes, AAP reports shiz is getting real with the Olympics in general. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee says if it\u2019s too dangerous to hold the Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus, the event could be cancelled rather than postponed. Canadian official Dick Pound, who has been on the IOC since 1978, estimated there is a three-month window \u2013 or even two months \u2013 to decide the fate of the Tokyo Olympics, meaning a decision could be put off until late May. \u201cIn and around that time, I\u2019d say folks are going to have to ask: \u2018Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?\u201d\u2019 he told the Associated Press. As the games draw near, he said: \u201cA lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there building their studios.\u201d If the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as scheduled in Tokyo, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation,\u201d he said. It is very, very quiet here today. I miss the baboons. I hope they are OK. Mark Butler has a few things to say to Keith Pitt this morning: This morning on ABC Breakfast, resources minister Keith Pitt, in response to a question about the government\u2019s $4m coal feasibility study, said: \u201cI\u2019m technology agnostic \u2013 if you look at HELE coal, super critical boilers combined with CCS \u2013 that is a 90% reduction on emissions from legacy brown coal power stations around the country. \u201cSo if we want to take the opportunity to look at this with open minds I think there are opportunities for building further power stations right around the country , and we need them.\u201d Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated the cost of a HELE power station with CCS as $352/Mwh. In comparison, Snowy Hydro are selling dispatchable renewables for $70/Mwh. And the government has itself a target of wholesale price at $70/Mwh. Not to mention the fact that any serious research and development into CCS technology was scrapped by this government\u2019s cut of $400m and effective abolition of the carbon capture and storage flagships program. Reuven Rivlin to Scott Morrison: We appreciate your welcome and we must say, the appreciation comes from the bottom of our hearts because we know that when you are blessing us and hosting us, you are doing it from the bottom of your heart. And I must say to you, Mr Prime Minister, Australia is a great friend of Israel, a real great friend. Once upon a time we used to say the firm relationship of Israel is based on three principles: the relationship with the United States, second, not necessarily as important, the relationship with the United States, and the last but not least, the relationship with the United States. Now, it\u2019s not only that. It\u2019s the relationship between United States and Australia. Really, the relationship and friendship Australia comes out of the relation between people, between, really, sharing the same values that we are sharing. You are ambassador in Jerusalem, I know Tel Aviv, but Israel is very small. I think it is very close to Jerusalem. I must say, we really salute Australians for what they have done and what they are doing just now. For example, the ICC, the ICC is a real \u2013 you are a beacon. You are a beacon to show people all around and understand. The Israeli army are the soldiers of our sons and daughters. And our grandsons and granddaughters. The army of Israel is the army to defend our homes and to keep Israel as a really safe haven to everyone, but we would like to live in democracy and harmony. Israel has been defined as a Jewish state, nevertheless it is a democratic one. It is a Jewish democratic state as much as it is a democratic Jewish state. And I know you appreciate that and all of your government, and I know how we appreciate that. And you are standing behind us once the political ideas of people who are taking part in the international organisations \u2013 very much cleared by you and your prime minister \u2013 saying there is no way to end date Israel once we\u2019re talking about the unification of his, not only the duty of Israel, the right of Israel to protect its citizens and people who are living with us. Scott Morrison to Reuven Rivlin: Australia and Israel have a great friendship, and it\u2019s a friendship between people, a friendship that has been born out of deep respect and empathy for the struggles that Israel has faced. At Israel\u2019s Jewish people\u2019s worst times, Australia has been there, and will always be there to support the Jewish people. And the state of Israel as well. And my recent remarks, our position has been very strong when it comes to defending the great democracy that is the state of Israel. A beacon in an area where democracy is something that is not as widespread, but certainly the freedom of the press and stridency of the judiciary and all of these great principles and values that underpin freedom I what the state of Israel stands for. So it is a very easy, very comfortable, very relaxed relationship that rests in I think deep affection and also one that rests in a deep sharing of values and beliefs about what\u2019s important. So it\u2019s a great honour to have you here, particularly someone not only of your very high office, but someone of your esteemed background and contribution. This is not the news anyone wants, given how much more fragile things got in the months after. And Jim Chalmer\u2019s response: This country is crying out for economic leadership and for an economic plan and Scott Morrison is either unwilling or unable to provide either of those things. Morrison and Frydenberg had no plan before the coronavirus, they have no plan now. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve had disappointing growth, stagnant wages, record household debt, more than doubled public debt, and extraordinarily weak productivity and business investment. The government needs to come up with a plan. They need to provide economic leadership which has been lacking for so long now. They shouldn\u2019t be pretending in their seventh year of government that all of this economic weakness is somehow the product of coronavirus which hit in recent weeks. The country is crying out for leadership and a plan and Scott Morrison is unwilling or unable to provide either. For those wondering why Labor is going so hard on this, given the outside factors, just remember that Chalmers was in Wayne Swan\u2019s office when the GFC hit and how then Coalition opposition responded. There was no leeway there for not being able to deliver a surplus in the midst of the greatest economic challenge since the Great Depression. And there will be none here. Here is some of what Josh Frydenberg has been saying during his \u201clowering expectations tour\u201d rounds (from AAP): \u201cBut I do know that this is going to hit the economy, and I do know that our focus has been, in relation to the fires and other shocks that we\u2019ve faced, on getting the support to the community in need,\u201d he told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s been our primary focus, not the surplus.\u201d He noted the government had already notched up an achievement in delivering the first balanced budget in 11 years, at the same time as it rolled out tax cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re back in balance, and no one can ever take that away from us,\u201d he told ABC Radio National. The treasurer was also coy when asked whether a recession could be on its way. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the word I would use,\u201d before noting he\u2019s waiting to see the figures from the December and March quarters. Frydenberg stressed this was just the latest economic shock the Australian economy has faced, following trade tensions between the US and China, an extended drought, bushfires and floods. The virus is also a shock beyond our control, he said. Non-government senators are still taking up the government business time in the Senate. It\u2019s up to two hours now. James McGrath is only 45 years old. That would make him Gen X. But quotes like this: How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ... I don\u2019t know, under 21 issues, whatever they are.\u201d He is displaying BIG boomer energy. Proving, once and for all, that boomer is a frame of mind. Caroline Fisher told the electoral committee that there was \u201ca lot of concern\u201d around political advertising and campaigning that was \u201cless than honest, and very dubious\u201d including Labor\u2019s Mediscare campaign in 2016 and the anti-Labor \u201ctax scare campaign\u201d in 2019. Fisher said while there was \u201clittle evidence of international interference\u201d in the election \u2013 there were questionable claims made by political parties and \u201cthe outcome of the election seems to indicate it did have an impact\u201d. Labor then pursued a line of questioning about micro-targeting of voters through social media ads, which Fisher suggests may not be \u201cethical\u201d because it allows parties to target people\u2019s particular prejudices without giving everyone the same information. JSCEM chair, James McGrath, speaks in defence of micro-targeting, noting different groups of voters have different interests. He said: How would it be unethical for a political party to say write to the over 65s to say this is what we\u2019re doing with the pension and to the person under the age of 21 to say this is what we\u2019re doing with ... I don\u2019t know, under 21 issues, whatever they are.\u201d Perhaps he should ask the youth minister Richard Colbeck for an example of a youth issue. He sounded *this close* to saying skate parks. The joint standing committee on electoral matters has a hearing in Canberra examining whether fake news played a role in the 2019 election. Caroline Fisher, from the News and Media Research Centre, said Australians are the \u201clightest\u201d consumers of news in the world: Almost half of all Australians only get news once a day or less. Two thirds are concerned if news is fake but only one third did any fact checking. 60% are interested in news but only one third in politics \u2013 meaning 65% said they had no to low interest in politics. Fisher said that \u201cof most concern\u201d is the fact that those who don\u2019t know their political orientation and aren\u2019t interested in politics do not engage in fact-checking. She said: \u201cThese less engaged consumers are more likely to be female, younger and less educated. In an environment of tainted information, they fact-check the least. This group is possibly aligned with undecided voters, and if so they are voting based on the fewest news sources. This represents a significant population of disengaged voters, who are more vulnerable to misinformation.\u201d Michael Jensen, associate professor at the University of Canberra, said he did not see evidence of \u201csizeable or sustained effort by Russia or China to sway the Australian federal election\u201d. For Russia, there was \u201clittle difference\u201d between the Coalition and Labor to their strategic interests. For China, there was \u201cclear evidence the CCP is opposed to this government and believe it is especially hostile to its interests\u201d. He cited an article in propaganda outlet the Global Times that Labor \u201cmight change Australia\u2019s attitude to Washington and be more favourable to Beijing\u201d. But China did not intervene, he said, perhaps because it was a high-risk low-reward proposition, and perhaps because they believed Labor would win anyway. Jensen said both are engage in political interference on particular issues including in favour of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative and Huawei\u2019s involvement in the 5G network; and for Russia, in undermining faith in institutions generally. Today is going really, really well for everyone. Michael McCormack continues his attempts at a personality. Here he was this morning. Honestly. Four-day-old oats have more appeal: A surplus is a number that I know that is in important to get the books back in balance and that is what we have done. Labor, well, they wouldn\u2019t know what the definition of a surplus was, they haven\u2019t produced one since 1989 when Cher was singing If I Could Turn Back Time, of course we all remember that vision of her on that navy ship, and there you go again, Labor didn\u2019t even build a navy ship and they had six years, six years of opportunity, didn\u2019t give a ship, didn\u2019t give a ship at all, about making sure that we built the infrastructure to increase defence capability. If Labor could only turn back time who knows what might happen.\u201d But we also get a sportsball (that\u2019s what the people like, right? Sportsball) reference, when asked if the surplus is sunk. I don\u2019t believe so, and you\u2019ll have to wait until May. It\u2019s like suggesting that Hawthorn\u2019s not going to win the premiership and it\u2019s only February. I am hoping that Hawthorn will win the premiership, they\u2019ve lost a trial game the other day, you know, it\u2019s early day.\u201d So, obviously, Hawthorn is now cancelled. And I don\u2019t just say that as a Collingwood supporter. Anyways, Matt Canavan then turned up and the Curb Your Enthusiasm music began playing in all our heads: (apologies Melbournites for the extra e. I am tired. And now obviously hate Hawthorn) I can\u2019t imagine that the extradition of Malka Leifer won\u2019t come up in some way today. Josh Burns and Dave Shama are on a bipartisan unity ticket when it comes to this, pushing for Leifer\u2019s return in order to face the abuse allegations levelled agains her. Everyone is allowed to be aspirational apparently, except for the National Farmers\u2019 Federation, when it comes to looking at carbon neutrality, says the man who is somehow the nation\u2019s deputy prime minister and supposed advocate for farmers. Here he is this morning, as reported by AAP: Nationals leader Michael McCormack has cast aspersions on the farming sector\u2019s aims to cut emissions over the next decade. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation has had a policy for almost two years for the sector to be \u201ctrending towards carbon neutrality by 2030\u201d. Its 2030 roadmap also says Australia could become a global leader in low-emissions agriculture, although cautions a poor policy response \u201ccould saddle farm businesses with additional costs\u201d. The move towards carbon neutrality has been seized by Labor to back its commitment to bring Australia down to net zero emissions by 2050. But the deputy prime minister is sceptical about the NFF aims. \u201cTrending towards and actually achieving might be two different things,\u201d McCormack told Sky News on Wednesday. \u201cWhat the Nationals support is jobs in regional Australia and jobs in agriculture.\u201d Asked whether he backed the NFF\u2019s plans, he said only that it was aspirational. \u201cIt\u2019s aspirational by the NFF, good on them, and I support Fiona Simson and what the NFF stand for,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the fact remains we want to make sure we grow agriculture.\u201d Unless of course, we need water for irrigators. Or if a mine needs to go in a food bowl. It\u2019s so difficult being a Nat these days. In case you haven\u2019t seen it yet, Anne Davies has this story this morning: The federal government is spending up to $2m buying water from Queensland agribusiness Eastern Australia Agriculture in a bid to keep an internationally significant wetlands from dying, despite paying $80m to the same company three years ago for water rights for the same purpose. The $80m purchase of overland flows from Eastern Australia Agriculture has been controversial and is now under scrutiny by Australian National Audit Office. Secret Nationals business, as captured by Mike Bowers. Here is what Zali Steggall was seeing when she tweeted asking where the government MPs were. Keith Pitt on ABC Breakfast this morning, once again talking about the government\u2019s technology roadmap. No one is really clear on what that actually means just yet, but it\u2019s something to do with the technology the government is looking at for energy security moving forward. Anyways, Pitt has discovered the word commitment and he\u2019s not afraid to use it. We made a commitment internationally. We will meet our commitment. We took that proposal to the election. I\u2019m a member of the government. I support what we are doing. We took a balanced proposition, it was accepted by the Australian people at the election. They clearly rejected what was put forward by then Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten. Although I see Mr Anthony Albanese has decided he wants to head down the same track, uncosted an unplanned targets. I don\u2019t think people will fall for it. We\u2019re looking at a technology road map as you know. We\u2019re looking for opportunities into the future. I\u2019m sure those shareholding ministers that have responsibility for that area will be making statements later in the year. But right now we\u2019re committed to 2030. We\u2019ll deliver on our commitments, we\u2019ll do what we said we would. We have taken a balanced proposition to the Australian and it has been accepted. Up to $4 million for the feasible study. It was an election commitment. We deliver on our election commitments. And feasibility studies determine feasibility, that\u2019s what they\u2019re for. As an engineer I wait to see the results. The Greens senator Janet Rice is up in the Senate, chasing the Phil Gaetjens report into the sports rort affair. The government once again came back with a public interest immunity claim to avoid having to bring in the report (they have declared it cabinet in-confidence, despite previous reports like this being made public) so non-government senators are now taking up the government\u2019s business time this morning. Depending on how many senators join in, the government could lose a couple of hours of business time here. Rice\u2019s motion: Mr President I give notice that on the next day of sitting, I shall move: (1) That there be laid on the table by the minister representing the prime minister, by no later than 7:20pm on Tuesday 25 February 2020, the final report provided by the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Mr Phillip Gaetjens, to the prime minister in relation to the application of the statement of ministerial standards to the former minister for sport\u2019s award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Program. 2) In the event the minister fails to table the report, the Senate requires the minister representing the prime minister to attend the Senate on Wednesday 26 February 2020, prior to government business being called on, to provide an explanation, of no more than 10 minutes, of the government\u2019s failure to table the report. (3) Any senator may move to take note of the explanation required by paragraph (2). (4) Any motion under paragraph (3) shall have precedence over all government business until determined, and senators may speak to the motion for not more than 10 minutes each. ....SQUIRREL! This issue has come off the boiler \u2013 but will no doubt start ticking away again when a distraction is needed. Even though it seems like 600 days ago, it was only yesterday that Peter Dutton defined \u201cleftwing terrorism\u201d as Islamic terrorism, for reasons only he can explain \u2013 but won\u2019t. In the midst of that word vomit, you may have missed this from Katharine Murphy: While the debate about false equivalence played out in public, Guardian Australia has also confirmed that one of the minister\u2019s advisers cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query Dutton\u2019s controversial intervention in the debate. Matthew Noel, an engineering student from New South Wales, says he rang Dutton\u2019s ministerial office in Canberra on Tuesday morning. Noel says he telephoned to try to establish exactly who the minister was referring to when he raised the spectre of leftwing terrorism. The student says he spoke to an adviser who identified himself as Mark. Noel says the adviser over the course of the call identified the group Extinction Rebellion as an example of leftwing terrorism. Noel says he said to the adviser: \u201cAre you saying Extinction Rebellion are a terrorist group? [The adviser] replied, yes.\u201d Dutton\u2019s office has confirmed the call took place. But a spokeswoman disputes some of Noel\u2019s recollection of the conversation. Dutton\u2019s spokeswoman told Guardian Australia: \u201cThe allegation that a member of staff nominated Extinction Rebellion as an example of a leftwing terror group is completely false. \u201cWhen asked by the caller, the staff member advised that the group is an example of a leftwing extremist group, not a terrorist group.\u201d Asked whether the adviser was reflecting the minister\u2019s view during the conversation, the spokeswoman said: \u201cThe minister does not believe this group is a leftwing terror organisation.\u201d Parliament starts at 9.30am this morning. Just in case anyone was wondering. Resources minister Keith Pitt was asked what the problem with a net zero 2050 target was, while speaking to ABC TV this morning. The fact that he didn\u2019t outright slam it, is very telling. We\u2019re looking at a technology road map, as you know. We\u2019re looking for opportunities into the future and I\u2019m sure those shareholding ministers that have responsibility for that area will be making statements later in the year. But right new we\u2019re committed to 2030. We\u2019ll deliver on our commitments. We\u2019ll do what we said we would. We have taken a balanced proposition to the Australian people and it\u2019s been accepted. It\u2019s not just Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 facing the reality of climate change is something more and more of Australia\u2019s sectors are turning their mind to. Someone who is enjoying the treasurer\u2019s discomfort though, is his shadow counterpart and former adviser to Wayne Swan, Jim Chalmers. Speaking about Josh Frydenberg\u2019s Fran Kelly interview this morning, Chalmers could barely contain his glee: \u201cJosh Frydenberg\u2019s interview on radio this morning had all of the coherence of a Sydney baboon rampage.\u201d Josh Frydenberg\u2019s \u201cmanaging expectations\u201d tour has continued. He has been on Sky News, ABC radio and Sydney radio 2GB today. After spending the better part of the last eight years smashing up Wayne Swan for promising a series of surpluses and then failing deliver (because of that little thing called the global financial crisis), the Morrison government is attempting to get out ahead of it\u2019s own potential failure by reminding everyone they can find that the world economy is under quite a bit of pressure. If the surplus disappears, which, Frydenberg and Scott Morrison\u2019s language makes clear is a real possibility, given the bushfires, drought and now coronavirus impacts, it\u2019s a little more embarrassing given there was an entire advertising campaign dedicated to moody, slightly smug, black and white portraits of the government\u2019s leaders declaring the budget was BACK IN BLACK. There are coffee mugs. MUGS. There was the \u201cI said we brought the budget back to surplus next year.\u201d So what does Frydenberg say to that? \u201cWe\u2019re back in balance and no one can ever take that away from us,\u201d the treasurer told ABC\u2019s Fran Kelly. \u201cI made a very clear statement based on the best advice available to us knowing that Australia is now living within its means.\u201d We\u2019ve got to stop this false debate, this misleading debate about whether getting to net zero emissions by 2050 ... is something that\u2019s optional. Well, I suppose it is optional, but it\u2019s an option you don\u2019t want to miss, because if we do miss it we know what the consequences are. The fires of this last summer will seem like a very, very mild experience compared to what a 3C [warmer] world will look like.\u201d That\u2019s Malcolm Turnbull there, as reported by David Crowe in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, speaking to an energy executive conference in Sydney yesterday. The former PM, who was dumped by his party over energy and climate policy, is now leaving it all on the floor. After a tweet storm on Sunday during Insiders: Turnbull is now taking every opportunity to remind people of what the cost of inaction is. As Crowe reports: There is no economic case for building a new coal-fired power station in Australia anymore, regardless what you think about carbon policy \u2013 and everyone in the energy sector knows that. But if you read the News Limited newspapers and listen to debates in Canberra, it\u2019s a parallel universe. As to the future of the coal industry, we should all hope that thermal coal is going to go out of business, not just in Australia but around the world. Because if it doesn\u2019t, and we\u2019re still burning coal to generate energy in 30 or 40 years, we\u2019re moving into a 3C environment, which is catastrophic.\u201d Meanwhile, Josh Frydenberg is having to explain how he is not embarrassed about the government getting so excited about the possibility of a surplus it launched a \u201cback in black\u201d advertising campaign \u2013 and $35 souvenir mug \u2013 when it is looking increasingly likely the surplus is gone, and avoiding negative growth will be lineball. We\u2019ll bring you that, and everything else as it happens. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp as well as a one coffee me. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "bodyText": "Mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. The second biggest miner in the world has also committed to reducing its emissions by 15% by 2030. Rio Tinto\u2019s decision, which follows pressure from investors, puts it in line with Australian business groups and unions and at odds with an Australian government that has devoted itself to attacking the Labor opposition over its commitment to the same net zero target. Its commitment to cut emissions is easier for Rio Tinto than BHP and other big global miners because unlike BHP, it does not mine coal or oil. However, unlike BHP, Rio Tinto has refused to set a target to reduce so-called \u201cscope 3\u201d emissions produced by its customers. Announcing Rio Tinto\u2019s full-year results on Wednesday, the company\u2019s chief executive Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques also warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Chinese steel mills are major Rio Tinto customers, however Jacques said the company\u2019s iron order books were full. \u201cBut we are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers,\u201d Jacques said. \u201cWe acknowledge that there will be some short-term volatility and uncertainty, but we are very well positioned.\u201d He said Rio Tinto\u2019s new commitments on climate added to a 46% cut in the company\u2019s emissions since 2008, although much of that reduction was due to it selling operations that produce a lot of pollution. To reduce its total emissions by 15% by 2030, every new business opened by Rio Tinto in the next decade will need to be carbon neutral. Jacques said the company was open to buying carbon offsets if necessary but this was a \u201clast port of call\u201d. He said the emissions cut to 2030 would be achieved using existing technology but Rio Tinto would also be investing part of the $1bn on developing new ways of eliminating carbon production. \u201cWe have approved around US$100m last week for the Pilbara, I think it would be a good example of things we may look at going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 34MW solar photovoltaic plant and a battery system of 12MW per hour storage facility at one of our operations. \u201cBy doing this investment \u2026 we\u2019ll be able to take out about 90,000 tonnes compared to commercial gas power generation.\u201d This was equivalent to taking 28,000 cars off the road or about 3% of the company\u2019s emissions from the Pilbara, he said. \u201cAt the same time we are investing serious money in order to find the technology for the future. We have only a pathway for the next 10 years. If we don\u2019t work today on options beyond the next 10 years, we\u2019ll never get there.\u201d He defended Rio Tinto\u2019s decision not to set scope 3 targets \u2013 something rival BHP did in July as part of a $400m program to cut its emissions. \u201cWe will not set targets for our customers,\u201d Jaques said. \u201cHaving said that, we are looking to partner with our customers and the customers of our customers to look for ways to work together in order to improve emissions across the value chain.\u201d He said examples included a deal the company struck with giant Chinese steel mill and key customer Baosteel in September to reduce emissions from steelmaking and another deal struck with Apple and the government of Quebec two years ago relating to aluminium. \u201cRemember, we are the only large diversified mining and metal company that is not selling either coal, and the carbon associated with coal, or drilling oil and gas and the carbon associated with oil and gas. \u201cSo if you step back, if you believe in climate change \u2013 and we do believe in climate change \u2013 we know we need to have more high quality copper, high quality aluminium, in order to be part of the solution.\u201d Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s conservative Coalition government campaigned hard against Labor\u2019s net zero target as part of its re-election strategy at the federal election last May, and in recent weeks has revived its attacks on the opposition over the policy by demanding costings and raising the spectre of soaring energy prices.

It\u2019s unclear whether there are enough Trump loyalists to replace everyone on the lists of his enemies. Officials purged from executive branch posts since the impeachment acquittal on 5 February include the impeachment witnesses Gordon Sondland and Alexander Vindman, whose brother was also purged from his national security assignment; US attorney Jessie Liu, who opposed prosecution of former FBI official Andrew McCabe, a Trump bugbear; Pentagon official Elaine McCusker, who resisted a White House directive last year to suspend aid to Ukraine; John Rood, a Pentagon official who certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption benchmarks required for aid to flow; deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates; and Joseph Maguire, Grenell\u2019s predecessor. \u201cThere might be a few people who slip through the cracks, but not many,\u201d said Stevenson of Trump\u2019s purge. \u201cYou can\u2019t read everybody\u2019s minds, and there are people I think probably at the National Security Council \u2013 I\u2019m sure there are a number of people who question Trump\u2019s leadership and even his suitability for the job, and yet they stay for their own reasons. \u201cA complete and airtight purge probably is impossible. But substantial headway can be made, and apparently is being made.\u201d Trump\u2019s defenders in the media and government point out he may choose executive branch employees as he pleases, and they defend his attacks on the traditional separation between politics and career service by weaving ominous tales of plots against the president from within. Trump\u2019s response has been to dig deeper into his list of loyalists and send Johnny up against the Deep State. It\u2019s a game critics warn that everyone could lose.",

      "body": "<p>Fear and scepticism were among the reactions offered by trainers on Wednesday when asked about the threat posed to the Cheltenham Festival by the coronavirus outbreak. Organisers insist the four-day meeting, which is the highlight of the jump-racing year, is on track to go ahead as planned on 10 March but privately there is sure to be fretting about what would happen if the number of cases in Britain were to increase.</p> \n<p>\u201cGordon Bennett, it terrifies me,\u201d said Nigel Twiston-Davies, expressing concern about the Festival being abandoned rather than about development of the virus itself. The situation reminds the Gold Cup-winning trainer of the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/02/footandmouth.roncox\" title=\"\">when the presence of sheep grazing</a> on racecourse grounds resulted in that year\u2019s Festival being lost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/26/talking-horses-epatante-still-the-pick-of-hendersons-hurdle-contenders\">Talking Horses: Epatante still the pick of Henderson's Hurdle contenders</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe over-reaction when there was a few sheep there \u2026\u201d Twiston\u2011Davies said. \u201cIf somebody in Cheltenham happens to get it [coronavirus], what happens? Hopefully we\u2019re close enough to the Festival that it\u2019ll be OK but the Grand National meeting might be a different thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Twiston-Davies was speaking at a media event at the racecourse to promote the Festival. His fellow Cotswolds trainer Fergal O\u2019Brien, formerly an assistant to Twiston-Davies, took a diametrically opposed view. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be worried at all, I think it\u2019s a storm in a tea cup. I hope I\u2019m proved right. I think it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019ll blow over and we\u2019ll all get on with it as we should do. It [the outbreak] doesn\u2019t affect the vast majority of the population.\u201d</p> \n<p>A market opened this week by Betfair suggests gamblers are closer to the Twiston-Davies way of thinking than O\u2019Brien\u2019s. While the Festival is odds-on to go ahead, punters assessed the chance of no racing at Cheltenham on 10 March as just a 5-2 shot, odds that shortened from 3-1 during the course of Wednesday. It means punters think racing is more likely to be abandoned than the favourite, Epatante, is to win the Champion Hurdle.</p> \n<p>A calm approach was urged by the very experienced Ian Renton, who manages the racecourse for its owner, the Jockey Club. \u201cAt the moment the racing industry is working closely with the government and they have been extremely effective in keeping controls on the virus not entering this country, so we are delighted with what they have done and we look forward to the Festival happening in a fortnight\u2019s time,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have seen various things that have come on the horizon at each Festival. Last year we had the equine flu, previously we had the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019, so there\u2019s normally something around the corner to create a little bit of concern. At the moment, there is nothing to push us off course.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked what contingency plans are in place should the Festival have to be postponed, Renton declined to offer specifics. \u201cThere are always thoughts for whatever eventuality there may be. Last year, we were working through, if we were to lose a day due to the winds, when we would stage it. So we have a number of scenarios in mind for whatever could happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>The main difficulty in staging the Festival at a later date is there are other races staged for more or less the same horses at Aintree\u2019s Grand National meeting three weeks later and at Punchestown at the end of April.</p> \n<p>The racing industry has set up a steering group, including representatives from the British Horseracing Authority, racecourses and horsemen, to deal with the problems raised by the coronavirus and the group met on Wednesday. Its conclusion was that action is not necessary yet and there is no need to develop a policy regarding abandonment of any specific fixtures because of coronavirus at this time.</p> \n<p>A BHA spokesman said the steering group \u201cwill continue to liaise with government and monitor the implications of coronavirus. Further information or guidance will be issued to the industry as and when appropriate.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"de18fcc7-291a-44b2-a7ff-f706023d8027\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh</b><br><b>1.00 </b>Judex Lefou <b>1.30 </b>Made For You <b>2.07 </b>Shanroe Street <b>2.42 </b>Overcourt <b>3.17</b> Celtic Flames <b>3.52</b> Away At Dawn<br><br><b>Ludlow</b><br><b>1.40 </b>Feel The Pinch (nb) <b>2.15</b> Red Risk (nap) <b>2.50 </b>Nautical Star <b>3.25 </b>Another Venture <b>4.00</b> Whatsdastory <b>4.30</b> Optimised <b>5.00</b> Demopolis<br><br><b>Taunton</b><br><b>1.47</b> Todd <b>2.22</b> Eritage <b>2.57</b> On The Road <b>3.32</b> Jobsonfire <b>4.07 </b>Risk And Roll <b>4.37</b> Lady Chartreuse <b>5.07</b> Time To Tinker<br><br><b>Newcastle</b><br><b>1.55</b> Sweet Dime <b>2.30 </b>Papa Power <b>3.05</b> Persian Sun <b>3.40</b> Cosmelli <b>4.15</b> Dandys Gold <b>4.45</b> Fortamour<br><br><b>Chelmsford</b><br><b>5.30</b> Ice Ice Lady <b>6.00 </b>Flying Focus <b>6.30</b> Maori Knight <b>7.00 </b>Fantastic Flyer <b>7.30</b> Griggy <b>8.00 </b>Lady Of York</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "Fear and scepticism were among the reactions offered by trainers on Wednesday when asked about the threat posed to the Cheltenham Festival by the coronavirus outbreak. Organisers insist the four-day meeting, which is the highlight of the jump-racing year, is on track to go ahead as planned on 10 March but privately there is sure to be fretting about what would happen if the number of cases in Britain were to increase. \u201cGordon Bennett, it terrifies me,\u201d said Nigel Twiston-Davies, expressing concern about the Festival being abandoned rather than about development of the virus itself. The situation reminds the Gold Cup-winning trainer of the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, when the presence of sheep grazing on racecourse grounds resulted in that year\u2019s Festival being lost. \u201cThe over-reaction when there was a few sheep there \u2026\u201d Twiston\u2011Davies said. \u201cIf somebody in Cheltenham happens to get it [coronavirus], what happens? Hopefully we\u2019re close enough to the Festival that it\u2019ll be OK but the Grand National meeting might be a different thing.\u201d Twiston-Davies was speaking at a media event at the racecourse to promote the Festival. His fellow Cotswolds trainer Fergal O\u2019Brien, formerly an assistant to Twiston-Davies, took a diametrically opposed view. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be worried at all, I think it\u2019s a storm in a tea cup. I hope I\u2019m proved right. I think it\u2019s one of those things that\u2019ll blow over and we\u2019ll all get on with it as we should do. It [the outbreak] doesn\u2019t affect the vast majority of the population.\u201d A market opened this week by Betfair suggests gamblers are closer to the Twiston-Davies way of thinking than O\u2019Brien\u2019s. While the Festival is odds-on to go ahead, punters assessed the chance of no racing at Cheltenham on 10 March as just a 5-2 shot, odds that shortened from 3-1 during the course of Wednesday. It means punters think racing is more likely to be abandoned than the favourite, Epatante, is to win the Champion Hurdle. A calm approach was urged by the very experienced Ian Renton, who manages the racecourse for its owner, the Jockey Club. \u201cAt the moment the racing industry is working closely with the government and they have been extremely effective in keeping controls on the virus not entering this country, so we are delighted with what they have done and we look forward to the Festival happening in a fortnight\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen various things that have come on the horizon at each Festival. Last year we had the equine flu, previously we had the \u2018Beast from the East\u2019, so there\u2019s normally something around the corner to create a little bit of concern. At the moment, there is nothing to push us off course.\u201d Asked what contingency plans are in place should the Festival have to be postponed, Renton declined to offer specifics. \u201cThere are always thoughts for whatever eventuality there may be. Last year, we were working through, if we were to lose a day due to the winds, when we would stage it. So we have a number of scenarios in mind for whatever could happen.\u201d The main difficulty in staging the Festival at a later date is there are other races staged for more or less the same horses at Aintree\u2019s Grand National meeting three weeks later and at Punchestown at the end of April. The racing industry has set up a steering group, including representatives from the British Horseracing Authority, racecourses and horsemen, to deal with the problems raised by the coronavirus and the group met on Wednesday. Its conclusion was that action is not necessary yet and there is no need to develop a policy regarding abandonment of any specific fixtures because of coronavirus at this time. A BHA spokesman said the steering group \u201cwill continue to liaise with government and monitor the implications of coronavirus. Further information or guidance will be issued to the industry as and when appropriate.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Republicans revel in spectacle of bickering Democrats The Trump campaign described it as a \u201chot mess\u201d, and the president was certainly among the beneficiaries of a chaotic and contentious Democratic debate on Tuesday evening. Bernie Sanders, his rivals\u2019 biggest target on the stage in South Carolina, emerged relatively unscathed from the onslaught \u2013 which, says Richard Wolffe, may have been the other candidates\u2019 last, best chance to halt the momentum of the progressive frontrunner. Who won? Sanders won the debate, Warren kept her cool, but the other candidates did themselves a disservice in a debate heavy on vitriol and light on substance, writes Moira Donegan. That also appears to be the consensus among the Guardian\u2019s panel of experts. California air. Sanders has teamed up with Latino activists to tackle industrial air pollution in California, where his campaign\u2019s longstanding ground game could bring him a big win on Super Tuesday, as Sam Levin reports from San Bernardino. WHO says world \u2018not ready\u2019 for coronavirus pandemic A World Health Organization official has said countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a potential coronavirus pandemic, as cases of the Covid-19 virus proliferate in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East. South Korea reported 284 new infections on Wednesday, war-torn Afghanistan reported its first cases in Herat province, and the virus has reached Latin America, after a 61-year-old man in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, tested positive on Tuesday. \u2018Severe disruption\u2019. The CDC has said an outbreak of Covid-19 in the US could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, despite Trump\u2019s assertion that the virus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d. Home alone. A young boy in China\u2019s Hubei province was found alone at home after watching his grandfather die from the virus, because of state restrictions intended to halt its spread. India: 21 dead amid worst religious violence for decades At least 21 people are dead in Delhi following sectarian clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups, the worst spate of religious violence in the Indian capital for decades. The violence, which began with attacks on mosques by Hindu mobs, was sparked by protests over a law passed in December that grants citizenship for refugees of every major south Asian religion except Muslims. Trump visit. The violence began during Trump\u2019s visit to India this week, a trip designed to stoke nationalism in both nations, says Ankita Rao. Trump and Narendra Modi, leaders of the world\u2019s biggest democracies, are undermining their own countries\u2019 founding values, says Michael H Fuchs. With Weinstein in prison, spotlight turns on his enablers As he awaits his sentencing for rape and sexual assault on 11 March, Harvey Weinstein is to join the 7,000 inmates at New York\u2019s notorious Rikers Island jail. In the meantime, the focus may shift to the associates who helped enable his abuses and silence his accusers. With 105 women having levelled accusations against him, writes Ed Pilkington, how Weinstein managed to avoid trouble for decades is a burning issue. \u2018No perfect victim\u2019. Weinstein\u2019s former assistant Rowena Chiu, who accused him of trying to rape her at a Venice hotel in 1998, has called for greater empathy towards rape survivors, saying: \u201cThe thing that we\u2019ve learned from the trial is there is no such thing as the perfect rape victim.\u201d Cheat sheet Bob Iger, the Disney CEO who masterminded the company\u2019s acquisitions of Marvel, Star Wars and the 20th Century Fox Studio, has abruptly stepped down after 15 years in charge of the world\u2019s most successful entertainment brand. The Welsh singer Aimee Duffy \u2013 who recorded as Duffy before her retreat from the public eye several years ago \u2013 has said in an Instagram post that she was drugged, raped and held captive by an unidentified person. The 11-time world champion surfer Kelly Slater is leading a project to construct the world\u2019s largest rideable, open-barrel, manmade wave at a new hotel complex in La Quinta, in the southern California desert. A former White House doctor has admitted he attempted to improve Trump\u2019s infamously unhealthy diet by sneaking cauliflower into the president\u2019s mashed potato and \u201cmaking the ice cream less accessible\u201d. Must-reads How lead is poisoning America\u2019s poorest children After her young son was diagnosed with autism, Shanaya Ball learned he had dangerous lead levels in his blood, caused by the crumbling paint in their Philadelphia home. The toxin endangers hundreds of thousands, reports Nina Lakhani, but parents whose children are most at risk may never be warned. Amazon debuts first checkout-free supermarket The first bricks and mortar Amazon Go Grocery store opened on Tuesday in Seattle, where sensors and cameras record everything in shoppers\u2019 baskets and charge them automatically \u2013 so you can walk out without waiting in line at checkout. Hallie Golden pays a visit. The college QB leading Trump\u2019s \u2018deep state\u2019 purge Johnny McEntee, the 29-year-old White House director for presidential personnel, is the person responsible for leading the administration\u2019s purge of those thought to harbour anti-Trump sentiments. Tom McCarthy profiles a baby-faced assassin. Is Gmail hiding Bernie\u2019s emails from you? Everyone knows Facebook and Twitter customise their news feeds. But Gmail\u2019s email curation could prove just as consequential in 2020, with some candidates\u2019 campaign mailouts proving more spam-prone than others, as a report by The Markup reveals. Opinion Michael Bloomberg\u2019s digital campaign is deliberately poisoning online discourse with doctored videos and fabricated quotes. It\u2019s a cynical approach with toxic side-effects, says Julia Carrie Wong. In many ways the Bloomberg campaign is only mimicking tactics that Donald Trump successfully harnessed in 2016, when his campaign enjoyed \u2026 a \u2018symbiotic relationship\u2019 with the far-right meme machine. Sport When MLS launched a quarter of a century ago, many wondered whether it could survive, writes Tom Dart. But on the eve of its 25th season it continues to grow, attracting foreign stars and developing new ties to football-mad Mexico. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee has said this summer\u2019s Tokyo Games may have to be cancelled if the coronavirus crisis becomes too dangerous in Japan, where a dozen new cases of the disease were reported on Monday.

      "bodyText": "The number of new coronavirus cases being officially reported outside China has overtaken those reported by Beijing for the first time since the outbreak began, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said. According to WHO, 427 cases were reported by 37 countries on Tuesday, compared with 411 by the Chinese authorities. While 96.5% of the total number of 80,980 cases reported so far are in China, the latest figures on new infections suggest Beijing\u2019s strict response to the crisis is paying off. The virus has killed 2,715 people and infected more than 78,000 in China. A further 52 deaths inside the country were reported on Wednesday \u2013 the lowest number in three weeks \u2013 with no fatalities outside the centre of the outbreak in Hubei province. China\u2019s national health commission also reported a drop in the number of new infections to 406, with only five outside Hubei. In the rest of the world there have been more than 40 deaths and 2,700 cases. On Wednesday, Beijing\u2019s health commissioner announced that the capital would quarantine people for 14 days at home or in groups if they had been to countries seriously affected by the coronavirus. The number of cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea is continuing to rise \u2013 a trend that the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. The virus has proliferated in parts of Asia, Europe and the Middle East in recent days, with the death toll rising in Iran, infections in South Korea passing 1,200 and the first Latin American case confirmed in Brazil. Despite the disease\u2019s spread, Tedros once again warned against rushing to declare a pandemic. \u201cUsing the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralysing systems,\u201d he said on Wednesday. \u201cIt may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true.\u201d Tedros said a WHO mission would travel to Iran at the weekend, where 19 people have died and 139 others have been infected by the virus. The first two cases of the virus were reported on Wednesday by the government of Pakistan, with one of the infected patients having travelled to Iran with his family. South Korea reported 284 new infections on Wednesday, raising the total to 1,261 \u2013 by far the highest outside China \u2013 while an 11th person died. Ninety per cent of the new infections in South Korea were in Daegu and the neighbouring province of North Gyeongsang. Seoul has announced plans to introduce \u201cmaximum measures\u201d to contain the coronavirus, including plans to test about 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. Italy, meanwhile, has reported 374 cases and 10 deaths. Authorities have locked down 11 towns and ordered Serie A football games to be played to empty stadiums. Italian prosecutors have also opened an investigation into the procedures adopted by hospitals in the northern Lombardy region to manage the initial coronavirus outbreak. The inquiry is examining whether medical staff missed opportunities to identify coronavirus in the man identified as Italy\u2019s first \u201csuper spreader\u201d. The man is believed to have infected five people and has also been linked to eight other infections, among them health workers and patients at a hospital in Lombardy. According to reports in the Italian media, it took four contacts with doctors before the man was eventually tested for coronavirus, and then only after he had spent 36 hours in the hospital \u2013 a period during which he infected a number of other people. Croatia, Austria and Switzerland reported their first cases on Tuesday, while Greece and Norway reported their first on Wednesday. In France, a second person infected with the coronavirus died late on Tuesday, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. The death was one of three new cases in France this week, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 17. Ten cases of the virus have been detected across Spain in the past 36 hours and hundreds of guests and workers remain in quarantine in a hotel in Tenerife after four Italian guests tested positive for coronavirus. The health ministry raised the risk of local transmission from low to moderate after more cases were detected, including that of a man in Andaluc\u00eda who had not travelled to Italy or Asia and is thought to have picked up the virus in Spain.

      "bodyText": "The Olympics, the Six Nations and Stormzy\u2019s world tour are among events under threat amid health and travel concerns as authorities attempt to combat the spread of coronavirus. As the number of cases worldwide continues to climb, fears over the outbreak have already prompted the mass cancellation of festivals and sporting events across Asia, and events in Europe are also being called into question. A senior member of the International Olympic Committee has said cancellation of the Tokyo 2020 Games would be likely only if the disease proved too dangerous for the event \u2013 scheduled to begin on 24 July \u2013 to go ahead. On Wednesday the Irish Rugby Football Union said both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s matches between Ireland and Italy would be postponed on the advice of the government and public health advisers. Last weekend, Italy\u2019s women\u2019s team had their match with Scotland cancelled. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer said on Wednesday that the recommendation to cancel the match was \u201cthe only responsible decision that could have been made\u201d. A number of touring artists have cancelled dates in affected places altogether, including Stormzy, who has had to postpone the entire Asian leg of his forthcoming global tour, and Mabel, who has cancelled all of her performance dates in Italy. A Public Health England spokesperson said people should \u201cnot feel obliged to avoid others, even in large gatherings, but should maintain good personal, hand and respiratory hygiene to avoid the spread of infections that are common at this time of year, such as flu\u201d. The statement continued: \u201cAt the moment, we are not advising changing plans around sporting events. However, this is an evolving situation and we regularly review our advice.\u201d Sport Olympic Games The IOC member Dick Pound told the Associated Press that preparations for Tokyo 2020 were \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d and any decision on whether or not to go ahead with the Games did not need to be taken until May. But he raised the prospect of a cancellation if the circumstances demand it nearer the time. \u201cIn and around that time [late May], folks are going to have to ask: is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of things have to start happening. You\u2019ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic Village, the hotels.\u201d If the IOC decides the games cannot go forward as scheduled in Tokyo, rather than another country taking over, \u201cyou\u2019re probably looking at a cancellation\u201d, he said. Training for 80,000 Olympic volunteers, which was due to begin on 22 February, has been delayed for at least two months. Six Nations Ireland\u2019s game against Italy in Dublin on 7 March has now been postponed following an intervention from the country\u2019s health minister. Simon Harris said he believed the fixture should be postponed following the spread of coronavirus to countries including Italy. \u201cThe clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game would constitute a significant risk because a very large number of people will be travelling from what is now an affected region,\u201d he said. The IRFU said it was \u201cperfectly happy to comply with this instruction\u201d and it now had \u201ca lot of work to do\u201d to rearrange the fixture. Attention will turn to whether Italian fans with tickets to Dublin will still travel or cancel their visits. England v Italy The Football Association has begun the process of discussing how it responds to coronavirus and, specifically, whether England\u2019s friendly with Italy at Wembley on 27 March can go ahead given the spread of the virus in Italy, which has already led to four Serie A fixtures being postponed and Internazionale\u2019s home Europa League tie with Ludogorets on Thursday becoming a behind-closed-doors fixture. Other matters \u2013 including England\u2019s participation at Euro 2020 \u2013 are also being discussed by the FA, which for now is continuing to take government advice in regards to how to react to the virus. Premier League Clubs are following NHS guidelines regarding safeguarding against the coronavirus as it continues to spread globally. The governing body is also sharing recommendations to its clubs received from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, agreed in conjunction with the EFL chief medical officer, while at their respective stadiums advice is being displayed for staff and fans to self-isolate if they experience symptoms of the virus. The Department of Health, NHS England and Public Health England are not, though, currently issuing any further stipulations. Cheltenham festival As of Wednesday morning, the only decision taken was to establish a coronavirus steering group including representatives of the British Horseracing Authority, racecourses and horsemen. The sport is said to be on a \u201cwatching and monitoring\u201d brief and prepared to take its cue from the government if the situation in Britain should deteriorate. World Athletics Indoor Championships Originally scheduled for Nanjing from 13-15 March, the championships have now been postponed until next year. Formula One The Chinese Grand Prix, originally set for 19 April, has been postponed by FIA and Formula One, who will weigh potential alternative dates later this year. The opening three races of the Formula One season \u2013 in Australian, Bahrain and Vietnam \u2013 are coming under increasing threat of cancellation. Culture Touring musicians Stormzy is undertaking his biggest tour yet in 2020, a global jaunt across five continents \u2013 but the Asian leg has been postponed.

      "body": "<p>As the impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc on the world\u2019s economy, the problem for Australia is that it has come at a time when our government has been more worried about the budget surplus than the actual economy. And now with the surplus almost certainly gone, the weak domestic economy is laid bare for all to see.</p> <p>On Tuesday the prime minister, treasurer and health minister <a href=\"https://www.pm.gov.au/media/press-conference-parliament-house-2\">all fronted the media</a> to deliver the bad news about the impact of Covid-19. For Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison the impact on the economy was just as important to highlight as that of the health concerns.</p> <p>For a government that has placed so much store in achieving a budget surplus, the news was not good, but for the broader economy the news was worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/morrison-steps-away-from-surplus-pledge-amid-unknown-global-shock-of-coronavirus\">Morrison steps away from surplus pledge amid 'unknown global shock' of coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrison suggested \u201cthe Australian economy will depend a lot more on its domestic elements\u201d. This is true because clearly the virus affects our exports, especially to China, but he also noted \u201cbusiness as usual can be maintained here in Australia within our domestic economy\u201d.</p> <p>That is a problem because the current business as usual in our domestic economy is pretty dire.</p> <p>On Wednesday the bureau of statistics released <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8755.0Main+Features1Dec%202019?OpenDocument\">the latest construction figures</a>. These reflect the level of investment in the economy and are also important because the construction sector is one of our largest employers. Nine per cent of all employees work in construction, as does 17% of all men working full-time.</p> <p>So when construction work falls, the economy generally struggles.

      "bodyText": "As the impact of the coronavirus outbreak continues to wreak havoc on the world\u2019s economy, the problem for Australia is that it has come at a time when our government has been more worried about the budget surplus than the actual economy. And now with the surplus almost certainly gone, the weak domestic economy is laid bare for all to see. On Tuesday the prime minister, treasurer and health minister all fronted the media to deliver the bad news about the impact of Covid-19. For Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison the impact on the economy was just as important to highlight as that of the health concerns. For a government that has placed so much store in achieving a budget surplus, the news was not good, but for the broader economy the news was worse. Morrison suggested \u201cthe Australian economy will depend a lot more on its domestic elements\u201d. This is true because clearly the virus affects our exports, especially to China, but he also noted \u201cbusiness as usual can be maintained here in Australia within our domestic economy\u201d. That is a problem because the current business as usual in our domestic economy is pretty dire. On Wednesday the bureau of statistics released the latest construction figures. These reflect the level of investment in the economy and are also important because the construction sector is one of our largest employers. Nine per cent of all employees work in construction, as does 17% of all men working full-time. So when construction work falls, the economy generally struggles. And it has been struggling for a long time \u2013 and importantly was doing so before the impact of the bushfires and the coronavirus occurred. In the December quarter of last year, the volume of construction work fell 1.4% in trend terms \u2013the sixth consecutive quarter of falling work: In the recent past the reason for the overall fall has been the end of the mining boom and the huge engineering construction done to build mines. But now the fall is as much about a decline in buildings being constructed: In 2019 the volume of engineering construction fell 6.8%, but almost as large was the 6.5% fall in the construction of buildings. Around 65% of buildings constructed in Australia are residential \u2013 either apartments and flats or houses. And the housing construction boom that began when the Reserve Bank cut rates at the end of 2011 is well and truly over. Last year the volume of new residential construction fell in every state except for Tasmania, and even there the growth of 1% was well down on its recent peak of 40% growth in 2018: The big concern is the decline in New South Wales. In 2019 new residential construction fell 23% \u2013 the biggest fall since 2001 when construction plummeted after people had rushed to build homes before the GST came into effect in 2000. The decline of construction in NSW and Victoria highlights just how greatly those two states have been the centre of the boom. At the start of 2010 the volume of new residential construction in those two states was roughly equal to that in the rest of the nation. By the middle of 2018 the amount of residential building in NSW and Victoria had doubled, while in the rest of the nations it had increased just 2%: The mining construction and residential building booms are over. So what now? Interest rate cuts started the last housing boom, but that was when the cash rate was 4.75% and the average discounted mortgage rate was 7.15%; now the cash rate is 0.75% and the discounted average mortgage rate is 4.15%. Sure, there might be people waiting to build a home for when the Reserve Bank cuts rates one more time, but I suspect not a lot. The market however still expects the RBA to cut the cash rate to 0.5% by July. Three months ago when the last construction figures came out, the market expected that would be as low as the cash rate would go. Now after the horror summer and Covid-19, the market believes there is a 50:50 chance that the RBA will do a further cut to 0.25%: But even that suggests little real stimulus to come from the RBA. And so we could look to the government. It is clear that the public sector has not helped fill the gap left by the private sector.

In effect it has accentuated the impact of the declining private sector at a time when it should be doing the opposite: There has been a slight increase in public sector construction work in the past few months, but clearly not enough.

Economic and trade policy are narratives in these posters.\u201d</p> <p>The exhibition, curated by Steffi Duarte, details how foreign companies expanded into the Chinese market, how Mao Zedong used socialist realism to get through to Chinese citizens and the latest wave of Chinese design.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do just a Chinese poster show, so many of these posters talk about the influence of foreign trade or the reaction to foreign trade,\u201d adds Lippert. \u201cYou see them push western products into China, in some cases it worked, others, it didn\u2019t. When communism came to power, they rejected all of that.\u201d</p> <p>The earliest posters in the show advertise soap, candles, fabric dye and even a few rather out-of-place, misguided tobacco ads featuring babies and children. They\u2019re all marked with a pastel palette, glamorous women and utopian teatime \u2013 very Victorian, very Versailles. It stems from the \u201c<em>yuefenpai</em>\u201d (calendar posters), which promoted everyday products, dressed in luxury.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2801d330e4e8b008eace19b9ecc8641011c546e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2801d330e4e8b008eace19b9ecc8641011c546e/0_0_1200_1747/687.jpg\" alt=\"The Rat Cigarettes, 1938\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rat Cigarettes, 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Feliciano/Xie Zhiguang</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey used demure, gorgeous women in high fashion to advertise condensed milk,\u201d said Lippert. \u201cThey missed the whole avant-garde era, the revolutionary European art movements in the 1920s, and got the whole \u2018when everything is controlled\u2019 art movement, which is fascinating.\u201d</p> <p>Things take a dark turn in the late 1930s, with a collection of violent military posters ahead of the second Sino-Japanese war, one which reads: Military First \u2013 Victory First.</p> <p>Things took an even stranger turn in 1949, when Mao Zedong came to power, as Chinese posters were made with overt overtones of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/oct/25/soviet-art-painting-berlin-exhibition\">Soviet socialist realism</a>.

      "bodyText": "Made in China has become shorthand for mass production and cheap labor but now, with the impact of the coronavirus, which may cost the global economy $1.1tn in lost income, this stronghold may not be quite the same. Even with the spread of disease, China is urging roughly 300m migrant workers to return to their jobs. It\u2019s a timely moment to look back at the history of the Chinese economy with The Sleeping Giant: Posters &amp; The Chinese Economy, a new exhibition featuring more than 50 posters from the 1920s to the early 2000s, covering a century of poster design \u2013 everything from products to political propaganda. \u201cEveryone knows that the Chinese economy, and trade with China, are hot button issues,\u201d said Angelina Lippert, chief curator of the Poster House in Manhattan. \u201cBut this show explains its backstory; a lot of the posters illustrate how the Chinese economy got to where it is today. Economic and trade policy are narratives in these posters.\u201d The exhibition, curated by Steffi Duarte, details how foreign companies expanded into the Chinese market, how Mao Zedong used socialist realism to get through to Chinese citizens and the latest wave of Chinese design. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to do just a Chinese poster show, so many of these posters talk about the influence of foreign trade or the reaction to foreign trade,\u201d adds Lippert. \u201cYou see them push western products into China, in some cases it worked, others, it didn\u2019t. When communism came to power, they rejected all of that.\u201d The earliest posters in the show advertise soap, candles, fabric dye and even a few rather out-of-place, misguided tobacco ads featuring babies and children. They\u2019re all marked with a pastel palette, glamorous women and utopian teatime \u2013 very Victorian, very Versailles. It stems from the \u201cyuefenpai\u201d (calendar posters), which promoted everyday products, dressed in luxury. \u201cThey used demure, gorgeous women in high fashion to advertise condensed milk,\u201d said Lippert. \u201cThey missed the whole avant-garde era, the revolutionary European art movements in the 1920s, and got the whole \u2018when everything is controlled\u2019 art movement, which is fascinating.\u201d Things take a dark turn in the late 1930s, with a collection of violent military posters ahead of the second Sino-Japanese war, one which reads: Military First \u2013 Victory First. Things took an even stranger turn in 1949, when Mao Zedong came to power, as Chinese posters were made with overt overtones of Soviet socialist realism. One from 1977 shows a countryside worker, bearing the phrase: Hard Work and Innovation are Rooted in the Countryside. \u201cThis idealized pro-countryside worker aesthetic that\u2019s very rah-rah worker,\u201d said Lippert. \u201cIt isn\u2019t acknowledging that the people pictured wouldn\u2019t be that strong, they would be half their body weight, starving.\u201d The Soviet-inspired posters \u2013 an aesthetic trailblazed by the Sternberg brothers \u2013 continued in China throughout the 1950s, illustrating the country\u2019s friendship with the Soviet Union. One sealed with a handshake, reads: \u201cWith the Great Support of the Soviet Union, and Our Own Greatest Strength, We Will Realize the Industrialization of Our Nation Step by Step!\u201d Even now, presenting a show that includes Mao was complicated. His face is in only two posters and one wall piece as part of a century-long timeline. \u201cIn the posters, he is surrounded by adoring fans and citizens,\u201d said Lippert. \u201cHis cult of personality was very comparable to Stalin\u2019s, making him into a God or savior of humanity.\u201d There\u2019s an important objective behind how these posters are presented within the exhibition. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to glorify this time period,\u201d said Lippert. \u201cWe think of Stalin and Lenin as these horrible bad dictators, but Mao was given a pop culture appeal through Andy Warhol prints, but would Warhol do a silkscreen of Hitler?

And, to be frank, we are ready to believe this.</p> <p>In fact, I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>But Barnier also said that, if the UK is committed to high standards, it should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the EU. </strong>He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.</p> <p>What that means is it should not be a problem for the UK to agree on a number of ground rules.</p> <p>And I want to be very, very clear.</p> <p>We understand that the UK wants its own rule book. We respect that choice, the UK\u2019s sovereign choice. That was the whole point of leaving the EU ...</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Adam Fleming</strong>, the BBC\u2019s Brussels correspondent, suggests Barnier was sounding a little more accommodating towards the UK at this point than in the past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/adamfleming/status/1232680841274445824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichelBarnier?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@MichelBarnier</a> finessed his rhetoric on the level playing field?  <br>\ud83d\udd39\u201cI don\u2019t believe \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames.\u201d<br>\ud83d\udd39\u201dWe understand \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\udde7 wants its own rulebook.\u201d<br>\ud83d\udd39\u201dLet\u2019s lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards...\u201d</p>&mdash; Adam Fleming (@adamfleming) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adamfleming/status/1232680841274445824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <ul> <li><strong>Barnier said a simple Canada deal was not on offer to the UK. </strong>This is what the British government is now demanding. But Barnier said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is no single template. There was never, and there never will be, a single template. The UK says it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barnier explained that Canada was not an option because the UK was much closer to the EU than Canada, and its volume of trade with the EU was much bigger. That was why level playing field provisions mattered more, he said.</p> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU was willing to offer the UK \u201csuper-preferential access\u201d - in return for assurances that competition would be free and fair.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We are ready to offer to the UK super-preferential access to our markets - a level of access that would be unprecedented for a third country.</p> <p>Is this something we can do without firm guarantees that the UK will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages? The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is simple. We cannot.</p> <p>We want competition in future but it must be fair - fair and free ...</p> <p>That is why we are asking that the EU and the UK lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards in specific areas: state aid, environmental protection and the fight against climate change, social and labour rights and taxation issues. This way we will make sure that somewhere down the road, perhaps in years to come, neither side will use unfair subsidies, nor grant derogations on industrial emissions or on labour standards to win industries from the other.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that the EU would strictly enforce rules of origin checks on British goods entering the single market from 2021 - even if there is a trade deal. </strong>Explaining why, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>On 1 January 2021, whatever the outcome of the negotiation, there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market as there are for any third country.</p> <p>These checks are particularly important given the UK\u2019s position as a major entry point into the single market and as part of these checks we will need to pay the greatest attention to the rules of origin that we will put in our trade agreement.</p> <p>Of course we love \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 but we must guarantee that the goods we import from the UK - tariff and quota free - really are British.</p> <p>We cannot take the risk that the UK becomes a kind of assembly hub for goods from all over the world, allowing them to enter the single market as British goods.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said the EU would not allow British financial institutions to get permanent equivalence status for trading in the single market from 2021.</strong> Earlier this month <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/11/barnier-tells-uk-dont-kid-yourself-about-financial-services-deal\">it emerged that the UK would be asking for permanent equivalence.</a> But Barnier said that, although the EU would be willing to grant equivalence (the right to do business, subject to certain conditions) in some sectors, equivalence decisions would remain temporary, and subject to EU discretion. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We will do so when it is in the interests of the EU, our financial stability, our investors and our consumers. But these equivalences will never be global nor permanent, nor will they be subject to joint management with the UK. They are, and will remain, unilateral decisions.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said a \u201cpoint of concern\u201d for the EU was the extent to which the British government now seems to be \u201cdistancing\u201d itself from the commitments made on Northern Ireland border rules (in the legally binding Northern Ireland protocol) and on level playing field commitments (in the political declaration).</strong> He said the EU needed to check what the UK\u2019s intentions really were in these areas \u201cin the next few days and weeks\u201d.</li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cbdd9aec289a8b749708dc1e48d1a97914dba853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cbdd9aec289a8b749708dc1e48d1a97914dba853/0_0_2074_2851/727.jpg\" alt=\"Michel Barnier\" width=\"727\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michel Barnier with his award of an honorary degree from the ESCP Business School in Brussels, which was presented to him after he gave a speech to students from the college.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fran\u00e7ois Lenoir/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T17:41:37.183Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e568b8c8f08e1332474a94e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:16:05.332Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After the audience all stood for the European anthem, Barnier is now being presented with an honorary degree.</p> <p>I will post a summary of his speech shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5685b68f08e1332474a8ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:13:23.534Z\">3.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier's Q&amp;A</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier has finished his speech. He is now taking questions.</p> <p><em>Q: Has anything surprised you in the Brexit negotiations so far?</em></p> <p>Barnier says what was surprising was that the PM could not reach a majority for a deal. </p> <p>He says he once asked Nigel Farage what his vision was for life after Brexit. He says Farage told him that after Brexit the EU would no longer exist. He says that showed that, for some people behind Brexit, they wanted to use it to destroy the EU.</p> <p>He says he is surprised by how far the British government has moved from its previous commitments (ie, in the Northern Irish protocol and in the political declaration). But the EU will have to check this in the coming days and weeks, he says.</p> <p><em>Q: You say you think the British government is distancing itself from the withdrawal agreement, and what it said about Ireland. Do you think Ireland could unite in the coming years, and Northern Ireland rejoin the EU that way?</em><br></p> <p>Barnier says he listens to everybody, including people from Northern Ireland and from Scotland. But he does not want to intervene in the national debate in the UK.</p> <p><em>Q: What are the changes since 1973 that led to the UK leaving the EU?</em></p> <p>Barnier says the UK joined the EEC mainly for trade reasons. But for Europeans, the EU is more than a supermarket, or a free trade zone. It has become an economic ecosystem. And that is why China and the US respect the EU, he says. That is why the EU will never let it unravel.</p> <p>He says there are specific British reasons for Brexit. But there are common popular views. There are many British regions where was is behind Brexit is \u201csocial anger\u201d, and the feeling that the EU does not protect people. Politicians must take the time to listen, to understand and to respond, he says. He says it is too late to do this in Britain, but not elsewhere.</p> <p>And he says you should not confuse this popular sentiment with populism. Populism used this sentiment, he says.</p> <p>And he says there are answers to people\u2019s concerns. </p> <p><em>Q: How will the EU make up for the loss of the UK\u2019s contribution?</em><br></p> <p>Barnier says the UK has been a net contributor to the EU budget. The loss amounts to 1% of the EU\u2019s GDP, he says. But he says there is a huge and very difficult debate about the budget. This debate has never been easier, but it has been made harder by the departure of the UK. The gap amounts to \u20ac10bn.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T15:54:16.283Z\">at 3.54pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5684328f08e1332474a8dc\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:49:46.367Z\">2.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says the negotiation with the UK starts on Monday.</p> <p>He says the EU has been listening to ministerial declarations from the UK, and it has seen distancing from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>The EU wants the text of that agreement implemented to the letter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e56822b8f086a28115b2f34\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:43:45.835Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier says the UK is insisting a lot on its own sovereignty.</p> <p>He says nobody contests this.</p> <p>The EU respects the UK\u2019s sovereignty, he says. But it is not just a matter of sovereignty; it is a matter of pragmatism too.</p> <p>From January 2021 there will be changes in many areas, he says.</p> <p>He says the more the UK seeks to distance itself from the common rules established over years, the more the relationship will be separate, sector by sector.</p> <p>He says the EU is not proposing that the UK loses control; it is offering the UK to use its sovereignty for mutual advantage.</p> <p>The UK is leaving 600 international agreements by virtue of Brexit, he says. This will have consequences from 2021, even if there is a deal.</p> <p>He says he has three examples.</p> <p>First, from 1 January 2021 there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market, as with any third country. This will apply even if there is a deal. He says this will involve attention being paid to rules of origin. The EU loves \u201cmade in Britain\u201d, he says. But it will want to know these goods are made in Britain. Britain cannot just become an assembly hub.</p> <p>Second, from January 2021 UK financial services firms will lose the financial passport. They will not be able to offer services in all EU states based on being British. He says they might have to establish themselves in an EU country. In some sectors the EU will grant equivalences, where it is in the EU\u2019s interest. But they will \u201cnever be global and permanent\u201d, and never be subject to joint management with the EU, he says.</p> <p>As a former financial services commissioner, Barnier says the EU cannot allow the UK to keep profits, while the EU takes on the risk. The EU must take responsibility for its financial supervision, and financial responsibility.</p> <p>Third, on goods, Barnier says the UK will not be able to grant market authorisations for things like cars and pharmaceuticals for the EU market. This function must be carried out in the EU, he says.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:55:39.357Z\">at 2.55pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e56809a8f086a28115b2f18\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T14:35:19.122Z\">2.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Barnier says UK cannot get Canada trade deal because 'UK is not Canada'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Barnier has now switched to speaking in English. </p> <p>He says trade is about more than boosting economic performance.

Johnson says he has higher standards, he says.

It was not a Geoffrey Howe-style sabotage mission by any stretch of the imagination, and the tone of his remarks \u2013 and of Boris Johnson\u2019s response \u2013 implied that a return to government at some point in the future may well be an option. But Javid did deliver two messages that sounded like polite but firm warnings about the direction in which Johnson is leading his government.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid said Johnson should not try to stop his ministers \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d. </strong>Javid resigned in the reshuffle because Johnson said he could only stay at the Treasury if he agreed to sack some of his advisers and replace them with officials jointly appointed by No 10. Javid said he thought that was unreasonable. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It has always been the case that advisers advise, minsters decide and minsters decide on their advisers. I couldn\u2019t see why the Treasury, with the vital role that it plays, should be the exception to that.</p> </blockquote> <p>More importantly, Javid suggested that Johnson would not be able to govern properly if he was not exposed to independent advice from his ministers. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A chancellor, like all cabinet ministers, has to be able to give candid advice so he is speaking truth to power. I believe that the arrangement proposed would significantly inhibit that and it would not have been in the national interest.</p> <p>So while I was grateful for the continued trust of the prime minister in wanting to reappoint me, I am afraid that these were conditions that I could not accept in good conscience.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Javid made it clear that he held Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, responsible for what happened. </strong>He made this point by means of a joke. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now I don\u2019t intend to dwell further on all the details and the personalities ... the Cummings and goings if you will.</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps that line also contains a hint that Javid was expressing a hope that Cummings himself would be going quite soon. </p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid backed Rishi Sunak, his successor.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I very much hope that the new chancellor will be given space to do his job without fear or favour. And I know that [Sunak] is more than capable of rising to the challenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the day of his resignation Javid said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/13/politics-live-cabinet-reshuffle-set-to-get-underway-live-news?page=with:block-5e4580488f0811db2faf72cd#block-5e4580488f0811db2faf72cd\">\u201cany self-respecting minister\u201d would reject the conditions imposed by Johnson</a>, implying that Sunak was not a self-respecting minister. Javid did not use the same line today, and his complimentary comments about Sunak sounded genuine.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Javid said it would be a mistake for Johnson to water down the commitments given in the Tory manifesto about reducing the national debt.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has won a huge mandate to transform our country and already he is off to a great start - ending the parliamentary paralysis, defeating the radical left, getting Brexit done, a points-based immigration system and an infrastructure revolution.</p> <p>We need a resolute focus on long-term outcomes and delivery, not short-term headlines. The Treasury as an institution, as an economic ministry should be the engine that drives this new agenda.</p> <p>But the Treasury must also be allowed to play its role as a finance ministry with the strength and credibility that it requires.</p> <p>You see, I\u2019m a proud, low-tax Conservative and I always will be. Already our tax burden is the highest it has been in 50 years.</p> <p>It is fair to say not everyone at the centre of government always feels the pressure to balance the books. It was ever thus.</p> <p>But the Treasury has a job to do. It is the only tax-cutting ministry. Every other department has an in-built incentive to seek and to spend ever more money ...</p> <p>At a time when we need to do much to level up across generations it would not be right to pass the bill for our day-to-day consumption to our children and grandchildren.</p> <p>And unlike the US, we don\u2019t have the fiscal flexibility that comes with a reserve currency, so that\u2019s why the fiscal rules that we are elected on are critical.</p> <p>To govern is to choose, and these rules crystallise the choices that are required to keep spending under control, to keep taxes low, to root out waste and to pass that fitness test that was rightfully set in stone in our manifesto on debt being lower at the end of the parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>This passage was a reference to speculation that Johnson and his new chancellor may abandon the fiscal rules announced by Javid during the general election. The Tory manifesto specifically said that under the Conservatives \u201cdebt will be lower at the end of the parliament \u2013 rather than spiralling out of control under Labour.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"52e99123c21983920b6345276c6011fa9746861f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52e99123c21983920b6345276c6011fa9746861f/29_0_1757_1054/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sajid Javid delivering his personal statement.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sajid Javid delivering his personal statement.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: House of Commons/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T13:41:41.165Z\">at 1.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5669de8f08e1332474a7ce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T12:55:29.786Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hancock is now responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary.</p> <p>Hancock thanks Ashworth, and other MPs, for taking a responsible and proportionate approach.</p> <p>There are plans in place in case of the virus becoming pandemic, he says.

The BBC says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested.</p> <p>In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot ...</p> <p>New official figures will be released on Thursday but the data <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-47059450\">for 2018 showed 4,677</a> people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010.</p> <p>However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record.</p> </blockquote> <p>Healey has asked the UK Statistics Authority to investigate. In a letter to Sir David Norgrove, its chair, he says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The government\u2019s own figures, as published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in the latest publication \u2018Rough Sleeping Statistics: Autumn 2018, England\u2019, declare that the total number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough was just 4,677. You\u2019ll be aware that this data is gathered each year on a single night in the autumn.</p> <p> In light of the new figures published today, it is clear that the use of the government\u2019s own figures as the sole official measure of rough sleeping is seriously misleading as it dramatically undercounts the number of people sleeping rough.</p> <p>You will know the longstanding concern about the government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics, including from expert organisations and charities. For example, in 2018 the charity Crisis commissioned research which calculated that the number of people sleeping rough in England is more than double what government statistics suggest. </p> <p>The UKSA\u2019s own work in this area confirmed in 2015 that these rough sleeping statistics do not meet the standards required of national statistics \u2013 trustworthiness, quality and value.</p> <p>The government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics are the sole statistics produced by government on rough sleeping so they are naturally and inevitably assumed by the public to be an accurate portrayal of the scale of rough sleeping. This is clearly not the case, as the statistics are an unreliable undercount and are an unsound basis for public policy-making or debate. I would be grateful if you would investigate the flaws in these figures and how the government\u2019s statistics could be improved so they better capture the level of rough sleeping in our country.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e676a026396ed0c0cd458d0e9eca6143990f3a94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e676a026396ed0c0cd458d0e9eca6143990f3a94/0_83_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Healey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Healey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T12:17:26.721Z\">at 12.17pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e5654eb8f08e1332474a6da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-26T11:32:48.445Z\">11.32am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sajid Javid</strong> is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor, and it is likely to come just after PMQs, according to Labour whips.</p> <p>By convention ministers who resign from cabinet are allowed to make statements to the Commons.

Theoretically, the government could opt for all three. My colleague <strong>Richard Partington</strong> has written up the IFS\u2019s assessment here.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/26/ifs-urges-rishi-sunak-to-raise-taxes-in-budget-to-fund-spending-spree\">IFS urges Rishi Sunak to raise taxes in budget to fund spending spree</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The IFS analysis also illustrates quite how severe the cuts to public spending have been over the past decade. It says that day-to-day non-NHS public spending per head is 26% lower than it was at its peak in 2010, and that welfare cuts currently in the pipeline are set to take colossal sums away from some low-income families. Here is an extract (bold type from the IFS original).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Outside of health, day-to-day public service spending per person remains 26% below its 2010 peak. </strong>\u00a354bn would be required just to return to real 2010 levels.</p> <p><strong>No department will see cuts in 2020\u201321. </strong>Beyond that there are commitments to increase spending on the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. Simply to avoid any further real-terms cuts elsewhere over the following three years the chancellor would need to find an additional \u00a33bn by 2023\u201324. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require an additional \u00a36.5bn.</strong></p> <p><strong>This would still leave cuts to means-tested support for low-income families with children slowly working their way through the system</strong>. The removal of an additional tax credit payment for the first child will eventually lead to around 3.2 million households getting \u00a3550 per year less than they would have received, while the two-child limit in means-tested benefits will eventually lead to around 750,000 households losing an average of \u00a33,600 per year.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what <strong>John McDonnell,</strong> the shadow chancellor, is saying about the IFS analysis. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This analysis shows the damage done by a decade of decline under Conservative governments, and the scale of investment needed even just to get back to 2010 spending levels.</p> <p>Ten years of Tory rule have brought 10 years of chaotic and erratic economic policy, with 16 fiscal targets proposed and ripped up and productivity growth plummeting.</p> <p>Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment. Labour will continue to call for the fair taxation and investment needed to end austerity and tackle our social and climate emergencies.</p> </blockquote> <p>This may, or may not, come up at PMQs later.

      "bodyText": "Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has said the UK should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the Brussels as part of a trade deal given Boris Johnson\u2019s claim to be committed to high standards. In a speech in Brussels (full text here), Barnier said that he believed Johnson did not want to turn the UK into a deregulated \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. But he also said that a trade deal would have to include rules to guarantee fair competition and that the UK could not have an off-the-peg Canada-style deal because \u201cthe UK is not Canada\u201d. (See 4.39pm.) The former chancellor Sajid Javid has delivered a sharp indictment of the government, saying plans to centralise the team of advisers serving No 10 and the Treasury were \u201cnot in the national interest\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn has castigated Boris Johnson for not having visited any communities affected by floods, accusing him in parliament of being \u201ca part-time prime minister\u201d. A YouGov poll of Labour members for Sky News suggests Sir Keir Starmer is on course to win with 53% of first-preference votes. Rebecca Long-Bailey is on 31%, the poll suggests, and Lisa Nandy on 16%. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has signalled another U-turn on law and order with the return of Whitehall-set targets to cut crime and warned police there will be no excuses for failure. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has clarified advice on travel to Italy following the coronavirus deaths in the north of the country after he was accused of creating confusion for British tourists. The government has rejected calls for a public inquiry into the UK flooding disaster, arguing that it has the crisis under control. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, faces a tough choice at next month\u2019s budget between raising taxes, entrenching austerity or abandoning Tory manifesto promises on government borrowing, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast. Rowena Mason is joined by Marie Le Conte, Karin Robinson, Raoul Ruparel and Tim Bale to discuss turmoil in Whitehall, the US Democrats\u2019 Super Tuesday, and the upcoming EU trade talks. Here are the main points from Michel Barnier\u2019s speech and Q&amp;A. Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, said that he accepted Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that he does not want to turn the UK into a deregulated \u201cSingapore-on-Thames\u201d. He said: Of course we have heard Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s assurances that the UK would never engage in a race to the bottom, that it would not seek to undermine European standards, that the UK would in fact maintain higher standards than the EU. And, to be frank, we are ready to believe this. In fact, I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames. But Barnier also said that, if the UK is committed to high standards, it should be willing to agree common \u201cground rules\u201d with the EU. He said: I do not believe that the UK will become some sort of Singapore-on-Thames. What that means is it should not be a problem for the UK to agree on a number of ground rules. And I want to be very, very clear. We understand that the UK wants its own rule book. We respect that choice, the UK\u2019s sovereign choice. That was the whole point of leaving the EU ... Adam Fleming, the BBC\u2019s Brussels correspondent, suggests Barnier was sounding a little more accommodating towards the UK at this point than in the past. Barnier said a simple Canada deal was not on offer to the UK. This is what the British government is now demanding. But Barnier said: There is no single template. There was never, and there never will be, a single template. The UK says it wants Canada. But the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada. Barnier explained that Canada was not an option because the UK was much closer to the EU than Canada, and its volume of trade with the EU was much bigger. That was why level playing field provisions mattered more, he said. He said the EU was willing to offer the UK \u201csuper-preferential access\u201d - in return for assurances that competition would be free and fair. He said: We are ready to offer to the UK super-preferential access to our markets - a level of access that would be unprecedented for a third country. Is this something we can do without firm guarantees that the UK will respect the level playing field and avoid unfair competitive advantages? The answer, I\u2019m afraid, is simple. We cannot. We want competition in future but it must be fair - fair and free ... That is why we are asking that the EU and the UK lay down together a number of rules building on our current high standards in specific areas: state aid, environmental protection and the fight against climate change, social and labour rights and taxation issues. This way we will make sure that somewhere down the road, perhaps in years to come, neither side will use unfair subsidies, nor grant derogations on industrial emissions or on labour standards to win industries from the other. He said that the EU would strictly enforce rules of origin checks on British goods entering the single market from 2021 - even if there is a trade deal. Explaining why, he said: On 1 January 2021, whatever the outcome of the negotiation, there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market as there are for any third country. These checks are particularly important given the UK\u2019s position as a major entry point into the single market and as part of these checks we will need to pay the greatest attention to the rules of origin that we will put in our trade agreement. Of course we love \u2018Made in Britain\u2019 but we must guarantee that the goods we import from the UK - tariff and quota free - really are British. We cannot take the risk that the UK becomes a kind of assembly hub for goods from all over the world, allowing them to enter the single market as British goods. He said the EU would not allow British financial institutions to get permanent equivalence status for trading in the single market from 2021. Earlier this month it emerged that the UK would be asking for permanent equivalence. But Barnier said that, although the EU would be willing to grant equivalence (the right to do business, subject to certain conditions) in some sectors, equivalence decisions would remain temporary, and subject to EU discretion. He said: We will do so when it is in the interests of the EU, our financial stability, our investors and our consumers. But these equivalences will never be global nor permanent, nor will they be subject to joint management with the UK. They are, and will remain, unilateral decisions. He said a \u201cpoint of concern\u201d for the EU was the extent to which the British government now seems to be \u201cdistancing\u201d itself from the commitments made on Northern Ireland border rules (in the legally binding Northern Ireland protocol) and on level playing field commitments (in the political declaration). He said the EU needed to check what the UK\u2019s intentions really were in these areas \u201cin the next few days and weeks\u201d. After the audience all stood for the European anthem, Barnier is now being presented with an honorary degree. I will post a summary of his speech shortly. Barnier has finished his speech. He is now taking questions. Q: Has anything surprised you in the Brexit negotiations so far? Barnier says what was surprising was that the PM could not reach a majority for a deal. He says he once asked Nigel Farage what his vision was for life after Brexit. He says Farage told him that after Brexit the EU would no longer exist. He says that showed that, for some people behind Brexit, they wanted to use it to destroy the EU. He says he is surprised by how far the British government has moved from its previous commitments (ie, in the Northern Irish protocol and in the political declaration). But the EU will have to check this in the coming days and weeks, he says. Q: You say you think the British government is distancing itself from the withdrawal agreement, and what it said about Ireland. Do you think Ireland could unite in the coming years, and Northern Ireland rejoin the EU that way? Barnier says he listens to everybody, including people from Northern Ireland and from Scotland. But he does not want to intervene in the national debate in the UK. Q: What are the changes since 1973 that led to the UK leaving the EU? Barnier says the UK joined the EEC mainly for trade reasons. But for Europeans, the EU is more than a supermarket, or a free trade zone. It has become an economic ecosystem. And that is why China and the US respect the EU, he says. That is why the EU will never let it unravel. He says there are specific British reasons for Brexit. But there are common popular views. There are many British regions where was is behind Brexit is \u201csocial anger\u201d, and the feeling that the EU does not protect people. Politicians must take the time to listen, to understand and to respond, he says. He says it is too late to do this in Britain, but not elsewhere. And he says you should not confuse this popular sentiment with populism. Populism used this sentiment, he says. And he says there are answers to people\u2019s concerns. Q: How will the EU make up for the loss of the UK\u2019s contribution? Barnier says the UK has been a net contributor to the EU budget. The loss amounts to 1% of the EU\u2019s GDP, he says. But he says there is a huge and very difficult debate about the budget. This debate has never been easier, but it has been made harder by the departure of the UK. The gap amounts to \u20ac10bn. Barnier says the negotiation with the UK starts on Monday. He says the EU has been listening to ministerial declarations from the UK, and it has seen distancing from the withdrawal agreement. The EU wants the text of that agreement implemented to the letter. Barnier says the UK is insisting a lot on its own sovereignty. He says nobody contests this. The EU respects the UK\u2019s sovereignty, he says. But it is not just a matter of sovereignty; it is a matter of pragmatism too. From January 2021 there will be changes in many areas, he says. He says the more the UK seeks to distance itself from the common rules established over years, the more the relationship will be separate, sector by sector. He says the EU is not proposing that the UK loses control; it is offering the UK to use its sovereignty for mutual advantage. The UK is leaving 600 international agreements by virtue of Brexit, he says. This will have consequences from 2021, even if there is a deal. He says he has three examples. First, from 1 January 2021 there will be checks and controls on all UK goods entering the single market, as with any third country. This will apply even if there is a deal. He says this will involve attention being paid to rules of origin. The EU loves \u201cmade in Britain\u201d, he says. But it will want to know these goods are made in Britain. Britain cannot just become an assembly hub. Second, from January 2021 UK financial services firms will lose the financial passport. They will not be able to offer services in all EU states based on being British. He says they might have to establish themselves in an EU country. In some sectors the EU will grant equivalences, where it is in the EU\u2019s interest. But they will \u201cnever be global and permanent\u201d, and never be subject to joint management with the EU, he says. As a former financial services commissioner, Barnier says the EU cannot allow the UK to keep profits, while the EU takes on the risk. The EU must take responsibility for its financial supervision, and financial responsibility. Third, on goods, Barnier says the UK will not be able to grant market authorisations for things like cars and pharmaceuticals for the EU market. This function must be carried out in the EU, he says. Barnier has now switched to speaking in English. He says trade is about more than boosting economic performance. It is also about maintaining and promoting high standards, he says. He says the EU has heard Boris Johnson\u2019s assurances about planning to never engage in a race to the bottom. Johnson says he has higher standards, he says. And Barnier says he believes Johnson on this. He says that means it should be possible for the two sides to agree on ground rules. The UK wants to be sovereign, Barnier says. He says the EU accepts that. But he says trade deals are about opening up markets. There is no single template that could apply for a trade deal with the UK, he says. He says the UK says it wants a Canada-style deal. \u201cBut the problem with that is that the UK is not Canada,\u201d he says. He says you can fly from Brussels to London in 70 minutes. The flight to Ottawa takes more than 10 hours, he says. And he says trade with the UK is worth more than 10 times more than trade with Canada. He says because the UK is on the EU\u2019s doorstep, the EU will insist on a level playing field. Competition must be free and fair, he says. That is why they want level playing field provisions, he says, covering state aid, environmental protection, climate change, social and labour rights and taxation. Barnier says the EU had a complex negotiation with Boris Johnson to ensure no return of a hard border in Ireland. The UK has now left. But a transitional period applies, he says. Boris Johnson has said \u201cagain and again\u201d that he will not request an extension to the transition, Barnier says. So both sides have to make the best use of the limited time available. The withdrawal agreement must be implemented, he says. He says this is a matter of trust. Barnier is recalling the referendum held in France in the early 1970s to decide whether Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Norway should be allowed to join what was then the EEC. He says he voted yes, even though he was a Gaullist and General de Gaulle was opposed. He says an interviewer recently asked why he was negotiating a new Brexit agreement, when he had already spent three years negotiating Brexit. Brexit is a divorce, he says. And all divorces have consequences. These consequences were poorly explained, he says. He says no one has been able to show him the added value of Brexit, even Nigel Farage. But where the risk is the highest is in Ireland, he says. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is speaking now. The event he is attending is mainly about the European green deal, but the chair said that Barnier would be talking about the Brexit negotiations. Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, is giving a speech in the chamber of the European parliament this afternoon for an event run by the ESCP Business School. There is a live feed here. Barnier is one of several speakers, but I will cover what he says in detail when he starts. Here is the New Statesman\u2019s Stephen Bush on Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has described Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement (see 1.37pm) as an attempt by Javid to position himself as the leader of a Thatcherite Tory faction fighting for low taxation. In a statement McDonnell said: Sajid Javid\u2019s statement is not only a damning attack on Dominic Cummings\u2019 dominance of the Johnson administration but also an unashamed leadership bid to the group of Thatcherite backbenchers committed to resisting tax rises for the wealthiest and big business. Choppy waters are ahead for Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson. Here are the key points from Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation statement. It was not a Geoffrey Howe-style sabotage mission by any stretch of the imagination, and the tone of his remarks \u2013 and of Boris Johnson\u2019s response \u2013 implied that a return to government at some point in the future may well be an option. But Javid did deliver two messages that sounded like polite but firm warnings about the direction in which Johnson is leading his government. Javid said Johnson should not try to stop his ministers \u201cspeaking truth to power\u201d. Javid resigned in the reshuffle because Johnson said he could only stay at the Treasury if he agreed to sack some of his advisers and replace them with officials jointly appointed by No 10. Javid said he thought that was unreasonable. He said: It has always been the case that advisers advise, minsters decide and minsters decide on their advisers. I couldn\u2019t see why the Treasury, with the vital role that it plays, should be the exception to that. More importantly, Javid suggested that Johnson would not be able to govern properly if he was not exposed to independent advice from his ministers. He said: A chancellor, like all cabinet ministers, has to be able to give candid advice so he is speaking truth to power. I believe that the arrangement proposed would significantly inhibit that and it would not have been in the national interest. So while I was grateful for the continued trust of the prime minister in wanting to reappoint me, I am afraid that these were conditions that I could not accept in good conscience. Javid made it clear that he held Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, responsible for what happened. He made this point by means of a joke. He said: Now I don\u2019t intend to dwell further on all the details and the personalities ... the Cummings and goings if you will. Perhaps that line also contains a hint that Javid was expressing a hope that Cummings himself would be going quite soon. Javid backed Rishi Sunak, his successor. He said: I very much hope that the new chancellor will be given space to do his job without fear or favour. And I know that [Sunak] is more than capable of rising to the challenge. On the day of his resignation Javid said that \u201cany self-respecting minister\u201d would reject the conditions imposed by Johnson, implying that Sunak was not a self-respecting minister. Javid did not use the same line today, and his complimentary comments about Sunak sounded genuine. Javid said it would be a mistake for Johnson to water down the commitments given in the Tory manifesto about reducing the national debt. He said: The prime minister has won a huge mandate to transform our country and already he is off to a great start - ending the parliamentary paralysis, defeating the radical left, getting Brexit done, a points-based immigration system and an infrastructure revolution. We need a resolute focus on long-term outcomes and delivery, not short-term headlines. The Treasury as an institution, as an economic ministry should be the engine that drives this new agenda. But the Treasury must also be allowed to play its role as a finance ministry with the strength and credibility that it requires. You see, I\u2019m a proud, low-tax Conservative and I always will be. Already our tax burden is the highest it has been in 50 years. It is fair to say not everyone at the centre of government always feels the pressure to balance the books. It was ever thus. But the Treasury has a job to do. It is the only tax-cutting ministry. Every other department has an in-built incentive to seek and to spend ever more money ... At a time when we need to do much to level up across generations it would not be right to pass the bill for our day-to-day consumption to our children and grandchildren. And unlike the US, we don\u2019t have the fiscal flexibility that comes with a reserve currency, so that\u2019s why the fiscal rules that we are elected on are critical. To govern is to choose, and these rules crystallise the choices that are required to keep spending under control, to keep taxes low, to root out waste and to pass that fitness test that was rightfully set in stone in our manifesto on debt being lower at the end of the parliament. This passage was a reference to speculation that Johnson and his new chancellor may abandon the fiscal rules announced by Javid during the general election. The Tory manifesto specifically said that under the Conservatives \u201cdebt will be lower at the end of the parliament \u2013 rather than spiralling out of control under Labour.\u201d Hancock is now responding to Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. Hancock thanks Ashworth, and other MPs, for taking a responsible and proportionate approach. There are plans in place in case of the virus becoming pandemic, he says. But he says the government is still working on the basis of plans to contain the virus. He says people should only travel to the quarantined areas in Italy if their travel is essential. He says it is important that the government is not advising the blanket closure of schools. Testing sites are available at all A&amp;E facilities in England, he says, but the NHS also wants to introduce home testing for the virus. That will allow the government to roll out testing for a much wider group of people, he says. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Commons statement now on coronavirus. He says there have been 13 cases of the virus in the UK. Eight of those people have been discharged, he says. But the government expects more cases to arise, he says. He says the government has a four-point strategy for dealing with this: contain, delay, research and mitigate. He says the government will be rolling out a publicity campaign soon. Yesterday advice for travellers coming back to the UK from northern Italy and some other countries was published. He says the government is coordinating with its international partners to ensure it is ready for all eventualities. Boris Johnson, intervening on a point of order, thanks Javid for his contribution and says Javid should know \u201che has friends and admirers\u201d on all sides of the Commons. Javid says he is a proud low-tax Conservative. But the tax burden is the highest it has been for 50 years. Not everyone in government is committed to keeping taxes down, he says. He says the Treasury is the only tax-cutting department in government. He says the government should not pass down debt to our grandchildren. And he says, unlike the US, the UK does not have a reserve currency. He says that is why he supports the rule that debt should be falling by the end of this parliament. The Tories have the chance to implement wholesale renewal, he says. And they can put social justice at the heart of a more human capitalism. He says the PM has the tenacity to see this through. Boris Johnson has his full support, he says. Javid says he wants to explain why he resigned. He thanks MPs who have supported him, and he thanks his family. He came into politics to give something back, he says. He says he hopes he has more to contribute to public life. He ran four departments, he says. Each taught him something. He never took a decision that he did not think to be in the national interest, he says. He says this country is strong because of its institutions. Conservatives believe that no one person has a monopoly on good ideas, he says. He says there is no one model for the No 10/No 11 relationship. That relationship should depend on \u201cmutual trust\u201d, he says. It should be the case that \u201cadvisers advise, ministers decide, and ministers decide on their advisers\u201d. He says the chancellor must be able to give candid advice to the PM, and to \u201cspeak truth unto power\u201d. He says he could not stay as chancellor because the conditions imposed by the PM would not make this possible. He will not dwell any more on this \u2013 on \u201cthe Cummings and goings, if you will\u201d, he jokes. He says the new chancellor must be allowed to do his job. Rishi Sunak is capable of rising to the challenge, he says. Sajid Javid says it is eight years since he last spoke as a backbencher. He is proud to represent the people of Bromsgrove, he says. And he will champion the causes he believes in most - but from outside government. He says he had hoped to stay in government longer. Labour\u2019s Ian Mearns asks about the Marmot report and health inequalities affecting Gateshead. What will the PM do to ensure that people in Gateshead can live as long as people in Johnson\u2019s constituency? Johnson says he has enormous respect for Prof Marmot. He worked with him as London mayor. But there is more to be done, he says. That is why the government believes in levelling up. Daniel Kawczynski, a Conservative, asks about flooding in Shrewsbury. Johnson says the environment department will do what is necessary. The SNP\u2019s David Linden asks about religious intolerance in India. Will the PM meet him to discuss this? Johnson says this is a crucial issue. He is particularly keen to defend religious freedom, and to protect those of a Christian faith. Marco Longhi, a Conservative, asks about plans for a university campus in Dudley. Johnson says he will look at this. Labour\u2019s Gerald Jones asks whether the PM will give Wales the funding it needs to recover from flooding. Johnson says this is a devolved matter. But the government will work flat-out to make sure Wales gets the cash it needs. Theresa Villiers, the former environment secretary, asks the PM to resist the selling-out of fishing communities. Johnson says he \u201cwill indeed\u201d. He says the SNP would hand back control of fishing to Brussels. Boris Johnson was able to rouse a cheer from the Tory benches with his final answer to Jeremy Corbyn, which involved a rumbustious but badly aimed rant about Labour (no one in the opposition is arguing for the UK to rejoin the EU), but it could not disguise the fact that by then he had been comprehensively clobbered over his decision to go Awol last week when the country was under water. Corbyn was not especially witty or forensic, but he was saying what many people think (which is enough) and his comments about Johnson being a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d and only \u201cpretending to care\u201d will register. No 10 types have been briefing that the row about the PM\u2019s extended absence last week was a Westminster bubble controversy that does not matter to voters. But that\u2019s the sort of thing spin doctors always say when they are on the defensive, and it does not sound very plausible. Next time flooding strikes I expect Johnson will be searching for his wellies ... Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says immigration is crucial for the Scottish economy. The Scottish government\u2019s plans for a Scottish visa system have been welcomed by business and even Scottish Tories. Does the PM accept it was a mistake to reject the plan? Johnson says this idea was rejected by the migration advisory committee. He says under the government\u2019s plan, firms will be able to get the workers they need. Blackford says the PM is \u201cdelusional\u201d. He says the care sector will suffer, the GMB union says firms could be tipped over the edge, and the Scottish Tourism Alliance says the immigration plans will be devastating for the sector. Do Scottish businesses matter? Of course Scottish businesses matter, says Johnson. He says SNP plans for tax rises would penalise them. Corbyn says he has learned a lot from visiting victims of flooding. The PM should try it. He says people cannot get insurance. Isn\u2019t it time the PM found an urgent solution to this problem? Just imagine what it must be like. People are looking to the government for help. Johnson says there are problems with insurance. But the government scheme has helped many households. He says he is looking at what can be done to protect homes that cannot get insurance. He says any government led by Corbyn would not be able to help. Corbyn says the Welsh Labour government has done what it can. He says Johnson often goes Awol. He was on holiday when the London riots happened, he was away when the Iranian general was assassinated, and he was away last week. He says Johnson is a \u201cpart-time prime minister\u201d. Last night Johnson was schmoozing Tory donors instead of helping flood victims. Johnson says the government has stopped the early release of terrorists, and it is hiring more police officers. He says it can do this because it has a strong economy. The opposition is jabbering away because they cannot decide whether they want to be in the EU. The hottest topic in Labour is what job Corbyn should have in the shadow cabinet. The government is delivering on the people\u2019s communities, he says. Corbyn says no Cobra has been called. Is Johnson just \u201cpretending to care\u201d? Johnson says there has been a stream of ministerial meetings. He says he has been directing things. He says Cobra is Cabinet Office briefing room A. It is not the only place where meetings can take place. Corbyn says people need help, not \u201ctrite answers like that\u201d. Does Johnson agree with the Tory MP Philip Davies who says the government has done little to protect people from floods. Johnson says the government is doing a lot to protect homes. Jeremy Corbyn says his thoughts are with those suffering from coronavirus. He says he hopes the health services will get the resources they need. He pays tribute to the work of those helping flooding victims. Does the PM agree with the Conservative leader of Derbyshire county council that he has turned his back on flooding victims? Johnson says the government has been working to ensure the victims get the help they need. Corbyn quotes the Tory council leader. He says he visited flood victims. But the PM was silent, sulking in his grace and favour mansion at Chevening. When will the PM stop hiding and show he cares? Or is he too busy doing something else? If he is, he could send Dominic Cummings. Johnson says there has been \u201ca constant stream of ministerial activity\u201d on this. He says 200,000 households have been protected from flooding by government measures. Philip Dunne, a Conservative, says Storm Dennis has brought record high water levels. Over 100 properties in his Ludlow constituency have been flooded. Will the government spend more on flood defences? Johnson says it will. The government is investing \u201cmassively\u201d in flood defences, he says. Boris Johnson starts by expressing condolences to the family and friends of those killed in the recent storms. According to the Evening Standard, Sajid Javid\u2019s resignation speech will be \u201cdramatic\u201d. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Labour is demanding an investigation into claims that the level of rough sleeping in England is five times as high as official figures say. John Healey, the shadow housing secretary, has been prompted to act by this BBC story, which is based on freedom of information requests to councils. The BBC says: More than 28,000 people in the UK were recorded sleeping rough in 12 months, research by the BBC has suggested. In England five times as many rough sleepers were seen by councils in the year than reported in official figures, which are a one-night snapshot ... New official figures will be released on Thursday but the data for 2018 showed 4,677 people slept rough in England on the one night the snapshot survey was taken, down 2% on the year before but 165% up on 2010. However council responses to the BBC showed nearly 25,000 people were recorded sleeping rough at least once in England during the latest year on record. Healey has asked the UK Statistics Authority to investigate. In a letter to Sir David Norgrove, its chair, he says: The government\u2019s own figures, as published by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in the latest publication \u2018Rough Sleeping Statistics: Autumn 2018, England\u2019, declare that the total number of people counted or estimated to be sleeping rough was just 4,677. You\u2019ll be aware that this data is gathered each year on a single night in the autumn. In light of the new figures published today, it is clear that the use of the government\u2019s own figures as the sole official measure of rough sleeping is seriously misleading as it dramatically undercounts the number of people sleeping rough. You will know the longstanding concern about the government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics, including from expert organisations and charities. For example, in 2018 the charity Crisis commissioned research which calculated that the number of people sleeping rough in England is more than double what government statistics suggest. The UKSA\u2019s own work in this area confirmed in 2015 that these rough sleeping statistics do not meet the standards required of national statistics \u2013 trustworthiness, quality and value. The government\u2019s rough sleeping statistics are the sole statistics produced by government on rough sleeping so they are naturally and inevitably assumed by the public to be an accurate portrayal of the scale of rough sleeping. This is clearly not the case, as the statistics are an unreliable undercount and are an unsound basis for public policy-making or debate. I would be grateful if you would investigate the flaws in these figures and how the government\u2019s statistics could be improved so they better capture the level of rough sleeping in our country. Sajid Javid is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor, and it is likely to come just after PMQs, according to Labour whips. By convention ministers who resign from cabinet are allowed to make statements to the Commons. In the past some of these interventions (eg, Geoffrey Howe\u2019s) have been devastating, but mostly ex-ministers tend not to make these resignation statements now and, when they do, their content tends to be quite measured. According to Politico, Javid plans to be \u201cconstructive and positive\u201d. George Eustice, the environment secretary, held a press conference at the National Farmers\u2019 Union conference in Birmingham where he was speaking this morning. As ITV\u2019s Daniel Hewitt reports, Eustice defended the PM\u2019s decision not to visit areas recently flooded, even though he did visit flood victims during the general election campaign last year. Eustice said the PM felt he had to get involved last year because the purdah period in force during the election meant that, without his intervention, Whitehall was slow to get a grip on the crisis. Turning back to the budget, here are three related stories from today\u2019s papers. Christopher Hope in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) says 18 Conservative MPs from the party\u2019s blue collar group have written to the chancellor expressing concern about reports that fuel duty could rise. Hope says: Eighteen MPs from the blue collar group of Conservative MPs caucus \u2013 14 of whom were elected for the first time in 2019 in north and Midlands of England \u2013 wrote to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, expressing \u201cdeep concern\u201d the fuel duty freeze will be scrapped. A small increase would raise an extra \u00a34bn worth of funding for the Treasury. Fuel duty could rise by up to two pence which will see overall petrol and diesel costs increase, according to reports. However in the letter the group says: \u201cWe are writing to express our deep concern following reports that you are considering scrapping the fuel duty freeze at this year\u2019s budget. \u201cIf the decision was taken to raise taxes on fuel, hard-working people and businesses in blue-collar communities \u2013 many of which lent us their support at the general election for the first time in generations \u2013 will suffer.\u201d Francis Elliott and Steven Swinford in the Times (paywall) say the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to cut subsidies for a type of diesel used by off-road vehicles and machinery instead of ending the fuel duty freeze. They say: The chancellor is shifting more of the cost of meeting climate change targets from consumers to business as he finalises the budget, say allies. They suggest that he is cooling on ending the 10-year freeze on fuel duty amid a mounting backlash from Tory MPs. Instead, he is preparing new environmental taxes, including heavy restrictions on the use of so-called red diesel. Matt Dathan in the Sun says Sunak is considering raising almost \u00a31bn by closing two inheritance tax loopholes. He says: The Sun understands the chancellor is mulling closing two tax reliefs rich families use to funnel money through ghost companies and farmland before they die. Rich Brits cut down the amount of inheritance tax they have to pay by setting up a business or buying land, which can be passed on to their family after death. Agricultural relief and business property relief can protect between 50% and 100% of money invested from inheritance tax. Ending business relief would raise the Treasury an estimated \u00a3480m a year and stopping agricultural relief would bring in \u00a3320m. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is making a Commons statement on coronavirus after 12.30pm. Here is Jack Blanchard\u2019s take on Sir Keir Starmer getting Sadiq Khan\u2019s endorsement from the London Playbook briefing. It\u2019s a big boost for Starmer\u2019s campaign, though probably comes as no great surprise to Labour Kremlinologists, given Khan and Starmer are both London-based lawyers with closely aligned political outlooks, and actually go back years (Khan used to brief Starmer when he was a human rights solicitor). But a public endorsement from Labour\u2019s most powerful elected politician will nevertheless give further credence to Starmer\u2019s status as the clear frontrunner. And Sir Keir Starmer has responded to the news he has been endorsed by Sadiq Khan. Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, has announced that he is voting for Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, for Labour leader. Kit Malthouse, the minister for the police, has been giving interviews this morning. Here are three of the lines that emerged. Malthouse played down reports that his boss, the home secretary, Priti Patel, bullied civil servants. Asked whether she was a bully, he replied: I haven\u2019t witnessed any of that. To be honest with you, I\u2019m totally focused on crime. Everybody in the Home Office is focused on that, rather than on the sort of soap opera, I\u2019m afraid. He claimed there was no longer a rift between Patel and Sir Philip Rutnam, the Home Office permanent secretary whom Patel was reportedly trying to remove. Asked about this, Malthouse said: [Rutnam] and the home secretary have put out a joint statement showing, I think, glutinous harmony, as the prime minister would call it. Hopefully now we can get on with the mission. Malthouse said it was up to the House of Lords to decide whether Tom Watson, the former Labour deputy leader, was fit to receive a peerage in the light of the role he played in publicising false claims about Westminster figures being involved in child abuse. Asked whether Watson should go to the Lords, Malthouse said: There is a process of the House of Lords now that is independent that will have a look at whether he should or he shouldn\u2019t, as it would with all nominees. I don\u2019t really want to interfere with that. Jeremy Corbyn has reportedly nominated Watson for a peerage in the forthcoming dissolution honours. On universal credit, Paul Johnson says some people will gain a lot, and some people will lose a lot. Some of the cuts are still working their way through the system, he says. Q: Where will the money come from? Johnson says there has been talk of cutting pension tax relief for high-earners. But this will hit people earning between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 \u2013 exactly the group that Boris Johnson promised to help when he was standing for Tory leader, Johnson says. He says council tax could be reformed to raise tax on higher-value properties. And he suggests that the entrepreneurs\u2019 tax relief could go. Only a small number of people benefit from it, he says. Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is now being interviewed on Sky\u2019s All Out Politics about the IFS budget assessment out today. (See 9.09am.) He says this could be \u201ca really big moment\u201d for the British economy. Last year was the first year without a budget since the 1800s. And previous budgets were minor, because the government did not have a proper majority. So this will be the first major budget for years, he says. He makes the IFS point about the government having to choose between raising taxes, continuing with austerity, or breaking its rules on borrowing. He says, outside of infrastructure, the government did not make many promises on spending in the Conservative manifesto. But reversing the cuts of the last 10 years would be very expensive, he says. He says we will see in the budget whether the government is serious about reversing those cuts. Boris Johnson replaced his chancellor in the reshuffle two weeks ago but changing the underlying economic outlook facing the country is not so straightforward and, as the Institute of Fiscal Studies points out in an analysis today, the government faces difficult choices in the budget. \u201cRaise taxes, entrench austerity or break a fiscal rule,\u201d as the IFS puts it in the headline of its press release. Theoretically, the government could opt for all three. My colleague Richard Partington has written up the IFS\u2019s assessment here. The IFS analysis also illustrates quite how severe the cuts to public spending have been over the past decade. It says that day-to-day non-NHS public spending per head is 26% lower than it was at its peak in 2010, and that welfare cuts currently in the pipeline are set to take colossal sums away from some low-income families. Here is an extract (bold type from the IFS original). Outside of health, day-to-day public service spending per person remains 26% below its 2010 peak. \u00a354bn would be required just to return to real 2010 levels. No department will see cuts in 2020\u201321. Beyond that there are commitments to increase spending on the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. Simply to avoid any further real-terms cuts elsewhere over the following three years the chancellor would need to find an additional \u00a33bn by 2023\u201324. Maintaining spending on unprotected services as a share of national income would require an additional \u00a36.5bn. This would still leave cuts to means-tested support for low-income families with children slowly working their way through the system. The removal of an additional tax credit payment for the first child will eventually lead to around 3.2 million households getting \u00a3550 per year less than they would have received, while the two-child limit in means-tested benefits will eventually lead to around 750,000 households losing an average of \u00a33,600 per year. And this is what John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, is saying about the IFS analysis. This analysis shows the damage done by a decade of decline under Conservative governments, and the scale of investment needed even just to get back to 2010 spending levels. Ten years of Tory rule have brought 10 years of chaotic and erratic economic policy, with 16 fiscal targets proposed and ripped up and productivity growth plummeting. Despite all the hype about this budget turning a page, it risks setting in train five years of disappointment. Labour will continue to call for the fair taxation and investment needed to end austerity and tackle our social and climate emergencies. This may, or may not, come up at PMQs later. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The Institute for Fiscal Studies publishes its assessment of the options for next month\u2019s budget. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 12.30pm: Sajid Javid is expected to make a statement to MPs following his resignation as chancellor. 2pm: Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, gives a speech in Brussels. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up.

If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone.

      "bodyText": "Italian prosecutors have opened an investigation into the procedures adopted by hospitals in the Lombardy region at the centre of Europe\u2019s coronavirus epidemic, amid reports doctors initially delayed testing an Italian \u201csuper-spreader\u201d, allowing the disease to proliferate rapidly including beyond the country\u2019s borders. As new cases were confirmed in Spain, France, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Norway and Algeria, it was reported that a hospital in Lombardy, where the bulk of the infections are located, delayed testing \u201cpatient-one\u201d, a 38-year-old man who is believed to be the first source of local transmission. The virus has so far killed 12 people in Italy, the latest victim being a 70-year-old woman in Emilia-Romagna. Cases across the country have reached more than 400 by Wednesday night, among them five children aged between four and 15. Police officers carried out overnight inspections on hospitals in the Lombardy towns of Codogno, the centre of the outbreak, Casalpusterlengo and Lodi. The investigation comes after the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, blamed an unnamed hospital for contributing to the spread of the virus by failing to adhere to proper procedures. Reporting in Italian media has focused on whether medical staff missed opportunities to identify coronavirus in patient one \u2013 identified as \u201cMattia\u201d \u2013 who remains seriously ill in hospital in Pavia, south of Milan. The man is believed to have infected his pregnant wife and a friend he went running with as well as three elderly people who frequented a bar owned by his friend\u2019s father. He has also been linked to eight other infections, among them health workers and patients at the hospital in Codogno, one of them reportedly being a 77-year-old woman who died of the illness on Sunday. The woman was suffering from pneumonia and tested positive for the virus postmortem. Critics claim that emergency health guidelines introduced in late January mean that the man should have been treated as a potential suspected case, and tested, even without clear connections to China, because of his symptoms. According to reports in the Italian media it took four contacts with doctors before the man was eventually tested for coronavirus, and then only after he had spent 36 hours at a hospital in Codogno before being put under isolation, a period during which he infected a number of other people. Some staff at the hospital have complained that even after he tested positive it still took hours before all staff were warned of the risk. According to details that have leaked out slowly in recent days in the midst of Italy\u2019s escalating coronavirus crisis, it appears that the man first complained of feeling unwell around 14 February and went to his GP \u2013 also now in hospital with coronavirus \u2013 where he was given flu medication. With his symptoms failing to improve, he then attended hospital on 16 February, returning again to A&amp;E two days later on February 18 where he was discharged again without being tested because of a lack of any links with China. On 19 February, just after 3am in the morning, the man, experiencing breathing difficulties, visited the hospital for a third time. On this occasion the man\u2019s wife recalled he may have had contact with a friend recently returned from China. Even then he was only tested for the virus 36 hours later at about 4pm on 20 February during which time he had been visited by numerous friends and family who were able to come and go freely. While Conte did not explicitly refer to the hospital in Codogno where the first man tested positive, his comments prompted a backlash from Attilio Fontana, the regional president.

Dr Doom\u201d, as he\u2019s known, reckons \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d, as the chances of a global recession rise.</p> \n  <p>Roubini argues that investors are guilty of several \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, and need to realise several things:</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Covid-19 is going to be a global pandemic, and last for longer than first thought.<br></strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The view that the economic impact will peak before the end of the first quarter now looks very shaky. The damage to China is severe, and global supply chains are being seriously disrupted, at a time when China accounts for about 20 per cent of global gross domestic product, not the tiny 4 per cent it had at the time of Sars in 2003.</p> \n   <p>Add to that an economic shock to big economies like Japan, South Korea and Italy. When the disease spreads to other developed and emerging markets, this damage will increase.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) China\u2019s economy will not rebound quickly, as some economists hoped:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The idea of a V-shaped recovery is nonsensical. Suppose that the best Goldilocks scenario does occur: the shock to China hits only the first quarter and the contagion is mostly contained to the country. If its output shrinks just 2 per cent in the first quarter, that is an annualised contraction of 8 per cent. A V-shaped rebound would therefore require the same annualised growth, which exceeds the 6 per cent that China managed before the virus. </p> \n   <p>Assuming that China will rebound at this rate in the final three quarters of the year \u2014 which would imply growth in 2020 of 4 per cent \u2014 is heroically optimistic. It is more likely that a V-shape shows growth returning to a pre-virus annualised level of 6 per cent from the second quarter onwards. In this case, China\u2019s calendar-year growth would be 2.5 per cent.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>3) Governments and central banks can\u2019t step in and protect their economies.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Fiscal policy will react very slowly, or not at all, given political and other constraints. Central banks are running out of bullets: how much more negative can the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and others go on interest rates?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1232607277636603904\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Markets remain complacent about coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "A late newsflash: Microsoft has warned that its More Personal Computing division won\u2019t hit its targets for the current quarter, due to the coronavirus. Just after the market closed, the software revealed that its supply chain \u201cis returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated\u201d, due to disruption in China. That means the personal computing division, including MS\u2019s Surface laptop arm, won\u2019t sell as many units as hoped. \u201cAs a result, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated.\u201d And that\u2019s all for tonight! GW Closing report: Wall Street couldn\u2019t hold onto its earlier gains, and has posted another loss. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 123 points, or 0.46%, at 26,957. That\u2019s a new four-month low. The broader S&amp;P 500 ended 0.38% down. The Nasdaq managed to keep its head, though, finishing a modest 0.17% up. With new cases reported in Norway, Pakistan and Georgia for the first time today, plus more cases in China, Iran, Italy, South Korea and beyond, the coronavirus is still weighing on markets. As Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist with Bruderman Asset Management, told MarketWatch. \u201cThe last couple of days have seen like an emotional reaction, as opposed to a fact-based reaction. The reality is that the data is coming in so quickly and changing so quickly,\u201d he said about the spread of the illness beyond Asia. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to see that changing over then next three or four weeks.\u201d Reminder: our main, comprehensive, coronavirus liveblog is still running: A handy recap: Oh dear, the Wall Street rally has indeed stumbled. The Dow is now in the red, down 97 points or 0.36%, at 26,983. Despite Donald Trump\u2019s claim that the market looked to be offering value at these prices, traders are still edgy. I\u2019ll be back with the Wall Street close in a couple of hours.... Hmmmm. Wall Street may be struggling to hold onto its gains. The Dow nearly dropped into negative territory a few minutes ago, and is currently only up 0.5% today. Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz fears the market isn\u2019t strong enough for a sustained recovery: The sentiment in the markets has improved a little, says David Madden of CMC Markets, even if the Covid-19 crisis hasn\u2019t. He says: The health crisis is getting worse, but markets don\u2019t move in straight lines, so at some point there was going to be a switch in sentiment, and that\u2019s what we are seeing today.... The mood on Wall Street has turned optimistic and traders are buying back into equities in the wake of major losses earlier this week. The solid US new homes sales was a pleasant reminder there are positive aspects to the US economy, as the reading came in at 764,00, which smashed the 710,000 forecast. Despite this afternoon\u2019s late recovery, it\u2019s been a rough few days for the Footsie. Britain\u2019s blue-chip index is still 5% down this week - bad news for pension-holders and other savers. The healthcare, utility, basic materials anfd financial sectors all led the recovery in London today. But consumer-focused firms, such as housebuilders and retailers, fell. Just in! London\u2019s stock market has clawed its way back from this morning\u2019s one-year low. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK-listed shares has close 24 points higher at 7042, up 0.35%. Quite a recovery, given it was down 106 points at one stage this morning. That still leaves the index down around 5% this week, but it suggests the panic over Covid-19 may be easing. Other European markets also recovered from this morning\u2019s slump, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB gaining 1.5% (after two days of chunky falls), and France flat. Why the recovery, given the coronavirus crisis has hardly gone away? Well, there will be some bargain-hunting, with investors betting that the index has fallen too far, too fast, in recent days. Wall Street has also helped. The sight of the Dow Jones jumping by 400 points has calmed investors nerves in Europe. Connor Campbell of SpreadEx sums up the mood: The Dow Jones rode in like something of a white knight on Wednesday afternoon, rescuing Europe from its intraday lows. The Dow added 350 points after the bell, a rebound likely born of nothing more than bargain-hunting investors sweeping in at near-4 month lows. That pushed the index above 27400 \u2013 for reference, around 1,100 points shy of its mid-February all-time highs. US equity markets are \u201cfacing this coronavirus like buffalo, with their heads into the storm and marching onwards\u201d, says Neil Wilson of Markets.com. But with Wall Street up 1.5% today, this optimism may be displaced (and a reminder that even a dead cat will bounce if you drop it far enough). Here are six reasons why, in his words, the recovery looks \u201cdecidedly feline and rather deceased\u201d: Markets are still conditioned to buy on the dip - and what a dip we have had. a drop of 2000 Dow points in 2 days is plenty downside baked in already even if the economy takes a scrubbing in Q1. The market has already priced for a spread of cases in the US &amp; Europe. Donald Trump says if you\u2019re not buying you\u2019re chicken and an MSM putz. No material deterioration in the situation in the US with regards the virus (there is a lot of expected bad news already priced in). But we\u2019re only talking a few hours having passed. Several technicals were indicating oversold conditions. All moves have pullbacks, all trends have countertrends. These are by definition short-lived - or they become the trend. Despite the bounce the bulls are not yet in charge of this. Eek. More UK jobs cuts, this time at Virgin Money. That takes today\u2019s total of job losses over 2,000, following the 1,600 jobs being axed at Lloyds Banking Group and Direct Line Insurance. Today\u2019s recovery may be driven by hopes that Donald Trump calms the crisis, when he speaks this evening (6pm New York time). (spoos is the contract to buy or sell the S&amp;P 500) Tech stocks are sizzling on Wall Street, with Netflix up by 5%, NVIDIA up 4.6%, Oracle up 3.75% and Micron Technology at 3.7%. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust, fears economic growth will be hit by measures to contain Covid-19, as it spreads beyond China. Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman is scathing about the US government\u2019s response to Covid-19: It\u2019s been a bad day for the UK labour market. Lloyds Banking Group, insurance group Direct Line and fashion chain Ted Baker have all announced job cut plans, a day after Tesco said 1,800 jobs were at risk at its supermarket bakeries. Wall Street is pushing higher.... The oil price is now recovering from today\u2019s one-year low, after US energy stocks rose by less than expected. The Energy Information Administration has reported that crude oil inventories rose by 452,000 barrels in the last week, below analyst forecasts of a 2 million-barrel rise. Stocks of gasoline and distillate fell, and by more than expected, which all suggests demand for oil was higher than thought. An encouraging signal for growth (if not for climate change). Some encouraging news -- US home sales have hit their highest level since the financial crisis, some 12 years ago. Sales of new American single-family homes jumped 7.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 764,000 units last month, the Commerce Department says. That\u2019s the highest level since July 2007, just before the credit crunch. It suggests US consumer confidence was pretty strong last month, which could help it survive the shock of the coronavirus. Virtually every sector of the New York stock market has risen in early trading, as Wall Street tries to end this week\u2019s slide. But Disney is dragging the consumer sector back. Its shares are down 1.25% after CEO Bob Iger surprisingly announced he was stepping down last night. Wall Street\u2019s recovery has dragged the London\u2019s stock market away from this morning\u2019s one-year low. The FTSE 100 just briefly turned positive, nudging back over the 7,000 point mark. Nearly every company on the Dow is up this morning -- which makes a change! Healthcare firms are leading the risers, with UnitedHealth up 2.2% and Walgreen Boots up 1.6%. Microsoft has gained 1.8%, as tech shares rebound, while credit card firm Visa (which has suffered from economic slowdown fears), is 1.7% higher. Here\u2019s the state of play regarding coronavirus infections: Newsflash: Wall Street has opened higher, as US traders try to hold their nerve after two days of wild declines. The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped by 200 points, or 0.75%, at the start of trading. That lifts the index to 27,287, up from last night\u2019s four-month low. The broader-based S&amp;P 500 is up 0.8%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq has jumped by 1%. An encouraging start. But don\u2019t forget the Dow lost 1,900 points over the last two days, so this is a very modest recovery. Some investors may be suspecting, like Royal London, that stock prices look rather attractive. But others may remember Nouriel Roubini\u2019s warning that there is worst to come, if Covid-19 becomes a full-scale global pandemic... Not every investors is hammering the sell button today. Trevor Greetham, head of multi asset at Royal London Asset Management, says he\u2019s \u201cbuying the dip\u201d - betting that stocks will soon recover from this week\u2019s tumble. Greetham argues that the markets have over-reacted to the spread of Covid-19, and that a global recession will be avoided (especially if central banks cut interest rates to support growth, or Donald Trump cuts taxes): \u201cWe are buying the dip in our multi asset funds, moving to a high conviction overweight position in stocks. While it is impossible to know how much economic damage measures to contain the virus will cause over the next few months, markets have a strong tendency to overreact to bad news in the short term and our contrarian investor sentiment indicator is once again registering a buy signal.\u201d \u201cAs longer term investors we find it usually pays off to look on the bright side when others are panicking. Virus disruption is very unlikely to force the world economy into recession. We expect to see a large but temporary hit to economic activity followed by a bounce back later in the year that additional stimulus could make stronger than it otherwise would be. But Greetham also expects plenty of market volatility in the weeks ahead: \u201cWe are not complacent about the risks. We expect markets to remain choppy for weeks or perhaps months as investors weigh up good and bad news on the outbreak and its impact. We will look to trim equity exposure on rallies and buy on dips during this period. With inflation low, the longer term prospects for the world economy and stock markets remain positive, especially if additional stimulus is in the offing.\u201d. European stock markets appear to be recovering their earlier losses! The Italian FTSE MIB is now up 1.5% today, clawing back some of this week\u2019s losses, while the Stoxx 600 index is now flat. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down just 23 points at 6994, nudging back towards the 7,000 point mark. This recovery comes as the World Health Organisation reports there are now more new coronavirus cases outside China than inside. That suggests China may be getting to grips with Covid-19, just as it spreads faster in countries like Iran, South Korea and Italy. Greece\u2019s stock market has fallen sharply, since its first coronavirus case was reported today. The Athens stock index has slumped by over 3%, with Piraeus Bank and Aegean Airlines both down over 6%. Donald Trump will be pleased to hear that Wall Street is expected to open calmly in 90 minutes time. The Dow Jones industrial average is on track to rise 0.25%, or 75 points, when trading begins. The Washington Post reports that the president was furious that the Dow plunged by nearly 1,900 points, or 6.5%, during Monday and Tuesday. And apparently he blames health officials for warning US citizens to prepare for an inevitable coronavirus outbreak. The Post says Trump has cautioned aides against forecasting the impact of the virus over fears that stocks could fall further. Trump has used the US stock market rally as proof that he\u2019s doing a great job, so any crash would undermine his re-election campaign. But telling health officials to pipe down may be counterproductive, and dangerous. And as I type, the president has just tweeted that the media are to blame for tumbling markets. He\u2019s planning to hold a press conference on the \u201cCaronavirus\u201d (sic) on the issue later... Chinese microblogging site Weibo has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could wipe 20% off its revenues. It warned shareholders that its business has been \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d by the coronavirus outbreak, adding: Due to the high uncertainty of the evolving situation, we have limited visibility on the full quarter revenue impact brought upon by the epidemic. Based on our current best estimate, Weibo anticipates its first quarter of 2020 net revenues to decrease by 15% to 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. This forecast reflects Weibo\u2019s current and preliminary view, which is subject to change. Weibo also reported that its net income fell sharply in the final three months of 2019, to $95.1m from $166.5m a year ago. It also reported a 3% drop in advertising and marketing revenue during the last quarter - even before the coronavirus crisis began.... After a rough morning, European stock markets are struggling back off the mat as lunchtime approaches. Most of the indices are still down, but they\u2019ve bounced off their lowest points. Italy\u2019s market has actually turned positive, after several days of heavy selling. There\u2019s still a lot of anxiety about a Covid-19 pandemic, but investors are reassured to see that Wall Street is expected to open a little higher today (after two whopping falls this week). FTSE 100: down 39 points or 0.57% at 6979 -- on track for a one-year low German DAX: down 131 points, or 1% at 12,685 French CAC: down 38 points or 0.4% at 5,641 Italian FTSE MIB: up 102 points or 0.5% at 23,195 This leave the Stoxx 600 down 0.85%, on track for its lowest close in four months. The UK stock market is on the brink of falling into a full-blown correction, due to coronavirus fears. A correction is defined as a 10% fall from a recent peak. And after this week\u2019s rout, the FTSE 100 is roughly 9% below the 7674 point level hit just five weeks ago, on 17 January. Just in: Credit rating agency Moody\u2019s has slashed its forecast for car sales in 2020, due to the economic damage caused by Covid-19. Moody\u2019s now expects global auto sale to fall by 2.5% this year -- rather worse than its previous forecast of a decline of 0.9%. That would mean 88 million new cars being sold, down from 90.2 million in 2019. Sales are expected to fall in Europe, the US and China -- a blow to the industry, which is already struggling to transition away from petrol and diesel cars towards electric. Moody\u2019s says: In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, auto sales in China likely to drop to 2.9% this year, significantly more than 1% previously expected Light vehicle sales in Western Europe likely to fall to 4% in 2020, after a surge in demand late 2019 with cars discounted to meet carbon emissions rules US sales will remain weak falling by 1.2% in 2020, then dip by another 0.6% in 2021 Japan will be the only major auto market to see unit sales growth in 2020 Senior vice-president Falk Frey says: \u201cGlobal vehicle sales will decline 2.5% in 2020, narrowing from a 4.6% drop in 2019, but worsening from the 0.9% decline that we had previously projected for this year. Sales will rebound only modestly in 2021, with growth of 1.5%,\u201d The Chinese government has attempted to calm fears over its economy. State TV are reporting that the Communist Party\u2019s Politburo has held a meeting, where they agreed that China\u2019s economic recovery is accelerating. However, they also warned that the coronavirus outbreak situation in the epicentres of Hubei province and Wuhan is still dire (Reuters reports). Greek government bonds are weakening, after Athens reports its first coronavirus case. Greece\u2019s heath ministry says a 38-year-old Greek woman who had travelled from an area of northern Italy has caught the virus. This has knocked Greek bonds, pushing up the yield (interest rate) on 10-year debt up to 1.17%, from 0.97% last night. That\u2019s still a very low bond yield, especially by Greek standards (yields soared over 20% during its debt crisis). But today\u2019s rise indicates investors are concerned that its economy could be hit by the crisis. Harvard professor Jeffrey Frankel fears that central bankers lack the firepower to fight the coronavirus crisis (as Nouriel Roubini also warned). He writes: While global recessions are exceedingly difficult to forecast, the odds of one \u2013 particularly one characterised by less than 2.5% growth, a threshold set by the IMF \u2013 now seem to have risen dramatically. (Unlike advanced-economy growth, global growth rarely falls below zero because developing countries have higher average trend growth.) So far, US investors seem unconcerned about these risks. But they may be taking too much comfort from the US Federal Reserve\u2019s three interest-rate cuts last year. Should the US economy falter, there is nowhere near enough room for the Fed to cut interest rates by 500 basis points, as it has in past recessions.... The coronavirus scare reached London\u2019s financial district yesterday, when US oil company Chevron sent home about 300 workers from its Canary Wharf offices. Chevron asked traders and other staff to work from home as a precaution after an employee reported flu-like symptoms, having recently visited a country where coronavirus has been detected. The company says it acted to protect staff, while the individual is testeed. \u201cChevron continues to monitor the situation very closely, utilizing the guidance of international and local health authorities. \u201cOur primary concern is the health and safety of our employees and we are taking precautionary measures to reduce their risk of exposure.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak has forced a major trade show in Milan to be postoned. Salone del Mobile.Milano was due to start on 21 April, but instead it\u2019s been pushed back by two months. Organisers took the move after thousands of Chinese buyers were forced to cancel their trip, due to travel restrictions. More here. Salone del Mobile is said to be the world\u2019s biggest and most important furniture event, and organisers say they \u201cwon\u2019t stop\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t stop\u201d. Here\u2019s our news story on this morning\u2019s coronavirus warnings from Lufthansa, Diageo, and Danone.... Despite the heavy losses this week, global investors are too complacent about the coronavirus. So says economics professor Nouriel Roubini, in an article in the Financial Times. Dr Doom\u201d, as he\u2019s known, reckons \u201cthe worst is yet to come\u201d, as the chances of a global recession rise. Roubini argues that investors are guilty of several \u201cflawed assumptions\u201d, and need to realise several things: 1) Covid-19 is going to be a global pandemic, and last for longer than first thought. The view that the economic impact will peak before the end of the first quarter now looks very shaky. The damage to China is severe, and global supply chains are being seriously disrupted, at a time when China accounts for about 20 per cent of global gross domestic product, not the tiny 4 per cent it had at the time of Sars in 2003. Add to that an economic shock to big economies like Japan, South Korea and Italy. When the disease spreads to other developed and emerging markets, this damage will increase. 2) China\u2019s economy will not rebound quickly, as some economists hoped: The idea of a V-shaped recovery is nonsensical. Suppose that the best Goldilocks scenario does occur: the shock to China hits only the first quarter and the contagion is mostly contained to the country. If its output shrinks just 2 per cent in the first quarter, that is an annualised contraction of 8 per cent. A V-shaped rebound would therefore require the same annualised growth, which exceeds the 6 per cent that China managed before the virus. Assuming that China will rebound at this rate in the final three quarters of the year \u2014 which would imply growth in 2020 of 4 per cent \u2014 is heroically optimistic. It is more likely that a V-shape shows growth returning to a pre-virus annualised level of 6 per cent from the second quarter onwards. In this case, China\u2019s calendar-year growth would be 2.5 per cent. 3) Governments and central banks can\u2019t step in and protect their economies. Fiscal policy will react very slowly, or not at all, given political and other constraints. Central banks are running out of bullets: how much more negative can the European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and others go on interest rates? Mining giant Rio Tinto has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could hurt its operations. Although its iron ore order books are currently full, CEO Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques sees challenges ahead: \u201cWe are likely to see some short term impacts such as supply chains and possibly even provision of services from Chinese suppliers\u201d. Rio Tinto also outlined its plans to cut carbon emissions - more here: Helal Miah, Investment Research Analyst at The Share Centre, explains why travel companies are being pummelled: \u201cAs Coronavirus takes hold in Europe, the fear is authorities may have to resort to drastic measures like in China to contain it while travellers hold back bookings. In regards to this, the market slide has been led by the travel and leisure groups. EasyJet is down over 22% over the past week, most of the damage being done on Monday and yesterday after the weekend\u2019s news. TUI, IAG and Carnival are also off in a significant way and most sectors have been impacted to a certain degree. Bloomberg\u2019s Dani Burger has spotted that trading volumes on Wall Street were huge yesterday -- as the Dow plunged by almost 900 points. The price of oil has hit a one-year low, as fears intensify about the health of the global economy. US crude oil has fallen to just $49.88 per barrel, its weakest point since January 2019. It\u2019s down 1.3% today, and has slumped by 10% in the last week. Brent crude, sourced from the North Sea, has fallen by 1.5% this morning to $54.11 per barrel (only a two-week low). The slide comes as San Francisco declares a state of emergency over coronavirus (although there are no cases there yet). There has also been a surge of cases in South Korea and Iran, while France has just reported its second death from the virus. George Efstathopoulos, multi asset portfolio manager at Fidelity International explains: Commodity prices took a hard hit amid concerns that the epidemic will curb global demand. Crude oil led declines with a weekly loss of about six per cent, while copper and rubber were both down as of Wednesday. A rush to safe-haven assets, on the other hand, pushed gold prices to a seven-year high this week, and the Japanese yen has rallied too. European stock markets are now sliding deeper and deeper into the red. Germany\u2019s DAX has tumbled by another 2.5%, while the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 is now 1.5%, or 106 points, at 6910 (still a one-year low). It\u2019s turning into a really grim few days for the markets. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index has lost over 9% since last Wednesday, falling steadily as Covid-19 infections and deaths have kept rising. Russ Mould, investment director at stockbroker AJ Bell, says investors are now realising that Covid-19 will have a serious impact on corporate profits, as supply chains are hit and demand falls. European shares were also under significant pressure as several countries on the continent announce their first cases. Germany\u2019s DAX index drops 1.2%, overnight Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 index was down 0.8%. The correction for equities reflects the reality that the impact of this outbreak is likely to be far-reaching and lead to pressure on company\u2019s revenue and earnings. Alcoholic drinks maker Diageo becoming the latest high-profile company to flag an impact this morning. Lufthansa has announced a hiring freeze and is offering employees unpaid leave as part of a range of cost savings measures to attempt to limit the financial impact of the spread of the coronavirus. The German airline, which has already cancelled all flights to China until the end of March, also said it will expand part-time work options and cancel flight attendant and other personnel training courses from April onwards. Those that are already on courses will not be hired. The company said it aimed to offer affected trainees \u201cemployment contracts in the longterm\u201d. Lufthansa says: \u201cIn order to counteract the economic impact of the coronavirus at an early stage, Lufthansa is implementing several measures to lower costs. It is not yet possible to estimate the expected impact of current developments on earnings.\u201d Shares in Diageo have slid by 2.5% this morning, after it warned Covid-19 could wipe out \u00a3200m of profits. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says Diageo has highlighted an important issue -- sales lost during the coronavirus crisis can\u2019t always be clawed back: The problem is for the likes of Diageo is that once the consumption picks up again in affected regions in China and beyond, you don\u2019t then go and buy two bottles of Scotch instead of your normal one (most people anyway). The selloff in European markets is accelerating again. In London, the FTSE 100 has now shed another 102 points, or 1.5%, in its third day of big losses in a row. This pushes the blue-chip index down to a fresh one-year low of 6915. Other European markets are also slumping, with the Stoxx 600 index down 2% - to its lowest level since October 31. UK travel catering firm SSP Group has been hit hard by the coronavirus disruption. SSP runs restaurants and bars at airports and railway stations around the world -- so the transport restrictions imposed in Asia to combat Covid-19 are hurting sales badly. It expects to suffer a 50% plunge in sales across the Asia-Pacific region in February, which will cost it \u00a34-\u00a35m in operating profits. SSP tells shareholders that there\u2019s been a major drop in traffic levels: In terms of the impact at the airports in which we operate across the region, in China we have seen sharp declines in both domestic and international air passenger numbers, which are currently running c. 90% lower YOY( year-on-year). In Hong Kong passenger numbers are c. 70% lower YOY and across a number of our other Asia Pacific countries, including Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines, passenger numbers are between 25% and 30% lower YOY. Elsewhere, we have also seen some impact at our airports in Australia, as well as at major travel hubs in the Middle East and India, although to date this has been less severe. French food group Danone has also warned that the coronavirus crisis is hurting its business. The maker of Evian and Volvic bottled water, and Activia, expects to lose around \u20ac100m in sales, mostly at its \u201cWaters China\u201d business. That will wipe out Danone\u2019s revenue growth in the current quarter, leaving like-for-like sales \u201cbroadly flat\u201d. This has forced Danone to cut its sales growth targets - to 2-4%, down from 4-5%. CEO Emmanuel Faber says: We start this year under the uncertain clouds of the coronavirus. Our priority is on the health and safety of our employees, business partners, customers and the communities in which we operate, hand in hand with the work of authorities. I would like in particular to commend and deeply thank our teams in China for their incredible commitment to their mission serving relentlessly families, parents, babies and elderlies despite the difficult conditions. Let me express my support and empathy for the difficulties and challenges they face and my confidence that life will return to normal in China and beyond. \u575a\u5f3a, \u4e2d\u56fd Stay strong China. The FTSE 100 has now lost more than 5% of its value this week -- as it plunged to a one-year low this morning. Newsflash: The FTSE 100 share index has hit a new one-year low at the start of trading. Covid-19 worries have pushed the blue-chip index down by another 39 points, or 0.5%, to 6978. That\u2019s its lowest level since February 2019. Travel companies are leading the fallers, again, with holiday firm TUI and budget airline easyJet both losing 3%. This means the FTSE 100 has lost more than \u00a3100bn of value since the start of this week, as City investors have been spooked by the surge in coronavirus infections around the world. Newsflash: the coronavirus outbreak will hit its sales and profits at drinks giant Diageo this year. Diageo, the company behind Guinness, Smirnoff, Johnnie Walker, Baileys and Talisker, has warned the City that Covid-19 will have an adverse impact on its operations this year. Diageo estimates that the ongoing crisis will knock \u00a3225m to \u00a3325m off its organic net sales this year. That will wipe between \u00a3140m to \u00a3200m off organic operating profits, it reckons. Diageo\u2019s statement outlines how business has been hit hard in Greater China in recent weeks: Bars and restaurants have largely been closed and there has been a substantial reduction in banqueting. As the majority of consumption is in the on-trade, we have seen significant disruption since the end of January which we expect to last at least into March. This disruption has now spread across the region, it adds: The outbreak in several other Asian countries, especially South Korea, Japan and Thailand, has led to events being postponed, a reduction in conferences and banquets, and a drop in tourism which have all impacted on-trade consumption. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus selloff shows no signs of abating, as investors around the world are gripped with fears of a global pandemic -- and a major slowdown. European stock markets are heading for fresh falls today, which will drive Britain\u2019s stock market down to a one-year low. The FTSE 100 is currently being called down 60 points at 6957, a drop of almost 1%. It has already shed 5% of its value this week, after two days of heavy selling. The escalating virus crisis sparked another heavy day of losses on Wall Street last night, where the Dow fell by 879 points - on top of Monday\u2019s 1,000 plunge. Overnight, a World Health Organisation expert warned that countries outside China are \u201csimply not ready\u201d for a pandemic -- as new cases are reported in Iran, South Korea, Italy, Austria, and Croatia. WHO\u2019s Bruce Aylward warned: \u201cYou have to be ready to manage this at a larger scale \u2026 and it has to be done fast.\u201d That warning helped to trigger another day of heavy losses in Asia-Pacific markets. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index has shed another 2.3%, on fears that its economy will take a big hit from the slowdown in China. South Korea has shed another 1.5%, with China\u2019s CSI 300 down 1.2%. Our main coronavirus live blog has all the details: Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group reports that investors are rethinking how well, or badly, the global economy will perform this year. We\u2019ve now had two seismic daily declines on global stock markets. Short term traders may well choose to grit their teeth for a short-covering rally but we\u2019re getting the impression institutional investors are materially reassessing their outlook for stocks. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have just notched up the worst 2-day decline since February 2018 with the Dow giving up over 1900 points in the process. The Nasdaq has closed in the red for the year. Alarmingly, it has been reported that Only 5 US states have the capacity to test for the coronavirus. European shares look set for a lower open with the number of cases in China moving higher again. There are some stark instances of business being affected now - Royal Caribbean has cancelled 30 cruises in Southeast Asia. Nobody\u2019s willing to \u2018catch a falling knife\u2019 with these kinds of headlines. Benchmarks in Europe look in bad shape.

On Tuesday, 427 new cases were reported across 37 countries globally, compared with 411 inside China, despite nearly 97% of more than 80,000 infections occurring inside China.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 27 February. Top stories More cases of the coronavirus are being reported outside China than inside for the first time since the outbreak began, the World Health Organisation says. On Tuesday, 427 new cases were reported across 37 countries globally, compared with 411 inside China, despite nearly 97% of more than 80,000 infections occurring inside China. Earlier, the WHO had cautioned that the world was \u201csimply not ready\u201d should a pandemic break out, while major sporting events including the Six Nations rugby and F1 racing have either been postponed or cancelled. There have been 2,715 deaths so far, but health officials have cautioned against panic, reminding that mortality rates remain around 1-2% and predominantly affect people with already weakened immunity. Australia\u2019s seven hottest days on record were in the second half of December last year. Australia is heating faster than the global average, and extreme heat days are on the rise. Scientists warn the greatest threat is an escalation in heatwaves. \u201cThere\u2019s clear evidence that [extreme heat] is killing people prematurely,\u201d says Dr Diana Egerton-Warburton in today\u2019s episode of The Frontline, a major multimedia series from Guardian Australia about the lived reality of climate change. The prime minister\u2019s office broke the law by inexplicably delaying a freedom of information request, the information watchdog has ruled, despite a $110,000 internal investigation clearing it of wrongdoing. At least three federal agencies have been found to have breached FOI law since November, despite the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner sending an all-staff missive reminding departments of their legal obligations. Experts say delays can be used as a deliberate tactic to render information useless or less explosive by the time it is released. Australia Australia must significantly accelerate its take-up of low emissions options if it is to achieve a transition to net zero emissions by 2050, new analysis by ClimateWorks Australia suggests. That means the electricity market will need to be sourced 100% from renewables by 2035, while at least half of all new cars in 10 years time will need to be electric vehicles. Meanwhile, mining giant Rio Tinto says it wants its globe-spanning operations to reach net zero by 2050 and will spend US$1bn over the next five years to reduce its carbon footprint. Scott Morrison and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s offices exchanged 136 emails about sports grants program, the Australian National Audit Office has revealed. Morrison has maintained that his involvement in the $100m community sport infrastructure program was limited to his office passing on representations from MPs to McKenzie\u2019s office. Julian Assange\u2019s extradition case is to hear an application on Thursday for him to leave a dock surrounded by bulletproof glass and sit with his lawyers after he complained of being as much a participant in the proceedings as \u201cwatching Wimbledon\u201d. Josh Frydenberg has warned that the far right is on the rise in Australia, echoing a speech earlier in the week where Australia\u2019s top intelligence chief warned the threat of rightwing extremism in Australia was real and growing. The world At least 24 people have been killed in the worst religious violence in Delhi in decades, with calls for army to be deployed as clashes between Hindu and Muslim groups show little sign of abating. More than 200 people were admitted to hospital, following a fourth consecutive day of clashes and mob looting. A Brazilian lawmaker has warned against a return to dictatorship, following president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s apparent endorsement of nationwide protests designed to intimidate the nation\u2019s democratic institutions. Six schools and two nurseries in Syria have been bombed by the Assad regime and its ally, Russia, killing 21, amid concerns the violence has already led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the Syrian war to date. Clive Cussler, the bestselling American author of more than 80 adventure novels, has died, aged 88. A 17-times New York Times bestseller lister, Cussler sold more than 100m books, with 25 novels starring his government agent protagonist, Dirk Pitt. Recommended reads They were penned over 3,000 years ago, but songs about powerlessness and suffering are finding a modern audience. 150 Psalms, a collection of biblical era works, is being performed at this year\u2019s Adelaide festival, but for the project\u2019s director Tido Visser the thematic resonance is \u201cas if they were written yesterday\u201d. As the coronavirus prompts doom-mongering across the global economy, what hope does Australia\u2019s domestic economy have to offer? Well, according to Greg Jericho, with the mining and construction industries slowing down, very little: \u201cthe domestic economy, which the government is relying on to see us through the international crisis, was already struggling well before the rest of the world turned ugly.\u201d Open a cookbook these days and you don\u2019t expect to find recipes for turtle soup.

Listen Delhi is being rocked by India\u2019s worst violence in decades, with the death toll rising rapidly as mosques are set alight. On this episode of Today in Focus, Guardian\u2019s Samanth Subramanian looks at the rise of Hindu nationalism and the controversial citizenship laws that have fuelled months of escalating unrest. Sport Five-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova has announced her retirement from tennis. A top-five ranked player as recently as 2016, the 32-year-old has battled chronic shoulder injuries, and bid an emotional farewell to the sport that brought her \u201cuntold tears and unspeakable joys\u201d. Kevin Mitchell farewells a player more respected than loved. It was one of the great contests of the 80s and 90s and, ahead of Friday\u2019s bushfire relief game, a wave of AFL State of Origin nostalgia has well and truly been uncorked, Jonathan Horn writes.

Despite his rosy picture of the administration\u2019s work, serious concerns have been raised about its response so far.</p> <p>These were the top<strong> </strong>questions for Trump before his remarks include:</p> <h2><strong>How is the US monitoring the outbreak?</strong></h2> <p>The government distributed faulty test kits and public health experts are increasingly concerned the lack of testing is misrepresenting the spread of coronavirus in the US.</p> <p>Test kits have not been widely distributed to hospitals or medical labs and the kits that have been sent out must be sent back to the CDC in Atlanta to confirm results.</p> <p>While South Korea has tested more than 35,000 people for coronavirus, the US has tested 426 people, excluding those returned on evacuation flights, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/02/25/cdc-coronavirus-test/\">according to the Washington Post</a>.</p> <p>As of now, the US recommends testing only for people who display respiratory symptoms and have recently traveled to China or had close contact with an infected person. The CDC is considering expanding the testing protocol to include people traveling to the US from countries beyond mainland China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-us-response\">Donald Trump praises US coronavirus response while playing down impact</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">told the Guardian this week</a> the US does not have a fully mobilized response to testing for coronavirus. \u201cIt is puzzling to me that the government has been unable so far to resolve that problem, at a time when most other countries that are facing the disease have been able to do testing at a much larger scale,\u201d said Konyndyk.</p> <h2><strong>Who is in charge?</strong></h2> <p>According to the White House, the coronavirus response is in the hands of the health secretary, Alex Azar.</p> <p>During the Ebola crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s administration established a post to oversee the government\u2019s response in case the outbreak turned into a pandemic. Lawmakers and health experts have called for a similar post to be made in the Trump White House for coronavirus.</p> <p>Ronald Klain, who held the Ebola position under Obama, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">told the New York Times</a>: \u201cOne cabinet secretary cannot run an interagency response. Azar has the biggest civilian job in the American government.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump addressed the public on Wednesday night to discuss the government\u2019s response to coronavirus, which US health officials say has entered a new phase. The president had previously expressed optimismthat did not mesh with warnings from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Trump on Wednesday again tried to dispel Americans\u2019 fears: \u201cWhatever happens, we\u2019re totally prepared,\u201d he said. Trump has complained without evidence that the news media is \u201cdoing everything possible\u201d to make coronavirus \u201clook as bad as possible\u201d, while he has praised his administration\u2019s response. Despite his rosy picture of the administration\u2019s work, serious concerns have been raised about its response so far. These were the top questions for Trump before his remarks include: How is the US monitoring the outbreak? The government distributed faulty test kits and public health experts are increasingly concerned the lack of testing is misrepresenting the spread of coronavirus in the US. Test kits have not been widely distributed to hospitals or medical labs and the kits that have been sent out must be sent back to the CDC in Atlanta to confirm results. While South Korea has tested more than 35,000 people for coronavirus, the US has tested 426 people, excluding those returned on evacuation flights, according to the Washington Post. As of now, the US recommends testing only for people who display respiratory symptoms and have recently traveled to China or had close contact with an infected person. The CDC is considering expanding the testing protocol to include people traveling to the US from countries beyond mainland China. Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, told the Guardian this week the US does not have a fully mobilized response to testing for coronavirus. \u201cIt is puzzling to me that the government has been unable so far to resolve that problem, at a time when most other countries that are facing the disease have been able to do testing at a much larger scale,\u201d said Konyndyk. Who is in charge? According to the White House, the coronavirus response is in the hands of the health secretary, Alex Azar. During the Ebola crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s administration established a post to oversee the government\u2019s response in case the outbreak turned into a pandemic. Lawmakers and health experts have called for a similar post to be made in the Trump White House for coronavirus. Ronald Klain, who held the Ebola position under Obama, told the New York Times: \u201cOne cabinet secretary cannot run an interagency response. Azar has the biggest civilian job in the American government. Is he doing this in his spare time?\u201d On Wednesday, the White House deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, said on Twitter that a report the White House is considering appointing a coronavirus czar \u201cis not true!\u201d In May, the Trump administration scrapped a position created after Klain\u2019s departure to coordinate similar responses in the future: senior director for global health security and biothreats on the national security council (NSC). Last week, 27 senators wrote a letter to Trump asking him to quickly fill the job. The Pulitzer-prize-winning science writer Laurie Garrett said the federal government had \u201cintentionally rendered itself incapable\u201d of responding to the outbreak. \u201cIn numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the US government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cIf the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response, the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is \u2013 not just for the public but for the government itself, which largely finds itself in the dark.\u201d How much money is available? The US is entering this phase of the coronavirus outbreak after repeated attempts by the federal government to drastically cut CDC funding. Congress has mostly blocked this from happening, though the Trump administration successfully cut its global epidemic work from 49 countries to 10. Among the countries where CDC efforts were scaled back were Haiti, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as China, where the agency provided technical assistance. Now, the White House has requested $1.25bn in new emergency funding and to divert another $1.25bn from existing federal programs. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, a critic of the administration\u2019s response to coronavirus, on Wednesday requested $8.5bn. Does the US have enough equipment? Azar told a Senate panel on Tuesday that the federal government had a stockpile of 30m masks but could need 300m for health workers. Stores are also reporting shortages of the N95 respirator mask, which doctors recommend for people who are sick instead of surgical-type masks. Doctors have cautioned even the N95 has limited efficacy because it needs to be fit-tested, which many people aren\u2019t qualified to handle on their own. Can the president instill confidence? Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary under George W Bush, said he didn\u2019t understand why the CDC\u2019s Tuesday announcement was made without coordination with the White House. \u201cThere should have been an Oval Office meeting, a statement by Potus about protecting people, and then a press avail by experts,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cBizarre.\u201d Amid increasingly serious messages about the outbreak, Trump has repeatedly cast an optimistic light on US preparedness.

      "bodyText": "Coronavirus shocks have rippled through the corporate world after a large airline imposed a hiring freeze, the world\u2019s biggest whisky maker warned on profits and a factory shutdown in Italy threatened car production across Europe. The German carrier Lufthansa has halted recruitment and is offering employees unpaid leave as part of cost-saving measures to limit the financial impact of the spread of the coronavirus. The cutbacks came as several other European companies warned that the outbreak was hurting their operations or introduced emergency measures to protect staff. Sky said its offices would bar visitors who had been in high-risk countries in order to reduce the threat of contagion for its staff, with all guests required to complete a form at reception desks. The Italian manufacturer MTA, which makes electrical parts for cars, has been forced to close its factory in Codogno after the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy. It said the closure would have a knock-on effect on production at Fiat Chrysler\u2019s plants in the country before spreading to other carmakers across Europe. The closure of the plant in the Lombardy region would immediately force Fiat to shut production lines at four plants as soon as Wednesday, MTA said. Continued closure would mean all the other Fiat plants in Europe and those of Renault, BMW and Peugeot would close from 2 March. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK\u2019s largest carmaker, and the lorry makers Iveco and CNH, would be affected if the shutdown lasted longer. Diageo, the UK-based owner of Guinness and the world\u2019s biggest whisky producer with brands such as Johnnie Walker, said Covid-19 could hit its profits by up to \u00a3200m as restaurants and bars in China stay shut. SSP Group, the British operator of restaurants and bars in airports and railway stations, said its sales across the Asia Pacific region would slump by half in February. Diageo predicted a decline in profits of \u00a3140m-\u00a3200m in the year to the end of June. Sales are expected to be down by up to \u00a3325m. Its estimates excluded the impact of the coronavirus on other markets beyond Greater China and Asia Pacific. Diageo said the majority of consumption of its products in China took place in bars and restaurants, which mostly remain closed. \u201cWe have seen significant disruption since the end of January, which we expect to last at least into March,\u201d it said. \u201cThereafter we expect a gradual improvement, with consumption returning to normal levels towards [June].\u201d The company also highlighted the impact in South Korea, Japan and Thailand, where events have been postponed, conferences and banquets have been cancelled and a drop in tourism has also had an impact on consumption in bars and restaurants. The significant drop in international air travel, especially across Asia Pacific, has also hurt Diageo\u2019s business, including sales in airports. Danone, the maker of products including Volvic and Evian bottled water, and Activia yoghurts, said it would take a \u20ac100m (\u00a384m) sales hit in the first quarter as a result of the spread of the coronavirus. The French-based company was experiencing a \u201csevere demand slowdown\u201d for its Mizone water brand in China, which is Danone\u2019s second biggest market and accounted for 10% of global sales last year. Danone employs 8,200 staff in China and has eight factories, seven of which support its water business.
