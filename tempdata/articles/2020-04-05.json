But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted.</p> <p>Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> 7,000 </a>lives and nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">10m</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\"> jobs</a>. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net.</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,\u201d said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. \u201cReality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p> <p>Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the \u201cscale of a major war\u201d. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared \u2013 and more resilient \u2013 in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place.</p> <p>But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a divisive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,\u201d Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. \u201cIf he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it\u2019s for Bernie Sanders.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb3da29e6533e4e60d572c288fecc605af69fb70/0_86_1603_961/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with a safe elbow bump before the start of the 11th Democratic presidential debate on 15 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Enough debates\u2019</h2> <p>Sanders has sent conflicting signals.</p> <p>On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden\u2019s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/bernie-sanders/4140672\">narrow\u201d</a> one.</p> <p>After a dismal showing last month, the campaign <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanders-weighs-future-after-losses-to-joe-biden-11584544419\">deactivated</a> its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/bernie-sanders-will-stay-in-2020-race-until-new-york-primary/\">ramping up</a> digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left. New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.</p> <p>Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough debates,\u201d the former vice-president said.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 allies are split. Some have said it\u2019s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-top-sanders-advisers-urge-him-to-consider-withdrawing/2020/04/04/224d8164-767f-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">reported</a> that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention.</p> <p>\u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/sen-bernie-sanders-talks-about-the-2020-race-and-vice-president-joe-biden/4141900\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">survey</a> this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.</p> <p>Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions.

      "bodyText": "Bernie Sanders is not done running for president and he\u2019s tired of saying so. \u201cFor the fourth time,\u201d Sanders said tartly in an interview on The View this week, \u201cwe are assessing the campaign\u201d. It was a response \u2013 more diplomatic if no less irritated than previous versions \u2013 to a question he\u2019s been getting for weeks: \u201cWhy are you still in the race?\u201d Sanders has faced calls to drop out since early last month, when Joe Biden began his all-but unstoppable ascent to the nomination. But with the race for the nomination effectively in a state of suspended animation amid the coronavirus pandemic, the 78-year-old Vermont senator has resisted. Covid-19 has ravaged the US economy and strained the healthcare system, claiming more than 7,000 lives and nearly 10m jobs. The twin economic and public health crises give what Sanders and allies have described as a new imperative to his calls for universal healthcare and a wide expansion of the social safety net. \u201cIn many ways, this pandemic has made the case for a lot of the policies that the senator has spent 35 years fighting for,\u201d said Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign. \u201cReality has endorsed Bernie Sanders.\u201d Since stepping off the physical campaign trail, Sanders has turned his focus almost entirely to the coronavirus pandemic, a crisis he said is on the \u201cscale of a major war\u201d. In glitchy media interviews from his home in Vermont, the senator has argued that the US would be better prepared \u2013 and more resilient \u2013 in the face of a future pandemic if his policy agenda were already in place. But his continued presence in the race has alarmed many Democrats, haunted by the fallout from a divisive primary four years ago they believe contributed to Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat by Donald Trump. Sanders, they contend, had a year to make the case for his political revolution and should now bow out and help unify the party. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy to say there is some path for Bernie Sanders to win this nomination,\u201d Jay Jacobs, chairman of the New York party. \u201cIf he stays in this race, Bernie Sanders is doing it for one reason and one reason alone and unfortunately it\u2019s for Bernie Sanders.\u201d \u2018Enough debates\u2019 Sanders has sent conflicting signals. On the one hand, he has acknowledged Biden\u2019s daunting lead. Yet he insists there is a path to the nomination, albeit a \u201cnarrow\u201d one. After a dismal showing last month, the campaign deactivated its digital ads while pausing spending on TV ads. Days later, the campaign announced it was ramping up digital organizing ahead of the New York primary, the most delegate-rich contest left. New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June. Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough debates,\u201d the former vice-president said. Sanders\u2019 allies are split. Some have said it\u2019s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post reported that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention. \u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders said on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate. \u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic. \u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a survey this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points. Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed. \u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act. In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid. Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat. The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams. Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition. \u201cOh my God, the universe is collapsing!\u201d he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. \u201cOh my word, will the universe survive?\u201d The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, passed unanimously. On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as \u201cthe boldest legislation ever written in modern history\u201d. They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all individuals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic. The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package. \u2018Unprecedented moment\u2019 It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and several legal challenges to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new poll from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state. Sanders knows he has a decision to make.

Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society? \u201cRight now in this unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d Sanders told The View. \u201cI think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The utter chaos in America\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 shortages of equipment to protect hospital workers, dwindling supplies of ventilators and critical medications, jaw-dropping confusion over how $2.2tn of aid in the recent coronavirus law will be distributed \u2013 was perhaps predictable in a nation that prides itself on competitive individualism and hates centralized power. But it is also tailor-made for Donald Trump, who has spent a lifetime exploiting chaos for personal gain and blaming others for losses. \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility\u201d for the slow rate of coronavirus testing in the US, he said. On Friday, when asked if he could assure New Yorkers there would be enough ventilators next week when virus victims are expected to overwhelm city hospitals, he replied: \u201cNo. They should have had more ventilators.\u201d Trump has told governors to find life-saving equipment on their own. He refuses to create a central bargaining agent, arguing the federal government is \u201cnot a shipping clerk\u201d. This has left states and cities bidding against each other, driving up prices. Andrew Cuomo, the New York governor, described how ventilators went from $25,000 to $45,000 \u201cbecause we bid $25,000. California says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you $30,000\u2019 and Illinois says, \u2018I\u2019ll give you $35,000\u2019 and Florida says \u2018I\u2019ll give you $40,000. And then, Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] gets involved and Fema starts bidding! \u201cAnd now Fema is bidding on top of the 50! So Fema is driving up the price. What sense does this make? We\u2019re literally bidding up the prices ourselves.\u201d New York state is paying 20 cents for gloves that normally cost less than five cents, $7.50 for masks that normally go for 50 cents, $2,795 for infusion pumps that normally cost half that, $248,841 for a portable X-ray machine that typically sells for $30,000 to $80,000. Who\u2019s pocketing all this? An array of producers, importers, wholesalers and speculators. State laws against price gouging usually don\u2019t apply to government purchases. Some of it may be finding its way into this fall\u2019s election campaigns. The veteran Republican fundraiser Mike Gula and Republican political operative John Thomas just started a company selling coronavirus testing kits, personal protective equipment and other \u201chard to find medical supplies to beat the outbreak\u201d. They call themselves \u201cthe largest global network of Covid-19 medical suppliers\u201d. Asked how he\u2019d found such equipment, Gula explained: \u201cI have relationships with a lot of people.\u201d Thomas added: \u201cIn politics \u2013 especially if you\u2019re at a high enough level \u2013 you are one phone call away from anybody in the world.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner \u2013 who\u2019s one phone call away from anyone \u2013 is running a \u201cshadow\u201d coronavirus task force that has been enlisting the private sector and overseeing the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies, all out of public view. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be our stockpile \u2013 it\u2019s not supposed to be state stockpiles,\u201d he said cryptically on Thursday. Oh, and let\u2019s not forget the giant coronavirus bill Trump signed into law on 27 March, which created a $500bn fund that Trump and his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, will distribute to the private sector. Most of it will backstop $4.5tn of subsidized loans (ie, bailout money) coming from the Fed, also distributed by the Treasury.

Trump was impeached a mere three and a half months ago on charges of abuse of power and obstructing investigations. Eight months ago, he phoned the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, seeking dirt on Joe Biden and threatening to hold up military aid to get it. In June 2016, his son Donald Jr and Jared Kushner met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, after a Russian intermediary contacted Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would \u201cincriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton and be \u201cvery useful to your father\u201d, adding it was part of the Russian government\u2019s \u201csupport\u201d for Trump. Donald Trump calls allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 election a \u201choax\u201d. He called his impeachment a \u201choax\u201d. He initially called the coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d.

Health workers are rightly receiving huge credit for their crucial part. But since the crisis began, the good humour and politeness of, for instance, supermarket workers has also been inspiring. Hopefully, when the emergency is over, we\u2019ll remember that many of the pandemic\u2019s unassuming heroes were checkout staff, shelf stackers and delivery drivers, and other unsung key workers, like cleaners and refuse collectors. We should all take the time to personally thank our supermarket staff when we go food shopping; the bin men when they call around to collect the rubbish; and the cleaners who are helping to keep safe those public spaces that remain open. Joe McCarthy Dublin Loath though I am to disagree with someone who knows immeasurably more than I do about Covid-19 (\u201cThis isn\u2019t the time to be apportioning blame\u201d, David Nabarro, News), it seems to me that in politics we already know who the principal villains and incompetents are.

      "body": "<p>It is a terrible thing to see a disaster in the making and be unable to prevent it. Yet this is the prospect confronting us if we dare to look beyond the walls and parapets of a Britain besieged by the coronavirus invader. Tens of millions of people in poorer, less developed countries across the world face a looming catastrophe that appears as unstoppable as it is potentially lethal.</p> <p>The moment has not quite arrived. But an axe is poised to <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-31/coronavirus-countries-infection-rates-most-vulnerable/12085816\">fall on untold numbers</a> of largely defenceless heads, a massacre almost too appalling to contemplate. As the relatively wealthy countries of the northern hemisphere engage in a noisy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-the-week-explained\">struggle to repulse</a> Covid-19, alarm bells are ringing from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/india-coronavirus-cases-rise-amid-fears-true-figure-much-higher\">south Asia</a> to the Middle East and <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/02/africa-coronavirus-pandemic-violence-confusion/\">Africa</a>. Mostly they have not yet been heard.</p> <p>Anybody who has experienced the densely populated slums of Mumbai, Dhaka or Port-au-Prince knows how impossible are the concepts of social distancing and self-isolation for many of their inhabitants. Those who have seen the conditions in refugee camps in and around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/fears-over-hidden-covid-19-outbreak-in-lebanon-iraq-and-syria\">Syria</a> or Somalia know how limited are the health facilities there, even at the best of times.</p> <p>The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world\u2019s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. As the global equality charity Plan International Australia has ominously warned, many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition.</p> <p>People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable. If you are an inhabitant of Idlib, for example, there is a good chance that any attempt to follow advice, stay at home and stay safe will be disrupted by a Russian or Syrian regime bombing raid. That\u2019s one reason why Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for a <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">global ceasefire</a> in the face of \u201cour common enemy\u201d. There is scant evidence that his plea is being heeded.</p> <p>The UN has also warned that people in countries whose wellbeing has been damaged by unilateral sanctions, such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Cuba, could suffer disproportionately from the spread of coronavirus. This is already the case in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52118809\">Iran</a>. All such sanctions should be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-un-sanctions/lift-sanctions-on-iran-north-korea-venezuela-in-coronavirus-crisis-un-rights-expert-idUSKBN21I2N7\">lifted immediately</a>, said the UN\u2019s Hilal Elver, to help avoid virus-related food shortages. If the Trump administration heard her call, it has done little about it.</p> <p>Food insecurity is a growing worry in sub-Saharan Africa, notably the Sahel region. If the disease takes hold there, the <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/number-hungry-people-spikes-central-sahel-covid-19-looms\">World Food Programme</a> says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence.</p> <p>From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/march/just-three-ventilators-to-cope-with-covid-19-in-central-african-republic/\">Norwegian Refugee Council says</a> there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years.</p> <p>Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/26/paleastinians-brace-coronavirus-outbreak-gaza-strip-covid/\">Gaza is preparing</a> for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week.</p> <p>The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism.

      "bodyText": "It is a terrible thing to see a disaster in the making and be unable to prevent it. Yet this is the prospect confronting us if we dare to look beyond the walls and parapets of a Britain besieged by the coronavirus invader. Tens of millions of people in poorer, less developed countries across the world face a looming catastrophe that appears as unstoppable as it is potentially lethal. The moment has not quite arrived. But an axe is poised to fall on untold numbers of largely defenceless heads, a massacre almost too appalling to contemplate. As the relatively wealthy countries of the northern hemisphere engage in a noisy struggle to repulse Covid-19, alarm bells are ringing from south Asia to the Middle East and Africa. Mostly they have not yet been heard. Anybody who has experienced the densely populated slums of Mumbai, Dhaka or Port-au-Prince knows how impossible are the concepts of social distancing and self-isolation for many of their inhabitants. Those who have seen the conditions in refugee camps in and around Syria or Somalia know how limited are the health facilities there, even at the best of times. The World Health Organization has reported that at least half of the world\u2019s population did not have access to essential medical care even before the pandemic struck. As the global equality charity Plan International Australia has ominously warned, many in these communities, particularly children, suffer from serious underlying conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis and malnutrition. People living in conflict zones are doubly vulnerable. If you are an inhabitant of Idlib, for example, there is a good chance that any attempt to follow advice, stay at home and stay safe will be disrupted by a Russian or Syrian regime bombing raid. That\u2019s one reason why Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, has called for a global ceasefire in the face of \u201cour common enemy\u201d. There is scant evidence that his plea is being heeded. The UN has also warned that people in countries whose wellbeing has been damaged by unilateral sanctions, such as Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Cuba, could suffer disproportionately from the spread of coronavirus. This is already the case in Iran. All such sanctions should be lifted immediately, said the UN\u2019s Hilal Elver, to help avoid virus-related food shortages. If the Trump administration heard her call, it has done little about it. Food insecurity is a growing worry in sub-Saharan Africa, notably the Sahel region. If the disease takes hold there, the World Food Programme says, vital humanitarian supply chains in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger could be further disrupted at a time when millions already face summer food shortages caused by drought and jihadist violence. From war-scarred Afghanistan to the impoverished Central African Republic, where the Norwegian Refugee Council says there are three ventilators for five million people, fear of imminent disaster is compounded by a chronic lack of resources. And any responses to Covid-19 will be further hampered by unresolved political and security issues left to fester for years. Gaza is a case in point. Two million Palestinians are crammed into an area of 365 sq km. According to the International Crisis Group, cases of coronavirus have been identified. Now Gaza is preparing for the worst. \u201cA major outbreak would swiftly overwhelm Gaza\u2019s healthcare system, which has been devastated by years of war and Israeli blockade. The death toll could be horrific,\u201d the ICG said last week. The potential economic impact on the developing world is also a matter of huge concern. Low- and middle-income countries have already been hurt by falling export demand, lower oil prices and a collapse in tourism. Nearly 80 governments have asked for emergency IMF funding, with one estimate suggesting a total bailout of at least \u00a32tn may be necessary. The resilience of vulnerable states suffering anticipated shocks of such unprecedented social and economic severity is greatly limited when compared, for example, with wealthier nations such as Britain that can call on unlimited borrowing. Lasting, possibly permanent pandemic-related damage increases the risk of social disorder and state violence, as seen in South Africa. The incidence of Covid-19 in large swaths of Africa, south Asia and Latin America remains limited for now. But there is every reason to believe a virus that has ravaged and humbled the world\u2019s two biggest economies - the US and China - will eventually spread infection to all corners of the globe. It is not entirely true to say there is nothing we can do but watch. Governments and individuals should support the UN and its agencies; boost foreign aid budgets; donate to international charities; share expertise; offer refuge and succour; and, wherever possible, provide vital medical equipment \u2013 all this and more can and must be done. Covid-19 is a universal nightmare, a truly global crisis. All its victims without exception deserve help, wherever they live. If efforts to control the virus in the developing world fail, the human toll could be indescribable. And the disease could become endemic, repeatedly rebounding and recycling through migration, human contacts and second- or third-wave pandemics. It does not bear thinking about.",

      "body": "<p>At a White House coronavirus briefing late last month, Donald Trump became visibly annoyed. Jonathan Karl, ABC\u2019s chief White House correspondent, had pressed him about ventilator availability. The president snapped back with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1243672356511498240\">\u201cdon\u2019t be a cutie-pie\u201d</a> and don\u2019t act like a \u201cwise guy\u201d. This was not the pair\u2019s first rodeo. Their paths first crossed back in the mid-1990s.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">'It's an exhausting story': Jonathan Karl on his up-close view of Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back then, Trump was cementing his status as a tabloid legend and Karl was a cub reporter with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post. As part of the real estate mogul\u2019s perpetual circus, he granted Karl an interview about Michael Jackson\u2019s honeymoon in Trump Tower. Meditate on that.</p> <p>Now Karl has written a book. It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds.</p> <p>Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe.</p> <p>Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war.</p> <p>Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/charlottesville-white-supremacist-james-alex-fields-heather-heyer\">the murder</a> of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo\">Jews will not replace us</a>\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar.</p> <p>Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general.</p> <p>Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning.</p> <p>Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium.<strong> </strong>In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized.</p> <p>Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Muelller-Report-Redacted-Vol-II-Released-04.18.2019-Word-Searchable.-Reduced-Size.pdf\">examined in detail</a>.</p> <p>And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/reel-history-lady-jane-grey\">Lady Jane Grey</a> of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d</p> <p>Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/anthony-scaramucci-post-media-company\">Maybe 11</a>.</p> <p>Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story.</p> <p>Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass.</p> <p>Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner.</p> <p>In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/journalist-recounts-the-moment-in-the-2016-campaign-where-trump-took-a-dark-turn/\">Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger</a>.</p> <p>Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d.</p> <p>And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1245675889884626945\">depression</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefani Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest\">exploded</a> at a rate surpassing that of Italy.

      "bodyText": "At a White House coronavirus briefing late last month, Donald Trump became visibly annoyed. Jonathan Karl, ABC\u2019s chief White House correspondent, had pressed him about ventilator availability. The president snapped back with \u201cdon\u2019t be a cutie-pie\u201d and don\u2019t act like a \u201cwise guy\u201d. This was not the pair\u2019s first rodeo. Their paths first crossed back in the mid-1990s. Back then, Trump was cementing his status as a tabloid legend and Karl was a cub reporter with Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post. As part of the real estate mogul\u2019s perpetual circus, he granted Karl an interview about Michael Jackson\u2019s honeymoon in Trump Tower. Meditate on that. Now Karl has written a book. It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds. Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe. Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war. Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and the murder of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln. Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar. Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general. Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning. Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium. In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized. Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report examined in detail. And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the Lady Jane Grey of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. Maybe 11. Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story. Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass. Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner. In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger. Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself. \u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d. And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic depression. The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has exploded at a rate surpassing that of Italy. Unemployment has rocketed. In only two weeks, 10m jobs have been shed. They are not coming back anytime soon. Not exactly Maga. This is American carnage. Yet Trump\u2019s self-reverence remains. The president has proclaimed that he alone can save the nation. The press must ignore his lethal neglect. Likewise, Trump expects us to forget that his administration undermined our national response and dithered over providing essential equipment to hospitals. To top it off, Trump denies personal responsibility. In Gladiator, Ridley Scott\u2019s Oscar-winning movie about ancient Rome, Gracchus, a senator, posits that the Emperor Commodus will offer the people bread and circuses even as he tramples on their lives and freedom. \u201cHe will give them death,\u201d Gracchus says. \u201cAnd they will love him for it.\u201d These days, the sun is setting later. But darkness will be casting its broad shadow earlier. The president trails Joe Biden in trial heats but his poll numbers have risen. The election is seven months away: plenty of time for the president to rule and ruin. Karl\u2019s trepidation is not misplaced.",

      "bodyText": "In the week since the NHS identified more than 1.5 million people who are most vulnerable and in need of support, the government has issued about 30,000 food parcels containing tinned vegetables, bread, tuna and fresh fruit. The number is expected to increase to \u201chundreds of thousands being delivered every week\u201d according to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, but action has been much quicker on the ground. We speak to some of the heroes in the drive to keep the nation fed. Slough In a little under three weeks, Ajmal Azam has helped support about 300 people in his local community by organising a network of food parcels, shopping and hot meals for those most in need. In another life, 36-year-old Azam is a full-time barrister practising in family law, a married father of two and a school governor. Now he spends six hours a day packing and delivering boxes of tinned goods, pulses, bread, fruit and veg. It\u2019s humbling, he admits, but crucial work. \u201cSlough Islamic Trust has supported this drive but it\u2019s not faith-specific,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the whole community \u2013 around 80% of people we\u2019ve been supporting are non-Muslim, they\u2019re older or have disabilities, are self-isolating or have no support networks.\u201d Azam drew up a roster of volunteers, and has been working alongside Sikhs in Slough, who are also operating a mobile food-support network for those who are over 65 and quarantined. \u201cWe called up Wexham, our local hospital, to ask what they needed, and a senior A&amp;E sister pointed out that a number of nurses are in self-isolation and struggling to get basic necessities \u2013 so we put together 100 packages that day.\u201d While Azam has spent \u201cprobably more than \u00a31,000\u201d getting supplies together, he is keen to credit local grocers, supermarkets and takeaways that have been providing food and essentials. \u201cEveryone wants to help. That\u2019s incredible. My phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing since we put the first flyer out on social media. I do feel drained and exhausted at this stage but the impact we\u2019ve had is so endearing. I\u2019ve had so many messages from people that it\u2019s making a difference to. That\u2019s keeping me going.\u201d London Chef Michey Chan is used to cooking up a storm.

      "body": "<p>It was supposed to have been the big political event of April, but the announcement of Labour\u2019s leadership result was a low-key affair yesterday, with relatively little fanfare, overshadowed by the terrifying coronavirus crisis that has swept across Britain. </p> <p>As expected, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/30/labour-leadership-interviews-sir-keir-starmer\">Keir Starmer</a>, the party\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, was decisively endorsed by Labour members and supporters. In a sober, impressive address, he spoke of Labour\u2019s mission in the coming weeks to save lives and protect the country through constructive opposition.</p> <p>Starmer takes over not just at a time of unprecedented national crisis, but a difficult juncture for his party. His victory comes after its most disastrous <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\">election defeat</a> since 1935, the product of a party that was mired in institutional <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/03/corbyn-apologises-for-antisemitism-in-labour-party\">antisemitism</a>, divisions over Brexit and voters\u2019 dislike of Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>During the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news\">three-month leadership campaign</a>, Starmer has not proved as willing as his rival Lisa Nandy to speak hard truths to members about the reasons for Labour\u2019s defeat. But he was not the candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/23/labour-leadership-interviews-rebecca-long-bailey-podcast\">endorsed by Corbyn</a> and his election marks a welcome fresh start.</p> <p>There are a number of daunting tasks on Starmer\u2019s to-do list. The first is to get the substance and tenor of opposition right in these extraordinary times. Britain is crying out for a mature and responsible opposition that can forensically hold this government, whose response to the coronavirus pandemic has been marred by a lack of preparedness and transparency, to account. In recent weeks, frontbenchers such as the shadow health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/labour-urges-government-publish-findings-2016-pandemic-drill\">Jon Ashworth</a>, have led the way in asking appropriately tough questions of government about some of the chaotic aspects of its response, for example in its tardy procurement of ventilators, personal protective equipment and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/a-glimmer-of-hope-but-little-detail-experts-react-to-hancocks-test-plan\">testing capacity</a>, without looking like they are seeking to make political capital.

      "bodyText": "It was supposed to have been the big political event of April, but the announcement of Labour\u2019s leadership result was a low-key affair yesterday, with relatively little fanfare, overshadowed by the terrifying coronavirus crisis that has swept across Britain. As expected, Keir Starmer, the party\u2019s shadow Brexit secretary, was decisively endorsed by Labour members and supporters. In a sober, impressive address, he spoke of Labour\u2019s mission in the coming weeks to save lives and protect the country through constructive opposition. Starmer takes over not just at a time of unprecedented national crisis, but a difficult juncture for his party. His victory comes after its most disastrous election defeat since 1935, the product of a party that was mired in institutional antisemitism, divisions over Brexit and voters\u2019 dislike of Jeremy Corbyn. During the three-month leadership campaign, Starmer has not proved as willing as his rival Lisa Nandy to speak hard truths to members about the reasons for Labour\u2019s defeat. But he was not the candidate endorsed by Corbyn and his election marks a welcome fresh start. There are a number of daunting tasks on Starmer\u2019s to-do list. The first is to get the substance and tenor of opposition right in these extraordinary times. Britain is crying out for a mature and responsible opposition that can forensically hold this government, whose response to the coronavirus pandemic has been marred by a lack of preparedness and transparency, to account. In recent weeks, frontbenchers such as the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, have led the way in asking appropriately tough questions of government about some of the chaotic aspects of its response, for example in its tardy procurement of ventilators, personal protective equipment and testing capacity, without looking like they are seeking to make political capital. Starmer must press for proper parliamentary scrutiny, even while MPs are not meeting in Westminster. Further, he must confront the toxic cultures that have polluted his party. Most importantly, he must take responsibility for rooting out antisemitism, including fully implementing the recommendations of the Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry when it is published. The party has also proved incapable of adjudicating fairly on allegations of sexual harassment. We applaud his commitment to establishing an independent complaints process. The country faces huge levels of uncertainty as a result of the pandemic, with little clarity about where we will be in a few weeks, let alone six months. The only known is that there will be no going back to normal. Starmer must find a way to set out a vision for a new politics that addresses the societal fragilities that have been so painfully exposed in recent weeks, while holding on to those small shoots that are already emerging from the hardships and losses that many are starting to experience. The same questions therefore face a party that defines itself through its aspiration for a fairer, greener world \u2013 but with new challenges attached. How would a Labour government restore a healthcare system that rightly commands huge national pride, but that will be left ravaged not just by a decade of austerity but a pandemic?

The deputy chief medical officer, Nick Coatsworth, meanwhile said Australia appeared to be on the right path. \u201cIf we do stop these measures too early, then we have seen graphs in the media showing there could be a resurgence in cases so we have to be careful on those grounds,\u201d Coatsworth told Sky News on Sunday. Dr Jeremy McAnulty, NSW Health\u2019s director of health protection, said the rate of daily infections in that state was \u201cstabilising\u201d but it was too early to say if this trend would continue. \u201cIt is pleasing to see early signs of stabilisation, which is down to a number of important factors,\u201d McAnulty said. He attributed that stabilisation to an early detection of cases, allowing for early contact tracing and isolation of all known contacts, as well as adherence to social distancing measures. \u201cWe want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done and it is important that we all heed those messages.\u201d New South Wales reported 87 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in that state to 2,580. Some 39 people with Covid-19 are in intensive care in that state, 23 of whom require ventilators. NSW has the highest rates of untraced community transmission in the country, with 380 cases recorded as having been acquired locally with no known source of infection and 58 more under investigation. About 118,863 people have tested negative to the virus . The federal government has said it will release modelling on the coronavirus outlook in Australia on Tuesday, after it is approved by the national cabinet. Modelling by the University of Sydney showed that the number of active cases in Australia, assuming continued adherence to the current social distancing laws, could peak mid-April and the spread could be controlled by July. That modelling suggested the total number of people who would contract Covid-19 in Australia over the course of the pandemic was between 8,000 and 10,000. The current number is 5,635. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said he for the first time had \u201ca little bit of optimism that we can actually beat this\u201d. \u201cThat we can take a different course than most of Europe and North America has taken,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cThat we can avoid literally the millions of cases that will occur in North America and Europe and the tens of thousands of deaths that, unfortunately, will occur in those continents \u2026 It means staying the course in Australia, and the things that we\u2019ve asked people to do can make a difference, and this is the very early sign of it.\u201d Victoria recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, bringing the total to 1,135 of which 75 were acquired through untraced community transmission. Sutton said the new cases recorded on Sunday were \u201clikely to be a mix\u201d of returned travellers and known contacts, and community acquired cases. \u201cWe\u2019ll see a greater proportion of community transmission as our international travel proportion goes down, because those individuals are smaller and smaller in number as every day goes by,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd their secondary contacts are fewer and fewer because we\u2019ve got people in hotel quarantine, therefore protecting others around them.\u201d Queensland recorded just nine new cases overnight \u2013 its smallest one day rise in weeks. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a long way to go, but these signs are very encouraging to have only nine positive cases overnight,\u201d Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said. Palaszczuk said that more than 92% of the 907 cases confirmed to date in Queensland were either acquired overseas, or were caught from a person who had acquired the disease overseas. The Northern Territory has no confirmed cases of community transmission. It recorded 27 new cases overnight, including a child who was a close contact of a person who had travelled overseas.",

The move comes as Labor steps up its call for parliament to sit regularly during the coronavirus crisis, saying it is inevitable mistakes have been made in the rush to draw up a raft of economic stimulus and support measures. Australia has had 5,687 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 35 deaths, according to the latest figures released on Sunday. Christian Porter, the attorney general, opened the door to allowing more of the casual workforce to access the wage subsidies \u2013 an issue that has been raised by unions, business groups and various MPs. Porter said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. The government is poised to reach out to the secretary of the ACTU, Sally McManus, over the draft legislation, which will then go to parliament on Wednesday. Porter and McManus have spoken regularly in recent weeks. In a bid to reassure the union movement over the broader legislation, Porter told reporters on Sunday the changes to workplace relations laws would be subject to a six-month expiry date, which could only be changed in future with parliament\u2019s backing. He said the preparation of this legislation was \u201cone of the most important drafting exercises post-World War II\u201d because it would facilitate $130bn of \u201ceconomy-saving and job-saving expenditure\u201d over the next six months. \u201cThere is a lot of progress; it is occurring under enormous time pressure,\u201d he said in Canberra on Sunday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending - to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight, which the Australian Tax Office would pay directly to businesses and not-for-profit organisations that have suffered sharp drops in turnover during the coronavirus pandemic. McManus said the union movement had been raising concerns publicly and privately with the government about how it planned to implement the plan. McManus said 1.1m casuals would miss out on the payment because they had not reached the test of at least 12 months of continuous employment with their employer. Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program, McManus suggested an alternative test, saying \u201cif you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the coronavirus, then you should get the jobkeeper allowance\u201d. This would include casuals who had shifts already booked or received a promise of work. Porter acknowledged on Sunday that many people were regularly employed casually but may move from employer to employer. \u201cWe\u2019re working on that and listening and so when you see the final draft you will see we are trying to be as inclusive and reasonable as possible,\u201d he said. McManus also raised the plight of work visa holders who would miss out on the payments. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure that they\u2019re not let to starve as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other concern we\u2019ve got is a push by the government to change the Fair Work Act. We do not believe that this is necessary. We\u2019ve demonstrated that it is not necessary.\u201d McManus pointed to recent changes to modern awards that had been put through the Fair Work Commission over the last couple of weeks, and covered millions of workers, as an example of how measures could be reached through cooperation rather than legislation. She noted that not every award or enterprise agreement needed to change because some industries were doing well at the current time because of increased demand. McManus raised concern that in some sectors, employers might \u201cabuse\u201d or \u201ctake advantage\u201d of changes to the Fair Work Act and called on Labor, the Greens and crossbenchers to oppose such provisions. Unions are worried that some employers may take advantage of provisions allowing them to direct workers to run down their existing leave entitlements. Labor raised similar concerns last week, saying if employees were forced to exhaust their leave entitlements, the new $1,500 fortnightly payment may be transformed from a \u201cwage subsidy\u201d for employees into a \u201cbalance sheet subsidy\u201d that benefits employers. Porter said he would share drafts of the legislation with the ACTU and work through the details \u201cin a cooperative, open, frank and honest way\u201d. But he argued that failing to provide certainty through changes to the Fair Work Act could lead to additional job losses. \u201cWe will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be effected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements,\u201d Porter said. \u201cNo matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday: 6m Australian jobs depend on it. Next Wednesday, we are pushing a $130bn lifeboat out into the roughest economic seas Australia has ever seen and people will need to decide whether or not they\u2019re going to help us push the boat out.\u201d The government also confirmed the special measures to be put in place to allow parliament to sit on Wednesday amid the current health crisis. There are expected to be 47 \u201cpair\u201d arrangements in the House of Representatives, which would allow many MPs to be absent. Just 30 government MPs and 21 opposition MPs are likely to attend the lower house. Most of the crossbench MPs are likely to attend. Question time will be at 2pm as usual.

The beginnings of a bureaucratic blame game and increasingly open concerns about the route out of the coronavirus epidemic. And all in the opening weeks of a crisis that most experts believe will grip the nation for months.</p> <p>This was the week when public pleas for national unity from ministers were accompanied by increasingly fraught exchanges in Whitehall, as ministers, scientific advisers and officials confronted the reality of an unprecedented emergency developing at incredible speed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how quickly things move and turn,\u201d said one official. \u201cThere seems to be a narrative from some that there\u2019s a fixed body of evidence on how to deal with things. It\u2019s not like that. It sometimes feels like a game of whack-a-mole.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Everyone seems to think there\u2019s some sort of nirvana that lies beyond just having lots of tests.</p> <footer> <cite>John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately for the government, the moment that its handling of the crisis came seriously under strain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/01/alok-sharma-draws-the-short-straw-and-makes-an-april-fool-of-himself\" title=\"\">was broadcast live on television</a>. Inside Whitehall, there is a good dose of sympathy with Alok Sharma, the softly spoken business secretary, whose vague answers at Wednesday\u2019s press conference about the government\u2019s virus testing strategy encapsulated an apparent refusal to be honest with the public. In reality, he was following government \u201clines to take\u201d designed to talk in broad terms about testing being a priority and a desire to increase it. Yet unanswered questions over testing had built up to such a pitch that senior Tories were immediately aware that a breaking point had been reached. \u201cIt was a car crash,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cThis is what happens in a crisis. You get battered and buffeted, and you have to deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s handling of testing has become the case study in its struggle to communicate its strategy. Insiders concede that the apparent reluctance to explain bottlenecks and capacity issues was a mistake. This was addressed on Thursday, when health secretary Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/health-secretary-says-remarks-over-coronavirus-peak-over-interpreted\" title=\"\">returned after a stint in self-isolation</a>. With new frankness, Hancock conceded the scale of the challenge, admitted that mistakes would be made and set a clearer strategy and target for testing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/uk-ministers-struggle-to-keep-promise-of-100k-coronavirus-tests-by-end-of-april\" title=\"\">100,000 a day by the end of the month</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>In the developing blame game, fingers were pointing at Public Health England. While doing a good job in managing its in-house testing capacity, there was frustration at its slowness in co-opting private labs, as other countries have done. Greg Clark, the former cabinet minister and chair of the commons science and technology committee, has now formally written to PHE in order to scrutinise the thinking behind a centralised approach to testing that has been partly to blame for the slower rollout. \u201cIt seems to me that the fact we\u2019re doing it now, and the fact that [chief scientific adviser] Patrick Vallance and Matt Hancock all say we would have preferred to have more testing, seems to me that was probably the wrong call to limit it to Public Health England labs,\u201d said Clark.</p> <p>Tensions appear to be aimed higher up Whitehall, with whispers taking aim at the grip of Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary. Sidelined cabinet ministers are being blamed for the sniping. The political response is now largely in the hands of five ministers \u2013 the prime minister, cabinet office minister Michael Gove, chancellor Rishi Sunak, foreign secretary Dominic Raab, and Hancock. \u201cThere\u2019s frustration from people in offices not really involved,\u201d said one insider. \u201cCrises also see a lot of old agendas come to the fore, too.

      "bodyText": "A \u201ccar crash\u201d media appearance. A political \u201creset\u201d already being challenged. A prime minister stuck in isolation. The beginnings of a bureaucratic blame game and increasingly open concerns about the route out of the coronavirus epidemic. And all in the opening weeks of a crisis that most experts believe will grip the nation for months. This was the week when public pleas for national unity from ministers were accompanied by increasingly fraught exchanges in Whitehall, as ministers, scientific advisers and officials confronted the reality of an unprecedented emergency developing at incredible speed. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary how quickly things move and turn,\u201d said one official. \u201cThere seems to be a narrative from some that there\u2019s a fixed body of evidence on how to deal with things. It\u2019s not like that. It sometimes feels like a game of whack-a-mole.\u201d Unfortunately for the government, the moment that its handling of the crisis came seriously under strain was broadcast live on television. Inside Whitehall, there is a good dose of sympathy with Alok Sharma, the softly spoken business secretary, whose vague answers at Wednesday\u2019s press conference about the government\u2019s virus testing strategy encapsulated an apparent refusal to be honest with the public. In reality, he was following government \u201clines to take\u201d designed to talk in broad terms about testing being a priority and a desire to increase it. Yet unanswered questions over testing had built up to such a pitch that senior Tories were immediately aware that a breaking point had been reached. \u201cIt was a car crash,\u201d said one. Another said: \u201cThis is what happens in a crisis. You get battered and buffeted, and you have to deal with it.\u201d The government\u2019s handling of testing has become the case study in its struggle to communicate its strategy. Insiders concede that the apparent reluctance to explain bottlenecks and capacity issues was a mistake. This was addressed on Thursday, when health secretary Matt Hancock returned after a stint in self-isolation. With new frankness, Hancock conceded the scale of the challenge, admitted that mistakes would be made and set a clearer strategy and target for testing 100,000 a day by the end of the month. In the developing blame game, fingers were pointing at Public Health England. While doing a good job in managing its in-house testing capacity, there was frustration at its slowness in co-opting private labs, as other countries have done. Greg Clark, the former cabinet minister and chair of the commons science and technology committee, has now formally written to PHE in order to scrutinise the thinking behind a centralised approach to testing that has been partly to blame for the slower rollout. \u201cIt seems to me that the fact we\u2019re doing it now, and the fact that [chief scientific adviser] Patrick Vallance and Matt Hancock all say we would have preferred to have more testing, seems to me that was probably the wrong call to limit it to Public Health England labs,\u201d said Clark. Tensions appear to be aimed higher up Whitehall, with whispers taking aim at the grip of Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary. Sidelined cabinet ministers are being blamed for the sniping. The political response is now largely in the hands of five ministers \u2013 the prime minister, cabinet office minister Michael Gove, chancellor Rishi Sunak, foreign secretary Dominic Raab, and Hancock. \u201cThere\u2019s frustration from people in offices not really involved,\u201d said one insider. \u201cCrises also see a lot of old agendas come to the fore, too. The civil service has been excellent.\u201d There are already concerns the new testing target cannot be met, as NHS lab staff complain that they do not have the stocks of kit required. Hancock\u2019s allies know his decision to reset the testing policy means he now owns it. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a gamble,\u201d said one. Yet the political uncertainty over testing has been made even more complicated by disagreements between scientists\u2013 highly awkward for a government committed to following their advice.

Meanwhile, one letter signed by dozens of public health and epidemiology experts last week demanded \u201cwidespread community testing\u201d and the return of \u201cindividual case detection, contact tracing and appropriate isolation\u201d. \u201cWe know that testing on a large scale is one of the ways out,\u201d says an official. The \u201cway out\u201d is already the issue haunting the government. Studies of the health effects of a prolonged lockdown are under way.

I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.\u201d</p> <p>This quiet sense of destiny and \u201cinnate hunger\u201d, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. \u201cOne of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.\u201d</p> <p>Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party\u2019s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/labour-gives-keir-starmer-strong-mandate-to-face-battles-ahead\"> but miles in front of his two rivals</a>, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/the-corbyn-project-is-over-but-keir-starmer-still-needs-the-left\">The Corbyn project is over, but Keir Starmer still needs the left</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates.</p> <p>Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight.</p> <p>Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing.</p> <p>But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People wanted someone who could win,  someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing</p> <footer> <cite>Starmer supporter</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer.</p> <p>With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill.</p> <p>Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites.</p> <p>Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/05/from-attlee-to-blair-what-starmer-can-learn-from-four-labour-leaders\">From Attlee to Blair: what Starmer can learn from four Labour leaders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d</p> <p>One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition.

      "bodyText": "A few days before Keir Starmer was crowned leader of the Labour party, one of his shadow cabinet colleagues, Jon Trickett, made this observation about the way he operates. \u201cHe just has this inner drive. I get this impression that he thinks he has been driven by fate.\u201d This quiet sense of destiny and \u201cinnate hunger\u201d, Trickett said, seemed to affect much that Starmer did, and how he behaved. \u201cOne of the things I have noticed about Keir is that you can be walking through the Commons, or wherever it is, with him in a reasonably comradely way and then, suddenly, he would end up two strides ahead. It is just how he is.\u201d Yesterday the Surrey-raised 57-year-old son of a toolmaker and a nurse, who named their son after the party\u2019s first parliamentary leader, Keir Hardie, emerged not just strides but miles in front of his two rivals, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy, from the long contest to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The brilliant human rights lawyer who rose to become director of public prosecutions aged 45 in 2008 has only been an MP since 2015. But in a deeply divided party he managed to sweep up 56.2% of the vote, leaving Long-Bailey and Nandy way behind, on 27.6% and 16.2% respectively. Importantly, Starmer won a mandate across the board, winning the biggest share of the vote among MPs, members and affiliates. Many among Starmer\u2019s own supporters and within his campaign team, who tied him ruthlessly and repetitively to messages about unity during more than 40 hustings, had thought early on that it would be a much closer fight. Some believed he would appear too \u201clawyerly\u201d and wooden, while others feared that the left\u2019s candidate Long-Bailey, MP for Salford and Eccles, would be propelled to victory by the pro-Corbyn organisation Momentum, which had the vital data on many of the 500,000 party members from the last two contests in 2015 and 2016. Another danger, his backers believed, was that Starmer, a London MP and star barrister with a square jaw and smart suits, would be seen in the Labour heartlands as another Blairite in left-wing clothing. But as it turned out, the left who had wanted Long-Bailey to win, including her union backers, fell out among themselves about how to carry Corbynism forward amid the post-general election acrimony, and her campaign never really took off. It was also not entirely clear how much she wanted the job and whether she felt forced against her better instincts to carry the torch for the Corbynistas. \u201cShe went missing for the first four weeks of the campaign, which made everyone think she was wobbling, and when it started it was pretty much a disaster. By that time Starmer was miles ahead,\u201d said one of her early backers. While Nandy impressed and won admirers, the MP for Wigan started too far behind, and was viewed as less tried and tested than Starmer. With the party shattered by its worst defeat since 1935, when the rebuilding process began, it was not ideological purity, flamboyance, or someone young and new that members across the Labour divide wanted \u2013 but someone reassuring and competent who they could see taking on and outshining Boris Johnson. And Starmer fitted the bill. Prominent names on the left such as Laura Parker, a former senior official in Corbyn\u2019s office and a former national organiser of Momentum, chose Starmer and was followed by many other Momentumites. Parker, who had seen him operate in Labour\u2019s Brexit sub-committee, said Starmer was \u201ctenacious, forensic, diligent, intelligent\u201d. His focus, determination and mastery of detail is something everyone who knows him observes. Importantly for Parker he had also, since the election, put forward a left-wing programme that for her was entirely credible, allowing her to feel it was a natural switch. \u201cHe can seem cautious but the other side of that is that you feel you can believe the words that come out of his mouth,\u201d Parker said. \u201cHe has said there will be no rolling back from a radical programme \u2013 and I, like others who supported Corbyn, backed him on the basis of the policy commitments he had in his 10 pledges.\u201d One of Starmer\u2019s supporters who manned phone banks for him said Momentum members came over in droves. \u201cYou could just hear them peeling off on the phone. They wanted someone who could win, people wanted someone professional \u2013 this came up a lot \u2013 and capable of governing as well as leading an effective opposition. They trusted him to do both. There is only a relatively small hardcore of the membership who think that ideological purity is more important than winning.\u201d Starmer\u2019s supporters deny that his campaign had been long in the planning. But he has been very careful in his five years in parliament not to make political enemies either at Westminster or in his Holborn and St Pancras constituency party \u2013 and to shore up support against potential challenges from the local left.

In local Labour politics it was the same. Sally Gimson, an activist in Holborn and St Pancras, says that even when he was handling the Brexit brief in the shadow cabinet, Starmer had \u201cnever been too grand to come to the smallest fundraiser or support a tiny community group\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Banks are wicked and Rishi Sunak walks on water. That, at least, was the narrative that prevailed until the end of last week. The dashing new chancellor, the cabinet star of the coronavirus moment, had assembled the Treasury\u2019s armoury to provide lending to British businesses on unprecedented scale. It was only the damn banks that were stopping the cash reaching intended recipients.</p> <p>This storyline now looks wrong. Sunak and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\" title=\"\">the Treasury\u2019s \u201cfurther action\u201d, </a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\" title=\"\">announced on Thursday night</a> to support struggling British firms, was not a mere tweak. It was a sweeping redesign of a lending scheme that had glaring flaws.</p> <p>Yes, the lending banks probably have been too slow and plodding, but they weren\u2019t the primary block in getting money to thousands of businesses. Rather, they were trying to implement a wonky and fiddly package of the Treasury\u2019s creation.</p> <p>Version two of the scheme looks much better, which is a relief. The main reform related to eligibility for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or Cbils, the part aimed at small businesses.</p> <p>In the first outing, such government-backed interest-free loans could only be offered to businesses that could not secure finance in the normal way. Cue outrage among would-be borrowers who thought Sunak had promised them ultra-cheap loans but then found that the banks were first pushing standard finance with interest and fees.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t. No wonder borrowers were angry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the rejigged arrangement, all viable borrowers can proceed directly to the juicier Cbils product. That could be a game-changer in solving individual companies\u2019 cash flow worries, but it\u2019s worth asking how the Treasury miscalculated in the first place.</p> <p>No 11, one assumes, wanted to limit the risk to the public purse, a noble intention on the face of it because the government is on the hook for 80% of any loss of a Cbils loan. But the requirement to assess firms\u2019 eligibility for conventional finance meant Cbils wasn\u2019t having an impact. By Thursday night, only \u00a390m of loans had been approved to 983 businesses \u2013 barely scratching the surface of the problem.</p> <p>A similar point can be made about the contentious issue of personal guarantees on loans under \u00a3250,000. Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t, or were doing so in different circumstances. No wonder borrowers were angry. But the banks themselves were confused because the Treasury hadn\u2019t made clear what it wanted. Friday brought the clear instruction not to ask for guarantees. It could have been given on day one.</p> <p>Sunak has also had to acknowledge his original design had a large hole in the middle. Cbils loans were limited to firms with an annual turnover of \u00a345m or less, with other would-be borrowers directed to the scheme for larger companies overseen by the Bank of England. That didn\u2019t work because mid-sized companies thought they needed a credit rating, which most don\u2019t have. Thus Cbils has now been extended, in effect, to firms with \u00a3500m of turnover, albeit that they\u2019ll pay interest on loans.</p> <p>Business groups have applauded the Treasury for listening to feedback. They\u2019re being polite.

      "bodyText": "Banks are wicked and Rishi Sunak walks on water. That, at least, was the narrative that prevailed until the end of last week. The dashing new chancellor, the cabinet star of the coronavirus moment, had assembled the Treasury\u2019s armoury to provide lending to British businesses on unprecedented scale. It was only the damn banks that were stopping the cash reaching intended recipients. This storyline now looks wrong. Sunak and the Treasury\u2019s \u201cfurther action\u201d, announced on Thursday night to support struggling British firms, was not a mere tweak. It was a sweeping redesign of a lending scheme that had glaring flaws. Yes, the lending banks probably have been too slow and plodding, but they weren\u2019t the primary block in getting money to thousands of businesses. Rather, they were trying to implement a wonky and fiddly package of the Treasury\u2019s creation. Version two of the scheme looks much better, which is a relief. The main reform related to eligibility for the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, or Cbils, the part aimed at small businesses. In the first outing, such government-backed interest-free loans could only be offered to businesses that could not secure finance in the normal way. Cue outrage among would-be borrowers who thought Sunak had promised them ultra-cheap loans but then found that the banks were first pushing standard finance with interest and fees. In the rejigged arrangement, all viable borrowers can proceed directly to the juicier Cbils product. That could be a game-changer in solving individual companies\u2019 cash flow worries, but it\u2019s worth asking how the Treasury miscalculated in the first place. No 11, one assumes, wanted to limit the risk to the public purse, a noble intention on the face of it because the government is on the hook for 80% of any loss of a Cbils loan. But the requirement to assess firms\u2019 eligibility for conventional finance meant Cbils wasn\u2019t having an impact. By Thursday night, only \u00a390m of loans had been approved to 983 businesses \u2013 barely scratching the surface of the problem. A similar point can be made about the contentious issue of personal guarantees on loans under \u00a3250,000. Some banks were asking for guarantees at launch; some weren\u2019t, or were doing so in different circumstances. No wonder borrowers were angry. But the banks themselves were confused because the Treasury hadn\u2019t made clear what it wanted. Friday brought the clear instruction not to ask for guarantees. It could have been given on day one. Sunak has also had to acknowledge his original design had a large hole in the middle. Cbils loans were limited to firms with an annual turnover of \u00a345m or less, with other would-be borrowers directed to the scheme for larger companies overseen by the Bank of England. That didn\u2019t work because mid-sized companies thought they needed a credit rating, which most don\u2019t have. Thus Cbils has now been extended, in effect, to firms with \u00a3500m of turnover, albeit that they\u2019ll pay interest on loans. Business groups have applauded the Treasury for listening to feedback. They\u2019re being polite. Many of the design flaws could surely have been anticipated if the Treasury had had a better feel for how small businesses think and act. Sunak, it should be said, deserves praise for his \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme that will underwrite 80% of wages at affected companies. That is a genuinely big \u2013 and necessarily expensive \u2013 intervention that will save thousands of jobs. Nor should we pretend that designing a loan scheme is easy. The current crisis, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, extends almost to the entire economy. And, to repeat, the banks still need to move. But it also needs to be stated: Cbils required urgent improvement because its original design was poor. Billionaires benefit from the furlough. They don\u2019t need more The bill for supporting British business through the crisis will be enormous. It could not be otherwise. The government is paying 80% of the wages of millions of workers across the UK to minimise job losses and ensure the economy is fit to recover when lockdown ends. There will still be corporate failures \u2013 indeed, the destruction has started already on the high street with the collapse of Carluccio\u2019s and Laura Ashley. The only certainty is that action, in the form of the vast \u201cfurlough\u201d scheme, will be cheaper than inaction in the long run. Not all beneficiaries are alike, however. When clothing retailer Arcadia put 14,500 employees into furlough last week, Philip Green became an indirect beneficiary of the public purse. Or, strictly speaking, his wife, Monaco-based Lady Green, got lucky since she is the owner of the struggling fashion empire that includes Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins. This, to put it mildly, feels appalling. The Greens banked a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 but are under no obligation to return a single penny to the business in the circumstances.

It is virtually impossible to design a furlough scheme that does not apply equally to all companies. Ministers can, though, take a tough line when overseas-based billionaires beg for help beyond the generous furlough scheme.

The response to that should be simple: it\u2019s your turn to put your hand in your pocket. In time, we must devote huge resources to restarting the economy There has never been a crisis like the current one. The onset of coronavirus has crippled the advanced world, as governments effectively shut down economic and social life as we know it. Unemployment is now starting to soar as companies run out of money amid the enforced lockdowns, with early indications that joblessness in the US and UK could surpass the depths of the 1930s Great Depression. The jobs crisis is of our own making, an exercise in protecting the health of a nation at the expense of material wealth. It is entirely correct that a compassionate society should take such an approach. But the impact of the lockdown ought not to be overlooked: millions are facing unemployment and hardship. Comparisons with the second world war and the Great Depression are overwrought. Rather than attempting full-scale mobilisation, Covid-19 is overcome by suppressing the economy as much as possible. And, unlike the Depression, hope still remains that this crisis will prove shorter than any other severe economic downturn in history. But two historical comparisons ought to be kept in mind: the need for a New Deal akin to Roosevelt\u2019s in the 1930s, or the Marshall Plan of the 1940s, to reboot economic activity once the economy awakens from hibernation. When the dust finally settles on the emergency phase of the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 a moment hoped for sooner rather than later \u2013 the government must throw as much weight behind reopening the economy as it did to shut it down. In the short term, support packages are welcome, despite shortcomings that mean many are still left without adequate financial aid, as the Conservative government temporarily ditches political dogma dating back decades. Failure to support those who lose their jobs in this crisis will only cost Britain even more in the long run, from weaker economic growth and lost tax revenues.",

      "body": "<p>Detroit is planning a rapid mobilization of its engineering and manufacturing might unseen since the second world war, switching from making cars to making ventilators as the Covid-19 pandemic brings the US to breaking point.</p> <p>With coronavirus cases surging, not least in Detroit, demand for ventilators is outpacing hospitals\u2019 supply and people are dying without the machines. Now the US\u2019s largest car manufacturers are stepping in. General Motors plans to begin producing 10,000 ventilators per month by mid-April, and Ford hopes to produce 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days.</p> <p>But producing ventilators and automobiles are two very different processes, and retooling auto factories to make ventilators presents a daunting logistical challenge. Can Detroit really save the nation from its growing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">ventilator crisis</a>?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus-andrew-cuomo\">New York only has enough ventilators for six more days, says Governor Cuomo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of research with the Center for Automotive Research, said she was initially skeptical. Automakers have already had success <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/03/31/gm-face-masks-ventec-warren/5097793002/\">producing personal protection equipment</a> like face shields and surgical masks, Dziczek noted, but she\u2019s been \u201camazed\u201d that they seem to be successfully gearing up to produce far more complex ventilators.</p> <p>\u201cI knew the industry had something to offer, though I never thought it could actually produce ventilators. But, in fact, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Dziczek said.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, success hinges on the automakers\u2019 addressing four challenges:</p> <ul> <li><p>Retooling plants</p></li> <li><p>Developing a supply chain</p></li> <li><p>Pulling together a workforce </p></li> <li><p>Clearing regulatory hurdles</p></li> </ul> <p>And they need to solve those issues immediately. American hospitals have about 160,000 ventilators, and only about 65,000 of the machines designed for the most severe cases. Critical care units in hotspots like New York City and Detroit already have a shortage. Eventually, up to 740,000 ventilators could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.</p> <p>Ventilators are designed to push air through a tube and into the lungs. They are in high demand because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, and people with severe cases need extra oxygen to survive.</p> <p>Once in production, the devices won\u2019t roll off the lines at Ford or GM\u2019s behemoth, robot-filled plants that produce F-150 pickups and Sierras. Instead, the machines will be assembled largely by hand at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, and GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, facility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e5dd6d09f841ac1d548ac405d9d60c41ec8728/0_0_3471_2083/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A General Motors assembly worker works on assembling a V6 engine last year.

      "bodyText": "Detroit is planning a rapid mobilization of its engineering and manufacturing might unseen since the second world war, switching from making cars to making ventilators as the Covid-19 pandemic brings the US to breaking point. With coronavirus cases surging, not least in Detroit, demand for ventilators is outpacing hospitals\u2019 supply and people are dying without the machines. Now the US\u2019s largest car manufacturers are stepping in. General Motors plans to begin producing 10,000 ventilators per month by mid-April, and Ford hopes to produce 50,000 of the devices in the next 100 days. But producing ventilators and automobiles are two very different processes, and retooling auto factories to make ventilators presents a daunting logistical challenge. Can Detroit really save the nation from its growing ventilator crisis? Kristin Dziczek, vice-president of research with the Center for Automotive Research, said she was initially skeptical. Automakers have already had success producing personal protection equipment like face shields and surgical masks, Dziczek noted, but she\u2019s been \u201camazed\u201d that they seem to be successfully gearing up to produce far more complex ventilators. \u201cI knew the industry had something to offer, though I never thought it could actually produce ventilators. But, in fact, that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to do,\u201d Dziczek said. Broadly speaking, success hinges on the automakers\u2019 addressing four challenges: Retooling plants Developing a supply chain Pulling together a workforce Clearing regulatory hurdles And they need to solve those issues immediately. American hospitals have about 160,000 ventilators, and only about 65,000 of the machines designed for the most severe cases. Critical care units in hotspots like New York City and Detroit already have a shortage. Eventually, up to 740,000 ventilators could be needed, according to the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Ventilators are designed to push air through a tube and into the lungs. They are in high demand because Covid-19 attacks the lungs, and people with severe cases need extra oxygen to survive. Once in production, the devices won\u2019t roll off the lines at Ford or GM\u2019s behemoth, robot-filled plants that produce F-150 pickups and Sierras. Instead, the machines will be assembled largely by hand at Ford\u2019s Rawsonville Plant in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan, and GM\u2019s Kokomo, Indiana, facility. The latter is a relatively trim 2.6m-sq-ft plant resembling a clean office building more than a gritty factory, and it is where GM produces small electrical components for cars. Similarly, when it isn\u2019t idled, Ford\u2019s 1.7m-sq-ft Rawsonville plant produces components such as transmission oil pumps, battery packs, and air induction systems. The companies are utilizing those facilities because they are where \u201ca bunch of smaller parts arrive, then are assembled into larger parts\u201d, said Mark Schirmer, public relations director with Cox Automotive. \u201cThey\u2019re then shipped to the assembly plants to be installed in vehicles on the large assembly lines.\u201d The process for manufacturing ventilators is similar, he added. \u201cImagine someone at a desk putting together a complex puzzle or model by hand \u2013 lots of small-part assembly,\u201d Schirmer said, adding that the real challenge was \u201cgetting all the necessary parts together in one place for workers to assemble them\u201d. More than 700 parts compose the VOCSN critical care ventilators that GM is partnering with Seattle-based Ventec Life Systems to produce in Kokomo, and the automaker has tapped more than 100 suppliers to feed components. The ventilators are sought after by hospitals because they are five-in-one, portable machines with critical care ventilators, oxygen concentrators, cough assistance, suction and nebulizers. By contrast, Ford is producing a simple ventilator design, which will be licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon and operate on air pressure instead of electricity. Ford and GE designers have essentially stripped down a machine used for anesthesia that functions as a ventilator. Aside from sourcing components from suppliers, Ford is repurposing parts that are \u201cuseful in production of other items\u201d, its chief executive, Jim Hackett, recently told CBS This Morning. \u201cWe\u2019re going into our parts bins to see what can be done,\u201d he added. Concurrently, the automakers are helping boost production at their partners\u2019 facilities \u2013 Ventec currently produces about 200 ventilators monthly, and GM is using its suppliers and logistical team to help the company push out about 10 times that figure. Meanwhile, Ford said it was helping ramp up GE\u2019s capacity. Labor is perhaps the easiest challenge for the companies to solve, partly because ventilator production is not a labor-intensive job. Cox said it had found one of the nation\u2019s largest ventilator manufacturers only had about 10,000 employees worldwide. Automakers are asking United Auto Workers employees to volunteer to work in three shifts. Ford said it would need about 500 employees, while GM is staffing Kokomo with about 1,000. \u201cIf this does move forward as promoted, it won\u2019t be like world war two when automotive plants were changed over to produce tanks, planes and plane engines,\u201d Schirmer said. The effort got a boost when Donald Trump invoked the Defense Production Act \u2013 wartime legislation that will allow automakers to avoid certain patent issues and provides the president with the ability to compel companies to prioritize government orders over those of other clients. As he announced the measure, Trump also criticized GM over the ventilators\u2019 price. However, both automakers have said they won\u2019t profit off of the project. Ventec\u2019s ventilators can cost about $18,000 each, far cheaper than the more sophisticated models, which can run up to $50,000. The federal government is also accommodating automakers by waiving Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rules to allow non-medical manufacturers to quickly produce the devices. Among other changes, it is not enforcing rules that require ventilator manufacturers to gain FDA approval before making slight changes to their devices. \u201cIf you want to help expand production of ventilators to save American lives in this pandemic, we are going to work with you to sweep every possible barrier out of your way,\u201d the FDA wrote in a 22 March statement. Sadly, many of those ventilators will be needed in Detroit. As of Saturday, the city had recorded more than 3,550 confirmed cases and more than 117 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. Michigan had seen close to 13,000 cases and close to 500 deaths. For those with the disease, Motor City\u2019s ventilators can\u2019t come soon enough.",

The plague struck just after the Athenians\u2019 leader, Pericles, delivered his great funeral oration over the dead from the war against Sparta. Alas, Pericles himself died of the plague, and not long after Athens\u2019s glory was in decline.</p> <p>Most historians would no doubt say that Britain\u2019s glory days began their decline after the second world war. But one of the lessons from that war was that, well before it ended, the coalition government under Conservative prime minister Winston Churchill and Labour deputy prime minister Clement Attlee was planning for the aftermath.</p> <p>One of the main things on Attlee\u2019s mind was that the poor social conditions of the interwar years should not be experienced again. Central to postwar planning was the formation of the NHS under the first Attlee administration of 1945-50, which was set up, amid fierce resistance from the medical profession, by Aneurin Bevan in 1948.</p> <p>There was no NHS in ancient Athens, and there is no NHS in the United States. To put it another way: we have a health service, they have a health sector. That is an important reason why, for all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/absolutely-wrong-how-uk-coronavirus-test-strategy-unravelled?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">well-publicised mishandling of this crisis in the UK</a>, the US, still the mightiest economy in the world, seems to be in for an even bigger shock from the virus than we are experiencing.</p> <p>At this point \u2013 as one who was born a year before the outbreak of the 1939-45 war \u2013 I hope readers will forgive me if I point to an important difference in the dangers to the general public between then and now. Thus I confess that my initial inclination when asked what I felt personally about the virus \u2013 as opposed to thoughts about the disturbing political and economic implications \u2013 was to say something like: \u201cThis is nothing like watching flying bombs overhead, listening as their engines switched off, and hoping they didn\u2019t land on you.\u201d In fact one did land on the church at the end of our road and shattered our windows while we were safe in the Anderson shelter in the garden.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Tories suddenly becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The awful thing about this plague is that it is more like the Athenian one 2,500 years ago or the Spanish flu of 1918. It doesn\u2019t fly in or explode, it just hits people unawares \u2013 that is to say, we are aware of the danger, but don\u2019t know if or when it will hit. A timely reminder of the horrors of germ warfare.</p> <p>In common with most of the population, I feel as if I am under house arrest. But when I hear and read so many comments about \u201cdraconian\u201d conditions, my classical background comes back to me. There is a breed of historians who say that the common understanding of the epithet \u201cdraconian\u201d is a misrepresentation, and that Draco wasn\u2019t that bad: he merely codified existing civic practices.</p> <p>On the other hand, let\u2019s face it: in ancient Athens, Draco prescribed the death penalty for petty theft \u2013 even of cabbages, if you please. According to Plutarch, this produced the memorable comment that \u201chis laws were written not in ink but in blood\u201d.</p> <p>So frankly, in the circumstances, I do not regard being asked to take precautions about the threat to my own and other people\u2019s health \u2013 indeed, lives \u2013 as draconian. </p> <p>But back to the economy. The unemployment and bankruptcy news is horrendous, and likely to get worse before it gets better.</p> <p>There will be plenty of time in the coming months to examine the implications. But at this stage I should just issue a health warning (sorry) against taking some of the instant conclusions too seriously. The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Conservative and Brexit party suddenly repenting of 10 years of austerity and becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder.</p> <p>Finally, why are we in this mess? Could it possibly be anything to do with the fact that during 10 years of austerity, public spending on health was budgeted to rise by 1% a year at most (in real terms \u2013 that is, after inflation) whereas all the professionals knew that it needed to rise by 4% a year merely to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and, especially, the cost of technological advance?</p> <p>And could it also possibly be because this government\u2019s crazed obsession with Brexit means that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/uk-discussed-joint-eu-plan-to-buy-covid-19-medical-supplies-say-officials\" title=\"\">shut itself out of the joint ordering of vital medical supplies</a> with the 27 members of the European Union?

There was no NHS in ancient Athens, and there is no NHS in the United States. To put it another way: we have a health service, they have a health sector. That is an important reason why, for all the well-publicised mishandling of this crisis in the UK, the US, still the mightiest economy in the world, seems to be in for an even bigger shock from the virus than we are experiencing. At this point \u2013 as one who was born a year before the outbreak of the 1939-45 war \u2013 I hope readers will forgive me if I point to an important difference in the dangers to the general public between then and now. Thus I confess that my initial inclination when asked what I felt personally about the virus \u2013 as opposed to thoughts about the disturbing political and economic implications \u2013 was to say something like: \u201cThis is nothing like watching flying bombs overhead, listening as their engines switched off, and hoping they didn\u2019t land on you.\u201d In fact one did land on the church at the end of our road and shattered our windows while we were safe in the Anderson shelter in the garden. The awful thing about this plague is that it is more like the Athenian one 2,500 years ago or the Spanish flu of 1918. It doesn\u2019t fly in or explode, it just hits people unawares \u2013 that is to say, we are aware of the danger, but don\u2019t know if or when it will hit. A timely reminder of the horrors of germ warfare. In common with most of the population, I feel as if I am under house arrest. But when I hear and read so many comments about \u201cdraconian\u201d conditions, my classical background comes back to me. There is a breed of historians who say that the common understanding of the epithet \u201cdraconian\u201d is a misrepresentation, and that Draco wasn\u2019t that bad: he merely codified existing civic practices. On the other hand, let\u2019s face it: in ancient Athens, Draco prescribed the death penalty for petty theft \u2013 even of cabbages, if you please. According to Plutarch, this produced the memorable comment that \u201chis laws were written not in ink but in blood\u201d. So frankly, in the circumstances, I do not regard being asked to take precautions about the threat to my own and other people\u2019s health \u2013 indeed, lives \u2013 as draconian. But back to the economy. The unemployment and bankruptcy news is horrendous, and likely to get worse before it gets better. There will be plenty of time in the coming months to examine the implications. But at this stage I should just issue a health warning (sorry) against taking some of the instant conclusions too seriously. The end of capitalism? I doubt it. The Conservative and Brexit party suddenly repenting of 10 years of austerity and becoming fully paid-up Keynesians? For how long, I wonder. Finally, why are we in this mess? Could it possibly be anything to do with the fact that during 10 years of austerity, public spending on health was budgeted to rise by 1% a year at most (in real terms \u2013 that is, after inflation) whereas all the professionals knew that it needed to rise by 4% a year merely to cope with the pressures of an ageing population and, especially, the cost of technological advance? And could it also possibly be because this government\u2019s crazed obsession with Brexit means that it shut itself out of the joint ordering of vital medical supplies with the 27 members of the European Union? I merely ask.",

      "bodyText": "Prominent Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who was jailed for four and a half years for subversion, has been released from prison but barred from reuniting with his wife and son in Beijing amid the coronavirus pandemic. His wife, Li Wenzu, fears that the authorities are using the pandemic as an excuse to hold him under de facto house arrest indefinitely. She said Wang has been released from prison but authorities had sent him to his home town, Jinan, in the north-eastern province of Shandong (400km south of Beijing) for quarantine. Chinese authorities have been using compulsory quarantine as a pretext to detain or restrict the movements of government critics. \u201cThe government is continuing to restrict his personal freedoms and forcing us to be separated,\u201d Li told the Guardian. \u201cThis behaviour is shameless, I\u2019m absolutely opposed to this and am very angry. \u201cI fear the government is using the pandemic as an excuse to detain him. Would it be just 14 days as they say? I can\u2019t trust them. So long as my husband has no freedom, I\u2019ll continue to fight until he comes back.\u201d Wang called his wife from the prison yesterday telling her to refrain from going to meet him in prison. In a recording she posted on Twitter, Wang said he had to be quarantined \u201cfor some time\u201d due to the pandemic. When Li, who has been frequently harassed by the authorities, angrily asked whether he was prompted to say that under duress, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll be back together, but there\u2019ll be a process.\u201d \u201cThe Linyi prison\u2026 forced Quanzhang to \u2018persuade\u2019 me into accepting the arrangement of sending him to Jinan. I absolutely oppose it,\u201d Li said on Twitter: \u201cWang Quanzhang needs real freedom, our family needs to be reunited.\u201d In a practice dubbed \u201cnon-release release\u201d by respected China law expert Jerome Cohen at the New York University, Chinese rights activists are often released from prison into de facto house arrest or enforced restriction to their native village, where they remain for years. \u201cWhat will Wang Quanzhang\u2019s \u2018release\u2019 on April 5 amount to?\u201d asked Cohen in his blog. Wang, a lawyer who had taken on politically sensitive cases and defended activists and members of the banned religious group Falun Gong, was sentenced to jail in January 2019 on the blanket charge of \u201csubversion of state power\u201d. He was one of more than 300 lawyers and activists detained in a wave of crackdowns that started in July 2015. He was the last lawyer of the group to be convicted, with his trial taking place three-and-a-half years after he was taken away by the authorities.",

This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year.</p> \n  <p>The findings come after the tutoring industry reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/mar/27/school-closures-prompt-boom-in-private-tuition-online-isolation\">a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak</a>, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or <a href=\"https://coronavirustutoring.co.uk/\">free tutoring</a> to less-affluent schoolchildren. </p> \n  <p>Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. </p> \n   <p>Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/03/gcse-a-level-grades-coronavirus-crisis-teacher-assessment-ofqual\">deciding who would get a university place</a>.<br></p> \n  <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/children-must-not-become-unseen-victims-of-coronavirus-says-thinktank\">difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said there was \u201cno fixed point\u201d at which the government could say the lockdown will end \u2013 it will depend on compliance from the public. The message came as police, health officials and local authorities issued pleas to the public to stay at home this weekend and not be tempted by good weather to go outside. Among them was the CEO of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson, who said today: \u201cYou can\u2019t clap for carers one day and flout the stay at home rules three days later\u201d. The number of deaths in UK hospitals saw a record daily rise, increasing by 708 from 3,605 to 4,313 \u2013 a rise of 20%. Among the dead was a five-year-old child, thought to be the UK\u2019s youngest victim so far, who had underlying health conditions. Up to 4,000 low-risk offenders are to be temporarily released as part of measures to try to contain the spread of Covid-19 in prisons in England and Wales. So far, 88 prisoners and 15 staff have already tested positive for Covid-19. Three prisoners have died. Thirteen people died in the space of a week after a suspected Covid-19 outbreak at a care home in Glasgow. The deceased had not been diagnosed with Covid-19 though two members of staff had tested positive and are being treated in hospitals. Carrie Symonds, the prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant, said she had spent the last week in bed with coronavirus symptoms. Symonds shared that she was \u201con the mend\u201d and had not been tested for Covid-19. The prime minister continues to self-isolate. The national medical director for England, Stephen Powis, condemned the actions of people acting on a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the pandemic. He said \u201cit is absolute and utter rubbish and I can\u2019t condemn it in stronger terms than that\u201d. Watford general hospital closed its A&amp;E department to all new patients and visitors, even in an emergency, until further notice. The hospital is known to be under significant strain from the coronavirus pandemic. Boris Johnson has written to all opposition party leaders to invite them to a briefing next week and insisting \u201cwe have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. That brings us to the end of another day of coverage here on the UK side. If you would like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic, head over to our global live blog. Carrie Symonds, the prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, who is pregnant, has said she has been self-isolating for the past week with coronavirus symptoms. She wrote on Twitter: I\u2019ve spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus. I haven\u2019t needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I\u2019m on the mend. Symonds described being pregnant with symptoms as \u201cobviously worrying\u201d and encouraged other pregnant women to consult the latest guidance from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Blood Cancer UK has written to the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, and to six major supermarkets, calling on them to take urgent action to make sure people with blood cancer can get food deliveries. The charity said it has been contacted by people with blood cancer, of whom there are some 115,000 in the UK, who are struggling to access food, after being told not to leave their home for a minimum of 12 weeks as they are classed as \u201cvery high risk\u201d. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: We are now at the point where some people are being forced to choose between going hungry and making a trip to the supermarket that could be fatal if they pick up the coronavirus there. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve written to the supermarkets and the government today. We need them to work together to fix this now. The blood cancer community is going through the most difficult time it has ever faced \u2013 we urgently need their help. One woman was told by a supermarket that she could not be prioritised because it was her daughter, not her, who had blood cancer. Another man said he had tried unsuccessfully for many hours to get a supermarket delivery slot. Helen Payne, a former NHS physio from Wokingham, has leukaemia and has been struggling to order food. She said: I am on chemotherapy and have had my NHS letter but it\u2019s absolutely impossible to get any food. I am seriously thinking of going shopping myself. God knows what I have left for tonight. Gove said there were now more than 8,000 ventilators in the NHS and the aim was to produce and secure more. Powis called the 5G story \u201crubbish\u201d and \u201cthe worst kind of fake news\u201d. He said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d and \u201coutraged\u201d at reports of people taking out 5G masts at this time of national crisis. He stressed that phone networks were crucial for people staying in touch with loved ones at this difficult time, but also vital for the emergency services. It is absolute and utter rubbish and I can\u2019t condemn it stronger terms than that. Gove said he would talk to the health secretary about reports of NHS staff being turned away from testing sites and report on progress on Monday. Powis said it was likely the virus would become established in countries across the world, so a long-term strategy as opposed to an \u201cexit strategy\u201d was needed. Gove said there was \u201cno fixed point\u201d at which we could say the lockdown will end \u2013 it depended on compliance from the public. The prime minister will review the measures next week. Powis said it was clear deaths happen in the community. The figures reported by the NHS were those in hospitals, the ONS figures reflected those in the community. He expects deaths will be higher but it will only be in the days and weeks ahead and as that data comes through the ONS it will become clear how much higher. Powis said a reduction in transmission would, over a number of days and weeks, be reflected in a reduction in infections, hospitalisations and then in deaths. He said there was reason to be hopeful that physical distancing was having an effect, but it would take time for it to have a maximum effect. If we take our foot off the pedal, those charts will start to go in the wrong direction again. Stay at home and then we will see the benefits of those actions. Powis said we were learning about the virus all the time and more would become clear over the next few months. It is too early to outline what the exit strategy will be \u2013 the priority and critical objective now is to reduce transmission in order to get on top of it. Only then can we discuss what the next steps are. They are taking questions from the press now. Gove said everyone should ask themselves: What am I doing to relieve pressure on the NHS? He acknowledged that lockdown is challenging but people must, at every stage, respect the guidelines as it is the only way to restrict the spread of the disease. If people deliberately flout the guidelines, police have the powers to enforce the rules. If we weight up an hour or two outside and weight it against the lives of those we love and the lives of those on the NHS frontline, then it should be clear, I hope to all, that we should follow the advice. Powis said the NHS workers on the frontline would \u201cabsolutely plead\u201d with the public to follow the measures \u2013 \u201ctheir safety, their lives, depend on that\u201d. We absolutely know that this can work. This is everybody\u2019s chance to save a life. Stephen Powis is speaking now. He reiterates that the key to slowing the spread is reducing contact with others. Transport use remains \u201cextremely low\u201d. The sun might be out, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should be out. The number of new cases has stabilised in the last few days. We mustn\u2019t read too much into a day\u2019s or a few days\u2019 data. It will be a week or two before the measures in place translate into lower hospitalisation rates. In London there has been a plateau, but this is not the time to be complacent, he says. The number of deaths continues to be high, unfortunately that is likely to continue for the next week or two until we get on top of the virus and see a reduction in the number of deaths, he says. Gove says the government welcomes robust scrutiny \u2013 \u201cit is the duty of the media\u201d \u2013 and aims to communicate more clearly and effectively in guiding the public through the pandemic. Gove said invasive ventilators had been purchased from partners abroad including Germany and Switzerland. Today 300 new ventilators arrived from China. He thanked the Chinese government for their support. New sources of supply here in the UK would come on-stream soon, he said. The first models that have been scaled up will be coming off production lines this weekend, more are to come into operation in the coming weeks, subject to safety and regulatory approvals. He added the first of the ventilators the government has ordered from Penlon would begin arriving in hospitals this week for final clinical checks. The first devices from Smiths Group have also been received at MoD Donnington, which have been approved by the regulator. Gove said new non-invasive ventilator capacity had been secured with the help of UK manufacturers. A team from UCL working with Mercedes-Benz have produced a new device which has been clinically approved. 200 were produced yesterday, the same will be produced today and tomorrow, rising to 1,000 a day next week, he said. Gove said 10,984 tests of NHS staff were administered yesterday. Michael Gove is speaking now. 183,190 people have been tested, 41,903 of whom have tested positive. 15,073 people in England have been admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms. The pattern of hospital admissions has regional differences. In London, admissions fell slightly between 1-2 April. Admissions are steady in Wales. They have gone up 35% in Yorkshire and the north-east. In the Midlands, they have gone up by 47%. 708 have died, the highest daily total recorded, bringing the total to 4,313. These numbers emphasise the importance of maintaining physical distancing measures to contain the spread. This afternoon\u2019s news conference, due to begin shortly, will be fronted by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister. He will be joined by NHS England\u2019s national medical director Stephen Powis. There have been a further 13 deaths in Wales bringing the total number of to people to have died after tested positive for Covid-19 to 154, health officials have said. Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Covid-19 response at Public Health Wales, said the number of confirmed cases had risen by 387 to a total of 2,853 as of 2pm on Saturday. A group of volunteers have set up a public database to help people find farmers so people can source fresh vegetables and fruit, as well as other goods during the coronavirus outbreak. The database \u2013 which includes links to local farms and where they operate \u2013 includes a page explaining the mission. It says: In light of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, we decided to create a database of smaller scale farmers, growers, dairies, wineries, bakeries and independent shops that will now sell directly to consumers. Many of them sold exclusively to wholesalers or restaurants in the past. It added that for those who want to add a farmer, fisher or food producer to the database, they can submit a request via the online form. We chose to share this database as an online spreadsheet in the first instance, as it\u2019s a quick and easy way for many people to access it. Link to the database here. Tesco has just given an update on its efforts to boost the capacity of its online delivery service in order to help its most vulnerable customers. The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: On Thursday we were given an initial list of 110,000 clinically and socially isolated people. From these, we were able to match 75,000 existing customers and we\u2019ve already contacted them to let them know we\u2019re making home delivery slots immediately available to them. As we receive more data from government, we\u2019ll make even more slots available. We have increased our online delivery slots by 145,000 in the last two weeks with hundreds of thousands more due to become available shortly; but we know it\u2019s still difficult to get an online delivery slot at the moment due to high demand, and we ask those who are able to safely come to stores to do so, instead of shopping online, so we can start to free up more slots for the more vulnerable. Britons who were trapped on board two cruise liners embroiled in a bitter coronavirus dispute are flying back to the UK, the PA news agency reports. Holland America Line guests disembarked the Zaandam and its sister ship the Rotterdam in Florida, US, on Friday following a battle between federal and state authorities. Many of the 200 UK nationals caught up in the saga boarded a charter flight which departed Fort Lauderdale airport shortly after 3am on Saturday (local time). The flight is due to land at London Heathrow at 4.11pm (BST), the British Consulate General in Miami said. Messages posted on a Facebook group created for passengers to share updates state that some people have not been allowed to fly home yet. Holland America Line had previously said guests with coronavirus symptoms \u201cwill remain on board and disembark at a later date\u201d. More than a dozen Covid-19 cases were reported on the Zaandam, plus some 190 people with flu symptoms. Four people have died aboard the liner, including two officially diagnosed with the virus. Earlier this week, the ship offloaded its healthy passengers onto the Rotterdam. Florida officials were reluctant to allow the ships to dock - for fear that taking more Covid-19 patients would further burden the state\u2019s already-stretched hospitals - until US president Donald Trump intervened to approve the docking on humanitarian grounds. The four included 75-year-old Briton John Carter, who died on 22 March. The cause of death has yet to be officially revealed, but he was reported to have been on a ventilator in his last days. On Friday, passengers from both ships were finally allowed to touch dry land in Fort Lauderdale. Fourteen critically-ill patients were wheeled off the Zaandam on stretchers to be taken to local hospitals before their fellow passengers disembarked. Asymptomatic patients, after being screened and cleared by paramedics, were taken by bus directly to the local airport, escorted by police officers on motorcycles. Before disembarking from the ships, passengers received instructions to wear face masks at all times when travelling and to go immediately into 14 days of self-quarantine when they arrived home. Five London bus workers who tested positive for Covid-19 have now died, the Unite union said. the Unite regional secretary, Peter Kavanagh, said: Each of these deaths is a terrible tragedy and the thoughts of everyone at Unite go to the families of the bus workers who have died of coronavirus. Unite will assist the families of our members in every possible way during this terrible time. Unite has been working continuously with Transport for London (TfL) and the operators to ensure the safety of drivers and others in the industry who are performing a heroic job in getting NHS and care workers to their places of work. Measures include deep cleaning of buses, additional cleaning of touch points, the sealing of screens around the driver, the provision of hand sanitiser for all and placing the passenger seating closest to the driver out of bounds. The union is also calling on the government to make provisions for transport workers in terms of PPE. Borough market, London\u2019s famous produce market and foodie haven, is spearheading a national campaign to provide free fruit and vegetables to frontline workers battling coronavirus. The Feed the Frontline campaign is being funded for the rest of April by private businesses and aims to run throughout the peak of the crisis. The initiative aims to provide regular deliveries of fruit and vegetables to frontline workers at three NHS hospitals in London; St Thomas\u2019, Kings College hospital and the Maudsley. An estimated 4,000 bags of seasonal fruit and vegetables are being packed and delivered by the Borough market trader Turnips each week. Once at the hospitals, the bags will be distributed to frontline staff by NHS volunteers. The food is accompanied by recipe cards from Borough market chefs to inspire easy, healthy, home cooking. The market is now calling for more companies to help fund the expansion across the UK, with the help of food markets and fruit and vegetable wholesalers. Bradford St James\u2019s wholesale market is already following suit by delivering 1,000 fruit and vegetable bags to Leeds teaching hospitals NHS trust each week, with more hospitals in Leeds and Bradford set to follow. Darren Henaghan, managing director of Borough market, said: With the UK in lockdown, we owe an enormous debt to the fantastic people of the NHS and other frontline workers battling Covid-19. They are working around the clock to save lives, care for the sick and control the spread of coronavirus. With London at the heart of the UK epidemic we want to play our part in the national effort against Covid-19 by caring for the carers \u2013 giving them fresh, high quality food to help them stay healthy and feed themselves and their families. A further 637 people in England who tested positive for the Covid-19 have died, including England\u2019s youngest victim \u2013 a five-year-old child \u2013 bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 3,939, NHS England said. Patients were aged between five and 104 years old. Forty of the 637 patients had no known underlying health condition; they were aged between 48 and 93 years old. NHS England said 212 of the deaths were in the Midlands, 127 in London, 97 in the north-west, 73 in the north-east and Yorkshire, 70 in the east of England, 41 in the south-east and 17 in the south-west. The number of people who have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus has risen by eight to 56, health officials said. Testing has resulted in 94 new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases there to 998. Watford general hospital has closed its A&amp;E to new patients and visitors \u201cuntil further notice\u201d, West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust announced. People have been instructed to go to their \u201cnext nearest hospital with an emergency department\u201d or to seek advice via 111 in a non-urgent situation. Though no reason has yet been provided, the hospital is known to be under significant strain from the pandemic. The Watford Observer reports that several wards are dedicated to Covid-19 patients and, as of Friday, 29 patients at West Herts trust hospitals have died after testing positive. In a post on Twitter, the trust wrote: Please DO NOT attend Watford General\u2019s emergency department until further notice, even in an emergency. Go to your next nearest hospital with an emergency department. Anyone with non-urgent issues should seek advice via https://111.nhs.uk The Watford Observer has more on this story. The number of people who have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus is 218, up by 46 from 172 on Friday, the Scottish government confirmed. A total of 3,345 people across Scotland have now tested positive for the virus, up from 3,001 on the previous day, according to the latest figures. In total, 20,798 patients have been tested across the country. With anger growing toward \u201cselfish\u201d people who continue to flout physical distancing rules during the crisis, NHS Providers, the main organisation representing hospitals in England, has joined calls for people to \u201cstay at home this weekend\u201d. Chief executive Chris Hopson\u2019s words are worth quoting in full: This weekend\u2019s warmer weather, though normally welcome, poses a significant threat. It is absolutely vital that people heed the government\u2019s instructions and stay home. We\u2019ve been struck by how many times trust leaders have told us over the last 24 hours that they and frontline NHS staff are getting increasingly angry with the \u2018selfish\u2019 people who are not obeying the rules about staying at home. They can\u2019t see why any member of the public would want to make the job of frontline staff more difficult and risk other people\u2019s lives. NHS staff are absolutely bowled over by the huge amount of public appreciation and affection they are receiving, but their number one message to every single member of the public is to stay at home. The more people stick to the clear rules, the fewer infections, the fewer deaths, the easier their job. They have a very simple message: you can\u2019t clap for carers one day and then flout the stay at home rules three days later. The UK\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen to 4,313 in the deadliest day since the outbreak began. Department of Health and Social Care figures show that 708 people have died in UK hospitals since 5pm on Thursday, when the total was 3,605. John Lewis has become the latest shop to reward its staff working through the coronavirus pandemic. All frontline workers at the department store and Waitrose supermarkets will get an extra \u00a325 for each week they work in April and May. The discount at Waitrose for all employees across both shops has also been increased from 15% to 25% and will remain at 20% after Covid-19 has peaked, the company said. These new rewards follow a 2% bonus that was handed to all staff last month. John Lewis has closed its high-street shops, but is still operating online. Sharon White, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said staff had made \u201csignificant sacrifices to ensure that we are able to continue to serve and support our customers\u201d. She said: The measures that we have announced today are in recognition of their hard work and commitment and are part of a wider package of support available to help partners during this extraordinary time. Staff at Morrisons have also been told to expect a \u00a31,000 bonus, as their earnings will be topped up by 6% over the next 12 months. This means an extra \u00a31,050 for full time employees, including those who have been sick or are self-isolating, and new hires who have been taken on to deal with the extraordinary demand. Ocado has said that staff would be given a 10% bonus on all hours they work from 23 March \u201cwhile the crisis continues\u201d. Aldi, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco have all echoed the 10% pledge and Asda has promised an extra week\u2019s pay in June. A spate of mobile phone mast fires around the UK are being investigated as possible arson, amid concerns that people are attacking telecoms infrastructure because of a conspiracy theory linking 5G technology to the spread of coronavirus. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, also revealed he had received threats relating to the \u201cbizarre\u201d theory, which has gained traction on social media. My colleagues Nazia Parven and Jim Waterson have the full story: The death rate of those admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 has topped 50%, according to the latest figures. The figures come from data compiled by the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) based on a sample of 2,249 coronavirus patients. The data showed that 50.1% (346) of the 690 patients in the sample whose care outcomes were known, had died. The other 344 had been discharged. The remaining patients, 1,559, were reported still to be in critical care. By way of comparison, just 22.4% of patients admitted to intensive care with non-Covid-19 viral pneumonia between 2017 and 2019 died of the disease. The Covid-19 figures come from 286 NHS intensive care and combined intensive care and high-dependency units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland as of midday on Friday. Some specialist and non-NHS critical care units also submitted data. A reader who works at a care home has been in touch to ask people to spare a thought for those working in the care sector, whose work is equally essential to that of the NHS in keeping vulnerable people safe and has so far been neglected in terms of PPE. The nursing home employee, who wished to remain anonymous, described working in close contact with numerous vulnerable residents \u201cwith no masks, nothing more than our usual gloves and plastic aprons\u201d and how the home was struggling to minimise the risk of infection. She told the Guardian: It is stressful knowing that we are a potential risk to our residents, and they to us. We are letting them down by not having the masks we need to protect them, and we are being let down too. I take pride in doing a valuable job that most people wouldn\u2019t want to do. I accept the insulting minimum wage but I don\u2019t accept that I should have to risk my health, and even my life, to do this job. We should have masks for all close contact care. We deserve that protection. The lack of adequate PPE for all health care workers \u2013 NHS or otherwise \u2013 is a shameful scandal. Her words come as Sky News reports that 13 residents at a care home in Glasgow have died in the space of a week after a suspected coronavirus outbreak. Two members of staff are being treated in separate hospitals after testing positive for Covid-19. As tests are currently only carried out for people admitted to hospital, it is not known whether the residents who died, who all had underlying health condition, also had coronavirus. More on that story here. With Sunday set to be UK\u2019s warmest day in six months, police forces around the country have issued new warnings to people not to travel and to stay at home. Going on holiday is not an excuse to travel and second homeowners are being told to keep away, as police said they would issue fines and punishments if they see people making non-essential journeys this weekend. Gloucestershire police issued the warning on holidays, saying officers would be stopping people who looked like they may be heading away for a few days. The force said \u201cthere has been particular concern among some communities that people who own second homes in the area will be visiting over the Easter holiday\u201d and visitors would put extra pressure on the local NHS. Meanwhile, in Hampshire, officers and paramedics have told people to stick to physical distancing after three ambulances were called on a \u201cselfish and avoidable deployment\u201d to a man having a bad acid trip after a house party. Authorities in Wales have closed beachside car parks to deter people from \u201cusing the weather to treat what is a national crisis like a national holiday,\u201d as has Dorset council, which closed seafront parking bays and stopped the RNLI patrol in an attempt to prevent people from gathering at the seaside. Chief constable Shaun Sawyer, from Devon and Cornwall police, told BBC Breakfast officers would explain and encourage people to stick to the rules, but would enforce them with fines and punishments if people were not listening: When we come to enforcement, that really is a last resort because, in a way, if we come to enforcement, then everybody has failed to understand the significance of this endeavour. It\u2019s not just visitors, even within my 4,000 sq miles I\u2019ve got my own population that really just want to jump in the car and travel. They want to go to the moors, they want to go to the beaches. He described this weekend as \u201ca time to remember the importance of stay at home and save lives\u201d. There have been many joyous sights of animals taking advantage of quieter roads and exploring new spaces as people stay at home during the lockdown, but this could be my favourite. From BBC Breakfast this morning: Burnley FC have underlined the dire financial consequences of the coronavirus crisis on the Premier League by announcing they stand to lose around \u00a350m from the continued suspension of the season. The Premier League confirmed on Friday that the 2019-20 season \u201cwill only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so\u201d and will only be resumed with the full support of the government. Burnley\u2019s estimated losses of \u00a350m, it believes, are only half of what other Premier League clubs stand to lose this season. The full story is here. Addison Lee has launched a Donate a Ride campaign by which London\u2019s largest private hire vehicle operator will partner with its corporate clients to offer free rides to and from hospital for NHS workers at trusts within the M25. The British public matched Addison Lee\u2019s contribution of \u00a350,000 in just over 12 hours, with the fund breaking through the \u00a3100,000 mark as donations continued to rise. For members of the public who still want to contribute, Addison Lee has established a GoFundMe page. Over the coming days, Addison Lee will work with NHS trusts to distribute the donations and allow their workers to access the free rides. As more partners join the scheme, more free rides will be offered. The capital\u2019s key workers can also claim a 25% discount on rides. Two Best Western hotels in the south-west are believed to be the first in the country to be turned into discharge hospitals to help the NHS cope with the Covid-19 crisis, by accommodating low-risk patients and care workers. The hotels are the Grange hotel at Oborne, run by husband and wife team Jon and Jenny Fletcher and the Rembrandt hotel in Weymouth, run by the general manager Massimo Menin. The Grange will initially accommodate 12 patients and six carers and the Rembrandt 31 patients and 13 carers. Both have worked closely with Dorset countycCouncil and four local hospitals to start taking patients as early as Monday. The patients are recovering from conditions that have required hospitalisation and would ordinarily be able to go home to continue rehabilitation with the support of home visits. Under the hotel support scheme, patients and carers will live into together to reduce the risk of care workers travelling the country and becoming infected, and to give the patients the daily care they need. Rob Paterson, the chief executive of Best Western Great Britain, said: We are so proud of these two amazing hotels. These are unprecedented times and so as a hotel group we are taking unprecedented steps to support the NHS. We want to help free up urgent bed space in the NHS by taking low risk patients and carers and being part of the solution. These two hotels are proof we can do it, we have 230 other hotels prepared to reopen their doors and help the nation fight this terrible disease. A fifth coronavirus drive-in test centre has opened for NHS workers as the Department of Health and Social Care discloses plans to run 50 centres nationwide and the Swiss healthcare company Roche says it is on track to open 10 laboratories in the UK. NHS Wales confirmed on Saturday that the Dragons rugby stadium in Newport had been turned into a drive-in site but asked that non-NHS workers do not visit. The other sites, also for NHS workers exclusively, are at Boot\u2019s headquarters in Beeston in Nottinghamshire, the Ikea carpark in Wembley in London, North Greenwich in London and Chessington theme park in Greater London. Overnight, the DHSC disclosed it was planning to have 50 sites up and running in the coming weeks as part of the health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s plan for 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. It said: We are establishing these centres around the UK, starting in the main hotspots of the disease, such as London, the Midlands, growing to around 50 across the country. Most will be drive-throughs, set up in car parks, with trained staff taking nose and throat swabs. On the laboratory side, Roche, the company credited with enabling Germany to test 500,000 a week, has revealed it is \u201ccurrently on track to have more than 10 sites up and running before the end this month\u201d. It said in a statement its new diagnostics test is already being used in labs in London, Manchester and Gateshead, with a new lab opening in Wales on Monday followed by other facilities in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The first three opened last week after successful pilots were completed. The company said its polymerise chain reaction (PCR) test to detect current infection could determine \u201cif a person has Covid-19 in less than three and a half hours\u201d. The indefinite school closures caused by the coronavirus pandemic threaten to widen the attainment gap between rich and poor children, the former chair of the government\u2019s social mobility commission has warned. The increased use of private tuition by well-off middle class families during the pandemic lockdown will further disadvantage pupils from deprived backgrounds, said Alan Milburn, who now chairs the Social Mobility Foundation. A fifth of better-off households are either already using private tutors or are likely to do so during the school shutdown, compared with just 7% of low-income households, according to research for the charity, which organises mentoring and work experience for underprivileged 16- to 17-year-olds. A quarter (24%) of those considering private tuition said they were willing to spend more than \u00a3100 a week, according to the YouGov poll of 2,215 young people for the foundation\u2019s campaigning arm, the Department for Opportunities. The survey also found that 40% of children from households with income of less than \u00a320,000 a year lack a quiet room in which they can study during the lockdown. This compares with just 19% of children in households with income of more than \u00a370,000 a year. The findings come after the tutoring industry reported a boom in demand due to the Covid-19 outbreak, and a number of agencies said they were offering lower cost or free tutoring to less-affluent schoolchildren. Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said the findings showed lower-income families were less able to offset the detrimental impact of the pandemic on their children\u2019s education. He said: Access to a private tutor, even at a reduced rate, is well beyond the means of most families and will be impossible for families who do not have internet access and who live in crowded accommodation. Tutors offer parents a break and children the opportunity to learn from an experienced adult, their appeal is clear. But not all children will have access to this resource, indeed, they are a pipe dream for families living on low income. Milburn called on universities to recognise that the school shutdown could magnify the huge educational disparity between children from richer and poorer backgrounds, and to take that into account when deciding who would get a university place. The Institute for Public Policy Research has said the shift to school lessons being delivered online during the pandemic made it difficult for those children without suitable technology to keep up with their studies. Around a million children do not have access to a device suitable for online lessons, or do not have an internet connection, according to the thinktank. Rosamund McNeil, assistant general secretary of the National Education Union, said the SMF poll showed \u201cjust how unequal families\u2019 home learning environments are\u201d: There is just not the same access to internet access, tutors, gardens, spare room, books, bikes and musical instruments \u2013 and the opportunities for wellbeing that they provide. Smokers face a greater risk from coronavirus and may also be jeopardising the welfare of their loved ones, Public Health England has warned. Prof John Newton, PHE\u2019s director of health, said that in light of the \u201cunprecedented\u201d pandemic sweeping the globe: There has never been a more important time to stop smoking, not only for your own health but to protect those around you. PHE said that smoking can cause damage to the lungs and airways, and Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system. Officials also point to a \u201csmall but highly impactful\u201d survey from China which finds that smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe disease. More information on the campaign to help people quit smoking can be found here. The prime minister Boris Johnson has written to opposition party leaders inviting them to a briefing next week and insisting \u201cwe have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency\u201d. An extract from the letter reads: As party leaders, we have a duty to work together at this moment of national emergency. Therefore, I would like to invite all leaders of opposition parties in Parliament to a briefing with myself, the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser next week. I want to listen to your views and update you on the measures we have taken so far, such as rapidly expanding testing and providing economic support to businesses and individuals across the country. The government I lead will act in the national interest at all times and be guided by the best scientific evidence, and of course we will continue to engage constructively with all political parties on the national effort to defeat this pandemic. Risk-assessed prisoners within two months of their release date are to be temporarily released from jail in an effort to try and control the spread of coronavirus, the lord chancellor and justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has announced. The move follows campaigners\u2019 calls for early release to avoid thousands of prisoners, many of whom share cells, becoming infected after a total of 88 inmates so far have tested positive for Covid-19. Buckland said: This government is committed to ensuring that justice is served to those who break the law. But this is an unprecedented situation because if coronavirus takes hold in our prisons, the NHS could be overwhelmed and more lives put at risk. All prisoners will face a tough risk assessment and must comply with strict conditions, including an electronic tag, while they are closely monitored. Those that do not will be recalled to prison. No high-risk criminals such as those who have been convicted of violent or sexual offences, anyone who is a national security concern or a danger to children, will be considered for release. Prisoners who have not served at least half their custodial term will also not be among those who are released. The Ministry of Justice added that no offender convicted of Covid-19-related offences, including coughing at emergency workers or stealing personal protective equipment, will be eligible. In addition, the MoJ said no prisoner would be released if they have symptoms of coronavirus or without housing and health support being in place. Northern Ireland is to release 200 of its 1,500 prisoners early while the authorities in Scotland are considering taking similar action. Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell and I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest UK coronavirus news throughout the day. This morning, Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London and author of a report which warned of mass deaths if the UK did not introduce strict controls, said the lockdown could be relaxed in weeks \u2013 but only if Britons abide by physical distancing restrictions in the meantime. He said a high level of coronavirus infections could last for \u201cweeks\u201d if people broke physical distancing rules this weekend. He told BBC Radio 4 that the epidemic was expected to plateau in the next week to 10 days, but said people\u2019s behaviour was critical to determining what happens next. Asked what would happen if people flouted physical distancing rules this weekend, he said: That moves us to a slightly more pessimistic scenario. We still think things will plateau but we\u2019ll be at quite high levels of infection for weeks and weeks rather than seeing quite a rapid decline as the type seen in China. We want to move to a situation where at least by the end of May that we\u2019re able to substitute some less intensive measures, more based on technology and testing, for the complete lockdown we have now. His warning echoes the heartfelt plea issued yesterday by the chief nurse Ruth May that anyone thinking of gathering outdoors when the weather is sunny this weekend should remember the two nurses, Areema Nasreen and Aimee O\u2019Rourke, who died after contracting Covid-19. She said: Please stay home, for them.

These are the main stories on Sunday 5 April.</p> <h2>NSW police launch criminal investigation into Ruby Princess fiasco</h2> <p>The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, confirmed on Sunday that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle that will look at the actions of every agency involved as well as the cruise ship operator.</p> <p>\u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from Covid-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d</p> <p>Three of the four latest deaths in NSW were passengers on the Ruby Princess.</p> <h2>Health officials \u2018hopeful\u2019 curve is flattening</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">have expressed cautious optimism</a> that Australia may be able to limit the domestic coronavirus outbreak but have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said the number of cases in Australia rose by 139 on Sunday, to a total of 5,687 cases. About 2,000 of those cases are of people who have completely recovered. Australia\u2019s death toll now stands at 34.</p> <p>\u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve,\u201d Murphy said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Guardian Australia's coronavirus email signup button\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/coronavirus-australia-at-a-glance\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Coronavirus: Australia at a glance\" data-form-description=\"Get Guardian Australia's daily coronavirus email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email newsletter</a></figcaption> </figure>  <h2>More casuals could receive jobkeeper payment</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/more-casual-workers-may-be-included-in-130bn-jobkeeper-coronavirus-scheme\">The government has opened the door</a> to allowing more of the casual workforce to access wage subsidies, as it vowed to press ahead with legislating the $130bn jobkeeper scheme this week.</p> <p>Christian Porter, the attorney general, said the government was aiming to be \u201cas inclusive and reasonable as possible\u201d on the issue of casuals and he hoped to have draft legislation ready on Monday. Parliament is due to return on Wednesday \u2013 with limited numbers of MPs attending \u2013 to consider legislation to enable as many as 6m workers to access wage subsidies of $1,500 per fortnight.

The service will be available to healthcare professionals and other workers such as cooks and cleaners who directly engage with patients.</p> <h2>People warned against travelling over Easter holidays</h2> <p>Authorities in several states have warned people against travelling over the coming Easter holiday period, urging them to adhere to social distancing rules.

Peter Gutwein said many elderly people lived in these areas, and they needed to be protected, as the state\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 82.</p> <h2>Police issue scores of fines at Queensland car rally</h2> <p>Police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night where people were flouting social distancing directives.

The man had been staying at a government facility for his period of isolation but had breached conditions, police say.</p> <h2><strong>What you need to know: get the most important information from some of our key explainers</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/australias-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained-can-i-still-visit-my-partner-and-other-questions\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/social-distancing-rules-australia-coronavirus-strict-new-laws-legal-illegal-state-physical-restrictions-guidelines-explained-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-act-sa-wa-two-person-rule\">Australia\u2019s strict new coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government\u2019s coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/01/jobkeeper-payment-am-i-eligible-for-the-wage-subsidy-how-do-i-register-ato-jobseeker-supplement-support-package-eligibility\">Am I eligible for the jobkeeper payment?

      "body": "<p>Talking about Keir Starmer, one Labour MP recently asked a colleague: \u201cIs he another Ed Miliband?\u201d The question was the more pointed because the person posing it was none other than Ed Miliband himself, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/03/undoing-of-ed-miliband-and-how-labour-lost-election\">the ex-leader</a> responsible for one of the quadruple election defeats suffered by Labour in the last decade.</p> <p>Miliband Mark II, a closet Blairite and a 21st-century version of Harold Wilson: a variety of labels have been applied to Mr Starmer. He has become irritated by it, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ridgeonsunday/status/1228970663504990211\">protesting</a> that \u201cI don\u2019t need someone else\u2019s name tattooed to my head\u201d. Yet he has invited these speculative attempts to define him by spending the long months of the leadership campaign deliberately eluding a precise ideological identity.</p> <p>That was based on the calculation that keeping it vague was the way to maximise his support. The cautiously calibrated route that he chose to take to the Labour leadership largely eschewed taking any positions that would divide party opinion. This pleased activists who wanted to draw a line under the bitter factionalism of the Corbyn years. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-labour-leadership-acceptance-speech-in-full-video\">victory statement</a> on Saturday morning, echoing the relentless mantra of his campaign speeches, again called for unity.</p> <p>Unity around what? He says he wants Labour to be both \u201cradical\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d. Who among them is going to say that they want to be \u201creactionary\u201d and \u201cirrelevant\u201d? He has spoken warmly about the legacy of the Corbyn years, while also saying that the party should rehabilitate the New Labour era. \u201cDon\u2019t trash the last Labour government and don\u2019t trash the last four years.\u201d He has suggested that the last manifesto was \u201coverloaded\u201d with too many promises, while at the same time issuing \u201c10 pledges\u201d that committed himself to a lot of Corbynite policy. The reward for this face-all-ways approach was to be swept into the leadership with a majority of first preference votes in every section of the electoral college and a very wide spectrum of support. He had the backing of people intimately associated with New Labour as well as those who were fervent admirers of Mr Corbyn. The downside of such a sprawling coalition is that this leaves a lot of potential scope for disappointment.</p> <p>The leftwingers who supported Mr Starmer are generally assuming he will put a more credible face on a Corbynite programme. They will be expecting him to stay faithful to its central tenets and are likely to react with angry cries of betrayal if he doesn\u2019t. He also attracted a lot of backing from the centre-left, including New Labour luminaries such as Charlie Falconer and Andrew Adonis. Mr Starmer took their support for granted during the contest, while he concentrated on wooing the left with activist-soothing pieties about the superiority of socialist values. The Labour centrists are assuming that he will reorient the party towards what they would call more sensible positions. \u201cHe\u2019s got two very different kinds of supporters,\u201d notes one very senior Labour figure. \u201cThey can\u2019t both be right about him.\u201d</p> <p>He starts with some clear advantages. One is that it will be hard to be worse than Jeremy Corbyn, author of such a dreadful defeat that Labour\u2019s parliamentary representation is crushed down to its lowest level <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2019-50768605/general-election-2019-worst-night-for-labour-since-1935\">since 1935</a>. Mr Starmer can harvest some early credits by restoring professionalism to Labour as an opposition. Labour MPs expect, and Tories agree, that he will do a much better job of holding the government to account. As the former head of the Crown Prosecution Service, he comes to the task of leadership with senior experience of running a complex organisation. It can be an advantage that he came into the Commons just five years ago. Having become an MP later in life than most, he is not encumbered by an accumulation of historical<strong> </strong>obligations and debts to colleagues. \u201cKeir is a loner really, not at all clubbable. He is one of the least cronyistic people I know,\u201d comments a fellow Labour lawyer. That ought to leave him free to make frontbench appointments based on merit. The shadow cabinet will be recast to remove Corbyn-loyalist duds and make better use of the talent pool on the Labour benches that has been under used in recent years. He will have a fight, which he must win, to remove the Corbyn acolytes at party headquarters. A leader is never properly in charge of a party unless he can count on the loyalty of the general secretary and other key officials.</p> <p>An early test of his mettle will be how he tackles antisemitism. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party\">due to report</a> on whether Labour became an institutionally racist party during its calamitous experiment with Corbynism. A damning report will suit Mr Starmer if he uses it to make good on the promise in his victory statement to \u201ctear out this poison by its roots\u201d. He has indicated that he would support the automatic expulsion of any member found guilty of antisemitism, a position that will meet resistance among those on the left who will condemn it as a purge. Taking a robust, no-tolerance approach to antisemitism would allow the new leader to demonstrate to the public that Labour is now under a very different kind of management.</p> <p>Ah, yes, the electorate. Remember them, Labour? The party has been talking to itself rather than the country during the many months of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news\">leadership contest</a> so interminable that Britain was still a member of the EU when nominations opened. Yet voters will ultimately be the arbiters of whether Mr Starmer can put his party on the road to recovery or merely adds his name to the lengthening roster of failed Labour leaders.</p> <p>He won the leadership in part on the grounds of \u201celectability\u201d, which is a way of saying that he meets conventional expectations of what a potential prime minister ought to look and sound like. \u201cKeir passes the \u2018shut your eyes\u2019 test,\u201d says one supporter. \u201cYou can shut your eyes and imagine him standing outside Number 10.\u201d</p> <p>That is a necessary quality in someone who aspires to be prime minister, but it is not an entirely sufficient one. Successful political leaders also require a capacity to grab the attention and capture the imagination of voters. Tony Blair and David Cameron are the last two leaders to take their respective parties from opposition into power. Both had a talent for persuading the public that they had changed their parties for the better. Both combined that skill with an ability to convince the country that they had a plausible plan for national renewal.</p> <p>In this critical respect, Mr Starmer has yet to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/27/keir-starmer-profile-labours-non-aligned-leadership-frontrunner\">prove himself</a>. The words most often used when admirers describe him are decent, pleasant, diligent, forensic, moral, sensible, clever, collaborative and credible. You never hear him called exciting, captivating, entertaining, rousing, surprising or inspirational. He has yet to mint a cut-through zinger such as \u201ctough on crime, tough on the causes of crime\u201d. There\u2019s no memorable phrase associated with his name.</p> <p>Some of his allies think an unflamboyant style will commend him to voters as they grow tired of what a Starmer-supporting Labour MP calls \u201cBoris Johnson\u2019s histrionic blustering\u201d. Other Labour parliamentarians, and this includes some who are broadly hopeful about his leadership, reckon this is complacent. One former member of the shadow cabinet recently remarked to me: \u201cI worry that Keir and his team are underestimating just how difficult it can be to get yourself a hearing as the opposition.\u201d</p> <p>That challenge will be even tougher for as long as the coronavirus crisis is so all-consuming that it eats the rest of the news. A first test of his leadership will be how he calibrates scrutiny of ministerial handling of the pandemic. He said yesterday that he would \u201cengage constructively with the government\u201d and not score \u201cparty political points\u201d or make \u201cimpossible demands\u201d. This reflects an instinct to try to be statesmanlike. He will have a fine line to walk. Be overly cautious about calling out ministerial blundering and he will be accused of being too soft. Be too aggressive and he will be charged with stoking panic and fear.</p> <p>His longer-term prospects will be shaped by what sort of country emerges from this crisis. The victory speech - \u201cwe can see a better future\u201d - hoped for a post-coronavirus Britain that has a more collectivist spirit that places greater value on public services and their key workers. The optimists in Camp Starmer believe that the emergency will leave the public dissatisfied with the vaudeville style of performative politics personified by the current prime minister and ready to rediscover an appetite for more sober-sided politicians. There is one thing that no one says about Keir Starmer. He is never called frivolous. That will do him a power of good if Britain decides that serious times call for serious people.</p> <p>\u2022<em> </em>Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p> <p><br></p>",

For much of his career, Clement Attlee was subject to unflattering comparisons with more obviously talented rivals within his party, while being up against Winston Churchill, the flamboyant genius at wielding the English language.</p> <p>Yet Attlee won a landslide for Labour in 1945 and then presided over one of the great reforming governments. He is a prime example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/01/citizen-clem-by-john-bew-review-labour-clement-atlee\">how a reputation for dullness can become a virtue</a> when it is reinterpreted as reliable decency and steady competence. That may be an inspiration to Starmer. During the 1945 election, the Tories played up Churchill as the glorious war leader by having their chief conveyed around the country in regal style by limousine and special train. Attlee went about in a modest Hillman helmed by his wife, Vi, a notoriously erratic driver. The contrast worked to the Labour leader\u2019s advantage.</p> <p>After the privations of a conflict which had demanded a supreme collective effort, Britain was in a mood to embrace a more egalitarian postwar society. We can only guess whether the coronavirus crisis will have a similar effect on the national psyche, but it is possible.</p> <h2><strong>Harold Wilson</strong></h2> <p>Asked to name the Labour leader he most admired, Starmer made the unfashionable pick of Harold Wilson. He brought the party back to power in 1964 after a 13-year stretch in opposition, and it is instructive to recall how he went about it.</p> <p>One key component was relentless ridicule of the Tories as a party out of touch, out of time and hideously sleazy, an attack which was given a tailwind by the Profumo affair. Wilson was a very clever economics don who had not done a day of manual labour in his life, but he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2019/mar/30/observer-archive-harold-wilson-5-april-1969\">cultivated a \u201cman of the people\u201d image</a>. In public, he puffed a pipe and claimed to like brown sauce. In private, he drank brandy and smoked cigars.</p> <p>The other key to Wilson\u2019s success was to present Labour as the party of the future with a plan to modernise the country. He promised a \u201cnew Britain\u201d which would be \u201cforged in the white heat of the technological revolution\u201d. It didn\u2019t exactly work out like that in office, but the power of the idea helped Labour return to power.</p> <h2><strong>Neil Kinnock</strong></h2> <p>Labour was at rock bottom when Neil Kinnock was chosen to succeed Michael Foot in the wake of the 1983 \u201csuicide note\u201d election, which was about as calamitous for the party as its 2019 defeat. Kinnock was energetic, charismatic and mocked by his opponents as the \u201cWelsh windbag\u201d.</p> <p>Elected to the leadership from the \u201csoft left\u201d, he steadily junked policies, such as unilateral nuclear disarmament, which had repelled swing voters and traditional working-class supporters. It was a tough struggle often accompanied by cries of betrayal. He purged the far left extremists of the Militant tendency, famously condemning them in an electrifying speech to the Bournemouth conference in 1985. With the help of Peter Mandelson, party presentation and communications were transformed from hopeless amateurism into a slick professionalism which impressed the media and alarmed the Tories.</p> <p>Despite his best efforts, Kinnock never convinced the country to make him prime minister. He lost to Margaret Thatcher during a boom in 1987, and lost again, albeit more narrowly, to John Major in 1992, despite a recession. That said, it can be persuasively argued that Kinnock saved his party from existential danger and put it on the road to a recovery which culminated in New Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide.</p> <h2><strong>Tony Blair</strong></h2> <p>There are plenty of lessons to learn from Labour\u2019s most electorally successful leader. Tony Blair is the only one among them to win a back-to-back hat-trick of elections. Blair triumphed in 1997 by convincing the country that Labour had changed and changed for good, and could be trusted to change Britain for the better as well. The Conservatives were excluded from power for the next 13 years, their longest stretch in opposition in modern history.</p> <p>Even if he has absorbed things that Blair got right, Starmer will probably be very cautious about saying so. One poll asking Labour members to rate past leaders had Blair very near the bottom, below even Foot and Jim Callaghan. Polls of the public, by contrast, have Blair at or near the top of tables of most admired Labour leaders.</p> <p>Labour has not done its brand or morale much good by relentlessly running down its last period in power. This process of self-rubbishing began with Ed Miliband and intensified under Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has suggested that he will cease the denigration of the Blair era. Labour will have a more promising future if it has a more mature and balanced understanding of how it won in the past.</p> <p><br></p>",

It was a tough struggle often accompanied by cries of betrayal. He purged the far left extremists of the Militant tendency, famously condemning them in an electrifying speech to the Bournemouth conference in 1985. With the help of Peter Mandelson, party presentation and communications were transformed from hopeless amateurism into a slick professionalism which impressed the media and alarmed the Tories. Despite his best efforts, Kinnock never convinced the country to make him prime minister. He lost to Margaret Thatcher during a boom in 1987, and lost again, albeit more narrowly, to John Major in 1992, despite a recession. That said, it can be persuasively argued that Kinnock saved his party from existential danger and put it on the road to a recovery which culminated in New Labour\u2019s 1997 landslide. Tony Blair There are plenty of lessons to learn from Labour\u2019s most electorally successful leader. Tony Blair is the only one among them to win a back-to-back hat-trick of elections. Blair triumphed in 1997 by convincing the country that Labour had changed and changed for good, and could be trusted to change Britain for the better as well. The Conservatives were excluded from power for the next 13 years, their longest stretch in opposition in modern history. Even if he has absorbed things that Blair got right, Starmer will probably be very cautious about saying so. One poll asking Labour members to rate past leaders had Blair very near the bottom, below even Foot and Jim Callaghan. Polls of the public, by contrast, have Blair at or near the top of tables of most admired Labour leaders. Labour has not done its brand or morale much good by relentlessly running down its last period in power. This process of self-rubbishing began with Ed Miliband and intensified under Jeremy Corbyn. Starmer has suggested that he will cease the denigration of the Blair era. Labour will have a more promising future if it has a more mature and balanced understanding of how it won in the past.",

In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, it\u2019s the other way around. Federalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync. States in the formerly socialist east, less severely hit by the virus, were reluctant to close their schools, drawing ire from southern states who feared their students would then be put at a disadvantage. A week and a half into the de facto lockdown, however, Germany is beginning to discover the upsides of a system which distributes, rather than centralises, power. The country suddenly finds itself being held up as the model to be emulated for its high rates of testing \u2013 seen by many as the only strategy for being able to navigate a route out of lockdown measures. German public health services are provided not by one central authority but by approximately 400 public health offices, run by municipality and rural district administrations. Such an environment allows for a variety of laboratories \u2013 some attached to universities or hospitals, others privately run, medium-sized businesses \u2013 which act largely autonomously of central control. \u201cI don\u2019t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test,\u201d said Matthias Orth, of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Stuttgart\u2019s Marienhospital.

Through it runs South Africa\u2019s most polluted river, the Jukskei, whose water has <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Archive/Cholera-found-in-Jukskei-river-20010118\">tested positive for cholera</a> and has run <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/article/2016-11-03-00-sewage-spill-turns-jukskei-black/\">black from sewage</a>.

No one is sure how many people live there, but it could be up to 300,000. Dharavi, in Mumbai, is the word\u2019s largest slum. Like Makoko and Alexandra, it nestles next to fabulously rich areas, but the million people estimated to live there are <a href=\"https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/mar/20/asias-largest-slum-dharavi-is-sitting-on-time-bomb--doctor-2119164.html\">squashed into </a>less than a square mile of land that was once a rubbish tip.</p> <p>In such neighbourhoods, what can social distancing mean?

But in these neighbourhoods, the idea of protecting oneself from coronavirus must seem as miraculous as clean water.</p> <p>Last week, tens of thousands of Indian workers, suddenly deprived of the possibility of pay, and with most public transport having been shut down, decided to walk back to their home villages, often hundreds of miles away, in the greatest mass exodus since partition. <a href=\"https://thewire.in/labour/nearly-81-of-the-employed-in-india-are-in-the-informal-sector-ilo\">Four out of five</a> Indians work in the informal sector. Almost 140 million, more than a quarter of India\u2019s working population, are <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/10/india-has-139-million-internal-migrants-we-must-not-forget-them/\">migrants from elsewhere in the country</a>.

Internal migrants, whether in India, Nigeria or South Africa, are often treated as poorly as external ones and often for the same reason \u2013 they are not seen as \u201cone of us\u201d and so denied basic rights and dignities. In one particularly shocking incident, hundreds of migrants returning to the town of Bareilly, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bareilly/covid-19-outbreak-migrant-workers-sprayed-with-disinfectant-in-ups-bareilly/articleshow/74888857.cms\">were sprayed</a> by officials with chemicals usually used to sanitise buses. They might as well have been vermin, not just metaphorically but physically, too.</p> <p>All this should make us think harder about what we mean by \u201ccommunity\u201d. In Britain, the pandemic has led to a flowering of social-mindedness and community solidarity. Where I live in south London, a mutual aid group has sprung up to help self-isolating older people. The food bank has gained a new throng of volunteers. Such welcome developments have been replicated in hundreds of places around the country.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1564a24686b5d26af0a16d752301ac1e55988c88/0_208_3543_2126/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Armed soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South African National Defence Force soldiers enforce lockdown in Johannesburg\u2019s Alexandra township on 28 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luca Sola/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the idea of a community is neither as straightforward nor as straightforwardly good as we might imagine.

As of Thursday, the total tests conducted in the United States so far was 1.3m, Birx <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/birx-task-force-coronavirus-testing/index.html\">said</a>.</p> \n<h2>\u2018He surrounds himself with yes men\u2019</h2> \n<p>Elizabeth Spiers, one of a carousel of editors Kushner appointed during his ill-fated tenure as publisher of the New York Observer newspaper, recently <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/trump-narcissist-in-chief-global-pandemic\">described</a> her horror at the prospect of her former boss as coronavirus czar.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe short version is that Jared Kushner is incurious, not inclined to defer to experts, and surrounds himself with yes men, so he is unaccustomed to being told that his decision-making is bad,\u201d Spiers wrote. \u201cHe believes his capabilities far exceed what they are, and his assessment is reinforced by the people around him who are paid to tell him that.

      "bodyText": "The twist of fate that has cast Jared Kushner as a would-be savior in the greatest public health crisis to confront the United States in a century is a dramatic one. The moment of national peril has been compared to September 11. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said coronavirus was her country\u2019s greatest challenge since the second world war. As the leader of the federal government effort to distribute emergency equipment to the states, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, has mostly shied from the public stage, but he now is working in history\u2019s spotlight. His vast responsibilities include weighing requests from governors for aid and coordinating with private companies to obtain medical equipment, work he carries out from a special post created for him inside the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where his team is called \u201cthe Slim Suit crowd\u201d for their distinctive tailoring, the New York Times has reported. Kushner\u2019s team was credited with coordinating a planeload of medical supplies that arrived in the US from China last week. But some of those familiar with Kushner\u2019s record at the White House and in his prior professional life question why the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus threat is being run by the president\u2019s 39-year-old son-in-law. \u201cIt scares the hell out of me,\u201d said David Pepper, the chair of the Ohio Democratic party, who offered bipartisan words of praise for the crisis response of his state\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine. \u201cKushner has terrible judgment, and I don\u2019t remember a decision he\u2019s been involved with that hasn\u2019t just been bad \u2013 they\u2019ve been horrible. And the idea that everything has to go through the very flawed judgment of Jared Kushner is downright scary, and I believe at this point is costing American lives.\u201d Early this year, Kushner reportedly advised Donald Trump that the coronavirus was not that dangerous \u2013 more a threat to public confidence, and the markets, than to public health. Trump stuck with that message for six tragic weeks, between the confirmation of the first US case and a belated federal decision to speed the development of test kits. And it was Kushner who helped write a disastrous Trump Oval Office speech on 12 March announcing a European travel ban that sent markets into a tailspin and travelers crowding into airports. It was Kushner who solicited help from the father of the fashion model Karlie Kloss, his sister-in-law, to ask a Facebook group of doctors what should be done about the virus. Pepper expressed concern that when a governor calls the White House, she has to talk to Kushner, who then decides, apparently unilaterally, what the state really needs. \u2018He runs a shadow taskforce\u2019 In a rare appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday, Kushner said some governors did not have precise knowledge of their state\u2019s inventory of ventilators and delivered a lecture on the art of management. \u201cThe way the federal government is trying to allocate is, they\u2019re trying to make sure you have your data right,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cDon\u2019t ask us for things when you don\u2019t know what you have in your own state, just because you\u2019re scared. \u201cWhat a lot of the voters are seeing now is that when you elect somebody to be a mayor or governor or president, you\u2019re trying to think about who will be a competent manager during the time of crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis is a time of crisis and you\u2019re seeing certain people are better managers than others.\u201d Walter Shaub, a former director of the Office of Government Ethics under Barack Obama, reacted strongly on Twitter, calling Kushner a \u201cfeckless nepotist who presumes to criticize governors striving to fill the void left by this previously unimaginable federal failure!\u201d Trump has placed top experts in public health and disaster response on his coronavirus taskforce, including Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s foremost infectious disease expert, and Dr Deborah Birx, the former head of global health at the state department. But the adviser with the most influence over what Trump says and does appears to be Kushner, the son of a billionaire New Jersey developer, who just two months ago asserted his expertise on the Middle East conflict by saying: \u201cI\u2019ve read 25 books on it.\u201d The precise dimensions of Kushner\u2019s emergency response role are difficult to pin down because his authority, which stems from his marriage, exists outside the mapped structure of government agencies. He seems to be inventing his role on the fly, and to have the power to do so. Asked on Thursday to reply to reports that he runs a \u201cshadow taskforce\u201d on the coronavirus, Kushner smiled and said Mike Pence had asked him to help out. \u201cI can assure that you I\u2019m speaking with Dr Birx, Dr Fauci, the vice-president and the president multiple times a day, to make sure that I\u2019m accomplishing and focusing on the objectives that the vice-president deems a priority,\u201d he said. \u2018Kushner urged Trump to open America up by Easter\u2019 Kushner, who before his White House stint ran a newspaper into the ground and a real estate company into the red, has already made mistakes in the coronavirus crisis that cannot be recovered, his critics say. It was Kushner who reportedly spread the word that Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, was being alarmist when Cuomo asked the federal government for 30,000 emergency ventilators for the state. \u201cI have all this data about ICU capacity,\u201d Kushner was quoted as telling Trump by a White House source speaking to Vanity Fair. \u201cI\u2019m doing my own projections, and I\u2019ve gotten a lot smarter about this. New York doesn\u2019t need all the ventilators.\u201d It\u2019s not clear why Kushner thinks that. Cuomo announced on Friday that the national guard would deploy across the state to seize ventilators from hospitals that do not currently need them to deliver to New York City and other areas in need. And it was Kushner who urged Trump to overrule the health experts on staff and declare that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d on Easter with \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d, in Trump\u2019s words. Easter is one week away. The White House has since pushed the date back. The White House did not reply to a request for comment for this story. Kushner on Thursday asserted that the administration was turning in a strong performance. \u201cWe\u2019ve done things that the government has never done before, quicker than they\u2019ve ever done it before,\u201d he said, without specifying what, exactly. A month ago, Trump said the country would perform 4m tests a week. As of Thursday, the total tests conducted in the United States so far was 1.3m, Birx said. \u2018He surrounds himself with yes men\u2019 Elizabeth Spiers, one of a carousel of editors Kushner appointed during his ill-fated tenure as publisher of the New York Observer newspaper, recently described her horror at the prospect of her former boss as coronavirus czar. \u201cThe short version is that Jared Kushner is incurious, not inclined to defer to experts, and surrounds himself with yes men, so he is unaccustomed to being told that his decision-making is bad,\u201d Spiers wrote. \u201cHe believes his capabilities far exceed what they are, and his assessment is reinforced by the people around him who are paid to tell him that. In this sense, he is not unlike his father-in-law.\u201d Kushner grew up in New Jersey and matriculated at Harvard after his father, Charles Kushner, gave the school $2.5m. He took over the family\u2019s real estate business when his father went to prison for tax evasion and witness tampering. He married Ivanka Trump in 2009. He has an infamously broad portfolio in the White House. In addition to being in charge of bringing peace to the Middle East, Kushner is or was in charge of Trump\u2019s impeachment strategy; the Trump 2020 campaign budget; diplomacy with Saudi Arabia and Beijing, which both have targeted him as an asset, according to US intelligence assessments; solving the opioid crisis; developing internet infrastructure; running an \u201cOffice of American Innovation\u201d building a border wall, and more. \u201cHopefully my results speak for themselves,\u201d Kushner told Time magazine for a January profile. \u201cI think that I\u2019ve accomplished a lot. I think the president trusts me, and he knows I\u2019ve had his back, and he knows that I\u2019ve been able to execute for him on a lot of different objectives.\u201d Kushner has occasionally delivered for the administration, steering a criminal justice reform bill into law in late 2018. The problem with Kushner is ultimately a problem with Trump, Pepper said. \u201cIt\u2019s a case study for the problem with nepotism,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen [Ohio governor] DeWine is standing up there, even though his own kids are involved in politics \u2013 they\u2019re not the ones standing next to him. Who\u2019s leading the Ohio response? Amy Acton, the state health director, who has studied and taught this her whole life. \u201cThe biggest difference between DeWine and Trump is, one is relying on experts who have prepared for this for years. \u201cAnd the other is relying on Jared Kushner.\u201d",

So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime.</p> <p>\u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d</p> <p>Danes and her husband, the British actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/hugh-dancy\">Hugh Dancy</a>, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d</p> <p>And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d</p> <p>When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of <em>Homeland </em>after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre.</p> <p>In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bfd1a38af7d19add5229694f55822f153a2982d/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in season eight of Homeland: \u2018I think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u2019 Danes says of their on-screen relationship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is striking now that <em>Homeland</em> is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001.

Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Homeland's function was to mirror what was happening in the world\u2026 it was never going to suffer from stagnation</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u201d Danes reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.\u201d </p> <p>The rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen \u201ckind of from the word go\u201d, Danes says. \u201cIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d</p> <p>When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of <em>Homeland</em> truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge.

While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary.</p> <p><em>Homeland\u2019s</em> politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in.</p> <p>\u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently.</p> <p>\u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4dbg8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2390102\"            data-video-name=\"Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC World Service / Outside Source\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561fc22ae4b01867c5abe709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_synd_768k_vp8-2.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\">Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em> in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, <em>Homeland</em> has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d</p> <p>On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1/0_0_1920_1153/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Danes in the final season of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danes in the final season of Homeland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another sensitive area has been <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d</p> <p>Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the defining image of Homeland, one of the most ambitious US drama series of the past decade, is Claire Danes\u2019s character, Carrie Mathison, a mercurial CIA officer, staring at a video screen and displaying a sixth sense for the vital clue. So it is fitting that Danes appears to this interviewer not in person but via FaceTime. \u201cLet me just get on to my wifi,\u201d she says, as the signal flickers, \u201cI thought I was. OK, that should be better.\u201d Danes and her husband, the British actor Hugh Dancy, who have two sons \u2013 a seven-year-old and an 18-month-old \u2013 are weathering the coronavirus storm at a country house two hours north of New York, by far the worst-hit US city. \u201cWe\u2019re just kind of acclimatising to this crazy new reality where we FaceTime all the time with everybody.\u201d And like millions of other parents, the 40-year-old actor is suddenly dealing with the challenge of home-schooling. \u201cIt\u2019s full-on but I\u2019m trying to download math apps and order a bunch of workbooks and stuff from Amazon, hoping that\u2019ll keep them engaged.\u201d When the crisis erupted and brought daily life shuddering to a standstill, Danes had been enjoying her first few days back in \u201ccivilian\u201d life after a blitz of media interviews to mark the end of Homeland after eight seasons, 96 episodes and five Golden Globe awards. She had been looking forward to catching some theatre. In contrast with other art forms, pre-recorded television is immune to the virus (\u201cIt\u2019s a resilient medium, it turns out\u201d), and Homeland\u2019s last bow may get a ratings boost from a captive audience. They will be witnessing the end of a landmark of 21st-century television, a drama set in the world of espionage and counterterrorism that has thrilled, surprised, frustrated, courted controversy, disappointed and returned to form, swung between sublime and ridiculous and, above all, never been less than relevant. It is striking now that Homeland is often described as the first true post-9/11 drama when, in fact, it was born a full decade after the 11 September attacks on New York and Washington in 2001. Perhaps events of such magnitude take that long to sink in, and we will have to wait 10 years for similarly rich drama reflecting the age of Donald Trump and the coronavirus. Created by Alex Gansa and Howard Gordon of 24 fame, Homeland never had the more writerly aspirations of Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Sopranos or The Wire. But it was always contemporary, urgent, looking outward and thinking big. It captured many Americans\u2019 ambivalence about the \u201cwar on terror\u201d and their role in the world and showed tremendous capacity for reinvention. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like origami,\u201d says Danes. \u201cYou just refold it and it becomes a slightly different creature. Its function was to mirror what was happening in the world and that\u2019s ever changing, so by definition it had places to move and grow, and it was never going to suffer too badly from stagnation. My character was so wildly dynamic there was always a new facet to start to explore.\u201d At its heart was a compelling relationship not, as first expected, between Mathison, a brilliant rule-breaker whose mind moves like jazz, and Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis), a prisoner of war suspected of treason, but between Mathison and Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin), who emerges as her mentor and father figure. \u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful and surprising love story,\u201d Danes reflects. \u201cIt\u2019s not one that we see depicted all that often in pop culture: mentor and mentee.\u201d The rapport with Patinkin was mirrored off screen \u201ckind of from the word go\u201d, Danes says. \u201cIn our first read-through the chemistry was really powerful and palpable. He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of Homeland truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge. There were some tears \u2013 many of them \u2013 and we just hugged each other for a really long time.\u201d Danes was born in New York to artistic parents \u2013 a photographer and painter \u2013 and began learning modern dance when she was four years old. She was studying acting and performing on stage and screen by the age of 10, and landed her breakthrough role in My So-Called Life at 14, which took her to Los Angeles. She starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s 1996 Romeo + Juliet before studying for two years at Yale University. Her bohemian upbringing was not obvious preparation for playing a cog in the wheel of the national security apparatus and, at times, an agent of American imperialism. \u201cI grew up in downtown New York, surrounded by artists and deeply liberal folks who had a lot of scepticism about these organisations and institutions,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re suddenly playing somebody who is in that world you can\u2019t help but be moved by their efforts. I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.\u201d Adapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff\u2019s Israeli series Prisoners of War, Homeland exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, House of Cards. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero\u2019s welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed \u2013 in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling. The first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length. But in a recent Los Angeles Times interview, Gansa said \u201cit became much more difficult to write the show\u201d after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was \u201cstrained\u201d. The series indulged twists and turns that stretched credulity, and was in danger of \u201cjumping the shark\u201d. \u201cWhere Did Homeland Go Wrong?\u201d demanded the New Yorker magazine. The radical solution, apparently against Showtime\u2019s wishes, was amputation: Brody was killed off, publicly hanged from a crane in Tehran as punishment for killing the head of Iranian intelligence, with Mathison watching in horror. It was a chance for Homeland to start over. The team began attending an annual \u201cspy camp\u201d at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden. Speaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: \u201cA lot of times it was, \u2018OK, what\u2019s happening now?\u2019 We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about.

And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary. Homeland\u2019s politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in. \u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently. \u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the Washington Post in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, Homeland has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters. \u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d Another sensitive area has been Homeland\u2019s portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her. It was just so nice to play the smartest person in the room, somebody who was so daring and unapologetically ambitious and such a badass. She\u2019s not really going away.\u201d Homeland season eight screens on Channel 4 at 9pm (UK) and at 9pm on Showtime in the US. The entire series concludes on 26 April (US) and 3 May (UK)",

I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.</p> <p>In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-is-jason-kenneys-energy-war-room-good-for/\">\u201cwar room\u201d</a> to fight environmentalists, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">invested</a> $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">loan guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489960-three-states-push-criminal-penalties-for-fossil-fuel-protests-amid\">made it a felony</a> even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">memorandum</a> exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html?fbclid=IwAR3XkPugyurel_uSz86nG7Zt6eexJ_HLZNBufOWTNas8kDmJyby5UpQpe5I\">critical</a>\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to <em>cut</em> supply.</p> <p>On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/04/01/news/kxl-to-go-forward-amid-pandemic/8663.html\">moving workers</a> from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html\">actually begun arriving</a> 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.</p> <p>On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">$1.25b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">n bond issue</a> for TC Energy.</p> <p>So here\u2019s how it shakes out:</p> <p>1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system.</p> <p>2) The work is being done on the <a href=\"https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/\">edges of many Indian reservations</a> \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html\">endured</a> 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline\">put it</a> on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d.</p> <p>3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.</p> <p>There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:</p> <p><em>\u201cVice-</em><em>president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health</em><em> and climate justice before any project can proceed.

      "bodyText": "With that news about year 12 students, we will leave you for the night. Our Australian-specific live coverage will resume in the morning. In the mean time you can follow our rolling global coverage here. Goodnight, stay well, and stay at home. On ABC news, Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says that year 12 students will be able to sit their exams and get an Atar \u2014 a university entrance score \u2014 but possibly not until next year. Said Andrews: It is my aim that they can get an Atar, if not within this calendar year, then very soon thereafter. We\u2019ve got six or eight weeks at the end of the year that we can catch up with, if you like, when school was scheduled to finish. And when we get to that sort of Christmas holiday, we\u2019re in conversations with universities, with Tafe. We\u2019re talking to other states and territories and of course, the commonwealth. I know it\u2019s very frustrating, including in my own household. I can\u2019t give [my son] Noah who is in year 12 all the answers he wants, but as soon as we can, we will. The key point here is to get this right. Year 12 end-of-year exams are usually conducted in October and November, with results posted in early December. University offers flow from early of January, in time for the university semester to start in the first week of March. We will leave you there with a bit of cautious optimism that Australia is beginning to flatten the curve. You can follow our rolling global coverage here. To recap: Police in New South Wales have launched an investigation into the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The investigation will examine possible breaches of biosecurity laws and will be conducted alongside a coronial investigation into the deaths of 11 of the 662 passengers who tested positive to Covid-19. The deaths of four of the passengers of the Ruby Princess were confirmed on Sunday. They are three men from NSW and one 78-year-old man from Queensland. The death toll from Covid-19 in Australia sits at 35. NSW health minister Brad Hazard has again defended NSW Health staff who made the decision to allow the Ruby Princess passengers to disembark. The number of new daily cases in Australia has fallen to 139, and the total number of cases is 5,687. Of them, 91 people are in intensive care, 33 people are on ventilators, and about 2,000 have fully recovered. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the daily case numbers in Australia \u201cdoes tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve\u201d. However he said he was concerned that 10% of the cases recorded in Australia were from community transmission. The federal government may expand its jobkeeper package to allow more casual workers to access the payment, when parliament is recalled to debate that legislation this week. The Victorian government has offered free hotel rooms to health workers seeking to self-isolate to protect their families. Governments of all states have warned people against heading to regional towns for Easter holidays, saying that hospitals in those areas do not have the infrastructure to cope with a significant Covid-19 outbreak. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has warned she will close outdoor fresh food markets if crowds continue to congregate. Tasmania has closed two wards of the North West Regional Hospital after three health workers tested positive to Covid-19, prompting another 18 to go into self-isolation. The hard border between WA and the rest of the country comes into effect at 11.59pm tonight. You can read a summary of the day\u2019s news in Australia here. Stay at home, stay well, and we will be back in the morning. Police in Western Australia have arrested and detained a 35-year-old Victorian man for breaching mandatory quarantine \u201con several occasions\u201d and leaving his hotel to travel around the city. In a statement, WA police said the man arrived in WA on 28 March and was required under orders on the movement of interstate travellers to quarantine for 14 days, or until 13 April. The man was put up in a hotel in Perth for the duration of his quarantine. Said police: It is alleged during the quarantine period, the man breached the self-quarantine requirements that he was bounded by on a number of occasions. He wedged open a fire exit door at the hotel to enable him to leave and re-enter the property without being seen by staff. He utilised public transport to travel within the metropolitan area. The man has been charged with two counts of failing to comply with a direction under the Emergency Management Act s.86) 1A. Police added: The man remains in custody as he was refused bail on the basis that he will likely continue or repeat the offence, which endangers another person\u2019s safety. Carnival Australia responds to police investigation A spokesman from Carnival Australia, the company which operates the Ruby Princess cruise ship, just provided Guardian Australia with the following statement in response to police in NSW launching a criminal investigation. Carnival Australia said: We have seen the Police Commissioner\u2019s announcement. In addition to willingly participating in the investigation, Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them. You can read Matilda Boseley\u2019s full report on this issue here. Here\u2019s some more information about that latest death in Queensland. Queensland Health just issued a statement saying that a 78-year-old man with underlying medical conditions died in the Prince Charles hospital in Brisbane, after testing positive to Covid-19. They said: The man contracted the disease after recently returning from a cruise. Queensland Health offers its sincere condolences to his family. Back on Sky, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard says NSW has done more testing for coronavirus than any other state or territory. That\u2019s true in terms of the raw numbers \u2014 it has conducted 140,000 tests to date while the next-biggest state, Victoria, has conducted about 56,000. But on a per-capita basis, South Australia has conducted the most tests. On the Ruby Princess issue, Hazzard says now is not the time for casting blame on public health staff. We have got to put our trust in the public health doctors and our frontline medical staff who are trying to look after us and are doing their best... it\u2019s not a time for blame. An eleventh passenger of the Ruby Princess cruise ship has died after testing positive to Covid-19. It brings the total number of deaths in Australia from Covid-19 to 35 and the number of deaths in Queensland to five. Brad Hazzard on Sky said NSW Health allowed the ship to come into the harbour in accordance with a federal government protocols. He said more than 40 people were swabbed for influenza \u2014 not Covid-19 \u2014 on the ship before it docked in Sydney. About 15 of those swabs were handed over to NSW Health. He said more than 100 people on the ship had flu-like symptoms before the ship landed. Hazzard said NSW health made the decision to allow passengers to disembark based on the information they had at the time, and said that neither he nor anyone who is not a doctor should question that decision. I think the community could be satisfied that we had the best of the best making those decisions. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is on Sky News talking to Sharri Markson about the Ruby Princess cruise ship. He says he didn\u2019t know \u201cif you could say it\u2019s incompetence\u201d that allowed the ship to dock in Sydney, and 2,700 passengers to disembark. Hazzard: These cruise ships have sadly become crucibles of disease, of this disease. WA premier Mark McGowan mentioned earlier that the coastal town of Esperance, which is about 700km east of Perth on the south coast and 400km south of Kalgoorlie, will be subject to specific local border controls to prevent people going there for easter holidays. Police are already in place. The WA border will close at 11.59pm to anyone who does not have an essential purpose or meet one of the narrow categories for exemption. Details on the WA government website, here. In Tasmania, authorities have closed parts of the North West Regional hospital in Burnie, 330km northwest of Hobart, after three health workers tested positive. Two hospital staff tested positive on Friday, and a third overnight. A further 18 health workers based at the hospital have gone into self-isolation, after being identified as close contacts of the three who tested positive. This report is from The Examiner: Two major wards at the North West Regional Hospital have been closed to new admissions following a coronavirus outbreak. The medical and surgical wards have been locked down after three health workers were confirmed to have tested positive, Chief Medical Officer Professor Tony Lawler said. \u201cIn discussion with the acting director of public health yesterday, It was determined that appropriate measures would need to be put in place to limit the risk of further complications of the identification of infected individuals,\u201d Professor Lawler said. \u201cAs a result a determination was made that there would be no new admissions to the medical and surgical ward and appropriate hygiene and PPE measures would be put in place. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that this will have an impact not only on the capacity of the North West Regional Hospital, but a very real impact on the staff.\u201d The Ruby Princess cruise ship, which NSW police said today would be the subject of a criminal and coronial investigation, is currently sitting off the coast of Sydney. Between 100 and 200 \u2014 closer to 200, police said \u2014 crew members still aboard the ship are showing symptoms of the coronavirus. Some crew have been taken off the ship and taken to hospital. At least 662 people linked to the ship, mainly passengers, have tested positive to Covid-19, and 10 passengers have died. Consumer Protection WA has warned residential tenants to continue paying their rent unless they are genuinely experiencing severe financial hardship. It has also urged landlords and to show compassion and negotiate with tenants who have lost work due to Covid-19. Consumer Protection said it has received calls from \u201cconcerned landlords who claim that their tenant has stopped paying rent even when they are not facing financial difficulty\u201d. Consumer Protection commissioner Penny Lipscombe said she was concerned some may be exploiting the situation. While the national cabinet carefully considers the complex issue of implementing a proposed six-month moratorium on residential tenancy evictions, tenants are reminded that any moratorium will not apply to rental payments. There remains a legal obligation on the part of the tenant to pay their rent in accordance with their current lease agreement, but we are looking at ensuring that evictions are not carried out if the tenant no longer has the capacity to pay. Tenants should pay what they can \u2013 the proposed changes are about allowing time for tenants to get their financial situation sorted out so they can start paying rent again as soon as it is practical to do so. It is reasonable for a landlord to ask for proof of termination of employment or other evidence of financial distress, but should not ask to look at copies of bank statements. On Friday, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission warned real estate agents that they could be jailed for up to five years if they advised tenants to draw on their superannuation to pay rent. Forty-seven Australian children remain trapped in the abject al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, as the region braces for a potential Covid-19 outbreak. Syria has reported only a handful of cases, and there are none confirmed in the camp housing 68,000 women and children, most of them family of Islamic State fighters, but there has been little Covid-19 testing across the war-torn country. In neighbouring Turkey, more than 18,000 cases have been confirmed, and the rate of infection is on the steepest upward curve of any country in the world. Fabrizio Carboni, the regional director for the Near and Middle East for the International Committee of the Red Cross, tells the Guardian al-Hawl is \u201chell \u2026 this place really is hell\u201d, and acutely vulnerable to a Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cThe challenge for us is prevention, to avoid the virus getting into the camp, and to isolate any cases at all costs to stop the spread in the camp. But really, if this epidemic gets into the camp, forget about having medical supplies, it will be impossible to control.\u201d More details here: Meanwhile, in Queensland, police issued 58 infringement notices at a car rally in the Brisbane suburb of Rochedale last night. That\u2019s right, a car rally. Deputy Queensland police commissioner Steve Gollschewski, who is also the state disaster coordinator, has professed himself disappointed and frustrated and said the behaviour of people at the rally was \u201cinexcusable\u201d. Said Gollschewski: This is all about safety. About saving lives. About stopping the spread of Covid-19. We all, every single one of us, must do our bit. We are in this together. It is inexcusable what happened at Rochedale last night and such blatant disregard for the lives of Queenslanders will not be tolerated. Police said they received a tip-off at 10pm that about 150 cars and a \u201clarge number of people\u201d had congregated in the carpark of the Brickworks Place warehouse. From the police statement: Multiple police units responded with many of the cars attempting to flee the area, with some driving across grassland and becoming bogged in the process. The infringement notices carry a fine of $1,334, for failing to comply with a direction issued by the chief health officer. The 58 fines were issued to both drivers and passengers, male and female, aged between 17 and 30. If you\u2019re unclear about the rules in Queensland, you can read our explainer of the rules in each state here or the Queensland chief health officer\u2019s direction here. South Australian health minister Stephen Wade said it was \u201cfar too early to talk about easing restrictions\u201d. These figures are encouraging but they are early and we need to see a clear trend, particularly coming up to Easter ... We need to make sure that people follow through in the public health advice, stay at home for Easter, maintain social distancing, maintain high standards of personal hygiene. Michael Cusack was asked if the drop in daily numbers meant that SA would lift its border restrictions, or whether it would remain \u201clocked off\u201d from the rest of the country for six to 12 months. Cusack said he could not answer that question today, as it would depend on national health guidelines. He said SA was in a \u201cbetter position\u201d than the eastern states. He said that the lesson from countries which had managed the outbreak well was to do \u201ca lot of testing, large scale testing in the way we have done here, and then contract tracing of each of the persons who have the infection\u201d. That, he says, allows you to put \u201ca ring around infected people\u201d. That is how you keep numbers low and you effectively save lives. SA has, as of Sunday, conducted 38,863 tests. That\u2019s about 2% of the population, which is one of the highest per capita testing rates in the world. SA also has among the highest per-capita infection rates, and Cusack says the one follows the other. He said data from other countries showed that \u201ccountries that have done a lot of testing have had sort of relatively higher rates of infection, but that is because they know the size of the infections that they have got in their populations. I mean, there are some countries in Europe I guess where the level of testing has been quite low and although the quoted figures in terms of the number of people that they know have infection is low, what we see of the impacts on the hospitals in the health systems, the likelihood is there is an awful lot more people in the community, that they just do not know have infections. So I think the approach taken so far has been the right one in terms of a lot of testing, being really clear who has infection. [To] the people watching this: if you have symptoms or if you think you may have symptoms and you meet these testing criteria, you need to get tested quickly because what we do know about the virus, that people are infectious very early on and that is why we need to make the diagnosis early and then they can go into isolation and we can immediately get those contact traces made. Michael Cusack said a drop-off in cases was expected, because SA had put in place domestic border restrictions on top of the requirements for international travellers to quarantine. That means that the number of people coming to the state, both domestic and international travellers, has dropped. Cusack: Obviously once that kind of tap is switched off you would expect there would be a decline in imported disease. What the real anxiety has been and why social distancing is so important is that where the virus is in the community, there is a risk that we start to see some community spread, and that is why it has been so vitally important that we get the public to understand why they should distance themselves. And I would have to say in South Australia the public have been fantastic at actually buying into this and doing the social distancing, and I think it is very early days but that is perhaps starting to bleed through into the numbers. Like every other public health officer to speak today, Michael Cusack is cautiously optimistic about the ability of his team to get ahead of the spread in their jurisdiction. Cusack said they are \u201cobviously\u201d pleased with just two new cases recorded overnight, but added that they often see a \u201cslackening off\u201d of new cases recorded over the weekend, which suggested there could be fewer checks conducted. He said: So I wouldn\u2019t want to read too much into this, but we have seen a gradual decline in recent days. That leads to a question of if we should change our restrictions, and so forth. We are still in the early stages of this disease and we don\u2019t, as I say, we are keen that we don\u2019t read too much into this at an early stage. We may well see an increase in the coming days again, as we have done previously. South Australia records just two new cases in 24 hours SA\u2019s deputy chief Public Health Officer, Michael Cusack, says just two new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in that state overnight, bringing the total to 409. Neither of those new cases are from the Ruby Princess cruise ship. More than a quarter of all cases in SA \u2014 about 120 \u2014 have been traced back to cruise ships. Cusack says that the number of cases linked to the cluster among baggage handlers at Adelaide airport had increased by three, up to 28 cases, of which 17 are baggage handlers and 11 are secondary contacts, including family members. Those three cases are not included in the two new cases reported overnight \u2014 so they were reported earlier. Nineteen people are in the Royal Adelaide hospital with Covid-19, and nine are in ICU. Thanks to Luke Henriques-Gomes for keeping us all informed today. We\u2019ll go now to South Australia, where health minister Stephen Wade is giving an update. He begins by urging people not to travel for the Easter holidays. If you are planning to holiday beyond home, I would urge you to reconsider. The challenge is real and by staying apart, South Australia is truly united. Wade said SA was fast-tracking a plan to recruit 97 new ambulance officers. The ambulance SA chief executive, David Place, said they were also hiring more people to answer triple-0 calls, bringing the number of new employees to 100. They\u2019ve also contracted Toyota to sterilise ambulances that have carried confirmed or suspected cases. And with that, I might leave you in the hands of my excellent colleague Calla Wahlquist. A quick look at the main developments so far today: NSW police launch criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess deaths Another three deaths from the cruise ship, and four in total, pushed the death toll to 34 The CMO says the curve is continuing to flatten; 139 new cases Mark McGowan warns WA residents to come home before the border closes at midnight Asked if schools will reopen at the start of term two, McGowan says that education ministers are expected to present a plan to National Cabinet on Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m keen that our schools have the very best of health advice but that we continue to provide ongoing education. What the model is? Not sure yet.\u201d McGowan is asked about a call to house homeless people in hotels now, rather than the government\u2019s trial that has put 20 people in a hotel. The Guardian reported on this issue here. McGowan is unmoved. I think it\u2019s best to continue with the trial and make sure that is a successful and workable way forward. I spoke to the manager of the hotel the other day. He was very excited and very pleased by the way it\u2019s progressing but I think it\u2019s worth watching and making sure that it works well before we expand it. McGowan says the government would be more likely to reopen cafes and restaurants before reopening the border. \u201cIf we can push the level of infection down and continue to have the low rates of infection, well, then the first thing I want to do is try and get our economy back up sooner, or as soon as possible. But I can\u2019t put any deadlines or timeframes on that. It might be months and months away. Clearly to me the inconvenience of someone from the east not being able to come here or people from here not being able to go on holidays in Bali is minor compared to someone losing their business or job. So getting the economy back up and running is my first priority. But we can\u2019t do any of that until we know we get the best health advice and know it\u2019s the right time to do it.\u201d How long will the state\u2019s hard border be in place? \u201cThat\u2019s the $64 million question,\u201d says McGowan. He admits he does not have \u201ceasy answers\u201d about when this will happen, but says that people should be prepared for \u201canywhere up to six months at this point in time\u201d. McGowan is asked about police in Kununurra who are now in self-quarantine. He says that there were three officers in self-isolation, although it may be more now, he says. He can\u2019t provide any more detail than that. McGowan is talking about the WA\u2019s new hard border. He manages to invoke Brexit. Sorry, Britain. What we have done in less than a week took Britain four years to work through. Brexit has taken four years and we put borders in place in the space of one week. That is testament to the people who have been working around the clock to get this done across the public sector, in particular our police commissioner. McGowan\u2019s message to people outside the state is \u201ccome home by midnight tonight\u201d. No one from over east will be allowed entry into Western Australia unless you\u2019re an approved exempt traveller. I can\u2019t stress this enough \u2013 you must be exempt, otherwise you\u2019ll be turned around. People can go to the government website to get the latest information and download the necessary forms. Checks will be occurring. If you\u2019ve lied on an exemption form to get into our state, there\u2019s every chance you\u2019ll get caught and be forced to face the consequences. McGowan is pleased with WA\u2019s progress, as you can see from this metaphor-heavy passage. I know we\u2019ve been asking a lot of you all over the past month. I\u2019m so proud that Western Australia has risen to the challenge. It\u2019s also reassuring to see our efforts are having a positive impact and encouraging to see the low number of new cases. But that\u2019s just all the more reason for us to stay on course. What we\u2019re doing is working but this is a marathon, not a sprint. We\u2019re still heading into the storm ... Our best weapon in this war is you. WA premier Mark McGowan tells reporters there have been 17 new cases in WA overnight. McGowan says those who tested positive since yesterday were aged between 26 and 78 years old. That brings the state\u2019s total to 453 cases. There are 302 active cases. There are 59 confirmed cases in Perth hospitals; 18 are in intensive care units. Just turning back to Mick Fuller\u2019s press conference, he was asked if police will be doing random checks to see that people have not gone on holidays. The question included a reference to checking IDs. Fuller says: \u201cWe will. I feel we\u2019re getting good levels of compliance. The exercise issue is a complex one because we want people to get out and manage their mental health. You look at the transmission rates around our beaches and the area is much, much higher than it is in other areas generally. We will be stopping people and if you don\u2019t have a good reason to be where you are, you could face a $1,000 fine. As I keep saying we would much rather work with the community than be issuing fines.\u201d A reporter presses Murphy on the modelling that the government has claimed it will release. Why is the modelling not ready for release, but good enough to use to make decisions from? \u201cNational cabinet will consider some of the modelling work in the coming week and I think that the national cabinet, my understanding is, are quite keen to share some of the modelling with the community. I think we\u2019ll wait and see what the national cabinet discusses on Tuesday. \u201cThe intention is to provide the modelling when it\u2019s in a fit form for publication. That\u2019s pretty close, I think.\u201d Murphy is asked if there is a point where asymptomatic people in the community will be tested. There wouldn\u2019t be an availability of testing kits to test the whole community. The whole world is very keenly acquiring testing kits. We\u2019re doing a lot. We\u2019ve managed to secure very large numbers of testing kits to meet our high testing rate. There is no evidence at the moment about testing asymptomatic people. The only situation where we think it might be valuable at the moment is in an aged care outbreak because we\u2019ve found some aged care residents can have asymptomatic measures. Brendan Murphy says Easter is \u201cgoing to be very different this year\u201d. People have been asked not to travel over the holiday. However, he says the Easter Bunny is exempt from this. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked about the Easter Bunny and I\u2019m told because he\u2019s a solo operator and an essential service, Easter Bunny, he or she, will be allowed to continue to operate. \u201cBut the rest of us will have to do things differently.\u201d The major concern continues to be community transmission. Murphy acknowledges he may sound like a \u201cbroken record\u201d on this. We all know just how infectious this virus can be. Just look at what it did on some cruise ships. Thirty-five people in one wedding. The Qantas and Jetstar baggage handlers in Adelaide. It spreads very quickly. So we\u2019re in a good place at the moment. We are achieving good control because the community has done what we have asked. Murphy says it\u2019s estimated that more than 2,000 people have \u201cfully recovered from the virus already in Australia\u201d. He says authorities are \u201cincreasingly confident\u201d that they can prevent a situation like that in New York if people \u201ccontinue to adhere to\u201d the social distancing measures. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is now speaking in Canberra. He says there are: 5,687 cases, an increase of 139 cases over the past 24 hours 34 deaths 91 people in intensive care; 33 on ventilators \u201cThat is probably the lowest rise we\u2019ve had for a few days and it does tend to continue the trend we\u2019ve seen of flattening of the curve.\u201d Fuller is asked what laws are being considered as far as the criminal investigation goes. You have overarching biosecurity acts from a national or federal perspective and then you\u2019d have state legislation in terms of borders and then that criminal negligence-type crimes. But, as you said, we\u2019re at the beginning. I haven\u2019t even handed over the evidence I\u2019ve collected thus far and there\u2019s a lot more work to be done. Fuller says he has received a letter from Carnival that states that they will provide whatever documentation is requested through the investigation. He is also asked if he\u2019s disappointed that no agencies involved in the Ruby Princess issue have taken responsibility for what went wrong. \u201cI suppose the important thing is, from the New South Wales state perspective, this, the premier stood up, put police in charge of the ports and the airports in terms of border control and we haven\u2019t seen this happen again. I think that\u2019s the important thing. Because coronavirus is not over and we still have planes landing every day and hundreds of Australians returning, which is important that we manage that, with that same sort of humanitarian perspective. \u201cWe will continue from a police perspective and they\u2019ll look at all of those agencies. It\u2019s not just about finishing on Carnival or finishing on person X, we\u2019ll have to look at all the touch points to get to the bottom of it. There will be lessons learnt, I have no doubt.\u201d Fuller says there will also be coronial oversight of the police investigation. Fuller says that crew members who need medical assistance have been taken off the ship. Fuller says about 200 people who are still on board the cruise ship have symptoms. Authorities are looking at finding a safe place for the ship to dock. Fuller is asked whether cruise line operator Carnival was underplaying the symptoms of those on board. \u201cWe will only know by getting the ship\u2019s records, the records from the doctors on the ships and obviously there are over a couple of thousand people who were passengers on the ship who have come off. \u201cWell, there seems to be ... discrepancies between the information provided by Carnival and what I would see is the benchmark for the laws that the federal government and the state government put in place in terms of protecting Australians from cruise ships when coronavirus had started.\u201d Fuller also says that there has been another crew member taken off the Ruby Princess today. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller confirms that there will be a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess debacle. \u201cThere is clear evidence that [Covid-19] has been brought off that ship,\u201d Fuller says. There\u2019s clear evidence now when it stopped in New Zealand Covid-19 has come off that ship and at least 10 people have died in Australia from COVID-19. The only way I can get to the bottom of whether our national biosecurity laws and our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.\u201d He adds: \u201cThe investigation will look into the actions of every agency.\u201d Ten passengers who were on the cruise ship have now died. While we await those press conferences, I might point you to this excellent weekend feature by my colleague Lisa Cox. We are expecting press conferences from the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy, the WA premier Mark McGowan, and the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller, after 3pm. Burke is asked how Labor will go in opposing aspects of the legislation. His key point is that the opposition wants the legislation to pass. They want it to pass \u201cin the best possible form\u201d. At the moment there is no existing legislation. They have not finished and we have not been presented with anything and I don\u2019t think the government is playing a game. This is genuinely complex legislation to deal with every circumstance as to how this would unfold in any workplace. So, it is complex. Once we see it they may have already made ... the amendments to the announcement if they haven\u2019t we would look at how we can use the parliament to be able to do with that. On the leave issue, Burke describes Labor\u2019s concerns like this: An employer at the moment, if they force someone to take leave that someone has built up over the last year and in some cases they would have built up over many years, that is a liability that the employer already owes a worker, it is already on the books. At the moment, the way the government has described it, the employer can register for JobKeeper, register that employee as part of the scheme and even though the employee is simply getting what they were already owed and entitled to long before anyone had ever heard of coronavirus, the employer will be getting $1,500 a fortnight and keep it to improve their balance sheet. That is not what this program was established for. Tony Burke, who is Labor\u2019s industrial relations spokesman, turns to the jobkeeper package. He says the government\u2019s jobkeeper package could be improved. Burke is concerned that some casuals will be left out of the package. \u201cWe get a whole lot of perverse outcomes with the 12 month rule that the government is currently imposing.\u201d He says that there will be casuals who only work a shift or two each fortnight, who will now get $1,500 a fortnight, while another worker who relies on regular casual shifts but has not been at the same company for 12 months will not be eligible for the wage subsidy. Labor frontbencher Tony Burke is addressing the media. He is saying that the parliament should be sitting more often than is scheduled. Parliament is set to return to next week on Wednesday, ostensibly to pass the jobkeeper package, but will then will not return until until 11 August. \u201cWhen you push $200 billion out the door in the space of six months with legislation drafted only days before it gets introduced and go through all of its stages, mistakes will happen. We need to have the parliament sitting regularly to be able to deal with those errors and we have found ways now so that we can be sitting with only one-third of the members of the House of Reps present, with similar arrangements in the Senate. We need to be there to make sure the legislation can be adapted, as is required, and also, with $200 billion going out the door and no scrutiny on the floor of the house on a regular basis?\u201d NZ prime minister Jacinda Ardern has codified social distancing laws that prevent people from seeing their partners if they do not live under the same roof, AAP reports. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, and police minister, Lisa Neville, briefly told residents that it had adopted a similar policy this week, before reversing that position. Not so in NZ, AAP reports. The country is currently in a four-week lockdown. Ardern had previously told people to \u201capply common sense\u201d and shrink down their social group to \u201ca small group of individuals who are part of your bubble ... the bubble you must maintain\u201d for the month. But a new Health Act order does not allow people to visit their partners unless there is shared custody of children or if at least one of the partners lives alone. NZ has gone further than Australia, closing all non-essential businesses \u2013 including all restaurants and educational facilities. The country has just passed 1,000 cases. Here is a primer from Paul Karp that will give you a sense of Labor and the union movement\u2019s concerns about the government\u2019s plans to change the Fair Work Act. This debate has played out today between Sally McManus and Christian Porter. Also just letting you now that the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller will address the media at 3pm. There is currently a police investigation into the Ruby Princess fiasco. Sky News\u2019s Andrew Clennell has reported that this will proceed to a criminal investigation. However, it should be noted this has not been confirmed officially. No doubt Fuller will address this question later today. More from Christian Porter\u2019s press conference. Porter has a fairly colourful response when asked who he thinks is responsible for the Ruby Princess debacle. It\u2019s been busy few days in government and I have not gone through a PhD analysis of jurisdictional laws in regard to the Ruby Princess. Maybe one day I will go through that but I did find the explanation of the timing of events [by Michael Outram] to be utterly persuasive. Porter indicates that there will be room to move on the government\u2019s jobkeeper package as far as eligibility goes. On the issue of casuals, he suggests that the government is \u201cworking on that and listening\u201d and trying to be \u201cas inclusive as possible\u201d. The government\u2019s current definition means only casuals who\u2019ve worked at an employer for 12 months would be eligible. Asked about McManus\u2019s idea for a test that offers jobkeeper to anyone who would have been \u201creasonably\u201d expected to work, he says that he will consider the option, but considers it a bit \u201crubbery\u201d. Asked to respond to the ACTU\u2019s concerns about rorting, Porter says: \u201cI\u2019ll be sharing drafts with the ACTU, working through those line by line in a cooperative, open, frank and honest way with the ACTU. [We] want them to have comfort that this is time bound and has the requisite safeguards and mechanisms in it to ensure that there is not rorting of the system, but ultimately the laws need to change to allow people to receive $1,500 where they would otherwise receive nothing because the business was unviable.\u201d Porter makes the case that there needs to be changes to the Fair Work Act in order to make sure the jobkeeper package works. You\u2019ll remember we reported ACTU secretary Sally McManus\u2019s concerns about this earlier today. The issue is whether employers can direct their staff to take their leave. It would have a sunset date of six months. Porter suggests that the government does not intend to budge on this. They will be time bound and only last as long as the payment system lasted, but without the changes, even if it were the case that a business would face a situation where they would otherwise have to let an employee go, so that they have no job and no wage and no way to provide for their family, without changes to the IR system and employment relations system, that is what would happen, rather than the employee getting the $1,500 instead of getting the normal wage. We must change the system. I\u2019ve been working very cooperatively with Sally McManus and the ACTU and Greg Combet on the prime minister\u2019s commission and we\u2019ve had enormous progress in relation to the industrial relations systems. We will not be waiting or hoping that this change can be affected over the coming weeks or months by changing 121 awards and thousands of individual enterprise agreements. This change will be happening next Wednesday. No matter how late we have to sit, the change will be happening next Wednesday. Six million Australian jobs depend on it.\u201d Porter says jobkeeper legislation is being worked on by both Treasury and his department and a draft should be ready on Monday. The attorney general, Christian Porter, is addressing plans for next week\u2019s sitting of parliament on Wednesday. Porter says there will be 47 pairs granted in the House, meaning 37 members of the government and 21 members of the opposition. He says he\u2019s not checked with the crossbench but it\u2019s expected they will attend. Parliament will be dealing with the jobkeeper package. There will be a question time session at 2pm on Wednesday as per usual. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has indicated she will raise with the federal government the cramped conditions being experienced by refugees at a Brisbane detention centre. AAP reported on Saturday that dozens of refugees protested on the verandah of a Kangaroo Point hotel which houses refugees transferred from offshore detention to receive specialist medical treatment. The premier said on Sunday that she was \u201cnot happy\u201d with the situation. \u201cNo I\u2019m not happy with the situation and I will talk to the federal government,\u201d Palaszczuk said in comments reported by Nine Newspapers. \u201cThe refugee issue is an issue for the federal government and I am happy to raise it with them.\u201d The Guardian reported last month that an immigration guard at the hotel had tested positive for Covid-19. The refugees have called for better protections during the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s no distancing here which is really dangerous for us,\u201d a one refugee told AAP. \u201cIf one guy was infected here, then all of us would be infected.\u201d An ASRC spokeswoman told AAP on Saturday the refugees at Kangaroo Point live in cramped conditions and are \u201creally scared\u201d there will be a Covid-19 outbreak. There are about 1,400 people held in detention centres across Australia. Human rights lawyers are urging the government to reduce the number of people in these crammed spaces and release them into safer spaces, the ASRC said in a statement. The Tasmanian Legislative Council elections in Huon and Rosevears have been postponed. About 53,000 voters would have voted on 2 May, but new public health advice has forced the elections to be delayed. The Tasmanian attorney general, Elise Archer, says that the government still intends to hold the poll before 25 August, when the Tasmanian upper house will next convene. \u201cThe government will continue, of course, to seek public health advice over coming months to determine an exact polling date. Should public health circumstances require a further deferral of the election, then a further notice would need to be considered at that time.\u201d Gutwein says he was concerned yesterday to see groups of people \u201cbrowsing\u201d at the shops. There were still children in groups in the mall and walking through the city. Now, I know this is tough stuff. I know this is hard and I have had many discussions over the last 24 hours with my own family and children about the need for this to occur. It is important that we all take every step that we can to socially distance and ensure that we follow the rules. So if you are going to the supermarket, and yesterday I sat in the car with my children while my wife went in, only going to the supermarket, don\u2019t go with a family to browse and to shop. It is not a social outing. Go and buy what you need. Moving on from NSW, in Tasmania the premier, Peter Gutwein, has provided an update. Gutwein says there were two new cases confirmed overnight, taking the overall number of cases to 82. One of those who has tested positive was a health worker at the Northwest Regional hospital. Dr McAnulty has just confirmed three of the four people who died overnight likely acquired the coronavirus on board the Ruby Princess. McAnulty is cautiously optimistic that the curve is starting to flatten. We want to be hopeful, but not to over-egg the figures. The last few days we have seen numbers bounce around without escalating at the same level as we have seen before, so we are hopeful that we are starting to flatten the curve. But there is more work to be done, and it is important that we all heed those messages. But he does not want people to get ahead of themselves. Because we have seen internationally, where we think there is good news, people kind of relax the measures, and then that leads to an upswing in cases. NSW Health\u2019s director of health protection, Jeremy McAnulty, says that four people have died overnight, bringing the NSW death toll to 16. They were a 91-year-old man, who died at Port Macquarie hospital, a 80-year-old man and a 76-year-old who died at Westmead, and a 61-year-old who died at Hornsby. NSW Health Director of Health Protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty says there have been 87 new cases reported up until last night. While it is \u201cearly days\u201d, he says this suggests a \u201cstabilisation\u201d of the numbers. He is keen to see testing continue in places where community transmission has taken place, such as Bondi. There are 2,580 cases overall in NSW, with 578 acquired locally from a known confirmed case or cluster, and 380 locally acquired but without direct contact with a known case or cluster, and 56 remain under investigation. McAnulty notes that the \u201cbiggest single age group is people in their 20s\u201d. \u201cAnd in fact, we have seen also three people who were ventilated in intensive care in their 30s.\u201d Hazzard apologises that he did not confirm yesterday in newly issued public health orders that places of worship may have the staff they need to conduct livestreams. Brad Hazzard says some people are not heeding the message not to travel. He is not happy about large numbers of people entering the North Coast, Central Coast and the South Coast a few days out from Easter. \u201cI know Aussies like to thumb their nose at authority, but on this occasion, I would ask you to not thumb your nose, because the messages we are giving you are about keeping you alive, keeping your family alive, keeping your friends alive, and making sure the community stays safe. If you have headed off for a sneaky little holiday, my message to you is go home.\u201d Hazzard says he is \u201cappalled\u201d by news reports suggesting that doctors and nurses are being physically and verbally attacked. \u201cThat very same doctor, that very same nurse, when you see that person in a uniform in a hospital, and they might be putting a tube down your throat to keep you alive, you will wish you hadn\u2019t actually done what you did previously.\u201d The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, is speaking in Sydney. Hazzard says that there are now 39 people who are in intensive care units in the state, including 23 who are on ventilators. \u201cI want to say this is an extremely dangerous virus. It is still marching through our community, and people need to be on high alert. It has killed at this stage in New South Wales 16 people. I also want to say that, for those who don\u2019t know what it is like, if you have never had a severe bout of pneumonia, a severe bout of asthma, and I have had both those, the effect, whether or not you have a fever, normally there is a fever, is that you end up with a lack of oxygen.\u201d Hazzard claims that some young people still believe he virus cannot affect them. But he says of the 2,580 cases in the state, 565 relate to young people under 29. \u201cTake it seriously is my message to young people.\u201d The Victorian chief health officer, Brett Sutton, is asked if the government has found the source of a cluster of cases at The Alfred hospital. The answer to that question is no. But Sutton says the \u201csolution is the same\u201d. We will protect our healthcare workers by not becoming patients ourselves. By not transmitting to other people in hospital and not turning up to hospital if we\u2019re well and following the rules around visitation. Andrews also points to a government announcement that the state will spend $20m to purchase hotel rooms that will be available to frontline healthcare works who test positive to Covid-19. \u201c... We\u2019ll put them up in a hotel room \u2013 no cost to them. This will be a matter of their choice. Many will choose to avail themselves of that hotel room option because they might live with older people. They might live in a share house with a range of other workers. They might have people at home in their household who are vulnerable for one reason or another. So we don\u2019t think that if you have Covid-19, or you have to isolate because you may have Covid-19, principally because of the work you\u2019re doing, we don\u2019t think that it\u2019s fair that you would have to go and self-isolate in a hotel room, and potentially, potentially incur very significant expense. This is exactly the right thing to do.\u201d Separately, the government has also announced $45m to ensure that kindergartens can stay open. Andrews says the announcement builds on the government\u2019s child care package, which he says was \u201cthe right thing\u201d. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is also speaking in Melbourne. Andrews says that the state has conducted around 56,000 tests so far. He says there has been \u201creally significant success\u201d flattening the curve, but there is still a \u201clong way to go\u201d. He thanks Victorians who are \u201cdoing the right\u201d thing. But he notes 142 fines have been issued over the past 24 hours for people flouting social distancing laws. And 751 checks over that same period. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has addressed reporters in Logan. She starts by saying that overnight cases are \u201ccoming down\u201d. Out of the 907 cases in Queensland, 119 are linked to cruise ships, she says. There have been nine new cases. But the premier is not happy about crowds that gathered at markets yesterday. Yesterday we saw crowds at markets and guys, it\u2019s not on. If I see that happen again, they\u2019re going to be shut down immediately. So I\u2019m going to be talking with the police commissioner and if that happens again, it\u2019s going to be shut down because people are not ... observing social distancing from each other. Now I want to try and keep fresh food markets open for people. It is not a chance to go down for an outing. You should only be going down there if you intend to purchase fresh produce and if you don\u2019t adhere to social distancing then we will have no choice but to shut those markets. I don\u2019t want to do that. So everyone needs to do the right thing and I\u2019m giving my last warning in relation to that. Aside from Daniel Andrews\u2019 scheduled press conference at 10.30am, we\u2019re told Annastacia Palaszczuk will give an update on Queensland shortly. AAP has filed this story reporting that an Australian has been rushed to hospital in Florida: An Australian is among four passengers rushed to hospital after the coronavirus struck the Coral Princess cruise ship docked in Miami, Florida. Two other passengers died before the ship arrived in Miami on Saturday. The Australian was taken to Larkin Community Hospital. \u201cThere are two people who will be transferred to Larkin,\u201d Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez told reporters on Saturday. \u201cOne is American. One is Australian.\u201d \u201cThere are two Americans who will be transferred to a hospital in Tampa. \u201cWe originally had six, but apparently two passed away on the way in.\u201d The Coral Princess, with 1,020 passengers and 878 crew, is the latest cruise to turn into a nightmare when people began falling ill with coronavirus symptoms and nations refused to let the ship dock. Princess Cruises said seven passengers and five crew members had tested positive. The ship was cruising around South America and was due to end in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 19 March. Gimenez agreed to allow the ship to dock at Port Miami as soon as Princess Cruises arranged for flights out of Miami International Airport for passengers deemed fit to fly. Strict protocols, including passengers wearing masks and separate waiting areas at the airport, would be in place. A similar predicament was endured by 133 Australians on the Zaandam and Rotterdam cruise ships that were initially blocked from stopping at South American ports. The two ships were cleared to dock at Florida\u2019s Port Everglades on Thursday with the Australians placed on charter flights for the US west coast and connecting flights back to Australia. The home affairs minister Peter Dutton has warned imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. Dutton said the Therapeutic Goods Administration has ruled the test kits were unapproved medical devices. \u201cInaccurate results could prevent people from seeking the medical help they need, or alternatively, discourage people who should be self-isolating from doing so,\u201d Dutton said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cOur ABF officers at the border are on alert for any unauthorised or homemade Covid-19 products and they will continue working day and night to ensure these dangerous goods don\u2019t make it into Australian households and communities.\u201d Authorities have intercepted a number of faulty keeps in recent weeks, including 200 units that arrived in Perth from China as air cargo in March. Similar detections have now been made in Perth (50 units) on 23 March and Melbourne (39 units) on 27 March, both originating in Hong Kong, AAP reports. Dutton said the only approved tests for Covid-19 in Australia are laboratory based tests or tests that can be used by health professionals at the point of care such as in hospitals or clinics. Speers asks what McManus thinks the workforce could look like after the pandemic is over. We\u2019ve got different experiences of this. On one hand, it\u2019s like a collective experience for everyone around the world, but at the moment, you\u2019ve got the frontline workers facing the virus, fighting the virus. You\u2019ve got the support workers. Those workers working from home. Some of them with kids as well and you\u2019ve got then people who have lost their jobs. I think that the biggest thing for us, as a country, is we\u2019ve got some strong institutions like our public health system, but casual work \u2013 too many insecure jobs. It\u2019s just been so exposed about how much risk has been shifted on to the individual. Coming out the other side, that\u2019s something we\u2019d really like to see changed. We need more permanent jobs for more Australians. And the interview is over. Speers turns to the minimum wage. Unions have been calling for a 4% increase. He tries to pin McManus down on whether or not she still supports an increase. Remember, minimum wage increases happen in the second-half of the year, so that\u2019s from 1 July onwards. We\u2019ve got it think, as the prime minister has talked about, about the snap back. If we want a snap back, we have to make sure that people have got money in their pockets. Because for a long time, we\u2019re going to depend on our domestic economy. All our small businesses will need money in their pockets to spend it. We think it\u2019s far too early to be saying that there should be any freezes on the minimum wage. In the end, the minimum wage has to be enough for people to live on, and at the moment, it\u2019s not. And we should look at the other side of this pandemic and making sure that people have got enough money in their pockets. Speers suggests that small businesses may not be able to cope. He notes a decision is needed before July. McManus says that the minimum wage should \u201cabsolutely\u201d still be increased, but says there is plenty of time to assess the scale of that rise. She notes the current minimum is only $39,000 a year. She says that the decision could be looked at closer to July, but of the 4% ask, she says: \u201cWe are going to be sensible, we want to save jobs.\u201d McManus is asked by David Speers whether Labor \u201cfight to the death on this ... or make the point and then let it pass?\u201d Her response is essentially, let\u2019s wait and see. Look, Labor and the Greens and the crossbenchers, we are saying to them that they should oppose changes to the Fair Work Act because we\u2019re just not necessary. We also haven\u2019t seen the changes that the government has proposed yet. So I imagine that things will develop over the next couple of days. Pressed on employers being able to instruct workers to take their leave, McManus reiterates that she does view that as reasonable in some cases. But she does not believe there should be a blanket provision for all to be able to do this. McManus says that many workers will choose to take their leave anyway, because it will entitle them to more than the $1,500 per fortnight jobkeeper allowance. We shouldn\u2019t have a situation where this money is used really to subsidise the leave entitlements. Rather, it\u2019s a wage subsidy. And we need to be clear about what it\u2019s for. What are McManus\u2019 specific concerns about changing the Fair Work Act? For example, we know that what\u2019s being considered is that an employer may be able to direct people just to take all their leave. Now, that is going to be sensible in some circumstances where an employer has shut down, and already, I mean, workers will make that decision to take leave rather than being on the jobkeeper allowance, because it\u2019s going to be more money. But a whole lot of other employers that aren\u2019t affected, well, should they be able to direct everyone to take their leave? That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s a fair situation. McManus is opposed to plans to change the Fair Work Act with legislation in order to implement the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. Well, we want to see it happen by cooperation, not by legislation as we have been cooperating. And not every instrument needs to change, not every enterprise agreement. There are lots of industries that are doing well under the crisis because they\u2019ve got a lot more business. You think about all of the utilities still working. There\u2019s no need to change those agreements and if you have it imposed on worker, then some employers, unfortunately, might take advantage of it. So we believe that everything can be done without changing the current system. Remember, the Fair Work Act is workers\u2019 rights. Just don\u2019t tinker with the workers\u2019 rights, we can make this happen. McManus acknowledges that the Australian wage subsidy will mean some casuals are paid more ($1,500 a fortnight) than they would otherwise in normal circumstances. But she says, too, that the UK and Danish subsidies are more generous. It\u2019s a unique system they\u2019ve brought in, similar to the New Zealand one, a flat rate. There\u2019s swings and roundabouts. Yes, it is true that lower paid workers and people who aren\u2019t full time workers, some will get more than they would have got. But it also means that higher paid workers will be getting much, much less than they would have got under, say for example, the UK or the Danish system, where it\u2019s around 80% or 70% of wages. So you know, you\u2019ve got to take those swings and roundabouts, and trade unions are just willing to make this the best system we can. In saying that, McManus says that the union movement is concerns that there are 1.1 million casuals who will miss out on the jobkeeper allowance. (It is limited to those who have been on an employer\u2019s books for 12 months.) McManus would like the payment issued to all people who would be \u201creasonably expected\u201d to be working. I think it\u2019s reasonable to draw the line somewhere. I think that best way of thinking about it is \u2013 if you could have reasonably expected to be working if it were not for the coronavirus, then you should get the jobkeeper allowance. Unfortunately in our country, we\u2019ve become so dependant on casual work and so many employers would have had their casual workers working. Think about all of the universities \u2013 more than 50% of the workers there are casual workers and they won\u2019t get that allowance unless it changes. The ACTU secretary Sally McManus is on Insiders with David Speers. McManus is asked if she agrees with Scott Morrison\u2019s \u201cthere are no bosses or unions, just Australians\u201d comment. First she pays tribute to front line workers. McManus says \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s no unions\u201d. But she congratulates the government for the wage subsidy announcement. It was the right announcement, the wage subsidy as well as the childcare subsidy and the private hospitals. They made really good decisions. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s no unions and I can assure the working people in Australia that the trade union movement in Australia is here and working in their corner. Having said that, the fact that we\u2019re now consulting with the government means that better decisions are being made because you\u2019re listening to more voices. Hundreds of thousands of NDIS participants will have access to priority delivery from supermarkets during the Covid-19 crisis, the government has announced. From Monday, all participants will receive a code via SMS or email that will allow them to access the priority delivery offer, the government said. \u201cThe Priority Home Delivery Service will help hundreds of thousands of NDIS participants across the country access everyday items through an option that removes personal health risks and great stress associated with going shopping in the current environment,\u201d government services minister Stuart Robert said. \u201cI thank those supermarkets for delivering this service as it will be a great help to hundreds of thousands of Australians and their families.\u201d Good morning. Thanks for joining our continuing coverage. We\u2019ll be with you all day. Just so you know what\u2019s coming up this morning: the ACTU secretary Sally McManus is the main interview on Insiders so we\u2019ll bring that to you in real time. And the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is scheduled to hold a press conference at 10.30am. The latest figures show 5,544 cases of Covid-19 across the country. The death toll stands at 30. There will be much more throughout the day \u2013 so stick with us if you can.",

Its intended run, from 13 February to 17 May, was curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, we are left with a handsome and well-illustrated catalog from Yale University Press.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/08/wilmingtons-lie-review-david-zucchino\">Wilmington's Lie review: race, outrage and the roots of modern inequality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In eight chapters, leading authorities discuss aspects of a nearly decade-long collaboration between the two men. As each is <a href=\"https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-hidden-sargent-39/\">thought to have been gay</a>, the studies raise an unanswered question: were they involved intimately? The catalogue also examines McKeller\u2019s invisibility in light of long-term and widespread demeaning depictions or outright erasures of black people in American art and media, in the service of white supremacy.</p> <p>In 1916, at 60, renowned as a portrait painter, Sargent approached the close of his life. In Boston, he undertook the second of three civic mural commissions, hoping to gain immortal fame by decorating the entrance halls of the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard\u2019s Widener Library.</p> <p>McKeller was 26 and had worked as a bellhop at Sargent\u2019s hotel. Possessed of a magnificent physique, he became the painter\u2019s preferred model.</p> <p>Sargent\u2019s projects were not without irony.

      "bodyText": "Boston\u2019s Apollo: Thomas McKeller and John Singer Sargent, an exhibition at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, was meant to examine a contradiction of race and visibility. Its intended run, from 13 February to 17 May, was curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. Fortunately, we are left with a handsome and well-illustrated catalog from Yale University Press. In eight chapters, leading authorities discuss aspects of a nearly decade-long collaboration between the two men. As each is thought to have been gay, the studies raise an unanswered question: were they involved intimately? The catalogue also examines McKeller\u2019s invisibility in light of long-term and widespread demeaning depictions or outright erasures of black people in American art and media, in the service of white supremacy. In 1916, at 60, renowned as a portrait painter, Sargent approached the close of his life. In Boston, he undertook the second of three civic mural commissions, hoping to gain immortal fame by decorating the entrance halls of the Museum of Fine Arts and Harvard\u2019s Widener Library. McKeller was 26 and had worked as a bellhop at Sargent\u2019s hotel. Possessed of a magnificent physique, he became the painter\u2019s preferred model. Sargent\u2019s projects were not without irony. Under Abbot Lawrence Lowell, Harvard was undergoing an inquisition to uncover and expel gays. The college president also wanted a quota for Jews, while the university barred black students from campus housing. Harvard would even, for 70 years, credit the library not to its black architect but to his white employer. Given all that, it is not surprising that in Sargent\u2019s finished work, McKeller was never depicted as himself. Among allegorical decorations, neither McKeller\u2019s kind eyes nor his placid face look back. Only his supple musculature is faithfully rendered. McKeller is sometimes older, he is intermittently younger, he is sometimes female and he is even divine. But he is always white. The sole exception is a remarkable portrait sketch, painted for the artist\u2019s pleasure over an unfinished image of a bird. Phantom wings make the man a superman. It is quite unlike anything else Sargent ever did. The Gardner is hardly unique in having few African Americans on its staff. For the Sargent-McKeller project, Catherine Morris, a member of the museum\u2019s education department, convened community consultants who saw to black scholars\u2019 inclusion. Helga Davis, visiting curator, conducted interviews with McKeller\u2019s last living relation, Deirdre McKeller O\u2019Bryant. She elicited a crucial bit of family lore. Tom McKeller was suspected to have been gay, and had a greater reason than simple terror to leave Wilmington, North Carolina, the site of a notorious massacre in 1898, and travel north to Boston.

In 1938, two new scenes \u2013 Exploitation of Labor and The Hoarding of Wealth by David Karfunkle \u2013 were installed in place of the original murals. They are still there but they are now censored in their turn, obscured by a heavy curtain, Karfunkle\u2019s representation of history including slavery and nudity having offended a black court worker. I discovered Ishigaki\u2019s ill-fated contribution to the courthouse by accident, during a decade-long quest for the identity of the artist who created a 50ft pantheon of notable \u201cNegroes\u201d not far away, at the Joe Louis Bar and Restaurant on 125th Street near Fifth Avenue. That building was designed by a black architect, Vertner Woodson Tandy, and inside and out it was sleekly modernistic.

      "body": "<p>Britain has been in lockdown for two weeks and it has been the grimmest of fortnights. The number of daily deaths from Covid-19 has continued to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/five-year-old-child-among-latest-uk-coronavirus-deaths\">rise steadily</a> and large chunks of the economy have been brought to a standstill.</p> <p>As yet, there are few hard numbers to judge the economic impact, but the collapse seen in the past few weeks is without precedent both in its speed and its severity. The increase in the numbers applying for universal credit suggest that unemployment is rising rapidly despite the government schemes to support both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak\">employed</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings\">self-employed</a>.</p> <p>The aim of the Treasury and the Bank of England is to get the UK through the crisis with a minimum of scarring. Hence there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans\">loan guarantees</a> designed to prevent businesses that were perfectly viable a month ago from going bust as a result of the shutdown. The hope is that wage subsidies will prevent workers from losing touch with the labour market and becoming long-term unemployed.</p> <p>But clearly the longer it takes to tackle the health emergency the greater the economic damage will be. A 20% drop in output in one quarter \u2013 a perfectly feasible possibility \u2013 would be bad enough, but what if the lockdown were extended into the summer or the autumn?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, said last week that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/01/lengthy-lockdown-unrealistic-says-former-bank-of-england-governor\">unrealistic</a> for the government to keep the lockdown in place indefinitely and that if it went on for months on end there would be a rebellion against it.</p> <p>That assessment is almost certainly right. The government does need an exit strategy but it is also being warned by epidemiologists that if the restrictions are relaxed too soon the virus could return. A second lockdown would not just be hugely unpopular, it would also magnify the economic damage.</p> <p>The government says any decisions it takes on ending the lockdown will be based on science, but the scientists don\u2019t always agree. That\u2019s because they are using models and these have limitations. Why? Because the results of epidemiological models depend on what is fed into them, and this requires the scientists to make a number of assumptions about human behaviour.</p> <p>This is a point made by Gerard Lyons and Paul Ormerod in <a href=\"http://www.algorithmiceconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ending_lockdown.pdf\">an important new paper</a> that might just offer the government the sort of exit strategy that King was talking about. </p> <p>Lyons and Ormerod do not dispute that a lockdown was necessary. Indeed, they think that the government\u2019s initial idea that the population would develop \u201cherd immunity\u201d to the virus was dangerous nonsense.</p> <p>The evidence from other countries is that social distancing, shutting the restaurants and bars, discouraging unnecessary travel and getting people to work from home if they can does have an impact.</p> <p>Before the lockdown began, estimates suggested that on average each person with the virus infected between two and 3.5 other people. Without action, the virus would have carried on spreading, putting intolerable pressure on the NHS and killing many more people. This is known as the reproduction number: if it is above one, someone who is infected will pass it on to more than one person. If it less than one, it will fade away. The experience of China and Italy is that lockdowns will get the reproduction number below one.</p> <p>But the danger is that the reproduction number could go back up again if Britain went straight back to business as usual the moment the lockdown restrictions were lifted. If people celebrated en masse by going to the pub, to the football or by having a street party, there would be risk that the reproduction number would go up again and the virus would return. It is this possibility that concerns the epidemiologists.</p> <p>Taken to extremes, this would involve continuing the lockdown until there was no longer a risk of someone with the virus infecting anyone else and so ensuring that no one dies. But as Lyons and Ormerod points out, a similar approach would involve the banning of all road traffic to prevent the nearly 2,000 deaths a year on the road in Britain.</p> <p>Instead, they suggest that the return to normal life takes place under a traffic light system that will exploit the fact that people are going to be a lot more cautious in their behaviour after the crisis than they were before.</p> <p>\u201cIf people revert very quickly to the patterns of behaviour before the crisis, the epidemiological models are correct. There would be a second wave of infections. But behaviour will be different, either because of the lessons people have learned during this crisis, or because of the constraints placed upon them by rules and regulations.\u201d</p> <p>The paper suggests that phase one of the process involves moving from lockdown to red. In this period, more but not all shops would open and they would have to observe the strict social distancing currently seen in supermarkets. Travel would be discouraged and many international flights banned.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the amber phase, unlimited car journeys would be allowed, and the wearing of face masks and disposable gloves would be mandatory on public transport. Restaurants would be allowed to open only if they had strict seating demarcations to keep people at a safe distance.</p> <p>It would only be when the light turned to green that any sort of sporting event or other mass gatherings, such as music festivals could take place, and the churches, temples and mosques open their doors.</p> <p>Inevitably there will be those with different views about what should be included in the red, amber and green phases. But it\u2019s worth noting that Lyons was once an adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. The prime minister might just be listening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain has been in lockdown for two weeks and it has been the grimmest of fortnights. The number of daily deaths from Covid-19 has continued to rise steadily and large chunks of the economy have been brought to a standstill. As yet, there are few hard numbers to judge the economic impact, but the collapse seen in the past few weeks is without precedent both in its speed and its severity. The increase in the numbers applying for universal credit suggest that unemployment is rising rapidly despite the government schemes to support both the employed and the self-employed. The aim of the Treasury and the Bank of England is to get the UK through the crisis with a minimum of scarring. Hence there are loan guarantees designed to prevent businesses that were perfectly viable a month ago from going bust as a result of the shutdown. The hope is that wage subsidies will prevent workers from losing touch with the labour market and becoming long-term unemployed. But clearly the longer it takes to tackle the health emergency the greater the economic damage will be. A 20% drop in output in one quarter \u2013 a perfectly feasible possibility \u2013 would be bad enough, but what if the lockdown were extended into the summer or the autumn? Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, said last week that it was unrealistic for the government to keep the lockdown in place indefinitely and that if it went on for months on end there would be a rebellion against it. That assessment is almost certainly right. The government does need an exit strategy but it is also being warned by epidemiologists that if the restrictions are relaxed too soon the virus could return. A second lockdown would not just be hugely unpopular, it would also magnify the economic damage. The government says any decisions it takes on ending the lockdown will be based on science, but the scientists don\u2019t always agree. That\u2019s because they are using models and these have limitations. Why? Because the results of epidemiological models depend on what is fed into them, and this requires the scientists to make a number of assumptions about human behaviour. This is a point made by Gerard Lyons and Paul Ormerod in an important new paper that might just offer the government the sort of exit strategy that King was talking about. Lyons and Ormerod do not dispute that a lockdown was necessary. Indeed, they think that the government\u2019s initial idea that the population would develop \u201cherd immunity\u201d to the virus was dangerous nonsense. The evidence from other countries is that social distancing, shutting the restaurants and bars, discouraging unnecessary travel and getting people to work from home if they can does have an impact. Before the lockdown began, estimates suggested that on average each person with the virus infected between two and 3.5 other people. Without action, the virus would have carried on spreading, putting intolerable pressure on the NHS and killing many more people. This is known as the reproduction number: if it is above one, someone who is infected will pass it on to more than one person. If it less than one, it will fade away. The experience of China and Italy is that lockdowns will get the reproduction number below one. But the danger is that the reproduction number could go back up again if Britain went straight back to business as usual the moment the lockdown restrictions were lifted. If people celebrated en masse by going to the pub, to the football or by having a street party, there would be risk that the reproduction number would go up again and the virus would return. It is this possibility that concerns the epidemiologists. Taken to extremes, this would involve continuing the lockdown until there was no longer a risk of someone with the virus infecting anyone else and so ensuring that no one dies. But as Lyons and Ormerod points out, a similar approach would involve the banning of all road traffic to prevent the nearly 2,000 deaths a year on the road in Britain. Instead, they suggest that the return to normal life takes place under a traffic light system that will exploit the fact that people are going to be a lot more cautious in their behaviour after the crisis than they were before. \u201cIf people revert very quickly to the patterns of behaviour before the crisis, the epidemiological models are correct. There would be a second wave of infections. But behaviour will be different, either because of the lessons people have learned during this crisis, or because of the constraints placed upon them by rules and regulations.\u201d The paper suggests that phase one of the process involves moving from lockdown to red. In this period, more but not all shops would open and they would have to observe the strict social distancing currently seen in supermarkets. Travel would be discouraged and many international flights banned. In the amber phase, unlimited car journeys would be allowed, and the wearing of face masks and disposable gloves would be mandatory on public transport. Restaurants would be allowed to open only if they had strict seating demarcations to keep people at a safe distance. It would only be when the light turned to green that any sort of sporting event or other mass gatherings, such as music festivals could take place, and the churches, temples and mosques open their doors. Inevitably there will be those with different views about what should be included in the red, amber and green phases. But it\u2019s worth noting that Lyons was once an adviser to Boris Johnson when he was mayor of London. The prime minister might just be listening.",

Despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has put off a full national security council (NSC) meeting on the Open Skies Treaty (OST), the secretary of defence, Mark Esper, and secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have agreed to proceed with a US exit, according to two sources familiar with administration planning. A statement of intent is expected soon, with a formal notification of withdrawal issued a few months later, possibly at the end of the fiscal year in September. The US would cease to be a party to the treaty six months after that, so if a new president were elected in November, the decision could be reversed before taking effect. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, reconnaissance flights under the treaty have been suspended until 26 April.

Russia imposed the limitation over Kaliningrad after a prolonged zigzagging Polish overflight in 2014 closed down aviation for a day. Russia allowed an extended flight over Kaliningrad in February. One of the reasons Esper has cited for US withdrawal is to save money by not replacing the two Boeing OC-135B planes the US uses for its Open Skies reconnaissance flights. Congress appropriated $41.5m last year for the cost of replacement but the Pentagon spending request published in February contained no budget for the new planes. Esper told Congress he was awaiting a decision from the president. Three Republican hawks in the Senate, Richard Burr, Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz, sent a letter to the administration in March calling for withdrawal, for cost and security reasons. \u201cThe costs of the OST go far beyond wasteful spending, and directly erode our national security by enabling Russian espionage over the United States,\u201d the senators wrote. Supporters of the Open Skies Treaty say the US and its allies benefit from it more than Russia, with three times more overflights of Russian territory than Russian flights over US and allied territory. Furthermore, US withdrawal would not stop Russian reconnaissance flights over US bases in Europe. \u201cThe administration has yet to put forward any proposals on how to fix the two main issues that we\u2019re having with the treaty, and our allies have reiterated again and again, that they do not want us to leave the treaty,\u201d said Alexandra Bell, a former state department arms control official and now senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. \u201cThe administration doesn\u2019t seem to have any plan of what to do about US bases in Europe.\u201d The Democratic senators Bob Menendez and Jack Reed wrote to the administration in February, saying: \u201cThe Open Skies Treaty is an important multilateral agreement that operates as a critical transparency tool for the United States and our allied treaty partners.

The UK and other Europeans sent emphatic appeals for the US to remain part of the agreement. Ukraine also publicly underlined the strategic importance it attaches to the treaty. But the administration has so far not shared the result of its survey with Congress.

The principals meeting was put off until 11 March and then postponed again, in the face of the pandemic. But the absence of an NSC discussion does not appear to have stopped the momentum for US withdrawal. The Open Skies Treaty is the latest arms control agreement to be targeted by the Trump administration, which has walked out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with Russia. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, said: \u201cAt a time when the need for international cooperation, couldn\u2019t be any more obvious, with respect to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, it is foreign policy malpractice for the Donald J Trump administration to withdraw from a treaty that has been in effect for nearly 30 years against the wishes of the United States closest allies in Europe.\u201d",

But he is also one of an estimated 29,000 people in healthcare occupations who rely on an Obama-era immigration policy to shield them from deportation, according to a forthcoming analysis from the Center for American Progress (Cap).</p> <p>Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, allows undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the United States as kids to work legally and live without the constant looming threat of immigration enforcement officers knocking on their doors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/01/trump-says-no-more-daca-deal-attacks-nafta\">Easter tirade: Trump attacks Nafta and says 'No more Daca deal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the supreme court considers whether to greenlight his and hundreds of thousands of other potential deportations during this global pandemic, Contreras believes that getting rid of so many healthcare workers and other talented individuals when the country desperately needs them doesn\u2019t make sense. </p> <p>\u201cFrom a heartfelt perspective, it\u2019s like, you know, betraying us despite all the things that we\u2019re doing. From a logical perspective, it\u2019s just counterintuitive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Many of these roughly <a href=\"https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/All%20Form%20Types/DACA/DACA_Population_Receipts_since_Injunction_Sep_30_2019.pdf\">650,000 young people </a>have grown up almost entirely in the US and are deeply rooted in their communities. Contreras, for example, moved to Texas when he was six years old and has lived in the Houston area for two decades.</p> <p>Daca has allowed more than 3,000 registered nurses, almost 5,000 nursing and home health aides and about 4,000 medical assistants to enter their professions, among other healthcare fields, Cap found. Nearly 200 of the program\u2019s beneficiaries are medical students, residents or physicians, according to the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-587/118129/20191004130646281_Brief%20for%20AAMC%20et%20al%20Supporting%20Respondents.pdf\">Association of American Medical Colleges</a> (AAMC).</p> <p>Donald Trump has been adamant about ending Daca, a goal that\u2019s been stalled for years because of drawn-out court battles that have finally landed in front of the supreme court. Now, the country\u2019s foremost justices are in the process of concluding whether the Trump administration can legally move forward <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/department-of-homeland-security-v-regents-of-the-university-of-california/\">with its </a><a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/department-of-homeland-security-v-regents-of-the-university-of-california/\">plans to rescind </a>the policy, or if that action is even judicially reviewable.</p> <p>Oral arguments took place in November. Their decision is due at any moment.</p> <p>Daniel, a 32-year-old registered nurse in New Jersey who asked to use only his first name because he feared retaliation at work, has sometimes worried about being able to financially support his loved ones if he could no longer renew Daca. His mom just lost her customer service job because of how the pandemic has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">ravaged the economy</a>, adding even more pressure.</p> <p>And yet he\u2019s soldiering on, working shifts in an intensive care unit, where he said the majority of patients are Covid-positive, intubated and ventilated.</p> <p>As he described what it\u2019s been like to treat people with Covid-19 \u2013 controlling their vital signs, increasing their oxygen, watching for frowns or other pain indicators \u2013 his voice is strained. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very sad.\u201d</p> <p>A lot of nurses and doctors are getting sick, he said. One of his fellow nurses told him she cried before her shift because they were shouldering too much work.</p> <p>Like other medical personnel, Daniel is worried about having to wear the same PPE for 12 hours and then saving it to potentially reuse in the future. And he is concerned that he\u2019ll bring the virus back home to his family.</p> <p>But unlike other medical personnel, he also has to think about the very real possibility that someday soon, he may not be able to do his job at all.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m in a career to help people,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut because of my immigration status, it just puts me in a limbo.\u201d</p> <p>Once US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) gets the go-ahead from the court, it intends to start deporting Dreamers,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/immigration-kushner-trump-dreamers.html\"> the agency\u2019s acting head said </a>earlier this year.</p> <p>\u201cI can only imagine what that must feel like, to be putting your life literally on the line for a country, and for the wellbeing of the residents of a country, that isn\u2019t, hasn\u2019t decided whether you\u2019re gonna be allowed to stay there,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.</p> <p>Without Daca, Dreamers will lose the protection that has let them \u201cbuild a life in the US\u201d, said Camila Bustos, a law student intern with the Jerome N Frank Legal Services Organization. And, though their wider contributions to society shouldn\u2019t trump their humanity, they will also lose their work authorization, she said.</p> <p>A hit of that magnitude to the country\u2019s healthcare workforce could be \u201cpotentially devastating\u201d, the AAMC argued even before Covid-19 came to the US. But especially in the context of a global pandemic, as states plead for more healthcare professionals to outfit overwhelmed hospitals, <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-589/139241/20200327101941772_2020%2003%2027%20Letter%20to%20Court%20for%2018-589.pdf\">attorneys and advocates are asking</a> the supreme court to consider their ruling\u2019s potential ramifications.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re saying, side with immigrant young people,\u201d said Bruna Sollod, communications director at United We Dream, an <a href=\"https://unitedwedream.org/about/\">immigrant youth-led organization</a>. \u201cSide with the folks who are on the frontlines of this.

      "bodyText": "Jesus Contreras tore into his breakfast sandwich after getting off a 24-hour shift as a paramedic in the Houston area of Texas. He had got maybe 15 minutes\u2019 sleep the night before. Contreras, 26, is on the frontline of the US response to the coronavirus pandemic, a health crisis of epic proportions. But he is also one of an estimated 29,000 people in healthcare occupations who rely on an Obama-era immigration policy to shield them from deportation, according to a forthcoming analysis from the Center for American Progress (Cap). Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or Daca, allows undocumented \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the United States as kids to work legally and live without the constant looming threat of immigration enforcement officers knocking on their doors. As the supreme court considers whether to greenlight his and hundreds of thousands of other potential deportations during this global pandemic, Contreras believes that getting rid of so many healthcare workers and other talented individuals when the country desperately needs them doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cFrom a heartfelt perspective, it\u2019s like, you know, betraying us despite all the things that we\u2019re doing. From a logical perspective, it\u2019s just counterintuitive,\u201d he said. Many of these roughly 650,000 young people have grown up almost entirely in the US and are deeply rooted in their communities. Contreras, for example, moved to Texas when he was six years old and has lived in the Houston area for two decades. Daca has allowed more than 3,000 registered nurses, almost 5,000 nursing and home health aides and about 4,000 medical assistants to enter their professions, among other healthcare fields, Cap found. Nearly 200 of the program\u2019s beneficiaries are medical students, residents or physicians, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). Donald Trump has been adamant about ending Daca, a goal that\u2019s been stalled for years because of drawn-out court battles that have finally landed in front of the supreme court. Now, the country\u2019s foremost justices are in the process of concluding whether the Trump administration can legally move forward with its plans to rescind the policy, or if that action is even judicially reviewable. Oral arguments took place in November. Their decision is due at any moment. Daniel, a 32-year-old registered nurse in New Jersey who asked to use only his first name because he feared retaliation at work, has sometimes worried about being able to financially support his loved ones if he could no longer renew Daca. His mom just lost her customer service job because of how the pandemic has ravaged the economy, adding even more pressure. And yet he\u2019s soldiering on, working shifts in an intensive care unit, where he said the majority of patients are Covid-positive, intubated and ventilated. As he described what it\u2019s been like to treat people with Covid-19 \u2013 controlling their vital signs, increasing their oxygen, watching for frowns or other pain indicators \u2013 his voice is strained. \u201cIt\u2019s tough,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s very sad.\u201d A lot of nurses and doctors are getting sick, he said. One of his fellow nurses told him she cried before her shift because they were shouldering too much work. Like other medical personnel, Daniel is worried about having to wear the same PPE for 12 hours and then saving it to potentially reuse in the future. And he is concerned that he\u2019ll bring the virus back home to his family. But unlike other medical personnel, he also has to think about the very real possibility that someday soon, he may not be able to do his job at all. \u201cI\u2019m in a career to help people,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cBut because of my immigration status, it just puts me in a limbo.\u201d Once US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) gets the go-ahead from the court, it intends to start deporting Dreamers, the agency\u2019s acting head said earlier this year. \u201cI can only imagine what that must feel like, to be putting your life literally on the line for a country, and for the wellbeing of the residents of a country, that isn\u2019t, hasn\u2019t decided whether you\u2019re gonna be allowed to stay there,\u201d said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. Without Daca, Dreamers will lose the protection that has let them \u201cbuild a life in the US\u201d, said Camila Bustos, a law student intern with the Jerome N Frank Legal Services Organization. And, though their wider contributions to society shouldn\u2019t trump their humanity, they will also lose their work authorization, she said. A hit of that magnitude to the country\u2019s healthcare workforce could be \u201cpotentially devastating\u201d, the AAMC argued even before Covid-19 came to the US. But especially in the context of a global pandemic, as states plead for more healthcare professionals to outfit overwhelmed hospitals, attorneys and advocates are asking the supreme court to consider their ruling\u2019s potential ramifications. \u201cWe\u2019re saying, side with immigrant young people,\u201d said Bruna Sollod, communications director at United We Dream, an immigrant youth-led organization. \u201cSide with the folks who are on the frontlines of this. Side with the folks who are hurting and really in danger of getting sick, in danger of losing their jobs. In danger of not providing for their families.\u201d",

Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-91.pdf\">Florida executive order 20-91</a> was published.

Returning to Tallahassee after visiting a coronavirus testing site in Miami and issuing a regional stay-at-home order for the state\u2019s four southernmost counties, he was preparing notes for an upcoming press conference and doubtless thinking about the birth of his third child. The beaches below him were not packed, as in the enduring images that will come to epitomize his lethargic response to the pandemic, but there were enough people milling about to alarm the elected leader of the only one of the \u201chotspot\u201d states \u2013 those with Covid-19 cases at that stage in excess of 5,000 \u2013 not to have imposed blanket stay-at-home restrictions. \u201cWere there people out there?

During that time, as the number of cases and fatalities grew, Florida\u2019s beaches remained open, thousands flocked to church services (in defiance of local rules) and carefree seniors in the country\u2019s fastest-growing retirement hub, The Villages, did what they always do: play golf. Offshore, cruise ships stricken with dead or infected crew and passengers waited, unsure if they would be allowed to dock. \u2018DeSantis took a leaf from the Trump playbook\u2019 Meanwhile, DeSantis appeared to fiddle while Florida burned.

It was all, in the words of Oscar Braynon, a state senator from Miami Gardens, \u201cthe dumbest shit I have heard in a long time\u201d. That Florida\u2019s governor has been in lockstep with the messaging and posturing from the White House at every step of the pandemic, up to and including this week\u2019s abrupt volte-face, was a given, at least to those who have followed the former US congressman\u2019s career in Tallahassee. DeSantis \u2013 hailed from the Rose Garden lectern as \u201ca great governor who knows exactly what he is doing\u201d \u2013 consults with Trump regularly and the two share a similar ideology. As Trump frequently and controversially called Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, DeSantis was also castigating outsiders, blaming New Yorkers for \u201cseeding\u201d the spread in Florida and dispatching the national guard to airports to intercept them. When the president mooted plans to classify counties by risk level, then last weekend floated the idea of a quarantine for New York, DeSantis gave his full support.

      "body": "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Spain records smallest percentage rise in infections since start of crisis</h2> <p>Spain\u2019s death toll has risen by 674 to 12,418 in the past 24 hours, according to figures that recorded the lowest number of victims in nine days. It is also the first time since 28 March that daily deaths have dropped below 800. The number of registered cases rose to 130,759 from 124,736, Spain\u2019s ministry said. The 5% rise in infections was the smallest increase since the start of the health crisis. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus infections meanwhile rose by 5,936 in the past 24 hours to 91,714 on Sunday, the third straight drop in the daily rate of new cases.</p> <h2>Global cases pass 1.2 million</h2> <p>The number of confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-global-cases-pass-12m-as-trump-warns-us-of-worse-to-come\">cases globally has passed 1.2m</a>, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. Just over one in four of these are in the US, which has<strong> </strong>311,544 cases. There have been 64,753 coronavirus-related deaths worldwide. The five countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases were the US, Spain, Italy, Germany and France. China, which is now at number six, reported 30 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, up from 19 a day earlier as the number of cases involving travellers from abroad as well as local transmissions increased.</p> <h2>Trump talks up unproven malaria drug</h2> <p>Donald Trump has directly urged Americans worried about Covid-19 to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-us-ventilators-new-york-trump-touts-unproven-cure-malaria-drug\">take a little-studied anti-malaria drug for the disease</a>, despite potentially serious side effects and a lack of data on safety and efficacy in treatment of the pandemic virus. The president also warned the US that the worst was yet to come, and that Americans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/05/there-will-be-a-lot-of-death-trump-warning-as-covid-19-cases-in-us-pass-300000-video\">would see \u201ca lot of death\u201d</a>. At a lengthy, rambling and combative briefing on Saturday afternoon, the president sought to discredit media reports of his administration\u2019s failures and called some outlets in the White House press corps \u201cfake news\u201d. Scientists around the world are looking for potential treatments but so far have not found a success.</p> <h2>Lombardy enacts law obliging citizens to wear face masks</h2> <p>Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst-affected by coronavirus, have enacted a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside. In the absence of a mask, people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses with a simple foulard or scarf\u201d, said Attilio Fontana, the president of Lombardy. <br>The law came as <a href=\"https://video.corriere.it/cronaca/coronavirus-napoli-tanta-gente-strada-la-spesa-ma-questa-quarantena/733d255c-7599-11ea-856e-f9aa62c97d7a\">images from major cities </a>including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days amid good weather.</p> <h2>Pandemic threatens survival of European Union, Spanish PM warns</h2> <p>The European Union\u2019s very survival is at stake and a new \u201cMarshall plan for Europe is needed\u201d to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies, Spain\u2019s prime minister has warned in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/europes-future-is-at-stake-in-this-war-against-coronavirus\">article published by the Guardian</a>. Europe must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said. A critical juncture had been reached at which even the most fervently pro-European countries and governments, as is Spain\u2019s case, needed real proof of commitment in the form of \u201cunwavering solidarity\u201d.</p> <h2>African economics face \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d if virus not controlled</h2> <p>Economies in some parts of Africa face a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d unless the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled, a senior UN official with responsibility for operations on the continent has said. Up to 50% of all projected job growth in Africa will be lost as aviation, services, exports, mining, agriculture and the informal sector all take a hit, according to Ahunna Eziakonwa, the United Nations Development Program regional director for Africa. She told Associated Press: \u201cWe will see a complete collapse of economies and livelihoods. Livelihoods will be wiped out in a way we have never seen before.\u201d</p> <h2>First case recorded in South Sudan as Iran puts death toll at 3,603</h2> <p>South Sudan, one of the world\u2019s poorest states where decades of war and hunger have already devastated infrastructure, has become one of the latest states to record a confirmed case of Covid-19. The case was a 29-year-old woman who arrived in February from the Netherlands, via Ethiopia. Elsewhere, Iran said Covid-19 infections stood at 58,226 while the death toll from the outbreak was 3,603.</p> <h2>Outdoor exercise could be banned if rules flouted, Britons warned</h2> <p>Outdoor exercise <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/matt-hancock-warns-tougher-uk-lockdown-too-many-break-rules\">could be banned in Britain</a> if people flout the social distancing rules, the UK\u2019s health minister has warned. Matt Hancock said sunbathing in public spaces was against the government guidance, and told those who dared to disobey that they were putting their own and others\u2019 lives at risk. His warning came ahead of a televised address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/queen-to-make-personal-tv-address-to-the-nation-on-sunday\">by the Queen</a>, who was expected to praise Britain for its \u201cself-discipline\u201d and \u201cresolve\u201d during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Australian authorities cautiously optimistic</h2> <p>Health authorities in Australia have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/health-officials-hopeful-australia-is-flattening-coronavirus-curve-but-warn-against-complacency\">expressed cautious optimism</a> that the country may be able to limit its domestic outbreak, as the nation\u2019s death toll reached 34. However, senior officials have warned against complacency or relaxing social distancing rules too early, saying that could lead to a resurgence in cases. The government has also warned its citizens that imported \u201chome\u201d Covid-19 test kits pose a serious risk to public health. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said the kits were not reliable and could lead to people failing to isolate themselves or seek the medical help they need.</p> <h2>Criminal investigation launched into handling of cruise ship</h2> <p>A criminal investigation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster\">is to be launched</a> into the disastrous handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which has become the single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia, the NSW police commissioner said on Sunday. Mike Fuller announced the move as it was revealed four more passengers from the ill-fated ship have died \u2013 bringing the total to 11, and accounting for more than 30% of all Australian Covid-19 deaths. The Ruby Princess has been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/04/nsw-health-minister-defends-experts-who-handled-ruby-princess-coronavirus-outbreak\">focus of intense criticism</a> since its 2,700 passengers were allowed to freely disembark in Sydney on 19 March, despite passengers onboard showing signs of respiratory illnesses.</p>",

      "body": "<p>With countries on lockdown and millions being made to stay at home, it\u2019s unsurprising many couples and single people are wondering what coronavirus means for their sex lives. With this in mind, we asked three experts five of the most pressing questions about intimacy during the pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Is Covid-19 sexually transmissible?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Jessica Justman: </strong>We\u2019re not seeing patterns that indicate sexual transmission. It\u2019s primarily spread through respiratory droplets. And touching contaminated surfaces is thought to be the secondary mode of transmission.</p> <p><strong>Dr Carlos Rodr\u00edguez-D\u00edaz: </strong>There is no evidence that the Covid-19 can be transmitted via either vaginal or anal intercourse. However, kissing is a very common practice during sexual intercourse, and the virus can be transmitted via saliva. Therefore, the virus can be transmitted by kissing. There is also evidence of oral-fecal transmission of the Covid-19 and that implies that analingus may represent a risk for infection.</p> <h2><strong>So is it OK to have sex?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Justman: </strong>If you or your partner is a Covid-19 case, the advice is to steer clear of each other as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>Dr Julia Marcus: </strong>But for people who don\u2019t have symptoms and don\u2019t have any recent likely exposure and have been staying close to home, I think that, if it\u2019s within your own household, it\u2019s a different story. If you live with a regular sexual partner and you don\u2019t have any symptoms, or likely exposure, sex might actually be a really great way to have fun, stay connected and relieve anxiety during this potentially stressful time.</p> <h2><strong>What about new partners?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Marcus:</strong> The recommendation right now is that we try to stay home as much as we can and really only interact with people for things that are essential, like groceries.

      "body": "<p>Last week, Boris Johnson stood on a set of stairs inside 10 Downing Street and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1244339182690066433\">spoke into a smartphone camera</a>. Towards the end of a two-and-half minute monologue about Covid-19 and the national response to it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/20000-nhs-staff-return-to-service-johnson-says-from-coronavirus-isolation\">he said something striking</a>: \u201cOne thing I think [the] coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.\u201d</p> \n<p>The words, if anyone missed the reference, were an allusion to an <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/no-such-thing-society\">infamous few sentences</a> from Margaret Thatcher, published in an interview in Woman\u2019s Own magazine in 1987: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to cope with it \u2026 They\u2019re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.\u201d</p> \n<p>Though Johnson may well have cited what she said to create a useful distraction among political journalists, what he said nonetheless highlighted something undeniable: that Conservative politicians used to following Thatcher\u2019s example are suddenly having to behave in ways that will be causing some of them no end of unease.</p> \n<p>In the spectacle of the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s huge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/rishi-sunak-budget-2020-spending-spree-investment-productivity\">economic interventions</a> and the government\u2019s sudden veneration of the public sector, you can discern Tory shibboleths being suddenly thrown overboard. But things are perhaps more complicated than they appear. Coronavirus will force shifts in policy of a scale no Tory politician would ever have foreseen, but they also chime with underrated things that have been present in post-Thatcher Conservatism for years. When David Cameron was in charge, there were periodic fits of interest in a more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/feb/25/conservatives-workers-party-rebrand\">socially minded Toryism</a>, and the idea of the Conservatives somehow becoming a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d. Before she was waylaid by Brexit, Theresa May spoke about the need for an activist state. Just before the arrival of Covid-19, when all the talk was of big infrastructure projects and helping places in the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/17/red-wall-labour-south\">red wall</a>\u201d, cabinet ministers were doing much the same.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/05/britain-boris-johnson-crisis-covid-19-pandemic-escalated-worse-leader\">Trust is essential in these times. But Boris Johnson is not a man to be trusted</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of course austerity went on, inequalities were still ignored, and our exit from the EU quickly proved to be a huge distraction from the dire state of our social fabric. But in the midst of a sudden, unprecedented crisis, that is not quite the point. What matters right now is that much of the political groundwork has been done for Johnson and his allies to move away from free-market dogma, and in any case, they have no choice.</p> \n<p>As and when we start to emerge from the coronavirus period, I would imagine we will be hearing a great deal about a new kind of Conservatism, and the supposed end of a Tory approach to governing that lasted 40 long years, from 1979 to 2019. This may not be nearly as benign as it might sound: from increased surveillance to the closing of national borders, there are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/28/we-must-take-drastic-action-but-lets-not-turn-into-a-nation-of-little-tyrants\">things</a> lurking in this moment that play to the authoritarian part of the Tory soul, and they need to be closely watched. But make no mistake: a new political common sense will emerge from the crisis, and it will surely mark the start of a different era.</p> \n<p>Two days after the close of the Labour leadership contest, where does that leave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">Keir Starmer</a>? To some extent, the huge shift in Tory thinking will be helpful: if Ed Miliband\u2019s attempts to shift debate after the 2008 crash were always stifled by the tyranny of austerity, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s push left was stymied by basic unelectability,in times like these, a halfway competent Labour leader ought to be able to make the case for ambitious social democracy. That said, Starmer will have to avoid politicking for its own sake and the dire kind of \u201cthis proves me right\u201d stuff <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52048213\">recently attempted by his predecessor</a>. For now, some of his job will come down to calmly pointing out the inevitable gaps between the Conservatives\u2019 words and realities on the ground, and keeping a close eye on both the government\u2019s propensity for incompetence, and Covid-19\u2019s more sinister consequences. He ought to be good at those things; it would be strange if he were not.</p> \n<p>But there is another, altogether more onerous challenge. One big thing is lacking from the government\u2019s relationship with Britain, and it is time this was pointed out. Whatever its policy shifts, the Johnson administration has so far failed to speak to the country as a national community, and invoke a convincing idea of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d.</p> \n<p>One of the great political tragedies of the last decade or so was the way people on the right were allowed to run away with ideas about the United Kingdom \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly, England \u2013 and frame them in terms of a crabby, inward-looking set of prejudices. In the hands of so many Brexiteers, \u201cwe\u201d became synonymous with a monocultural notion of \u201cthe people\u201d, and patriotism was held to be the exclusive property of their own tribe.</p> \n<p>The left, particularly under Corbyn, did what it usually does, and for fear of having to come up with ideas of belonging and nationhood that could include diversity and openness, vacated the pitch.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Boris Johnson stood on a set of stairs inside 10 Downing Street and spoke into a smartphone camera. Towards the end of a two-and-half minute monologue about Covid-19 and the national response to it, he said something striking: \u201cOne thing I think [the] coronavirus crisis has already proved is that there really is such a thing as society.\u201d The words, if anyone missed the reference, were an allusion to an infamous few sentences from Margaret Thatcher, published in an interview in Woman\u2019s Own magazine in 1987: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem, it\u2019s the government\u2019s job to cope with it \u2026 They\u2019re casting their problem on society. And, you know, there is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women, and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people, and people must look to themselves first.\u201d Though Johnson may well have cited what she said to create a useful distraction among political journalists, what he said nonetheless highlighted something undeniable: that Conservative politicians used to following Thatcher\u2019s example are suddenly having to behave in ways that will be causing some of them no end of unease. In the spectacle of the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s huge economic interventions and the government\u2019s sudden veneration of the public sector, you can discern Tory shibboleths being suddenly thrown overboard. But things are perhaps more complicated than they appear. Coronavirus will force shifts in policy of a scale no Tory politician would ever have foreseen, but they also chime with underrated things that have been present in post-Thatcher Conservatism for years. When David Cameron was in charge, there were periodic fits of interest in a more socially minded Toryism, and the idea of the Conservatives somehow becoming a \u201cworkers\u2019 party\u201d. Before she was waylaid by Brexit, Theresa May spoke about the need for an activist state. Just before the arrival of Covid-19, when all the talk was of big infrastructure projects and helping places in the so-called \u201cred wall\u201d, cabinet ministers were doing much the same. Of course austerity went on, inequalities were still ignored, and our exit from the EU quickly proved to be a huge distraction from the dire state of our social fabric. But in the midst of a sudden, unprecedented crisis, that is not quite the point. What matters right now is that much of the political groundwork has been done for Johnson and his allies to move away from free-market dogma, and in any case, they have no choice. As and when we start to emerge from the coronavirus period, I would imagine we will be hearing a great deal about a new kind of Conservatism, and the supposed end of a Tory approach to governing that lasted 40 long years, from 1979 to 2019. This may not be nearly as benign as it might sound: from increased surveillance to the closing of national borders, there are things lurking in this moment that play to the authoritarian part of the Tory soul, and they need to be closely watched. But make no mistake: a new political common sense will emerge from the crisis, and it will surely mark the start of a different era. Two days after the close of the Labour leadership contest, where does that leave Keir Starmer? To some extent, the huge shift in Tory thinking will be helpful: if Ed Miliband\u2019s attempts to shift debate after the 2008 crash were always stifled by the tyranny of austerity, and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s push left was stymied by basic unelectability,in times like these, a halfway competent Labour leader ought to be able to make the case for ambitious social democracy. That said, Starmer will have to avoid politicking for its own sake and the dire kind of \u201cthis proves me right\u201d stuff recently attempted by his predecessor. For now, some of his job will come down to calmly pointing out the inevitable gaps between the Conservatives\u2019 words and realities on the ground, and keeping a close eye on both the government\u2019s propensity for incompetence, and Covid-19\u2019s more sinister consequences. He ought to be good at those things; it would be strange if he were not. But there is another, altogether more onerous challenge. One big thing is lacking from the government\u2019s relationship with Britain, and it is time this was pointed out. Whatever its policy shifts, the Johnson administration has so far failed to speak to the country as a national community, and invoke a convincing idea of \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d. One of the great political tragedies of the last decade or so was the way people on the right were allowed to run away with ideas about the United Kingdom \u2013 and, perhaps more importantly, England \u2013 and frame them in terms of a crabby, inward-looking set of prejudices. In the hands of so many Brexiteers, \u201cwe\u201d became synonymous with a monocultural notion of \u201cthe people\u201d, and patriotism was held to be the exclusive property of their own tribe. The left, particularly under Corbyn, did what it usually does, and for fear of having to come up with ideas of belonging and nationhood that could include diversity and openness, vacated the pitch. The right, meanwhile, developed the kind of nasty, polarising, warlike vocabulary, such as \u201csurrender\u201d, and all that stuff, which the prime minister used throughout his opening months in the job. This, coupled with his libertarian mistrust of the state, means Johnson is now doing things that clash with his most basic instincts, which is why he has not seemed able to speak to the country as a whole. In an age of mass scepticism and irreverence, and with the UK drifting apart, perhaps no politician could convincingly adopt the mantle of a national leader. There again, there is a collective, communitarian spirit woven through this awful crisis \u2013 and if politics is to meaningfully speak to us, sooner or later, that spirit will demand to be voiced by people who are either in high office, or who aspire to it. Aspects of our national life are suddenly in the foreground \u2013 from the NHS, through all those low-paid key workers, to spontaneous community initiatives that transcend most of the social divides we were told were insurmountable. If the Conservatives cannot turn them into a national story, someone else should at least try \u2013 not for immediate electoral gain, but for two other reasons. In the short-term, it could help many of us to get out of bed every morning and face the day. Looking further ahead, it might start to map out what kind of country we might become when the horrors of the coronavirus begin to recede. On the evidence of the past few months, Starmer may be too bloodless and cautious a politician to pull this off. Maybe his remainer convictions, and widespread mistrust of his party, will deny him a big enough audience. But in the speech released as his victory was announced, there were at least hints of what the moment requires: the elegant recognition that in the midst of the crisis, \u201ctoo many will have given too much\u201d and \u201csome of us will have lost too much\u201d; the unanswerable claim that \u201cwe know, in our hearts, [that] things are going to have to change.\u201d \u201cSo many volunteering for the NHS, millions of people doing their bit to stop this virus and to save lives,\u201d he said. \u201cOur willingness to come together like this as a nation has been lying dormant for too long.\u201d With modesty and humility at first, he needs to develop this voice.

But Swedes are still able to shop, go to restaurants, get haircuts and send children under 16 to class.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sweden reported a total of 401 deaths so far from Covid-19, up 8% from Saturday and greater than the totals of its three Nordic neighbours combined.

Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tegnell acknowledged last week that Sweden\u2019s infection curve was \u201cstarting to become somewhat steeper\u201d but insisted that overall it was still \u201cfairly flat\u201d. Amid a sharp rise in cases in Stockholm, however, the capital is soon to open a field hospital with 140 beds, rising eventually to 600, in a convention centre.</p> \n<p>There are also growing concerns for the country\u2019s older population after a third of Sweden\u2019s municipalities reported confirmed or suspected cases of the virus in nursing homes, where distressed staff have warned publicly of a lack of protective equipment. One third of Stockholm\u2019s nursing homes are affected.</p> \n<p>Although Sweden has closed senior high schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has preferred to rely on Swedes\u2019 sense of civic responsibility, asking rather than ordering them to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and to stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill.</p> \n<p>\u201cEveryone is responsible for their own wellbeing, for their neighbours\u2019 and for their own local community,\u201d the foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week. \u201cThis applies in a normal situation and it applies in a crisis situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The approach has so far proved popular among voters, with 44% of respondents in a survey published last week saying they trusted L\u00f6fven, compared with 26% in February.

      "bodyText": "Sweden\u2019s government is drawing up new legislation to allow it to take \u201cextraordinary steps\u201d to combat Covid-19, local media have reported, amid concern that its relatively soft approach may be leading to a higher death rate than in other Nordic countries. Denmark and Norway are among the many countries to have imposed tough lockdowns, closing borders and shutting schools and non-essential stores, and Finland has isolated its main urban area around Helsinki. But Swedes are still able to shop, go to restaurants, get haircuts and send children under 16 to class. On Sunday Sweden reported a total of 401 deaths so far from Covid-19, up 8% from Saturday and greater than the totals of its three Nordic neighbours combined. Sweden\u2019s toll per million inhabitants is 37, compared with 28 in Denmark, 12 in Norway and 4.5 in Finland. The state broadcaster SVT said on Sunday that after an outcry by opposition parties, the Social Democrat-led government had abandoned plans reported earlier in the weekend to rule by decree, bypassing MPs. Under legislation to be tabled next week, the Riksdag, Sweden\u2019s parliament, will now be consulted before the government takes any new emergency steps such as shutting airportsor train and bus stations, closing shops and restaurants, further limiting public gatherings or requisitioning medical equipment, according to SVT. Anders Tegnell, Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, has described the country\u2019s coronavirus strategy as an attempt to ensure \u201ca slow spread of infection and that the health services are not overwhelmed\u201d, arguing that it is important for a part of the population to acquire immunity. Tegnell has denied trying to build rapid \u201cherd immunity\u201d to the virus, a strategy originally adopted by the UK and the Netherlands before projected soaring death numbers prompted those countries to change course, but he has conceded that such a policy is \u201cnot contradictory\u201d to Sweden\u2019s objectives. \u201cIt is important to have a policy that can be sustained over a longer period, meaning staying home if you are sick,\u201d he said recently. \u201cLocking people up at home won\u2019t work in the longer term. Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway.\u201d Tegnell acknowledged last week that Sweden\u2019s infection curve was \u201cstarting to become somewhat steeper\u201d but insisted that overall it was still \u201cfairly flat\u201d. Amid a sharp rise in cases in Stockholm, however, the capital is soon to open a field hospital with 140 beds, rising eventually to 600, in a convention centre. There are also growing concerns for the country\u2019s older population after a third of Sweden\u2019s municipalities reported confirmed or suspected cases of the virus in nursing homes, where distressed staff have warned publicly of a lack of protective equipment. One third of Stockholm\u2019s nursing homes are affected. Although Sweden has closed senior high schools and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, the prime minister, Stefan L\u00f6fven, has preferred to rely on Swedes\u2019 sense of civic responsibility, asking rather than ordering them to avoid non-essential travel, to work from home and to stay indoors if they are over 70 or are feeling ill. \u201cEveryone is responsible for their own wellbeing, for their neighbours\u2019 and for their own local community,\u201d the foreign minister, Ann Linde, said last week. \u201cThis applies in a normal situation and it applies in a crisis situation.\u201d The approach has so far proved popular among voters, with 44% of respondents in a survey published last week saying they trusted L\u00f6fven, compared with 26% in February. But while Stockholm is estimated to be 70% less busy than usual, an analysis of smartphone location data showed that while visits to public places had fallen steeply in most European countries, Sweden was bucking the trend. The strategy has come under increasingly heavy fire from some of the country\u2019s health experts. Stefan Hanson, a Swedish infectious diseases expert, said the situation was not lost in the whole country, with large parts of the south and north so far displaying low infections rates. \u201cBut in Stockholm it is fast becoming critical,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cThere is a real risk now that cases will rise so high that the hospitals cannot cope. Treatment choices are already having to be made by biological age.\u201d He said this was due to a \u201cvery confused and unclear policy, with no clear objectives beyond trying to protect the over-70s and imposing some rather mild physical distancing measures.\u201d Cecilia S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r, a professor of microbial pathogenesis and one of about 2,300 academics to sign an open letter to the government at the end of last month calling for tougher measures to protect the healthcare system, said the government had \u201cno choice\u201d and should now lock down Stockholm. \u201cWe must establish control over the situation; we cannot head into a situation where we get complete chaos,\u201d S\u00f6derberg-Naucl\u00e9r said. \u201cNo one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?\u201d Sten Linnarsson, a professor at Sweden\u2019s Karolinska Institute, said the concern was that \u201cthere is really a lack of scientific evidence being put forward for these policies\u201d.

ITV and Sky, which have more diversified income from TV production and pay subscriptions, are on track for declines of 37% and 34%, respectively. ITV has said that by year-end each 1% decline in advertising revenue it fails to recover post-coronavirus will reduce revenue and profit by \u00a317m.",

      "bodyText": "The survival of the European Union is at stake as the continent weathers its worst crisis since the second world war, Spain\u2019s prime minister has said, calling on Europe to implement its own Marshall plan to rebuild the continent\u2019s economies. In an article published by the Guardian and nine newspapers across the continent, Pedro S\u00e1nchez said failure to act in solidarity could imperil the union\u2019s future. Meanwhile, the number of daily deaths in Spain dropped significantly, raising hopes the Covid-19 epidemic there is peaking. European leaders have clashed in recent weeks over how to respond to the economic shock of the crisis, exposing deep faultlines as countries such as Italy, France and Spain accuse other member states of being too timid in their response. S\u00e1nchez wrote: \u201cEurope must build a wartime economy and promote European resistance, reconstruction and recovery. Europe was born out of the ashes of destruction and conflict. It learned the lessons of history and understood something very simple: if we don\u2019t all win, in the end, we all lose.\u201d He reiterated his call for so-called \u201ccoronabonds\u201d, or EU-backed debt instruments, as well as a European Marshall plan of massive public investments. There are signs that the coronavirus may be beginning to loosen its grip on Spain and Italy, Europe\u2019s hardest-hit countries in the pandemic. Spain reported 674 deaths in the past 24 hours, the lowest daily toll since 26 March. The virus has claimed 12,418 lives in the country, and the number of confirmed cases is now 130,759, according to data from the health ministry published on Sunday. The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to about 5% \u2013 the smallest increase since officials began tracking the outbreak. While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted that the figures hinted at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra from Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d In Italy, the number of deaths has passed the 15,000 mark.

Several thousand people, including students and restaurant and bar workers laid off because of the coronavirus outbreak, have taken low-paid fruit-picking jobs in Tayside and Fife normally done by seasonal workers from Bulgaria and Romania. Farmers across the UK have said fruit and vegetable harvests are threatened by lockdown measures that have prevented tens of thousands of workers from flying in from eastern Europe for the picking season. Recruitment agencies have proposed chartering special flights to bring in workers from the continent, but in Tayside most vacancies have been filled by locals after an urgent appeal from farmers to fill 3,200 vacancies. James Porter, a fruit farmer who helps run Angus Growers, an organisation with members in Angus, Perthshire and Fife, said most of the 19 farms that took part in the appeal had filled all their vacancies. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a big response,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very encouraging and it gives me a bit of hope we might still be harvesting our crops.\u201d Many were students whose university courses had stopped and who normally had summer jobs.

Picking for the first crops would start in two weeks, Porter said, and picking for berries grown in heated tunnels had already begun. Picking would accelerate in May and peak from June onwards.

      "body": "<p>Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst affected by coronavirus, have introduced a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside, while Spain is considering recommending the public wear masks.</p> <p>As the number of confirmed infections globally <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">passed the 1.2m mark</a> officials around the world appeared to be making a U-turn on whether the public should wear masks, despite huge shortages.</p> <p>The calls came as a senior US health official braced the country for a coming week of deaths that would rival \u201c9/11 or Pearl Harbor\u201d in their impact on the nation\u2019s psyche.</p> <p>US surgeon general Jerome Adams warned: \u201cThis is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans lives, quite frankly.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it\u2019s not going to be localised \u2026 It\u2019s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Spain was mulling the new recommendation on masks as the country reported 674 <a href=\"https://elpais.com/sociedad/2020-04-05/acusada-caida-de-las-muertes-por-coronavirus-pero-aumento-de-los-ingresados-en-uci.html\">new deaths from coronavirus,</a> 135 fewer than in the previous 24 hours and its lowest number in 10 days.

      "bodyText": "Authorities in Lombardy, the Italian region worst affected by coronavirus, have introduced a law obliging citizens to wear face masks when they go outside, while Spain is considering recommending the public wear masks. As the number of confirmed infections globally passed the 1.2m mark officials around the world appeared to be making a U-turn on whether the public should wear masks, despite huge shortages. The calls came as a senior US health official braced the country for a coming week of deaths that would rival \u201c9/11 or Pearl Harbor\u201d in their impact on the nation\u2019s psyche. US surgeon general Jerome Adams warned: \u201cThis is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans lives, quite frankly. \u201cThis is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it\u2019s not going to be localised \u2026 It\u2019s going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.\u201d Spain was mulling the new recommendation on masks as the country reported 674 new deaths from coronavirus, 135 fewer than in the previous 24 hours and its lowest number in 10 days. Infections rose by 5%, the smallest increase since the epidemic hit. Italy also saw a significant decline in both deaths and the rate of increase of new cases on Sunday. The 525 new coronavirus deaths announced were the lowest in the last two weeks, and well down from the record high of 969 on 27 March. The number of new confirmed cases increased by 2,972, a 3.3% rise compared to Saturday, but almost half the number of new cases recorded on 20 March. Previously, countries had followed international health recommendations that suggested masks offered little protection and if not regularly replaced could increase the risk of infection. More recently, however, following the example in some Asian countries, some experts have suggested that covering the nose and mouth may be useful in stopping the spread of the disease. Lombardy\u2019s president, Attilio Fontana, announcing the new law there, said people should \u201ccover their mouths and noses\u201d with a simple scarf, saying it would help \u201cprevent you from spreading the virus if you happen to be a carrier\u201d. Images from cities including Rome, Naples, Milan and Turin showed an increase in the number of people venturing out in recent days in the good weather. The Lombardy law will be in place at least until 13 April, when Italy\u2019s lockdown is due to expire. On Friday Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, suggested the government would \u201cprobably\u201d recommend the wearing of masks, though in many places they are almost impossible to find. Protective masks \u2013 both the specialised air-tight versions required by healthcare workers and the more basic surgical versions \u2013 are in desperately short supply around the globe and have become the subject of bidding wars between countries.

      "bodyText": "Authorities in Ecuador\u2019s biggest city are distributing thousands of cardboard coffins and have created a helpline for families who need corpses to be removed from their homes. Guayaquil has emerged as a regional hotspot for coronavirus, and hospitals and mortuaries have been overwhelmed, forcing some families to store bodies at home. \u201cIt looks like a war zone hospital. The things we have seen are straight out of a horror film,\u201d a doctor at the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo hospital, one of the city\u2019s biggest facilities, told the Guardian. \u201cMy wife doesn\u2019t want me to go to work. But if I don\u2019t, more patients will die.\u201d On Saturday Ecuador\u2019s health ministry said it had registered 172 Covid-19 deaths, 122 of them in Guayas province, of which Guayaquil is the capital. Low testing rates mean the true figure is almost certainly higher. Ecuador has officially registered 3,465 coronavirus cases, the third highest number in South America after Brazil and Chile. One regional politician, Carlos Luis Morales, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that officials had been instructed not to divulge statistics about the death toll in Guayas. But he added: \u201cJust to give you an idea, 480 death certificates have been issued since yesterday; 150 bodies are being collected each day.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, has said up to 3,500 people could die in Guayas in the coming weeks, while Guayaquil\u2019s city hall said on Saturday that it would hand out 2,000 cardboard coffins \u201cto offer a dignified burial to those who die during this health emergency\u201d. Jorge Wated, the official leading Guayaquil\u2019s response to the crisis, announced a WhatsApp hotline for victims. \u201cAttention: those who require the removal of the deceased from their homes can write to us on this number,\u201d he tweeted. Ecuador\u2019s government has faced criticism for its response to coronavirus and failure to effectively enforce a quarantine in Guayaquil as the infection spread. \u201cWhen the virus appeared in China, we thought it would never reach here,\u201d Morales told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol. \u201cNow it\u2019s in all of us. We are breathing it. It\u2019s in the atmosphere.\u201d Ecuador\u2019s vice-president, Otto Sonnenholzner, offered a televised apology to the nation on Saturday for the gruesome images coming out of Guayaquil showing corpses dumped on pavements or outside homes. \u201cI give you my word that I am doing everything in my power to save the greatest number of lives possible,\u201d Sonnenholzner said. \u201cThis crisis isn\u2019t about left or right. Rich or poor. This virus doesn\u2019t care for religion, race or social status. All it seeks to do is spread. Its transmission risk is something never before seen by humanity.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>My dad\u2019s latest contribution to the family WhatsApp group was a meme. One that he\u2019d forwarded, possibly from another dad. It\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DonCheadle/status/1242183825666404353?s=20\">an illustration</a> of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, walking side by side, with the caption: \u201cBack the fuck up Piglet.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not that the global pandemic has caused my 64-year-old father to discover memes; it\u2019s more that he\u2019s now come to truly appreciate them. He tells me he has \u201c20 coming in a day, from various sources\u201d. Like a meme sommelier, he\u2019s become very selective about which ones he forwards to the family thread. And his taste isn\u2019t bad. A little schlocky at times, but surprisingly acceptable for someone of a generation whose online presence is largely defined by jpegs of inspirational quotes and below-the-line bigotry. The overflow he sends to my uncle. I imagine the two of them pinging each other the latest corona content, in a sort of quarantined baby-boomer version of tennis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-collabs-the-social-media-games-entertaining-the-masses-and-bringing-us-together\">Coronavirus collabs: the social media games entertaining the masses \u2013 and bringing us together</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got time,\u201d he says, when I ask him why his generation is getting so into memes. My dad isn\u2019t retired, and he\u2019s one of the busiest people I know. So I\u2019m not sure how this applies to him. I wonder if you become more present as you get older \u2013 and maybe seem<em> </em>to have more time. Is he living out these \u201cstrange times\u201d in a zen state, contemplating each new meme like a teaching of the Dalai Lama?</p> <p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/royals-ministers-or-even-boy-george-houseparty-isolation-app-coronavirus\">Houseparty</a>.\u201d</p> <p>In these times of crisis, I\u2019d rather have this irreverent sort of dad than the \u201chysterically blaming coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/report-coronavirus-quack-cures-immediately-says-uk-government\">on 5G</a>\u201d kind. Although <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/covid19-railroad-tankcar/\">that picture</a> of a train car marked \u201cCovid-19\u201d <em>did</em> somehow make its way onto the family thread. Tweets about parents spreading fake news about how to cure Covid-19 have become a meme in themselves. Like a virus within a virus are the screenshots of mums telling their adult kids to binge-eat garlic, huff bleach or \u2013 according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/temmyoseni73/status/1242237966745042945\">one viral tweet</a> \u2013 \u201cput an onion in the corner of every room in the house\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum has a PhD on coronavirus from WhatsApp university,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brownandboujiee/status/1242125087886761987\">tweeted</a> one user. Variations on this joke have now been posted by hundreds of other Twitter users.</p> <p>Another character to have emerged is the protective yet slightly deranged mama bear, yell-typing at her cubs to batten down the hatches and listen up because her friend Maureen from Zumba wrote a very compelling Facebook post on the healing power of dishwasher salt. But it\u2019s not just the \u201cgullible mums\u201d disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line <em>\u00c0 m\u00e9diter</em>, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2020/03/24/paolo-giordano-je-ne-veux-pas-passer-a-cote-de-ce-que-l-epidemie-nous-devoile-de-nous-memes_6034192_3232.html\">originally appeared</a> in Le Monde. My French isn\u2019t good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it\u2019s deeply existential.)</p> <p>There appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three.

      "bodyText": "My dad\u2019s latest contribution to the family WhatsApp group was a meme. One that he\u2019d forwarded, possibly from another dad. It\u2019s an illustration of Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, walking side by side, with the caption: \u201cBack the fuck up Piglet.\u201d It\u2019s not that the global pandemic has caused my 64-year-old father to discover memes; it\u2019s more that he\u2019s now come to truly appreciate them. He tells me he has \u201c20 coming in a day, from various sources\u201d. Like a meme sommelier, he\u2019s become very selective about which ones he forwards to the family thread. And his taste isn\u2019t bad. A little schlocky at times, but surprisingly acceptable for someone of a generation whose online presence is largely defined by jpegs of inspirational quotes and below-the-line bigotry. The overflow he sends to my uncle. I imagine the two of them pinging each other the latest corona content, in a sort of quarantined baby-boomer version of tennis. \u201cWe\u2019ve got time,\u201d he says, when I ask him why his generation is getting so into memes. My dad isn\u2019t retired, and he\u2019s one of the busiest people I know. So I\u2019m not sure how this applies to him. I wonder if you become more present as you get older \u2013 and maybe seem to have more time. Is he living out these \u201cstrange times\u201d in a zen state, contemplating each new meme like a teaching of the Dalai Lama? \u201cBy the way,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ve joined Houseparty.\u201d In these times of crisis, I\u2019d rather have this irreverent sort of dad than the \u201chysterically blaming coronavirus on 5G\u201d kind. Although that picture of a train car marked \u201cCovid-19\u201d did somehow make its way onto the family thread. Tweets about parents spreading fake news about how to cure Covid-19 have become a meme in themselves. Like a virus within a virus are the screenshots of mums telling their adult kids to binge-eat garlic, huff bleach or \u2013 according to one viral tweet \u2013 \u201cput an onion in the corner of every room in the house\u201d. \u201cMy mum has a PhD on coronavirus from WhatsApp university,\u201d tweeted one user. Variations on this joke have now been posted by hundreds of other Twitter users. Another character to have emerged is the protective yet slightly deranged mama bear, yell-typing at her cubs to batten down the hatches and listen up because her friend Maureen from Zumba wrote a very compelling Facebook post on the healing power of dishwasher salt. But it\u2019s not just the \u201cgullible mums\u201d disseminating misinformation like sugar-crazed toddlers throwing confetti at a wedding. My partner regularly has to tell off her 75-year-old dad for his factually dubious forwarded emails. (Although his latest offering, with the subject line \u00c0 m\u00e9diter, is actually a thoughtful essay on the pandemic, which originally appeared in Le Monde. My French isn\u2019t good enough to understand the full text, but an uninformed glance tells me it\u2019s deeply existential.) There appear to be three types of pandemic parent: the insouciant, the paranoid and the contemplative. Some straddle all three. The insouciant needs to be begged to stop going to the pub, but also creates the best content: the dads dancing with their teenage daughters on TikTok, the mums of younger kids churning out funny tweets about home-schooling. In one TikTok video, a dad acts as a bouncer and a mum a bartender, having turned their garage into a nightclub for their son\u2019s 21st birthday. These creatively supercharged boomers are \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 making lockdown slightly less terrible. They\u2019re trying so hard to \u201cmake the best of a bad situation\u201d and \u201clive, laugh, love\u201d their way through it that \u2013 you have to hand it to them \u2013 they\u2019re kind of succeeding. Or at least allowing us to forget about the slow collapse of civilisation in viral, 30-second blasts. In the past few weeks, we\u2019ve all seen those irritating references to the great works of art and literature supposedly created during quarantine, such as Shakespeare\u2019s King Lear.

But my lived reality is neither of these things. Instead, it\u2019s an unedifying cycle, where I badger them to at least get their homework out, hassle them into telling me what it is, and then end up doing it for them.</p> <p>The 10-year-old had to write a letter to Boris Johnson, telling him how coronavirus made her feel. She found this inherently droll, given that he actually had it. Like, you would never do that with any other disease. \u201cDear person with tuberculosis, I want to tell you a little bit about how tuberculosis, which I don\u2019t have, makes me feel.\u201d </p> <p>I said: \u201cGive them a break, they might have set this before he was diagnosed. Anyway, how does it make you feel?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t have any feelings about coronavirus.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel about being off school?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cReally? All the time? What about missing your friends?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYes, I miss my friends.\u201d </p> <p>OK \u2026 \u201cDear Boris Johnson, I write to you with some ambivalence about the situation facing the nation. On the one hand, it\u2019s great being off school. On the other, I miss my friends \u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long does this have to be?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cLonger than that. That\u2019s more of a postcard.\u201d <em>This </em>is my special skill, making things longer. This is the work I was born to do. I could do a paragraph wishing him well, and asking about his symptoms. I could tell him about the pets in the household. Frankly, I was on fire, we had a serviceable letter in 10 minutes flat and the only problem was that I\u2019d written it.</p> <p>Next she had to analyse a piece of graffiti: \u201cThe people save the people / NHS staff, you are our pride.\u201d What did she think it meant? What slogan would she spray paint on to a wall to show her appreciation for the NHS? </p> <p>\u201cThanks?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThink you\u2019d have to be a bit more specific, like: \u2018Doctors, thanks!\u2019\u201d We agreed that nurses shouldn\u2019t be left out. Then, that we would need some way to get their attention, and landed on: \u201cOi, nurses and doctors, thanks!\u201d If I had just butted out, and it had been that lame, it would have been fine. But I had basically done it, and it was still that lame.</p> <p>Then I went to harass the 12-year-old, who was answering questions about a speech in Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, which he claimed not to understand one word of. Oberon had just \u201cforgiven\u201d Titania \u2013 why had I put forgiveness in inverted commas, he wanted to know? Well, because it\u2019s pretty gaslighty, drugging someone to fall in love, then being enraged by their infidelity. So I would call forgiveness quite a moot concept. </p> <p>It turned out feminist revisionism was definitely not what he wanted. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. </p> <p>\u201cBECAUSE THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT THEY\u2019VE ASKED FOR. LITERALLY NOWHERE ON THIS SHEET DOES IT SAY: \u2018WHAT WOULD A FEMINIST THINK OF OBERON?\u2019.\u201d The question, rather, was: \u201cWhat do Oberon and Titania do next?\u201d, relating to the line: \u201cSound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me / And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI guess it could mean dancing, given the music. Or it could mean having sex. That\u2019s what people usually mean when they talk about the earth moving.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cThere is no way they are looking for the answer \u2018Having sex\u2019. I don\u2019t think you even understand what homework is.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWell, you could put it more formally, like: \u2018Dancing, or something a bit more marital.\u2019\u201d My attention then wandered for two seconds, and I turned round to find what he had actually written was: \u201cThey could be dancing, or doing something different.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cBut \u2026 \u2018something different\u2019 could be anything. It could be taking the dog for a walk. It\u2019s like saying: \u2018I have no idea what they do next. They could be doing any of an infinite number of different things.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go away, and do something different, and when you come back, neither of us will remember anything about this conversation.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201care you trying to bewitch me?\u201d</p>",

Instead, it\u2019s an unedifying cycle, where I badger them to at least get their homework out, hassle them into telling me what it is, and then end up doing it for them. The 10-year-old had to write a letter to Boris Johnson, telling him how coronavirus made her feel. She found this inherently droll, given that he actually had it. Like, you would never do that with any other disease. \u201cDear person with tuberculosis, I want to tell you a little bit about how tuberculosis, which I don\u2019t have, makes me feel.\u201d I said: \u201cGive them a break, they might have set this before he was diagnosed. Anyway, how does it make you feel?\u201d \u201cNothing. I don\u2019t have any feelings about coronavirus.\u201d \u201cHow do you feel about being off school?\u201d \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cReally? All the time? What about missing your friends?\u201d \u201cYes, I miss my friends.\u201d OK \u2026 \u201cDear Boris Johnson, I write to you with some ambivalence about the situation facing the nation. On the one hand, it\u2019s great being off school. On the other, I miss my friends \u2026\u201d \u201cHow long does this have to be?\u201d \u201cLonger than that. That\u2019s more of a postcard.\u201d This is my special skill, making things longer. This is the work I was born to do. I could do a paragraph wishing him well, and asking about his symptoms. I could tell him about the pets in the household. Frankly, I was on fire, we had a serviceable letter in 10 minutes flat and the only problem was that I\u2019d written it. Next she had to analyse a piece of graffiti: \u201cThe people save the people / NHS staff, you are our pride.\u201d What did she think it meant? What slogan would she spray paint on to a wall to show her appreciation for the NHS? \u201cThanks?\u201d \u201cThink you\u2019d have to be a bit more specific, like: \u2018Doctors, thanks!\u2019\u201d We agreed that nurses shouldn\u2019t be left out. Then, that we would need some way to get their attention, and landed on: \u201cOi, nurses and doctors, thanks!\u201d If I had just butted out, and it had been that lame, it would have been fine. But I had basically done it, and it was still that lame. Then I went to harass the 12-year-old, who was answering questions about a speech in Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, which he claimed not to understand one word of. Oberon had just \u201cforgiven\u201d Titania \u2013 why had I put forgiveness in inverted commas, he wanted to know? Well, because it\u2019s pretty gaslighty, drugging someone to fall in love, then being enraged by their infidelity. So I would call forgiveness quite a moot concept. It turned out feminist revisionism was definitely not what he wanted. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I asked. \u201cBECAUSE THAT\u2019S NOT WHAT THEY\u2019VE ASKED FOR. LITERALLY NOWHERE ON THIS SHEET DOES IT SAY: \u2018WHAT WOULD A FEMINIST THINK OF OBERON?\u2019.\u201d The question, rather, was: \u201cWhat do Oberon and Titania do next?\u201d, relating to the line: \u201cSound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me / And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI guess it could mean dancing, given the music. Or it could mean having sex. That\u2019s what people usually mean when they talk about the earth moving.\u201d \u201cThere is no way they are looking for the answer \u2018Having sex\u2019. I don\u2019t think you even understand what homework is.\u201d \u201cWell, you could put it more formally, like: \u2018Dancing, or something a bit more marital.\u2019\u201d My attention then wandered for two seconds, and I turned round to find what he had actually written was: \u201cThey could be dancing, or doing something different.\u201d \u201cBut \u2026 \u2018something different\u2019 could be anything. It could be taking the dog for a walk. It\u2019s like saying: \u2018I have no idea what they do next. They could be doing any of an infinite number of different things.\u2019\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a great idea,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go away, and do something different, and when you come back, neither of us will remember anything about this conversation.\u201d \u201cWait,\u201d I said, \u201care you trying to bewitch me?\u201d",

These days the company has 200 staff and 12 shops dotted around Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire.</p> \n<p>One hour after Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown, its owner, Gary Reeve, grandson of the bakery\u2019s founder, Harold Reeve, closed all the shops and furloughed most of the staff. \u201cIt was the hardest decision of my life,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI could have stayed open, we\u2019re a food business, but we have small shops and enforcing social distancing would have been a nightmare. My staff were worried too.\u201d</p> \n<p>People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day.</p> \n<p>Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her. She knows everyone and makes sure all the elderly and vulnerable get their supplies.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to how it was when my grandfather was baking bread. He would deliver to villages too. The community spirit we\u2019ve encountered has been amazing.\u201d</p> \n<p>In addition to the deliveries there is a pop-up shop in the town of Wilton twice a week. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"101a45bf64da6d59ecab051efd14e95bc050eec2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/101a45bf64da6d59ecab051efd14e95bc050eec2/0_96_1296_777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dutch lorry driver Jacques van Doornewaard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jacques van Doornewaard is delivering fresh food from the Netherlands to the UK.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Van Doornewaard/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The truck driver</h2> \n<p>Jacques van Doornewaard is a lorry driver bringing fruit and vegetables from the Netherlands to the UK. He travels about three times a week bringing goods including pears, strawberries and mushrooms to British supermarkets.</p> \n<p>According to Van Doornewaard, Britain\u2019s shelves would run out of fresh produce within a couple of days without supplies from countries including the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the supply chain of food was disrupted for 24 or 48 hours, all shops would be empty,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout truck drivers everything would come to a standstill.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s much quieter than usual. The ferry\u2019s capacity is 280 lorries, and on a quiet day there are about 105. Yesterday, on the ferry there were less than 50 drivers. We have to eat in shifts to maintain social distancing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Van Doornewaard used to deliver to food markets, who would sell the produce to restaurants, but this supply chain has closed down in recent weeks. Instead, more produce is going to supermarkets, as staff scramble to fill the shelves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"665122425293a7806d8b917635c600d6b1e0b67c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/665122425293a7806d8b917635c600d6b1e0b67c/0_118_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pallets of pears being delivered from the Netherlands to the UK.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pallets of pears being delivered from the Netherlands to the UK.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacques Van Doornewaard/Guardian Community</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the past week, Van Doornewaard has delivered 3,000kg of pears to Tesco in Dagenham, east London, and half as many to Sainsbury\u2019s, also in Dagenham, with stops at farms across southern England. He has also delivered mushrooms, strawberries and cheese. Through the week, he returns to collect thousands of empty trays to take back to be refilled in the Netherlands.</p> \n<p>The UK lockdown is more severe than in the Netherlands, and he has been struck by the emptiness of British streets.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe children\u2019s playgrounds are empty.

      "bodyText": "The sight of UK supermarket shelves being stripped bare in a matter of days and farmers warning that lack of workers could cause produce to go to waste has highlighted how quickly food supply chains can be disrupted. Though supermarkets have introduced rationing and panic buying appears to be on the wane, there is lingering uncertainty about what to expect in the weeks and months ahead. Some food producers and suppliers have acted quickly and creatively to try to ensure fresh food remains available across the UK. Here are some of the people and grassroots initiatives trying to make a difference. The community group Planna Fwyd \u2013 Welsh for plant food \u2013 is a community project in the Dyfi Valley in mid Wales. The project organises a variety of food production initiatives, from Zoom lessons for first-time crop growers to sending out seed packets for families to grow in their gardens, and has about 100 local people involved. The group also plans to organise a second world war-style \u201cland army\u201d of volunteers to work on farms, with about 30 people signed up and plenty more showing interest, out of a town of 2,000 people. The project was born three weeks ago, after Mach Maethlon, a community organisation working to improve food supply and sustainability in the local area, joined up with the local coronavirus aid group in an attempt to combat fears around a food shortfall. \u201cAfter the crisis kicked off, we got lots of people saying they were worried about food supply, and asking if they could help,\u201d said Katie Hastings, one of the group\u2019s coordinators. \u201cWe had a range of people, from families wanting to turn their land to veg, to farmers wanting to grow food on empty land.\u201d The group are having to reckon with social distancing regulations, ensuring that volunteers can work collectively and share toolswithout putting each other at risk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to work to improve the food supply here for eight years, and have had a sudden burst of enthusiasm. We import a lot of vegetables here, and while the project came in response to fear over food supplies, it will hopefully have a positive ongoing impact after the crisis,\u201d Hastings said. The group also hopes to help those in isolation. \u201cThere are a lot of people at home struggling with not working and being isolated. If we can work out a safe way to work on farms, it gives them the chance to do something meaningful,\u201d Hastings said. The baker Reeve the Baker was established in 1952 in Barford St Martin, a village six miles west of Salisbury in Wiltshire. These days the company has 200 staff and 12 shops dotted around Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire. One hour after Boris Johnson announced the UK lockdown, its owner, Gary Reeve, grandson of the bakery\u2019s founder, Harold Reeve, closed all the shops and furloughed most of the staff. \u201cIt was the hardest decision of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI could have stayed open, we\u2019re a food business, but we have small shops and enforcing social distancing would have been a nightmare. My staff were worried too.\u201d People rely on the bakeries and he did not want to let the community down so came up with a plan to deliver bread instead. Five bakers work overnight and bag up rolls and bread that is then taken by one driver to 20 surrounding villages. Each village has a designated weekly delivery day. Reeve relies on local businesses that have been temporarily forced to close, such as the Wyndham Arms pub in Dinton, to organise orders. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be done without the village coordinators,\u201d he said. \u201cThe landlady, Mary Gibbens, takes customer orders and card payments over the phone and we drop off once a week and people in the village collect from her. She knows everyone and makes sure all the elderly and vulnerable get their supplies. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back to how it was when my grandfather was baking bread. He would deliver to villages too. The community spirit we\u2019ve encountered has been amazing.\u201d In addition to the deliveries there is a pop-up shop in the town of Wilton twice a week. The truck driver Jacques van Doornewaard is a lorry driver bringing fruit and vegetables from the Netherlands to the UK. He travels about three times a week bringing goods including pears, strawberries and mushrooms to British supermarkets. According to Van Doornewaard, Britain\u2019s shelves would run out of fresh produce within a couple of days without supplies from countries including the Netherlands. \u201cIf the supply chain of food was disrupted for 24 or 48 hours, all shops would be empty,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout truck drivers everything would come to a standstill. \u201cIt\u2019s much quieter than usual. The ferry\u2019s capacity is 280 lorries, and on a quiet day there are about 105. Yesterday, on the ferry there were less than 50 drivers. We have to eat in shifts to maintain social distancing.\u201d Van Doornewaard used to deliver to food markets, who would sell the produce to restaurants, but this supply chain has closed down in recent weeks. Instead, more produce is going to supermarkets, as staff scramble to fill the shelves. In the past week, Van Doornewaard has delivered 3,000kg of pears to Tesco in Dagenham, east London, and half as many to Sainsbury\u2019s, also in Dagenham, with stops at farms across southern England. He has also delivered mushrooms, strawberries and cheese. Through the week, he returns to collect thousands of empty trays to take back to be refilled in the Netherlands. The UK lockdown is more severe than in the Netherlands, and he has been struck by the emptiness of British streets. \u201cThe children\u2019s playgrounds are empty. Some minor roadworks are going on, [but] the big construction sites are empty. It\u2019s funny to notice since in the Netherlands that kind of work is still going on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like on a Sunday morning, except for the fact that you see almost more lorries than cars.\u201d The local farmers\u2019 initiative As restaurants close their doors, many farmers are struggling to sell their produce to their usual suppliers, while more people are eating at home and struggling to get food from supermarkets. In response to this, Cathy St Germans established Farms to Feed Us, a digital database that connects people with farmers, enabling them to buy fresh food directly. So far, more than 80 farmers, growers and suppliers across the country have signed up. \u201cThere\u2019s no shortage of fresh produce on our farms and being fished in our seas,\u201d she said. \u201cThere has never been a more important time to eat healthy food and support your local farmers, growers and fishermen.\u201d She added: \u201cWe really focus on small-scale farmers and growers, where the ground isn\u2019t having its life sprayed out of it.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d.</p> <p>The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others.</p> <p>Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> had dismantled.</p> <p>\u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving.</p> <p>\u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019?</p> <p>\u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership.

      "bodyText": "Joe Biden will wear a mask if he goes out in public, the former vice-president and probable Democratic presidential nominee said on Sunday. Donald Trump said on Friday he would not wear a mask, despite new guidelines issued by the White House that day \u2013 and announced from the Briefing Room podium by the president \u2013 for people to wear face coverings in public places. In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Biden also defended his work as vice-president in the Obama administration in terms of preparing for such a pandemic. Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for the federal government\u2019s slow and disjointed response to the arrival on US soil of Covid-19, the virus which by Sunday had infected more than 312,000 Americans and killed nearly 8,500. At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters \u201cthe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure\u201d. But he added: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d. The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others. Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said Trump had dismantled. \u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving. \u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem. \u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response. \u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019? \u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president. Show some leadership. Mobilize the industrial base of the United States, that\u2019s what we need.\u201d On ABC, Biden also weighed in on the controversial dismissal of the US navy captain Brett Crozier, calling it \u201cclose to criminal\u201d. Capt Crozier was removed from command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt this week after he wrote a memo about concerns for his crew on the aircraft carrier with coronavirus cases aboard. Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday Trump criticized him for writing the letter. \u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature.

Esper also dismissed reports that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d Biden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy.

      "bodyText": "Ministers and the NHS have pushed back strongly against a series of reports alleging splits within the government and between ministers and health bosses over the response to coronavirus, insisting talk of tensions is wildly overblown. Following claims of disagreements between the Department of Health and Social Care and both NHS England and Public Health England (PHE) over difficulties in rolling out more tests for the virus, the health service took the unusual step of calling the reports \u201cfactually wrong\u201d. Meanwhile, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, dismissed the idea that he and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, had disagreed over when to end the lockdown. The reports capped a difficult week for the government after criticism over the slow pace of testing and the provision of protective equipment for NHS and care staff. The nadir came on Wednesday when a stumbling performance by Alok Sharma, the business secretary, prompted even some loyal newspapers to lead their next day\u2019s editions with talk of chaos. The following day Hancock emerged from seven days of isolation because of coronavirus symptoms to pledge that 100,000 tests a day would be carried out by the end of the month, a target he conceded on Sunday would be hard to achieve. In a story alleging widespread splits within government and between ministers and various agencies, the Sunday Times said ministers were blaming NHS England and PHE over the delays in supplying protective equipment and for taking an over-centralist, controlling attitude towards private laboratories helping with tests. NHS bosses are believed to be particularly annoyed at the claim they are unwilling to work with the private sector, pointing to a deal made last month to work with private hospitals to share the burden. An NHS England spokesman said the claims were \u201cfactually wrong\u201d, saying NHS hospital labs had done the testing they had been asked to do, focused on patients and staff, and that mass testing would always have needed outside help. NHS England \u201chas itself rapidly engaged with the private sector in areas for which it has responsibility, as evidenced by a deal to redeploy almost all independent hospitals across England to help with the expected surge of coronavirus patients\u201d, the spokesman said. \u201cThis means another 20,000 staff, 8,000 more beds and an extra 1,000 ventilators can all be used in this battle.\u201d They added: \u201cThe NHS in partnership with the military has acted in record time to establish new Nightingale hospitals in London and now in four other regions across the country.

      "bodyText": "Government minister Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s investment firm has been criticised for exploiting the coronavirus crisis after telling clients it provided a chance to make \u201csuper normal returns\u201d. Somerset Capital Management (SCM), which manages investments in emerging markets, told clients that the dive in stock market valuations around the world since the pandemic took hold had made \u201cexcellent entry points for investors\u201d. \u201cMarket dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors,\u201d SCM fund manager Mark Asquith wrote in a note to clients. \u201cHistory has shown us that super normal returns can be made during this type of environment.\u201d Rees-Mogg co-founded SCM and continues to hold a 15% stake in the business. He stepped back from day-to-day work at the firm when he became an MP in 2010 and quit his role as part-time adviser when he became a minister in 2019. He reportedly received a payout of about \u00a31m from the business last year. The firm said assets in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia were cheap following the recent heavy falls in global stock markets. Asquith noted that in the 12 months following the 2008 global financial crisis, the value of smaller companies in emerging markets rose more than 150%, with some Brazilian firms surging by about 500% within two years. The company said it has recently taken advantage of the downturn to invest in Hapvida, a Brazilian medical insurer and hospital operator; Advantech, a firm behind technology used in China to monitor the temperatures of people in public places during the pandemic; and the South African pharmacy chain Clicks. Keir Starmer, the new leader of the Labour party, said: \u201cNobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis. We should all be asking ourselves what we can do for our country and each other.\u201d The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: \u201cThis attitude is about as sick as it comes. Profit seeking from people\u2019s suffering is nearly as low as you can get. When we come through this we need a windfall tax on the profiteers.\u201d However, Jolyon Maugham, the campaigning lawyer who backed legal action against Brexit, described the criticism as \u201ca bit silly\u201d. \u201cNo fan of Rees-Mogg, and of course super-profits must be properly taxed, but this is a bit silly.

One major high street clothing supplier told the Guardian: \u201cSpring/summer season has been cancelled. People will try to reuse stock next year but they will have to slash prices to try and generate cash and some styles will no longer be relevant. \u201cThere will be containers being docked at [ports] for a fee of \u00a3120 a day. All sorts of measures will be taken, because it\u2019s a desperate time.\u201d Another industry insider agreed that discounting was unlikely to clear stock. \u201cNo one buys T-shirts in the winter. The industry has lost a season,\u201d the source said. In the past week it has emerged that both Debenhams and Cath Kidston are preparing to call in administrators, putting thousands of jobs at risk in the already battered retail sector. Cath Kidston, which has 60 stores in the UK and a further 180 overseas, has filed a notice of intention to appoint administrators, a legal process which protects the business from creditors for 10 working days, as it considers potential rescue options. The company employs 941 people in the UK, 820 of whom were furloughed on 22 March under the government scheme. Advisory firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal (A&amp;M) was appointed last month to help Cath Kidston seek a buyer as the British brand, which opened its first store in 1993, struggled to make a profit for its Hong Kong-based owner Baring Private Equity Asia. Cath Kidston Group has been in difficulties for some time, recording a pretax loss of \u00a342.3m in the year to the end of March 2018 when sales rose just 1.2% and it closed small retail businesses in France and Spain. Coronavirus lockdowns in the UK and elsewhere have only added to the difficulties and it is understood that even if a buyer is found, the rescue is likely to involve a pre-pack administration. A Cath Kidston spokesperson said: \u201cThe notice of intention forms part of the process by which Cath Kidston is continuing to work with A&amp;M to explore all options for the company in the current climate.\u201d Debenhams is preparing to call in administrators after the struggling department store was forced to close all its outlets under the lockdown while Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group, the owner of Topshop and Miss Selfridge, is expected to permanently close hundreds of stores as it suffers from competition from the likes of Asos, Boohoo and Primark. The lockdown has added to existing pressures on retailers from the consumer switch to online shopping and rising costs from business rates coupled with the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote. Fashion brands have been hit particularly hard as young people switch from spending on outfits to alternatives such as digital subscriptions and mobile phones.",

Daisy Dinwoodie, of the Scottish Doula Network, said: \u201cTwo women have been in touch this week saying they will freebirth and asking for support. It puts me in a very difficult position because I\u2019m not medically trained, my role is emotional support.</p> <p>\u201cIn the current climate I fear doulas will be blamed for women making that choice if we are present at the birth. These aren\u2019t women who would normally opt for this \u2013 they feel pushed away from the hospital because they can\u2019t have their doula and partner present for the duration.\u201d</p> <p>Michaela Kalusova, of London Bliss Doulas, says she is supporting a woman whose due date was on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cI will help because otherwise she says she will freebirth alone. She rung in tears after her home birth was cancelled. She wanted a midwife and we discussed at length whether she feels safe without one. I made it very clear I\u2019m not a trained medic.\u201d</p> <p>Kalusova has been present at around 10 free births but says: \u201cThis is completely different. Free birth should be a planned choice but this woman feels forced into it. She says hospital is not an option due to a traumatic first birth. I\u2019m hearing of many others in the same position.\u201d</p> <p>Samia Ahmad, who is 32 weeks pregnant with her third child, is also opting for a free birth due to midwife shortages. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to have a doula because I don\u2019t have the financial resources or the timeframe to build the necessary rapport.\u201d</p> <p>Ahmad previously lodged two complaints with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust regarding her first birth and what she calls the \u201cappalling aftercare\u201d following the unplanned unassisted birth at home of her second baby.</p> <p>She says: \u201cI feel I have no choice but to freebirth. I\u2019d like to catch the baby myself. I did it with my son, I caught him in my kitchen even though it wasn\u2019t planned and I have faith I can do it again.\u201d</p> <p>But she says that when she told her midwife she would pursue a freebirth she was warned that children\u2019s services could be notified.</p> <p>\u201cShe made me feel awful and asked how I would live with myself if something went wrong. But I know my legal rights to choose where I give birth. I\u2019m the one not getting support for the birth I want, and I\u2019m being backed into a corner.\u201d</p> <p>It is legal in the UK for a woman to freebirth and decline antenatal care. The <a href=\"https://www.aims.org.uk/information/item/freebirth?fbclid=IwAR1Z3PoRZQV08kf--exfxDPRhxNK1ggtBs44UEHlHSoeC6UxG1RaesJGuiU\">Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services</a> (AIMS) states: \u201cA woman does not have to justify her decision, nor base it on a particular reason.\u201d</p> <p>Its chair of trustees, Debbie Chippington Derrick, said: \u201cAIMS is receiving a worrying number of calls from women asking if they can birth at home when they have been refused support from a midwife. They should not be forced to choose between leaving home to birth or birthing without medical assistance.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes women refusing to attend hospital find themselves threatened with referral to children\u2019s services as a means of coercion. Referral should only be considered if there is concern about the wellbeing of the baby after it is born, not because the mother is exercising her legal right to decline care.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \u201cThe impact of the current crisis may mean pregnant women cannot have the birth they planned.

She says she \u201clost it\u201d for two days, crying constantly, gripped by uncertainty and then anger. The 33-year-old from the Highlands, whose baby boy is due at the end of April, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder after the birth of her first child and wants to avoid a hospital delivery at all costs. Now she has reached the decision to have a free birth, also known as unassisted childbirth. Maternity rights groups say there has been a rise in the number of women seeking advice about freebirthing owing to pressures on hospitals and new restrictions around birth partners. More than a fifth of birthing centres and more than a third of homebirth services have closed due to a shortage of midwives and concerns about ambulance response times. Alison Edwards, of Doula UK, whose 700 members advocate for expectant mothers, says she has seen a threefold increase in calls about freebirthing in the last fortnight. \u201cInitially women were concerned about staff shortages,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cNow they don\u2019t want to go to hospital at all, it\u2019s about infection.

It puts me in a very difficult position because I\u2019m not medically trained, my role is emotional support. \u201cIn the current climate I fear doulas will be blamed for women making that choice if we are present at the birth. These aren\u2019t women who would normally opt for this \u2013 they feel pushed away from the hospital because they can\u2019t have their doula and partner present for the duration.\u201d Michaela Kalusova, of London Bliss Doulas, says she is supporting a woman whose due date was on Wednesday. \u201cI will help because otherwise she says she will freebirth alone. She rung in tears after her home birth was cancelled. She wanted a midwife and we discussed at length whether she feels safe without one. I made it very clear I\u2019m not a trained medic.\u201d Kalusova has been present at around 10 free births but says: \u201cThis is completely different. Free birth should be a planned choice but this woman feels forced into it. She says hospital is not an option due to a traumatic first birth. I\u2019m hearing of many others in the same position.\u201d Samia Ahmad, who is 32 weeks pregnant with her third child, is also opting for a free birth due to midwife shortages. She said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to have a doula because I don\u2019t have the financial resources or the timeframe to build the necessary rapport.\u201d Ahmad previously lodged two complaints with the Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust regarding her first birth and what she calls the \u201cappalling aftercare\u201d following the unplanned unassisted birth at home of her second baby. She says: \u201cI feel I have no choice but to freebirth. I\u2019d like to catch the baby myself. I did it with my son, I caught him in my kitchen even though it wasn\u2019t planned and I have faith I can do it again.\u201d But she says that when she told her midwife she would pursue a freebirth she was warned that children\u2019s services could be notified. \u201cShe made me feel awful and asked how I would live with myself if something went wrong. But I know my legal rights to choose where I give birth. I\u2019m the one not getting support for the birth I want, and I\u2019m being backed into a corner.\u201d It is legal in the UK for a woman to freebirth and decline antenatal care. The Association for Improvements in the Maternity Services (AIMS) states: \u201cA woman does not have to justify her decision, nor base it on a particular reason.\u201d Its chair of trustees, Debbie Chippington Derrick, said: \u201cAIMS is receiving a worrying number of calls from women asking if they can birth at home when they have been refused support from a midwife. They should not be forced to choose between leaving home to birth or birthing without medical assistance. \u201cSometimes women refusing to attend hospital find themselves threatened with referral to children\u2019s services as a means of coercion. Referral should only be considered if there is concern about the wellbeing of the baby after it is born, not because the mother is exercising her legal right to decline care.\u201d Gill Walton, the chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said: \u201cThe impact of the current crisis may mean pregnant women cannot have the birth they planned. Keeping services at a single location, like a hospital, means that, at a time when resources are stretched, women continue to get the care and support they need, quickly, safely and effectively.\u201d Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust was contacted by the Guardian and declined to comment. *Some names were changed to protect identities.",

      "bodyText": "Premier League clubs anticipate having to start individual negotiations over wage reductions with their players after attempts to reach a collective pay agreement in response to the coronavirus crisis were frustrated during talks on Saturday. While players have been told clubs may lose \u00a31.137bn because of the disruption caused by the pandemic, the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association has responded to the Premier League\u2019s proposals of a 30% pay cut by saying that would be detrimental to the NHS. The proposal will be discussed among squads with a view to reaching a collective agreement by the end of the week but the PFA has remained defiant in the face of mounting pressure, arguing cuts would lead to a \u00a3200m tax deficit. There was hope before Saturday\u2019s conference call, which involved managers, captains and representatives of all 20 Premier League clubs, that an agreement would be reached over wage reductions, deferrals or a combination of both. Many top-flight clubs are worried about their income drying up while the season is suspended and some have already put non-football staff on furlough. While Manchester City said on Sunday they will not place any staff on furlough, Liverpool invited criticism after announcing they had joined Newcastle, Tottenham, Norwich and Bournemouth in claiming 80% of non-playing staff wages from the government scheme. However, one source had urged caution before Saturday\u2019s meeting, suggesting talking the PFA round would be difficult. There is now a growing feeling clubs will eventually be forced to conduct direct negotiations with their own players, which could drag the problem out even further. There is frustration on both sides. Players are upset at being portrayed as greedy \u2013 last week\u2019s comments by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that footballers \u201cshould play their part\u201d did not go down well in dressing rooms \u2013 and have stressed they are willing to do their bit. Hancock was invited to be a guest on Sky\u2019s Monday Night Football programme by Gary Neville after the cabinet minister suggested on Sunday players should donate a portion of their wages to struggling hospices.

It encourages people to think about a single enjoyable activity that is possible to do each day. \u201cIf you focus constantly on what you can\u2019t do or things you want to do or that you\u2019re isolated, that\u2019s not good for mood,\u201d said Buckey.</p> <p>Keeping a balance between group time and private time is crucial, he said. \u201cYou need to allow people their privacy but not to allow them to become isolated and separated from a group,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone\u2019s spending all their time in their room with their door closed, that\u2019s not great.

The Russian cosmonaut Valentin Lebvedev, who documented his 211-day stay onboard the Space Station Salyut 7 with Anatoly Berezovoy, wrote: \u201cWe don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with us.

      "body": "<p>I am employed on mental health wards as a support worker, helping people recover from acute problems. It can be a very difficult but also very rewarding job. Covid-19 has not only affected general hospitals but has also had a huge impact on mental health facilities, which are more often run by a skeleton staff, as workers have had to self-isolate. On top of this we are also dealing with mental health patients infected with Covid-19, mostly with mild symptoms of the virus. As we are not considered to be on the frontline, we are not equipped with proper personal protective equipment. We get a basic face mask, gloves and a flimsy apron.</p> <p>Last Tuesday I received a letter that said I should self-isolate even from my own family due to being in a high-risk group. I opened it on returning from a 13-hour shift on a ward where there were patients with suspected Covid-19 \u2013 wearing a basic face mask, gloves and apron. We waited three weeks for those masks. Their protection efficiency is 28%. Still, I regret nothing as those patients, many with severe mental health problems, need someone to look after them.</p> <p>The letter came a bit too late. I did not expect it to come at all as I did not suspect I was in a high-risk group. I naively expected proper PPE.

      "bodyText": "I am employed on mental health wards as a support worker, helping people recover from acute problems. It can be a very difficult but also very rewarding job. Covid-19 has not only affected general hospitals but has also had a huge impact on mental health facilities, which are more often run by a skeleton staff, as workers have had to self-isolate. On top of this we are also dealing with mental health patients infected with Covid-19, mostly with mild symptoms of the virus. As we are not considered to be on the frontline, we are not equipped with proper personal protective equipment. We get a basic face mask, gloves and a flimsy apron. Last Tuesday I received a letter that said I should self-isolate even from my own family due to being in a high-risk group. I opened it on returning from a 13-hour shift on a ward where there were patients with suspected Covid-19 \u2013 wearing a basic face mask, gloves and apron. We waited three weeks for those masks. Their protection efficiency is 28%. Still, I regret nothing as those patients, many with severe mental health problems, need someone to look after them. The letter came a bit too late. I did not expect it to come at all as I did not suspect I was in a high-risk group. I naively expected proper PPE. Now I can only count on my luck.

class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Health secretary <strong>Matt Hancock</strong> is first up on Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning, emphasising that people should not flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather. </p> \n  <p>\u201cSunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cunbelievable

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll be closing our UK live blog shortly \u2013 you can join my colleague Clea Skopeliti for all the global coronavirus developments. Thanks for reading, and take care. The UK coronavirus death toll rose by 621, a slight fall on yesterday when 708 people were confirmed to have died from Covid over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of victims to 4,934 The number of new people tested daily in the UK for coronavirus returned to above 10,000, according to Department of Health figures. A total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. Health secretary Matt Hancock said he could not provide an exact figure on how many more ventilators the NHS could have in place over the next week in the daily press conference but earlier this morning he told Andrew Marr that \u201cthere should be another 1,500\u201d in a week\u2019s time. He implored people not to flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather and he confirmed that sunbathing was against the rules. He said that if people flout them \u201cwe might have to take further action\u201d. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic, after it emerged she had twice visited her family\u2019s second home in Fife \u2013 prompting a police warning. Scottish government adverts are being shown on television this weekend where Calderwood says: \u201cTo help save lives, stay at home.\u201d These are being edited to remove her. Labour will ask the government \u201cdifficult questions\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, newly-elected leader, Keir Starmer said, adding that the UK had been slow to begin testing and that equipment for health care workers on the frontline was lacking. However, Starmer said he would seek to engage with the government constructively and that he would support the government if they were to ban outdoor exercise due to some people flouting lockdown rules. Matt Hancock should have stayed home for longer than seven days after contracting Covid-19, Labour\u2019s newly-elected deputy leader Angela Rayner said. The government\u2019s guidelines state that if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you need to self-isolate at home for seven days or for as long as you still have a high temperature, but the World Health Organisation has recommended people self-quarantine for a fortnight. Government minister Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s investment firm was criticised for exploiting the coronavirus crisis after telling clients it provided a chance to make \u201csuper normal returns\u201d. John Alagos, a 27-year-old nurse at Watford general hospital, died on Friday following a 12-hour night shift after complaining of suffering a headache and high temperature upon his return home. His mother, Gina Gustilo told the Mail on Sunday that her son had not been wearing full personal protective equipment despite treating coronavirus patients. The owner of London\u2019s ExCel centre, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company, has said it will no longer charge the NHS to use the site for the temporary Nightingale hospital. ExCel chief executive Jeremy Rees told the BBC an initial agreement with the NHS to had \u201cincluded a contribution to some fixed costs\u201d. But following reports, he said: \u201cWe have since decided to cover the fixed costs ourselves.\u201d The Foreign Office\u2019s efforts to repatriate British nationals stranded in India continue to draw criticism even after it announced seven charter flights for next week. The flights leave from Mumbai, Goa and Delhi but the cost of \u00a3600 for a one way journey and the lack of information on flights from other airports, particularly in Punjab, have frustrated those stranded. The high commissioner Jan Thompson said these were the \u201cfirst round of charter flights\u201d and would go from Goa to Stansted on 8, 10 and 12 April; from Mumbai to Heathrow on 9 and 11 of April and Delhi to Heathrow on 9 and 11 April. There has been criticism over the high prices, an issue that appears to have heightened existing exasperation over the UK\u2019s failure to send charter flights earlier like other countries including Germany which has repatriated 42,000 of its citizens around the world. Another said it was \u201cabsolutely appalling that those stranded in Punjab were not told sooner they would not be included in the first phase of repatriations\u201d. Thompson said in response that the Foreign Office was \u201clooking to arrange flights for British nationals from other locations\u201d. Public Health England said 11,085 tests for coronavirus were carried out on 8,651 people on Saturday in England. A tweet by the Department of Health added that PHE gave the testing capacity for inpatient care in England as 12,799 tests per day. The announcement comes after a total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. The equivalent figure for yesterday had slipped below 10,000, having previously been above 10,000 for two days in a row (see 3.07pm). Here are some further full lines from the presser. When asked if people are safe to visit family if they have been following the social distancing guidelines correctly, Hancock said uncertainty over how the disease is spread means they should not. This virus can spread in all sorts of different ways, both from directly respiratory and also through objects and through touching objects that others then touch - the uncertainty over who has it, especially before they have symptoms, means that the only effective way of bending the curve down is to reduce that social contact. That\u2019s why we came to the conclusions we did, difficult conclusions, that we have to have such extraordinary social distancing policies in place and why we took the decision more than a week ago now to flip the basis of those rules from saying you can\u2019t do certain things to saying you must stay at home unless you\u2019re doing one of a small number of things. Harries said there is an important distinction between the terms \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d. Previously you might have had four or five students living in a flat under one roof, sharing cooking, bathrooms, all sorts of things - that in infection control terms of things is a household. If your family lives in a different town, they are an entirely different household and mixing those two is not what we want to do generally. Stay with the people you live under the same roof with and keep doing that for as long as you can.\u201d During the press conference, health secretary Matt Hancock said he could not provide an exact figure on how many more ventilators the NHS could have in place over the next week. But this morning he told Andrew Marr that \u201cthere should be another 1,500\u201d in a week\u2019s time. He told the Downing St briefing: The production from domestic manufacturers is starting to come on stream. The key goal is to always keep the amount of critical care beds - which nearly all need ventilators - above the demand. We haven\u2019t got an exact figure for how many we will deliver next week not least because when we bring them in from abroad there are risks to the timing. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, he said: We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we\u2019re ramping that up. The answer is that our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks.\u201d Asked how many there will be in a week\u2019s time, he said: \u201cThere should be another 1,500.\u201d The government had already appeared to revise down its 30,000 target for ventilators. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer is withdrawing from daily media briefings during the coronavirus pandemic, after it emerged she had twice visited her family\u2019s second home in Fife. Dr Calderwood will remain in the post and continue advising the Scottish Government, but the current advertising campaign which features her will now be revised, according to first minister Nicola Sturgeon. In a statement after Sunday\u2019s excruciating briefing, Sturgeon said: I am acutely aware of the importance of public trust in the advice the government is giving to stay at home in order to save lives and protect our NHS. To maintain that trust we will be revising our public information campaign and the chief medical officer will be withdrawing from media briefings for the foreseeable future. She will continue to provide the Scottish government with the scientific and medical advice on the spread of coronavirus. Although he raised the possibility of an extension of the lockdown earlier today, Hancock said the government is not looking at tightening the rules on exercising outdoors. \u201cWhat we are doing is being absolutely clear that the current rules must be followed,\u201d he said. He said the rules are designed to include exercise to protect people\u2019s physical and mental wellbeing. Harries said: It is not just what you are doing but how you are doing it. If you are sitting on a park bench, people tend to accumulate - it is very difficult to prevent that. Having rules where we are getting all of the benefits and minimising the risks and harms is an important approach to maintain. We have set those rules, we are enforcing against those rules and we will reiterate those rules, because that is the best way to be able to bend the curve down and stop the spread of the virus. At the beginning of the news conference which was not broadcast due to a malfunction, Hancock said he offered his \u201cprofound sympathies\u201d to the families and friends of those who have died. He added: \u201cI\u2019ve lost two people that I was fond of so I understand what a difficult time this is for the country.\u201d Harries said that transport use in the UK had been down since February but needed to be sustained. The first slide [showing transport use] probably hasn\u2019t changed much but that is really good news. What is shows is that our transport use is down and remains down since early March, beginning back in February as well and we\u2019re managing to sustain that. As the secretary of state has said it\u2019s really important that we continue to do that despite the good weather so thank you to the members of the public that have observed that and please ensure that we keep moving in that direction. On the number of lab test reported cases, Harries emphasised the need for caution. You will be aware that our capacity is increasing all the time on laboratory tests. So we need to interpret this with a little bit of caution. We are following to a certain degree an epidemic curve and we can see the rise and we will of course in due course be looking to see that level off, but you will notice that over the last 24 hours or so there is an apparent big surge there. We just need to keep in mind that we need to watch for a trend over time because as our testing capacity increases, inevitably we will find more cases. Asked if he would have asked for Calderwood\u2019s resignation after she twice visited her coastal second home over the past two weekends, Hancock says it is a matter for the Scottish government. And the press conference concludes. Hancock says that even for \u201cthose of who have had it\u201d, it is unclear to what extent those who have contracted coronavirus can transmit the virus. He says there are scientific predictions showing their ability to transmit the virus is lower and their immunity is higher, but the science is not yet definitive. Hancock says the virus can spread in all sorts of different ways and that the uncertainty over who has it \u2013 especially before they have symptoms \u2013 means that the only way to reduce the number of people contracting it is strict social distancing. Harries says people have intermixed the terms family and household. She says it is important for people to remember it is a household isolation policy, not a family one \u2013 though people\u2019s households may comprise their family. Mixing those two is not what we would like to do, generally, she says \u2013 remaining slightly equivocal. She refuses to speculate on the true scale of coronavirus in the UK and acknowledges other countries are ahead in assessing the extent of the pandemic nationally. Harries says it is unclear how the disease outbreak has affected our immunity and says it is important to discover. She says different interventions could come in response to emerging regional data. The government has bought 3.5m finger-prick antibody tests. Asked if the government is going to take equity stakes in any companies hit by the outbreak, Hancock says this is an area where Rishi Sunak has been doing incredible work. He declines to comment on whether Virgin Care would be in line for this help, after Jim Pickard from the FT noted that it has sued the NHS and its owner Richard Branson is a tax exile. Asked about the Queen\u2019s espousal of the nation\u2019s self-discipline, Hancock says we need perseverance in the face of some great challenges, adding that people need to stay at home unless they are going out for any of four reasons. On mass testing, Harries says not everybody in particular care homes and prisons, for example, would be tested but those prioritised key workers have been tested where there have been outbreaks. On whether higher levels of protection should have been in place, amid growing reports of health care workers dying, Hancock muses on whether we are doing the right thing now. You can have a debate about the past, he says, but the previous guidance was based on the previous information that was available. Harries says the guidance has been reviewed to ensure clinicians feel safe. Asked whether people in hospitals with immunosuppressed conditions should be concerned due to doctors having a lack of protective equipment, Hancock says guidance has been updated in line with the emerging science. Harries appears to acknowledge that the previous guidance was not in line with the WHO guidance and that doctors need to be prepared for changing circumstances. Hancock says there are adequate supplies of oxygen in hospitals following reports to the contrary. He recognises an equipment failure led to the diversion of some ambulances, but this was not uncommon. Harries says the public should not be concerned since there was no insufficiency of oxygen. The press conference with health secretary Matt Hancock and deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries is underway. Campaigners have questioned the safety of pregnant women travelling by ferry from Northern Ireland for abortions amid the coronavirus pandemic as the services remain unavailable in the nation despite the law change in October. At the time, it was reported that women would continue to travel to England for medical terminations until March \u2013 but that period appears to have been extended. Here are some clips from earlier\u2019s remarkable press conference in Scotland as we await the daily Downing St briefing. A man has been arrested after a woman was stabbed in the face in a domestic incident, and police have urged victims of domestic abuse not to remain silent during the lockdown. Merseyside Police repeated advice for victims of domestic abuse during the coronavirus lockdown after officers were called to a home in Rainhill, Merseyside, just before 11pm on Saturday following reports of an argument involving the two occupants. A force spokesman said a 44-year-old woman had been stabbed in the face twice, causing injuries above her left eyebrow, and was taken to hospital for treatment. She was later released. A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of wounding. Two children are being looked after by family members following the incident, police said. Det Ch Insp Steve Reardon said: Earlier this week we reminded people about the silent call 999 system for vulnerable people living in our communities, including those who suffer from domestic abuse. We completely understand that victims of domestic abuse could be feeling more vulnerable during the current situation we all find ourselves in, but my message to them is please don\u2019t suffer in silence. If you need our help call us and if you can\u2019t make a call as you would ordinarily do, please use the silent call option available to you. Silent call is a part of the 999 system which allows for people who are not free to speak, but are able to make a noise, to press 55, which alerts the BT operator to the fact that you need help, and they can then connect the call to the police. The system enables all 999 callers to access support in the manner described, it is important that a noise is made when 55 has been pressed. For example if you can only make noise, such as tapping the handset, coughing, crying or even talking to the offender, then these actions will alert the attention of the BT operator. There are growing calls from within the NHS to urgently ramp up staff testing to tackle growing absence from work. NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said: We have welcomed the commitment to significantly increase testing for NHS staff, but we are now at the point where we urgently need this to be ramped up and operating at full capacity. Snapshot surveys indicating high staff sickness and self isolation rates reflect what we\u2019re hearing day in day out from trust leaders \u2013 that trying to cope with record levels of demand with record levels of absence is really difficult. More wide-scale staff testing to confirm whether self isolating staff have COVID-19 cannot come quickly enough. Trusts have rapidly put in place staff testing facilities and they are trying to grow the testing capacity they control as fast as possible. But we know there is still a shortage of swabs, reagents and kits and this urgently needs to be resolved. The lack of testing is affecting frontline staff not just in hospitals, but those who are working in community, mental health and ambulance services. Staff testing is vital to ensure staff in whatever role can get back to work as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, plans to ensure oxygen supplies for critically ill patients are afoot. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said: The NHS has known for over six weeks that treating COVID-19 requires high levels of ventilation support and accompanying oxygen. We\u2019ve therefore been preparing accordingly. Trusts have been working closely with national NHS leaders and oxygen suppliers to ensure hospitals have enough oxygen supply. They\u2019ve also been working with oxygen system engineers to ensure they have the right piping and ducting to carry oxygen to all the required beds including newly created critical care capacity. There is a particular challenge here given that trusts are currently using unprecedented levels of ventilators and oxygen at the same time. This can put a much higher level of pressure on a hospital\u2019s central oxygen supply system than usual, potentially overloading it. We can\u2019t comment on individual incidents but a hospital will declare a critical incident if it can\u2019t take any more patients or if it is suffering a serious incident like a fire. At that point a well prepared and frequently rehearsed critical incident plan will kick in. Patients will diverted to other hospitals and, if need be, existing patients will be transferred to other hospitals as well. This is another good example of the benefits of having a National Health Service where trusts are used to helping each other out if they encounter serious problems.\u201d Turning to party politics briefly, Ian Lavery and Barry Gardiner are to leave the shadow cabinet. Gardiner has said new leader Keir Starmer contacted him to \u201cstand him down\u201d, while it is currently unclear whether Lavery left of his own accord. The owner of London\u2019s ExCel centre, the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company, has said it will no longer charge the NHS to use the site for the temporary Nightingale hospital. ExCel chief executive Jeremy Rees told the BBC an initial agreement with the NHS to had \u201cincluded a contribution to some fixed costs\u201d. But he said: \u201cWe have since decided to cover the fixed costs ourselves.\u201d The Sunday Times reported that the centre, which is owned by ADNEC, was charging the NHS between \u00a32m and \u00a33m in rent to use the east London site. Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, managing director and group chief executive of ADNEC, said: To be clear, profit has always been the furthest thing from our minds. It is our firm commitment that we will not charge a penny for the use of our facilities, and we will provide the NHS with the operational and logistical support it needs for NHS Nightingale London. The ExCeL\u2019s decision to charge the NHS was in contrast to the NEC in Birmingham, owned by the American private equity giant Blackstone, which is reportedly providing the venue for free. Wayne Rooney has criticised the government and Premier League for putting Britain\u2019s top-flight footballers in a \u201cno-win situation\u201d over the issue of pay cuts, with Gary Lineker and Gary Neville also speaking out. Writing in the Sunday Times, Rooney claimed his fellow professionals were being lined up as \u201ceasy targets\u201d in the wider response to the coronavirus crisis, and branded government criticism of players \u201ca disgrace\u201d. The Premier League\u2019s proposed 30% wage cut or deferral strategy for players was discussed in a conference call with the PFA and the League Managers Association on Saturday. The players\u2019 union later issued a statement suggesting such a move could result in a \u00a3200m tax deficit. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, led calls for Premier League footballers to accept pay cuts, insisting players should \u201cplay their part\u201d by reducing their lucrative salaries. In response, Rooney said he is willing and able to make significant financial contributions, but felt the public pressure being exerted on players was unhelpful. If the government approached me to help support nurses financially or buy ventilators I\u2019d be proud to do so, as long as I knew where the money was going. I\u2019m in a position where I could give something up. Not every footballer is in the same position. Yet suddenly the whole profession has been put on the spot with a demand for 30% pay cuts across the board. Why are footballers suddenly the scapegoats? How the past few days have played out is a disgrace. He [Hancock] was supposed to be giving the nation the latest on the biggest crisis we\u2019ve faced in our lifetimes. Why was the pay of footballers even in his head? Was he desperate to divert attention from his government\u2019s handling of this pandemic? Gary Lineker has also said it is unfair to single out high-earning athletes but expressed confidence that action was imminent, citing recent conversations with players. \u201cWhy not call on all the wealthy to try and help if they possibly can rather than just pick on footballers?\u201d Lineker said during an appearance on Andrew Marr\u2019s BBC One programme. \u201cNobody seems to talk about the bankers, the CEOs, huge millionaires. Are they standing up? Are they being asked to stand up? We don\u2019t know.\u201d Lineker was critical of top-flight clubs, including l Liverpool and Tottenham, who have furloughed non-playing staff using the safety net of the Government\u2019s job retention scheme. \u201cThat\u2019s a different matter entirely,\u201d Lineker said. \u201cThe big clubs, you\u2019d have thought, would have been savvy enough to perhaps try to help more of their workers when players are earning so much money.\u201d In a statement issued by the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director (see 12.32pm), it was suggested that the chief medical officer merely went to check on her second home this weekend with her family. Now Catherine Calderwood has admitted she also went there last weekend, questions are being raised over how often must one check on their second home. Sturgeon did not provide her absolute backing to Calderwood future in the barnstorming press conference. She said Calderwood had offered to do whatever is in the best interest of the country. \u201cIn my view, that would not be her resignation,\u201d she said. Politicians have criticised the provision of personal protective equipment after a care home worker in Scotland with suspected Covid-19 died. Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said access to protective clothing and equipment for health and social care staff is a \u201cproblem across Scotland\u201d and called on the Scottish government to take urgent action. Baillie, who represents Dumbarton, said: In this time of crisis, we all owe a huge debt of gratitude to those heroic health and care workers who risk their lives daily to care for and treat those in need. This very sad news will come as a great blow to the family and to my local community. My thoughts are with them and I share in their grief. It is clear that access to protective clothing and equipment for health and social care staff is a problem across Scotland. Supplies are rationed because there is simply not enough and the strategy appears to be determined by that shortage of supply, rather than what health guidance dictates. This is simply not good enough and is putting lives at risk. The Scottish government must act urgently to protect our brave frontline workers. It is our duty to do so.\u201d Hazel Nolan, from the GMB union, said advice and guidance to home care workers had been resource-led, not science-led. Not everyone is ignoring the government guidelines, according to the Guardian\u2019s Miles Brignall. This was the A1 in Hertfordshire at midday today. Not a car in sight. It was junction nine, for any motorway nerds. The number of new people tested daily in the UK for coronavirus is back above 10,000, today\u2019s figures from the Department of Health show. A total of 12,334 new people were reported as being tested in the 24 hours up until 9am today. The equivalent figure for yesterday had slipped below 10,000, having previously been above 10,000 for two days in a row. On Thursday, Matt Hancock set out a goal of moving from 10,000 tests a day to 100,000 by the end of April. This would include swab testing in Public Health England and NHS labs, using commercial partners including universities and private businesses, and introducing antibody blood tests. The total number of people in the UK tested since the outbreak began - 195,524 - is the equivalent of around 293 people in every 100,000, or 0.3% of the population. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has taken 15 days to go from just over 5,000 \u2013 5,018 as of 9am March 21 \u2013 to nearly 50,000 \u2013 47,806 as of 9am April 5. Sturgeon would not be drawn on whether the CMO has put at risk the wellbeing of those who have been following the government\u2019s stay-at-home guidance and could be prevented from exercising under measures threatened by the health secretary earlier today due to people allegedly flouting existing rules. Asked why Calderwood has received a warning while people have received fines for sitting in their cars, Sturgeon said it is not a case of one rule for some and one rule for others, but that she cannot speak for the police. Calderwood said she is \u201ctruly sorry\u201d for not adhering to coronavirus guidelines by visiting her second home, adding she had \u201cno excuses\u201d for \u201cnot following the advice she has been giving to others\u201d. She said she cannot justify her actions and can only apologise unreservedly. People make mistakes, according to Sturgeon. The chief medical officer made a mistake in travelling away from her home. Whatever her reasons for doing so it was wrong and she knows that. All of us, including me, will make mistakes in these unprecedented times we are living in. When we do we must be candid about it and learn from it. She said Calderwood is learning from her error and that her advice and expertise during the pandemic has been invaluable. Sturgeon said any loss of this expertise would damage the government. The chief medical officer for Scotland has revealed that she was also at her holiday home in Fife last weekend. Seemingly in response to calls for her resignation, she said she would continue to concentrate on her job. Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said two more people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Scotland, bringing the total deaths there to 220. Sturgeon said this figure, up from 218 on Saturday, should not be taken as being \u201ctruly representative\u201d of the number of deaths, as the way Covid-19 deaths are being notified is changing. She said the figure is \u201clikely to be artificially low\u201d. An NHS nurse has made an emotional appeal to the public to observe lockdown measures. In a video filmed between two ICU shifts, Shirley Watts said the coronavirus crisis had left the NHS \u201con our knees\u201d. A total of 4,934 patients have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Saturday, the Department of Health has said. That is an increase of 621 from 4,313 yesterday when there were 708 new deaths confirmed in the UK \u2013 the largest 24-hour increase since the outbreak began. As of 9am on Sunday, a total of 195,524 people have been tested for Covid, 47,806 of whom tested positive, according to the Department of Health. As my colleagues reported yesterday, the NHS England figures \u2013 which make up the bulk of UK deaths \u2013 reflect the day on which the death was reported, not the actual date of death, which is usually days, sometimes weeks, before it appears in the figures. Public Health Wales has said 12 more people who had tested positive for Covid-19 have died, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 166. The total number of confirmed deaths of people who tested positive for coronavirus in hospitals in England has risen to 4,494, NHS England has said, an increase of 555. The patients were aged between 33 years and 103 years old and 29 of them were aged between 35 and 95 years old and had no known underlying health conditions, according to NHS England. The patients were from the following regions: East of England 40 London 174 Midlands 74 North East &amp; Yorkshire 103 North West 47 South East 81 South West 36 The daily update on UK coronavirus cases will be released later on Sunday, the Department of Health said. The number of people who have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus has risen by seven to 63, health officials have said. Tests have confirmed a further 91 positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the region to 1,089, though the true total is almost certainly much higher. We should have statistics for the rest of the UK shortly. The Observer\u2019s Nosheen Iqbal has been speaking with the volunteers delivering food to people\u2019s homes. Keir Starmer has received a briefing from senior government officials on the coronavirus pandemic. A spokesman for the new Labour leader said: This afternoon Keir Starmer was briefed over the phone by senior government officials about the coronavirus pandemic. During the call, the Labour leader reiterated his commitment to work constructively with the government in the national interest. Cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance were on the call. A investment management firm founded by Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the House of Commons, has been accused of profiteering from the coronavirus crisis. The MP reportedly owns 15% of Somerset Capital Management (SCM) and amidst the economic disruption caused by coronavirus it is believed that the company has been investing in businesses whose values have fallen but are expected to rally. First reported by the Sunday Mirror, the business\u2019 fund manager Mark Asquith said in a piece of promotional material for investors: History has shown us that super normal returns can be made during this type of environment. Market dislocations of this magnitude happen rarely, perhaps once or twice in a generation, and have historically provided excellent entry points for investors. Strategies such as those believed to have been employed by SCM are not uncommon but new Labour leader Keir Starmer said \u201cnobody should be seeking to take advantage of this crisis\u201d. Prof David Oliver, an NHS consultant physician, has said that there is a \u201cconstant anxiety\u201d among healthcare workers that they could become infected. He told the BBC: Its widely acknowledged that we could have been quicker to provide [protective] equipment to frontline staff. And also the advice has changed two or three times. My perception now is we do have regularly updated and very clear guidance. We\u2019re telling everybody else stay at home and don\u2019t mingle. But its the nature of our work that we have to come into buildings every day and come into contact with clinical colleagues and we don\u2019t know what members of the team have already been infected. Police have visited Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood and issued her with a warning after she visited her second home. Scotland\u2019s chief constable Iain Livingstone said in a statement: Earlier today, local officers visited Dr Catherine Calderwood and spoke to her about her actions, reiterated crucial advice and issued a warning about her future conduct, all of which she accepted. The legal instructions on not leaving your home without a reasonable excuse apply to everyone. The former boss of the McLaren Formula One team, businessman Ron Dennis, has launched an initiative to provide one million free meals to frontline NHS workers. He said he co-founded SalutetheNHS.org to feed thousands of hospital staff because he was \u201cin awe\u201d of their work to save lives during the coronavirus pandemic. This is a time when all of us, individuals and businesses alike, need to stand up and be counted in the effort to combat Covid-19. We\u2019re all in this together. I am delighted to be leading this initiative to help ensure that vital NHS workers have nutritious meals while they work every hour in this fight. It means they have one less thing to worry about. The Dennis family is donating \u00a31m through their charity foundation Dreamchasing, alongside 500,000 in match-funding. Tesco will donate food for the meals and the initiative is supported by catering group Absolute Taste and delivery service Yodel. Meals will be made available, for free, to ICU teams, anaesthetic teams and A&amp;E staff who are unable to leave their clinical areas during their 12-hour shifts. Deliveries will start at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford tomorrow and at London children\u2019s hospital Great Ormond Street the following week, before being rolled out to Government-targeted locations. Thousands of casual workers at some of English football\u2019s biggest stadiums have been left unpaid during the Covid-19 shutdown, the Guardian understands. A number of employees from Delaware North \u2013 which provides catering and hospitality services at venues such as the Emirates Stadium, London Stadium, Wembley, Craven Cottage and the Ricoh Arena \u2013 have contacted the Guardian after seeing booked shifts cancelled and receiving no payments since the Premier League season halted last month. Some of the workers, who are on zero-hour or casual arrangements, feel increasingly desperate. The casual workers complain the company has told them there are no shifts for them because of the impact of Covid-19 and that it is trying to establish whether they are eligible to be furloughed under the government\u2019s coronavirus job retention scheme. A long-standing casual employee at one of the venues told the Guardian that they work there for up to five days a week but saw that income stream removed as soon as the season was paused. They said they had received no payment for the shifts they had committed to. Lord Bath of Longleat has died aged 87 after testing positive for coronavirus. Alexander Thynn, the 7th Marquess of Bath, died on Saturday after being admitted to the Royal United Hospital in Bath on March 28. During his time there, it was confirmed that he had Covid-19. Longleat Safari Park confirmed the news in a Facebook post on Sunday, expressing their \u201cdeepest sadness\u201d at Lord Bath\u2019s death. The family would like to express their great appreciation for the dedicated team of nurses, doctors and other staff who cared so professionally and compassionately for Alexander in these extremely difficult times for everyone. They would politely request a period of privacy to deal with their loss. Aspects of our national life are suddenly in the foreground \u2013 from the NHS, through all those low-paid key workers, to spontaneous community initiatives that transcend most of the social divides we were told were insurmountable, writes the Guardian\u2019s John Harris. If the Conservatives cannot turn them into a national story, someone else should at least try \u2013 not for immediate electoral gain, but for two other reasons. In the short-term, it could help many of us to get out of bed every morning and face the day. Looking further ahead, it might start to map out what kind of country we might become when the horrors of the coronavirus begin to recede. On the evidence of the past few months, Starmer may be too bloodless and cautious a politician to pull this off. Maybe his remainer convictions, and widespread mistrust of his party, will deny him a big enough audience. But in the speech released as his victory was announced, there were at least hints of what the moment requires: the elegant recognition that in the midst of the crisis, \u201ctoo many will have given too much\u201d and \u201csome of us will have lost too much\u201d; the unanswerable claim that \u201cwe know, in our hearts, [that] things are going to have to change.\u201d There are reports of children arriving at hospitals with illnesses at more advanced stages than they usually would be at the point of admission, according to the UK\u2019s child health professional body. The president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Russell Viner, has privately contacted the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, to urge for an immediate change in the government\u2019s public information strategy as parents appear reluctant or afraid to go to hospital with their children, OpenDemocracy reported. With vast green spaces such as Victoria Park in London now closed, people are taking to smaller parks to exercise. But why not turn golf courses into exercising spots to allow people to more easily socially distance? The volume of calls to the NHS 111 helpline has surged by 400% since the spread of the coronavirus became a national health crisis. The free service, which offers urgent but non-emergency care advice, has been inundated with calls from Britons since the start of March when the virus took hold. Vodafone, which provides the lines and handles the call traffic for the NHS 111 call centre, said it had doubled capacity to handle 2,400 calls simultaneously. The call centre has experienced huge surges in the number of calls, hitting a peak of 1,100 simultaneously at one point \u2013 four times more than the peaks before the health emergency. Daily peaks vary widely, but for example last Saturday it was 500. The Scotman\u2019s Paris Gourtsoyannis has questioned how the Scottish government\u2019s national clinical director could be certain that the chief medical officer observed social distancing during her visit to Fife (see 11.58am). ITV\u2019s Peter Smith warns that the apparent mixed messaging is becoming dangerous. Waitrose and John Lewis are donating 50,000 boxes of Easter confectionery to NHS workers as a small token of their appreciation in the run-up to Easter. Truffles and mini Easter eggs from John Lewis will be available to NHS staff shopping at 51 stores until the Easter weekend. The Waitrose branches have been chosen due to their proximity to NHS hospitals, with shops based in locations including London, Dorset, Hampshire, Northumberland and the West Midlands. Peter Cross, director of customer experience at the John Lewis Partnership, said: In these extremely difficult times, we wanted to make a small gesture to those working on the frontline. We hope these gifts will go a little way in helping to express our gratitude and simply brighten up the day a little for the NHS staff who are working tirelessly in really challenging circumstances. John Lewis has also donated care packs with items such as pillows, phone chargers, eye masks and hand cream to hospitals to make breaks more comfortable for staff. Matt Hancock should have stayed home for longer than seven days after contracting Covid-19, Labour\u2019s newly-elected deputy leader Angela Rayner has said. The government\u2019s guidelines state that if you have symptoms of coronavirus, you need to self-isolate at home for seven days or for as long as you still have a high temperature, and anyone you live with should stay in for 14 days even if they do not have any symptoms. However, the World Health Organisation has recommended people self-quarantine for a fortnight after possible Covid exposure or having contracted the virus. Rayner, who herself has been self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, said she was in bed for six days and her symptoms were \u201cvery debilitating\u201d. Speaking to Sky News\u2019 Sophie Ridge On Sunday, she said: I\u2019m disappointed that Matt Hancock, after seven days of having the virus, went out when the World Health Organisation has said you should self-isolate for 14 days. I think it\u2019s right that we do that because I cannot stress enough the severity of the symptoms that I have suffered, as you can tell from how breathless I am still now, and I\u2019m day nine, day 10. I think the government really need to give that clarity and continue to support people doing the right thing. Hancock announced on Friday March 27 he had tested positive for Covid-19, and he came out of isolation on Thursday and presented the daily Downing Street press conference. He is assumed to have self-isolated for 24 hours before he made his positive diagnosis public. Meanwhile, prime minister Boris Johnson remains in isolation as he still has a temperature after going into isolation on March 27. Right wing think tank the Henry Jackson society has claimed that China is liable to pay the UK, along with the other G7 nations, billions in compensation due to alleged underreporting of the scale of the coronavirus outbreak, amid growing calls from Tory MPs led by former deputy prime minister Damien Green for a reset in UK-China relations. The chief medical officer for Scotland, Catherine Calderwood, is now facing calls to resign after she appeared to flout her own advice and visited her coastal second home with her family. Scottish Labour health spokesperson Monica Lennon said: The first minister and her top team must lead by example during this crisis which continues to take lives on a daily basis. The message that people should stay at home to save lives and protect the NHS is the right one. The chief medical officer delivers that instruction on behalf of the government but has failed to follow her own advice. Her actions have undermined Scotland\u2019s pandemic response and her own credibility. Unfortunately, it means she cannot and should not continue in her role. Her position as CMO has become untenable. Rennie and Wendy Chamberlain, the Lib Dem MSP for North East Fife and a former police officer, said government officials such as Calderwood had to command public confidence at a time of crisis. If we are going to get through this pandemic we need medical leaders who everyone can follow. It is with great regret that we say that the chief medical officer will need to go. Local people are irate that holidaymakers and second home owners have ignored the warnings from the chief medical officer to stay at home. The main street was described as being like a motorway and many second homes are full up,\u201d they said. There is real concern that with a swollen population and a virus sweeping through the local health services will just not cope. Prof Neil Ferguson of London University\u2019s Imperial College, one of the scientists whose modelling of the virus helped prompt the lockdown, told Andrew Marr earlier that it was difficult to know when it might be eased, as this would depend on how quickly case numbers reduce. There is no point, having gone through this effort, in releasing a lockdown at a point where case numbers are still high and will resurge even faster than we have seen before. We want case numbers to get to a low point where we can start substituting other measures for the most intrusive and economically costly aspects of the current lockdown. Ferguson said it was also hard to predict total death numbers, but he believed these could be \u201canywhere between 7,000 or so up to a little over 20,000\u201d. Here\u2019s the full story: ITV presenter Piers Morgan and businessman Alan Sugar have disagreed over whether people should be allowed to sunbathe. Matt Hancock said he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to calls for nurses to receive a pay rise. The starting salary for a nurse is \u00a324,214, according to Unison, and the more than 300,000 nurses have suffered real terms pay cuts due to government-imposed wage restraints over the past decade. Asked if nurses deserved a pay rise, Hancock told Andrew Marr: Everybody wants to support our nurses right now and I\u2019m sure there will be a time to debate things like that. At the moment the thing that we\u2019re working on is how to get through this. So I\u2019m very sympathetic to that argument but now is not the moment to enter into a pay negotiation, now is the moment for everybody to be doing their very best. Tributes are being paid to NHS staff known to have died after contracting Covid-19. Two nurses \u2013 both young mothers - five doctors and two healthcare assistants have contracted the coronavirus and died since the start of the outbreak, and there are reports of further such deaths. Nurse Areema Nasreen, 36, died just after midnight on April 2 in intensive care at Walsall Manor Hospital in the West Midlands - the hospital where she had worked for 16 years. Her sister Kazeema, 33, said: She was a legend. Everyone remembers her with so much love and heartbreak because she had so much love to give. She was like a mum to us. She looked after us all. Richard Beeken, chief executive of Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: \u201cAny death is devastating but losing one of our own is beyond words.\u201d He said Nasreen had started at the hospital as a housekeeper in 2003 before gaining her nursing qualification in 2019. Her dedication to her role and her popularity amongst her colleagues is obvious to see with the outpouring of grief and concern we are seeing around the organisation and on social media. Her vocation in nursing was clear for all to see and she always said that she was so blessed to have the role of a nurse, which she absolutely loved because she wanted to feel like \u2018she could make a difference\u2019 - and you did, Areema, you will be very sadly missed. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, has apologised for visiting her second home despite herself issuing advice to stay at home. In a statement, she said: I wish to apologise unreservedly for the issue reported in the media today. While there are reasons for what I did, they do not justify it and they were not legitimate reasons to be out of my home. While I and my family followed the guidance on social distancing at all times, I understand that I did not follow the advice I am giving to others, and I am truly sorry for that. I know how important this advice is and I do not want my mistake to distract from that. I have a job to do as chief medical officer to provide advice to ministers on the path of this virus and to support the medical profession as they work night and day to save lives, and having spoken with the first minister this morning I will continue to focus entirely on that job. A 20-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly wiping his saliva on products in a Dorset supermarket. The man entered the Lidl store on St Andrews Road in Bridport wearing a face mask and gloves at about 2pm on Friday, Dorset Police said. He was seen to lower the mask and lick his fingers before \u201cpurposefully\u201d rubbing them onto an item in the store. The force said the individual was arrested and charged with an offence of contaminating or interfering with goods with intent under Section 38 of the Public Order Act 1986. He is due to appear before Weymouth Magistrates\u2019 Court on Monday. Dorset Police said the suspect did not have a confirmed case of Covid-19 and was not displaying any symptoms. Nursing Notes, an online publication for healthcare professionals, has announced the death of John Alagos, a 27-year-old nurse at Watford general hospital. His mother, Gina Gustilo told the Mail on Sunday that her son had not been wearing full personal protective equipment despite treating coronavirus patients. They wear PPE, but not totally protective of the mouth. They wear the normal masks. Alagos was found unconscious in his bedroom following a 12-hour night shift on Friday after complaining of suffering a headache and high temperature upon his return home, according to reports. Watford General Hospital said in a statement: Our staff are fully briefed on the symptoms of Covid-19 and we would never expect anyone to remain at work if they were showing these symptoms or indeed were unwell in any way. We have always kept our staff updated on the latest PPE guidance to make sure they have the right level of protection ... John was very popular and will be missed greatly. It did not confirm whether Alagos had died from Covid. More details will emerge in due course. Nursing Notes has launched a digital memorial mapping health and social care professionals who have lost their lives during the fight against Covid. Matt Hancock, the health secretary said the government is on track to have ventilator capacity for 18,000 patients but that it may not be in place before the expected peak of the virus. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show earlier, he said: We need to make sure we have more ventilators than there are people who need ventilation. At the moment we have between 9,000 and 10,000 ventilators within the NHS right now and we have the 2,000 spare that are critical care beds with ventilator capacity should people need to come into them and we\u2019re ramping that up. The answer is that our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks. Asked how many there will be in a week\u2019s time: \u201cThere should be another 1,500.\u201d On whether the country will be below the capacity it needs in a week\u2019s time when the virus is expected to peak, Hancock said: \u201cNo, because thankfully we\u2019ve got the demand down because the vast majority of people are following their social distancing guidelines.\u201d He added there are no immediate plans to roll-out antibody testing - to test if people have had the virus and recovered - because they are \u201cnot good enough\u201d. Random testing, to provide a survey of how many people have had the virus and where, to better map the outbreak, is ongoing, Hancock said. Results of the first survey are being processed and would be made public in due course, he added. Starmer said he would support the government if they were to ban outdoor exercise due to some people flouting lockdown rules. \u201cWe do have to take whatever steps are necessary. Social distancing, staying indoors, is really difficult for people,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s particularly difficult if you don\u2019t have a garden or if you\u2019re in a flat, and I know there are many people in overcrowded accommodation. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to get through this and every time people break the guidance from the government they put other people at risk. \u201cIf the health service can\u2019t cope, people will die. You can see that that\u2019s happening every day.\u201d He added: \u201cI know it\u2019s tough, I know it\u2019s difficult, we are all missing each other, we realise how much social contact matters. \u201cBut I would support the government in this if that\u2019s what they decide to do.\u201d Starmer insisted that his party would scrutinise the government, but would not try to \u201cscore party political points\u201d. He added that prime minister Boris Johnson had allowed him one-to-one privy council meetings with experts and politicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to pull together, support the government where it\u2019s right to do so, but asking those difficult questions matters,\u201d said Starmer. \u201cYou can see that when the difficult questions were asked on testing, things began to move. Same thing with equipment on the frontline. \u201cScrutiny is important here. Because if scrutiny points out mistakes that can then be put right, it\u2019s an important thing. But not opposition for opposition\u2019s sake. \u201cI\u2019m not going to score party political points and I won\u2019t demand the impossible.\u201d When asked by Marr if he would consider joining a national government to deal with the crisis, Starmer reiterated the arrangements he has already made with the prime minister. Labour\u2019s newly-elected leader, Keir Starmer, told Andrew Marr that his party would ask the government \u201cdifficult questions\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI think this would be difficult for any government. I do think there have been mistakes along the way\u201d, he said. Starmer said he did not think it was worth \u201cpicking over\u201d the herd immunity approach that the government disputes ever considering. But, he added: \u201cwe were then slow in testing, the equipment that\u2019s needed on the frontline isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cBut I want to be very, very clear that I\u2019m going to engage constructively with the government. \u201cI spoke to the prime minister yesterday and said to him that I mean what I say about constructive engagement. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a duty here to save lives and protect our country and the Labour party under my leadership will ask difficult questions but only for the purpose of pointing out mistakes so they can be put right.\u201d In response to some frontline NHS workers having to use items such as bin liners as protective equipment, Hancock said the government were shipping \u201ctens of millions\u201d of personal protective equipment items to the UK a day. \u201cWe\u2019ve upgraded the PPE standards. Also we\u2019ve got a system coming in to deliver against those standards using the army,\u201d he said \u201cWe\u2019re asking people to put themselves in harms way to care for others and we\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019ve got the equipment.\u201d On Thursday, the government upgraded the standards of PPE that frontline doctors and nurses are expected to wear from aprons to gowns. Hancock said that calls to a hotline for NHS workers over the lack of protective equipment had declined, although there were \u201cabsolutely\u201d still some problems. He added that three nurses had died from Covid-19. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said the government could ban exercise outdoors if people flout lockdown rules. After saying earlier that sunbathing is against lockdown rules, he told Andrew Marr that if people flout them \u201cwe might have to take further action\u201d. \u201cI understand how difficult these measures are, of course I do. But the truth is the more people go out from home, the more the virus spreads,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve said because of the positive benefits to your physical and your mental health that it\u2019s ok to exercise on your own or with members of your own household. \u201cBut if the result of that is that too many people go out and flout the other rules because they say \u2018well if I can exercise, then it\u2019s fine for me to do other things\u2019, then I\u2019m afraid we will have to take action. \u201cMy message is really clear, if you don\u2019t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you\u2019ve got to follow the rules.\u201d Axel von Trotsenburg, the World Bank managing director of operations, has warned of an impending global recession. Speaking on Marr, he said: \u201cWhat we are seeing today is unprecedented. Certainly we haven\u2019t seen something alike since the second world war and also not during the financial crisis 11 years ago.\u201d He added that during the last week, 6.6m people in the US applied for unemployment benefits, on top of 3.3m people who filed the week before. The World bank would be providing financial assistance worth $160bn to poorer countries over the next 15 months. \u201cWe need to consider that these health systems are the weakest in the world and we need to provide our full support,\u201d he added. Professor Neil Ferguson has said there are \u201csome signs\u201d that the current lockdown measures in force across the UK has slowed down the coronavirus epidemic. Ferguson, a key epidemiologist in advising the government, told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show that he thinks the crisis will \u201cplateau in the next week to 10 days\u201d. Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s new deputy leader, said the party would work with the government to battle the coronavirus pandemic but would hold it to account. Speaking to Sky New\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Rayner said the government\u2019s was failing on testing, and on protecting frontline NHS staff, and ensuring businesses and employees could \u201cdo the right thing\u201d. Rayner believes she has experienced symptoms in line with those of the coronavirus including a sore throat, a temperature, a headache and fatigue. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that Matt Hancock after seven days of having the virus went out when the World Health Organisation has said that you should wait for 14 days,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to exercise that and I think it\u2019s right that we should do that.\u201d Former health secretary Alan Johnson has condemned the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. The former Labour MP told Sophy Ridge on Sunday: \u201cI am absolutely amazed at how badly prepared the government is for this.\u201d He added that during his tenure as health secretary, in which the swine flu pandemic took place in 2009, the government had a risk register. \u201cTop of our risk register was a pandemic,\u201d he said, saying that second on the list was a terror attack. He added that the basic arrangements that government\u2019s should be prepared for in the event of a pandemic was protective equipment for NHS staff, alongside testing. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of The Doctors\u2019 Association UK, has raised concerns about the \u201csevere lack\u201d of personal protective equipment (PPE) for frontline NHS workers. He told Sky News that some doctors had told the association that they were having to reuse single-use surgical masks, while others were holding their breath during procedures on coronavirus patients because they didn\u2019t know if their equipment would offer enough protection. He added that some doctors, many of whom did not have symptoms in line with Covid-19 but who lived with people who did, had been sent to a NHS testing centre only to be told their name doesn\u2019t appear on a list and they couldn\u2019t be tested. The prime minister Boris Johnson is in \u201cgood spirits\u201d but still has a temperature over a week after he was diagnosed with Covid-19, according to Hancock. \u201cThe prime minister is working away inside downing street but he\u2019s making sure he protects others by following public health advice,\u201d he added. Hancock, who also contracted the virus, said he did not know if Johnson had been visited by doctors at Downing Street. Hancock said that 8% of NHS frontline staff were currently off work self-isolating amid the coronavirus outbreak. Within that group, 5.7% of doctors are currently off work. \u201cThose figures are stable but we want to get them down obviously, and one of the ways we do that is make sure testing goes up,\u201d said Hancock. Health secretary Matt Hancock is first up on Sophy Ridge on Sky News this morning, emphasising that people should not flout the coronavirus lockdown rules despite the warm weather. \u201cSunbathing is against the rules that have been set out for important public health reasons,\u201d he said, adding that it was \u201cunbelievable frankly to see some people are not following that advice\u201d. \u201cI say this to the very small minority of people who are choosing to flout the guidance you are putting other\u2019s lives at risk and you are putting yourself in harm\u2019s way.\u201d He added that the \u201cvast majority of the public\u201d were following guidance to stay at home unless they are going to buy essentials such as food or medicine, seeking medical care, going to work, or exercising. Hancock\u2019s call for the public to adhere to public health guidance comes as Lambeth Council closed Brockwell Park in south-west London on Saturday, after it claimed that more than 3,000 people had spent the day in the park, sunbathing or hanging out in large groups. I\u2019m Amy Walker, covering the liveblog for the next two hours, you can follow me on Twitter at @amyrwalker. Good morning, and welcome to Sunday\u2019s UK-focused coronavirus live blog. We\u2019ll bring you all the news as it happens, with Matt Hancock due to appear on Sophy Ridge\u2019s Sky News programme this morning along with new Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner. Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s successor Keir Starmer gives his first big interview after yesterday\u2019s victory to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr. We\u2019re also expecting the first names in his shadow cabinet to be announced. Starmer has a daunting to-do list as he begins his first full day as Labour leader. The Observer\u2019s Michael Savage has summarised the challenge ahead of him, from Covid-19 and the economy to antisemitism: Elsewhere, London mayor Sadiq Khan has described his \u201cdevastation\u201d that five London bus workers have died after testing positive for coronavirus and urged people to stay home on another sunny day. And there are troubling signs in the midlands, where the death toll has now accelerated past the capital.",

      "bodyText": "Private health insurance funds stand to reap a windfall of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn due to a dramatic fall in elective surgery and other medical procedures during the coronavirus crisis, according to new research from the Australia Institute thinktank. Health expert Roy Harvey said if the funds failed to pass on the dramatic fall in costs to customers, more people will flee a private health insurance system that is already in a death spiral. Harvey, who worked with Australia Institute research director Rod Campbell on the report, said that if premiums were cut in line with services the federal government would also save $1bn to $1.5bn a year in subsidies. The Australia Institute paper, \u201cPrivate eyes ..., hips, etc\u201d, models the effect on the funds if benefits paid to members drop by between 30% and 50% during a six-month period. Factors taken into account include health minister Greg Hunt\u2019s decision last week to pay at least $1.3bn to private hospitals to take over beds potentially needed to accommodate Covid-19 victims, and sweeping bans on dental services introduced by dentists. Harvey said that many funds have abandoned premium hikes that were planned for this month, but this was not enough. \u201cThey\u2019ve been saying we won\u2019t put through the 4% increase that they\u2019re allowed to do in April, but if they say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ll give you a 40% discount\u2019, people might stay. \u201cIf they keep their rates unchanged, people will leave in droves.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic has hit a private health industry that experts say was already in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d because young people, who get relatively little from the product, have quit paying premiums. This has left the funds with a membership increasingly weighted towards older people, who typically require more expensive medical procedures. The escalating financial instability of the industry led the regulator to warn in February that only three will be viable in two years unless urgent action is taken. \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019re not talking about a viable system or a product people want to buy,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cThe thing is unsustainable, it\u2019s undermining the public hospital principle of equity and allowing doctors to charge fees that take people out of the public hospitals.\u201d He said it was hard to estimate the impact of the pandemic on private health using publicly available figures, but the $3.5bn to $5.5bn range was a good starting point. \u201cI think any detailed study would come up with figures that are in the range,\u201d he said. \u201cOther people can say, \u2018Oh, I think it\u2019s this or that\u2019, but it\u2019s really to get a discussion started. \u201cThe Productivity Commission could sort this out in less than a week in terms of getting good estimates.\u201d He said the funds should be held accountable for their windfall and money saved by the government could be used to fund other things, such as domestic violence services, that are needed during the pandemic. \u201cThe savings to the commonwealth alone could be one to one and a half billion [dollars] \u2013 one and a half billion used to be a lot of money once,\u201d he said. Campbell said the insurers looked set to trouser their windfall billions. \u201cInsurers claim to be supporting their members through the crisis by delaying premium increases, but they should be passing on these significant savings to households,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the commonwealth does not ensure savings are passed on to customers, it will be one of the most egregious subsidies ever given to an industry already infamous for receiving handouts.\u201d",

If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it\u2019s happening to Aboriginal people it\u2019s like it\u2019s expected.\u201d The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses \u2013 down from 34 in March 2019 \u2013 and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing. \u201cThe average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said. \u201cThe government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol. \u201cThis investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The scramble for face masks has created a \u201cmadhouse\u201d atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line.</p> \n<p>Producers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai.</p> \n<p>Crotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a madhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney talks. The factory knows one thing: what\u2019s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that\u2019s who is going to get the production time.\u201d</p> \n<p>Factories that have quickly changed their production lines to make masks are demanding 50% payment when an order is made and the other 50% before the masks leave the factory. With scams proliferating, those are often unacceptable terms to many buyers, especially those spending taxpayers\u2019 money.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe factory doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting orders from people they\u2019ve never heard of before. It\u2019s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver\u2019s seat. And they\u2019re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US.</p> \n<p>The masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications.</p> \n<p>Some European countries are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/lombardy-insists-on-face-masks-outside-homes-to-stop-covid-19\">weighing up</a> whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d</p> \n<p>French and German officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/mask-wars-coronavirus-outbidding-demand\">blamed the US last week</a> for using \u201cwild west\u201d tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair.</p> \n<p>Over the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had \u201cseized\u201d a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city\u2019s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/200-000-atemschutzmasken-doch-nicht-konfisziert-lieferung-fuer-berliner-polizei-wurde-in-thailand-zu-besserem-preis-aufgekauft/25715448.html\">modern piracy</a>\u201d from Berlin\u2019s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/200-000-atemschutzmasken-doch-nicht-konfisziert-lieferung-fuer-berliner-polizei-wurde-in-thailand-zu-besserem-preis-aufgekauft/25715448.html\">Der Tagesspiegel</a> newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was.</p> \n<p>Der Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use \u201cany and all authority\u201d to procure the protective equipment it needs.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need the masks.

      "bodyText": "The scramble for face masks has created a \u201cmadhouse\u201d atmosphere among Chinese manufacturers, who are making huge profits as customers around the world fight to be the first in line. Producers of masks and respirators are demanding to be paid in full before the products leave their factories and are supplying whoever can pay the most and pay fastest, according to Michael Crotty, a textile broker based in Shanghai. Crotty, of Golden Pacific Fashion and Design, said he had spent all of Sunday dealing with a flood of new enquiries from US states, national governments, cities, hospitals, distributors and private companies seeking to protect their employees. \u201cIt\u2019s just a madhouse,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney talks. The factory knows one thing: what\u2019s in my bank account and when did it get there? And if it gets there before the other guy then that\u2019s who is going to get the production time.\u201d Factories that have quickly changed their production lines to make masks are demanding 50% payment when an order is made and the other 50% before the masks leave the factory. With scams proliferating, those are often unacceptable terms to many buyers, especially those spending taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cThe factory doesn\u2019t care,\u201d Crotty said. \u201cThey\u2019re getting orders from people they\u2019ve never heard of before. It\u2019s a really unusual circumstance to have these factories absolutely in the driver\u2019s seat. And they\u2019re in the driving seat not of a Volkswagen but of a Mercedes limousine.\u201d Wearing masks has long been common in parts of Asia to combat air pollution and the spread of disease, but until now was rare in Europe and the US. The masks on the market range from thin cotton coverings to fine-mesh surgical masks and respirators that form a seal over the mouth and nose and have to conform to strict specifications. Some European countries are weighing up whether to advise the public to wear masks when not at home. Last week the CDC in the US issued guidance recommending wearing a mask in public spaces. Trump has shrugged off the advice so far, saying: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d French and German officials blamed the US last week for using \u201cwild west\u201d tactics to outbid them, but Crotty said the outbidding appeared to be an all-against-all affair. Over the weekend authorities in Berlin withdrew a claim that the US had \u201cseized\u201d a shipment of 200,000 respirator masks ordered for the city\u2019s police force, a claim that led to an accusation of \u201cmodern piracy\u201d from Berlin\u2019s state interior minister, Andreas Geisel. According to Der Tagesspiegel newspaper, the police now say they were outbid while the respirators were in transit at Bangkok airport. The Berlin authorities say it is unclear where they went and who the ultimate buyer was. Der Tagesspiegel reported that the masks were made by the US manufacturer 3M, but it has denied any involvement in the transaction. The company has come under intense public pressure from Trump in recent days for continuing to supply masks to other countries. On Thursday he invoked the Federal Production Act, which dates back to the Korean war era and has given the administration the right to use \u201cany and all authority\u201d to procure the protective equipment it needs. \u201cWe need the masks. We don\u2019t want other people getting it,\u201d Trump said in a Saturday briefing to reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re instituting [the] defence production act. You could call it retaliation because that\u2019s what it is: it\u2019s a retaliation. If people don\u2019t give us what we need for our people, we\u2019re going to be very tough.\u201d 3M issued a statement on Friday saying that cutting off supplies of protective equipment to Canada and Latin America could cause a humanitarian crisis, but Trump stepped up his attacks on the company over the weekend. \u201cThe people that have dealt with them, have dealt successfully with many companies over the last month, And they don\u2019t like the way 3M has treated our country. They don\u2019t frankly like the representatives of 3M,\u201d he said. Last week the US authorised the importation of respirator masks from China made to a Chinese standard that is close to US specifications for the N95, which filters at least 95% of particles that are 0.3 microns or larger. (The European equivalent is the FFP2 respirator.) At the same time, stung by widespread reports of shoddy masks imported from China, Beijing took action to regulate producers. However, Crotty said the effect of the regulation has been to cut off supply. Beijing is only giving certification to companies that have previously sold on the Chinese domestic market, but Crotty said four-fifth of the factories he dealt with manufacture solely for the export market. \u201cOnly 20% might have these certificates, so of course they\u2019re going to raise prices higher,\u201d he said. But he added that masks without certification could still be exported if they were labelled for personal or commercial use only. Crotty said everyone involved in the market was trying to improvise in unique circumstances. \u201cNone of us have ever seen anything like this.

I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cniRV3M8gRA\" title=\"\">Botham</a> and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d</p> <p>Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler <a href=\"https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/65080/england-vs-pakistan-17th-match-prudential-world-cup-1983\" title=\"\">in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup</a>. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af74d8be4f6163e3dfbbe3ba9e87811e7e0e547c/0_0_2413_3627/665..jpg\" alt=\"Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019\" width=\"665\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toby Chasseaud in the nets. \u2018Mostly I grind it out.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: portraitcollective.com/Sam Bowle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDGns4xWFo8\" title=\"\">YouTube video</a> shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32.</p> <p>When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGHScrCxF6Y\" title=\"\">other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981</a>.</p> <p>When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing.</p> <p>Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f3e76cbeb25cfb8a995e31ff9863fbb306d3acd/0_0_3520_2497/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup\" width=\"1000\" height=\"709\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Tavar\u00e9 facing Rashid Khan on his way to 58 off 116 balls against Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Hutchison/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them.</p> <p>\u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it</p> <footer> <cite>Cyrus Patel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League.</p> <p>When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c9a02ea77d25748976c070ea050d428da89535/0_133_2048_1229/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie 83.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev and Deepika Padukone as Romi Bhatia Dev in the movie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d</p> <p>He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d</p> <p>It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/489e2b12316420144187016883cb46bd08d6adf1/0_0_4872_3264/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final\" width=\"1000\" height=\"670\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kapil Dev sparks celebrations after taking a spectacular catch to dismiss Viv Richards in the 1983 final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d.</p> <p>Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says.</p> <p>In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory.</p> <p>Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2fd0f0\" title=\"\">the first spectacularly so</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"669513d4e6a58bc75e2108bac6b1cc94e913fb6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/669513d4e6a58bc75e2108bac6b1cc94e913fb6d/0_0_960_960/500..jpg\" alt=\"Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev lifting the World Cup trophy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev lifting the World Cup trophy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: No credit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.\u201d</p> <p>The film, to be called simply 83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show.</p>",

The Guardian and Observer\u2019s own Vic Marks was the player of the match in that final, taking three for 30 from 10 overs, including that of his friend Tavar\u00e9. I ask Marks for advice before my audition. \u201cChris spoke slowly and deliberately in a deepish voice \u2013 and not that often, which led briefly to the predictable nickname of Rowdy in early England dressing rooms,\u201d Marks says. \u201cBut he had a neat sense of humour and a tendency toward self-deprecation. I always felt he was a much better player than he thought. He was very popular. Botham and Bob Willis liked him a lot \u2013 as did everyone else, especially his contrasting opening partner in 1983, Graeme Fowler.\u201d Tavar\u00e9 would make 58 (off 116 balls) in a 115 partnership with Fowler in a seven-wicket victory against Pakistan at Old Trafford in the World Cup. \u201cChris had the neatest of cricket coffins and upon dismissal he would carefully return his kit there. From his demeanour it would be hard to tell whether he had made nought or a hundred,\u201d Marks says. \u201cHe was a cautious man in several ways \u2013 he travelled to India with his own pillow (often coveted by others in some of the hotels) and pyjamas and later on he took to wearing a gumshield when batting, which meant his calling when running between the wickets produced a muffled, barely comprehensible sound, which often meant \u2018Come on then\u2019. \u201cWe all know Chris\u2019s reputation but I can promise you he played some of the most destructive innings in one-day cricket, especially at county level for Kent and then Somerset and the odd one for England. In this format he stood tall and occasionally wandered down the wicket before the ball was bowled. So it wasn\u2019t such a daft idea to have him in the World Cup squad.\u201d Another YouTube video shows highlights of Fowler and Tavar\u00e9 sharing an opening stand of 69 against India in the semi-final at Old Trafford. Tavar\u00e9\u2019s stance is very side-on. He clips the ball through midwicket for an all-run four. He later plays an almost identical shot off the bowling of Kapil Dev, which this time crosses the boundary. This is followed by a cut for four through point. He plays and misses outside off stump to Roger Binny before edging behind to be caught by Syed Kirmani for 32. When I turn up at the Indoor Cricket Centre at Lord\u2019s in November 2018 I find I\u2019m in a group of six players all auditioning for parts, though I\u2019m the only Tavar\u00e9. One chap has to fill the big boots of Botham. Another is auditioning to be the Australian Trevor Chappell and says he has struggled to find much footage of him other than the notorious under-arm bowling incident of 1981. When I\u2019m asked to speak to camera in the nerves of the moment I forget to talk like Tavar\u00e9. Then I\u2019m asked to bowl my left-arm spin, which I don\u2019t think will help my chances of being cast as Tavar\u00e9 because a) he wasn\u2019t left-handed and b) he didn\u2019t bowl in the World Cup. Still, I\u2019m asked to deliver a ball and sledge the nonexistent batsman \u2013 not necessarily Tavar\u00e9-like behaviour, I think. But then other roles are up for grabs. I\u2019m asked to bowl another ball, appeal loudly and celebrate. Because the ball I bowl has hit neither a pad nor an edge, I forget to appeal straight away, which is embarrassing. Next it\u2019s time to bat. The bowling machine spits a ball at me and I try to drive but manage only to squirt away a bottom edge. The following three deliveries produce a similar result, though, in my defence, I haven\u2019t faced a bowling machine for more than 10 years. I have more success against four back-of-a-length balls, punching them into the off side off the back foot. Then I face four short balls. We\u2019re supposed to pull them but I make poor contact and the ball goes behind square. The second and third balls produce similar, unspectacular, results. The last ball I am supposed to strike and then celebrate as if I\u2019ve hit the winning runs but I spoon it and when attempting to celebrate struggle to take my helmet off as the strap stays wedged beneath my chin. So, all in all, it\u2019s not been the most convincing of auditions. No surprise, then, I never hear back from them. \u201cThe Indian team had already been cast a long time back but in the UK we were looking for players to represent England, Australia, Zimbabwe and West Indies,\u201d the film\u2019s UK line producer, Cyrus Patel, tells me later. \u201cWe wanted the action to be authentic.\u201d The cast is made up of actors in the main roles with body doubles for the cricketing action. It took eight months to find the West Indies side as the search for them was extended from the UK to the Caribbean. The great fast bowler Malcolm Marshall is played by his son, Mali. \u201cThe calibre of cricketers cast was extremely high. They\u2019re all accomplished players because we wanted the action to be as close to international standard as possible,\u201d Patel says. He tells me Tavar\u00e9\u2019s part was taken by Phil Lowe, a cricketer from Loughborough who plays for Newtown Linford in Division One of the Leicestershire and Rutland League. When I track down Lowe, he describes what it was like to be involved in the film. \u201cI had to go to London for training and a wardrobe fitting. We spent a couple of hours in the nets at Lord\u2019s replicating footage from the semi-final between England and India. There were certain shots Tavar\u00e9 played that I would have to replicate and I needed to perfect his technique before filming started. \u201cI was told I needed to grow a moustache and let my hair grow as long as possible. I\u2019d never grown a moustache before but luckily by the time filming had come around I\u2019d managed a reasonable one. But I had to wear a wig because there was insufficient time to grow the back and sides long enough, which wasn\u2019t ideal during long, hot days of filming in the summer.\u201d He spent a week in August filming at Stowe school in Buckinghamshire, a couple of days at Osterley CC in London, then at the Nevill Ground in Tunbridge Wells and, finally, at Lord\u2019s. \u201cThey were long 12-13 hour days spent on set but we had a lot of fun,\u201d Lowe says. \u201cWe filmed all of the cricket action from the semi-final on a regular cricket pitch that was surrounded by green screens, so that they could CGI the [Old Trafford] stadium and crowd into the shots. It was a fantastic experience to be involved in a big budget film and get to work alongside huge Bollywood stars like Ranveer Singh [who plays Kapil] and [director] Kabir Khan.\u201d It was at the Nevill Ground Kapil scored 175 not out after India were initially reduced to nine for four by Zimbabwe. No original footage exists of this record-breaking innings because BBC cameramen were on strike. But Patel says they tried to recreate it as accurately as they could. \u201cApart from the Nevill Ground all the other venues have changed considerably since 1983 so we made extensive use of CGI to take the viewer back in time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut Lord\u2019s couldn\u2019t have been more welcoming to us and over four days in August 2019 we were able to film in the dressing rooms and in the Long Room.\u201d Some of the street and hotel scenes were shot in Glasgow which, in Patel\u2019s words, \u201chas the feel of 1980s London\u201d. Going into the tournament India\u2019s previous World Cup record was dismal. In 1979 they had failed to win a game and in 1975 had won one, against East Africa. West Indies, on the other hand, had never lost a World Cup match, winning the tournament in 1975 and 1979. \u201cIt seemed like only Kapil believed India could win it,\u201d Patel says. In the final, India were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs and West Indies had the champagne on ice. But Clive Lloyd\u2019s team were then skittled for 140 in 52 overs. They were later to find Kapil knocking on their dressing-room door and asking for some bottles of fizz as the Indian camp had not anticipated victory. Kapil finished the tournament with 303 runs in eight innings at an average of 60.60 and a strike rate of 108.99. He took 12 wickets at an average of 20.41 and a miserly economy rate of 2.91, and caught Viv Richards and Clive Lloyd in the final \u2013 the first spectacularly so. \u201cNever did India think they would get to the final, let alone win it,\u201d Patel says. \u201cThe 1983 World Cup final was a match that transformed a nation. It is one of those perfect underdog sport stories.\u201d The film, to be called simply 83, had been scheduled for release on 10 April before the coronavirus pandemic intervened. And now Patel is unsure whether footage of Lowe batting will make the final cut of India\u2019s success story. Tavar\u00e9 was there but it was Kapil and his men who stole the show.",

      "bodyText": "Amid an ever increasing level of scrutiny over the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Matt Hancock appeared on the airwaves on Sunday to reassure the public that Downing Street was in control of the pandemic. Here we weigh up what the health secretary said against previous statements and the latest developments. What was said On BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: I\u2019ve set a very clear goal for the nation as a whole. The whole life sciences industry are coming to the table on this. I didn\u2019t say it would be easy to get to 100,000 a day, I said we need to get to 100,000 a day. Factcheck Hancock seemed to be describing the 100,000 tests per day as a broader ambition for the country, including the life sciences industry. When the figure was first introduced, the Department of Health stated that the UK \u201cwill\u201d carry out 100,000 tests for coronavirus every day by the end of this month. Is this pledge being watered down into an ambition? What was said On Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday: We set a goal of 10,000 tests a day by the end of March and we hit that goal. Factcheck Testing passed 10,000 a day for the first time on 2 April. The government previously said the capacity for 10,000 tests was met and the shortfall in actual tests was due to hospitals failing to use this capacity to the full. What was said Also on Sophy Ridge on Sunday: The UK has put more funding into the global search for a vaccine than any other country around the world. Factcheck Hancock was no doubt referring to the \u00a3210m UK donation to the Coalition for Vaccine Preparedness (CEPI), which is the largest single donation since the initiative announced a target of $2bn required from international governments to develop a Covid-19 vaccine. However, the UK was starting from a lower base of funding to CEPI than other countries, including Japan, the US and Norway \u2013 whose total funding to CEPI now stands at nearly \u00a3340m.

Schwarzenegger, 72, is emerging as a prominent face in California\u2019s battle against the pandemic, his lighthearted social media posts featuring his self-isolation antics with the two animals and his pet dog Cherry going viral while the virus continues to spread. In March, a short Twitter video of Schwarzenegger sharing quarantine food at his dining room table and urging people to stay indoors amassed more than 13.3 million views. Now Schwarzenegger has turned to his 20 million Instagram followers to launch a range of T-shirts and hoodies featuring the animals and the stay-at-home message, with the intention of raising money for underprivileged families affected by the crisis. \u201cWith schools closed, we can\u2019t provide our normal programming for our 100,000 kids, but we take our commitment to our families seriously, so we are pivoting to use our after-school staff to deliver groceries to our families,\u201d Schwarzenegger said in a post on Represent, an internet marketplace for charitable and campaign products launched by celebrities. Schwarzenegger founded the After-School All-Stars program in 1993 to enrich the lives of teenagers in California, mostly from racial minorities and financially-challenged families. \u201cNo one is allowed out, especially someone that is 72 years old,\u201d he said in the March video, which appeared the same week as the current California governor Gavin Newsom issued the formal statewide stay-at-home order for all residents. \u201cAfter you\u2019re 65, you\u2019re not allowed out of the house. We don\u2019t go out. We don\u2019t go to restaurants. We don\u2019t do anything like that any more here. We just eat with Whiskey and with Lulu. We have a good time.\u201d",

Officials were keen to stress that this was not an emergency admission, and that Johnson will remain in charge of government, and will be in regular touch with colleagues and civil servants. A government source told Reuters on Monday morning that Johnson had spent the night in hospital.

      "bodyText": "Oxygen supplies at a Hertfordshire hospital inundated with coronavirus patients became so precarious last week that officials considered how to decide who should receive the gas and who should miss out and likely die, the Guardian understands. The oxygen system at Watford general hospital came close to breaking point on Saturday, when a critical incident was declared and staff had to tell the public not to come to the hospital. Some patients were moved out to prevent the vital system failing. Last week, health planners in Hertfordshire, where more than 800 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, became so concerned about oxygen supplies they alerted the military that they might need help. The area has been under huge pressure from the Covid-19 pandemic, with mortuary space filling up and plans being made to increase capacity four-fold. As of 5pm Thursday, 29 people had died at West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS trust hospitals after being diagnosed with Covid-19. The trust is responsible for Watford general as well as Hemel Hempstead and St Albans City hospitals. A senior clinician said: \u201cThey were [consulting] the hospital ethics committee every day and considering who they were not going to oxygenate and ventilate if they needed it, and making decisions about who would be triaged to not have oxygen and die.\u201d The decision to announce a critical incident on Saturday meant no one had to go without oxygen, the trust said. Oxygen therapy is key to the successful treatment of advanced cases of Covid-19, and last Tuesday NHS England warned hospitals across the country about the risk to supplies in an urgent patient safety notice. It highlighted the dramatic recent increase in hospitals\u2019 use of ventilators and in particular CPAP machines, which dispense ventilation through a face mask. The pressure on Watford general\u2019s oxygen system was not unexpected, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Last week, healthcare planners in the area said they pleaded with the government and the NHS to urgently approve works to the hospital\u2019s oxygen system and warned NHS England on Wednesday that the situation was critical. However, NHS England said that it had alerted trusts, including West Hertfordshire, to the need to prepare their oxygen systems in February when the threat of the coronavirus epidemic was looming. \u201cAll trusts were written to by NHS England in February reminding them to carry out engineering checks on ventilation equipment, and were further issued with guidance on how to use the kit safely, on 1 April,\u201d a spokesperson said. Works to overhaul Watford general\u2019s oxygen supply system had been planned before the outbreak, but were put on hold.

This compares with just one in eight (13%) of workers aged 25 and over. Women were about one-third more likely than men to work in a sector that has been shut down, as they make up the bulk of retail and hospitality workers. One in six female employees worked for businesses hit by the lockdown, compared with one in seven of their male counterparts.. Xiaowei Xu, a senior IFS research economist and an author of the briefing note, said: \u201cThere is a remarkable concentration of younger and lower-paid workers in the sectors most affected by the current lockdown. Women are also more likely to be affected than men. \u201cFortunately, in the short run, many will have the cushion of the incomes of parents or other household members. But for the longer term there must be serious worries about the effect of this crisis on the young especially and on inequality more generally.\u201d The study found that 61% of under-25s who worked in shutdown sectors lived with their parents and tended to contribute a relatively low proportion of household income on average, at 16%. The figures delineate the pain for millions of workers whose jobs are at risk after weeks of enforced closures intended to slow the spread of the virus. While many will continue to be paid, with a 20% pay cut, under the government\u2019s furlough scheme, it is already clear that thousands will be made redundant. Last week it emerged that nearly a million people had successfully applied for universal credit in the first fortnight of the lockdown.",

The profits from bets placed in Ireland will be donated to Irish charities, including the Irish Red Cross. \u201cWe are overwhelmed with the public support for the Virtual Grand National,\u201d Michael Dugher, the chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council, an umbrella body for gambling operators, said on Sunday. \u201cWhen the nation was in much need of some light relief, millions joined in the fun in honour of one of Britain\u2019s greatest sporting events and helped raise a fantastic amount for our brave heroes in the NHS.\u201d ITV broadcast a half-hour programme on Saturday that featured the virtual event at 5.15pm, the intended off time for the cancelled race. It had an average audience of 4.3m, a 28% share, with a peak of 4.8m (30% audience share). Last year\u2019s Virtual Grand National attracted 737,000 viewers, while nearly 10m watched Tiger Roll land the race for the second year running. The Grand National is by far the most watched horse race annually, and with most of the country at home due to the lockdown to fight the spread of coronavirus, the audience for this year\u2019s virtual substitute compares favourably with the figure for many other high-profile events during the racing season. The peak audience for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which is run on a Friday, has averaged 1.6m over the past four years, while last year\u2019s Derby, on the first Saturday in June, pulled in 1.75m viewers at peak. Royal Ascot in June last year, meanwhile, reached a daily average peak of 1.25m. The computer programme used to create the virtual race took the form of 40 horses that were among the initial entries for the Grand National and produced a list of fixed odds on each runner\u2019s chance, before using a random number generator to pick a 1-2-3-4. The process came up with a decent result for the books, as Potters Corner (18-1) \u201cbeat\u201d Walk In The Mill (16-1) and Any Second Now (10-1) with Tiger Roll, the 5-1 favourite and likely to be the best-backed runner, in fourth.",
