The assessment by professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young (EY) says a government focus on renewable energy and climate-friendly projects to drive the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic could create more than 100,000 direct jobs across the country while cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Commissioned by environment group the World Wide Fund for Nature, the EY report suggests fast-tracking wind and solar farms that have already been approved, increasing electricity transmission capacity and backing new industries in battery manufacturing, electric buses, renewable hydrogen and manufacturing powered by renewable energy. It estimates every $1m spent on renewable energy and exports creates 4.8 full-time jobs in renewable infrastructure or 4.95 jobs in energy efficiency. By comparison, $1m on fossil fuel projects has been found to create 1.7 full-time jobs. That suggests that if 10% of what the federal and state governments had indicated they would spend in response to Covid-19 was directed towards clean projects it could create 160,000 jobs. \u201cIt represents a fraction of the immediate government stimulus package while generating significant job numbers and reorienting the economy towards a more strategic, low-carbon trajectory,\u201d it says.

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people marched through Australian cities and towns for Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday, defying an attempt from the police to ban one demonstration through the courts and despite pleas from the prime minister and state leaders for people to stay home. In a dramatic turn of events, a massive crowd in Sydney learned just as they were gathering outside the city\u2019s Town Hall that the New South Wales court of appeal had ruled their rally was now lawful, overturning a court decision handed down late on Friday. At least 20,000 attended the Sydney march which passed off peacefully, except for ugly scenes when police officers used pepper spray on protesters who had flowed into Central station after the rally finished. Some protestors were hurt by the spray, with eyes streaming, and there were accusations that the remaining crowd had been forced together into a small space in the station and unable to move. On Sunday morning, NSW Police said a 21-year-old man had been charged with offensive behaviour and resisting police, after he allegedly \u201cbecame violent\u201d when officers \u201cattempted to move a group of people through the station\u201d. Police said after he was arrested, the surrounding group of people in the station \u201cbecame increasingly aggressive\u201d, at which point \u201cOC (pepper) spray was deployed\u201d, with five people treated at the scene from the effects of the spray. In the hour before the protest was declared legal by the NSW Supreme Court, police tasered and arrested a 23-year-old man who was involved in \u201ca physical altercation\u201d, and a 51-year-old was arrested over an alleged \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d when he raised a sign that said \u201cblack, white, all lives matter\u201d on the steps of Town Hall. At a press conference on Sunday afternoon \u2013 held about 35km north west of the local police station for Central station \u2013 acting commissioner Mal Lanyon defended officers using capsicum spray as \u201cacting professionally\u201d. He said a brick was thrown through a police car on Eddy Avenue, behind the station, prior to the capsicum spray incident. Police then attempted to move the remaining crowd away from the area and into the nearby train station, after which people in the group threw a drink can and bottle at the faces of policemen, injuring at least one officer. Lanyon said the spray was deployed to \u201ccurb that violence\u201d from people acting aggressively. He also said the incident at Central was not representative of the wider protest, and said he believed \u201cthere are groups that attend those types of protests with an interest to incite police and try to cause violence\u201d and to \u201cpursue interests that are contrary to the rest of the protest group\u201d. In Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, and smaller cities and towns across the country mask-clad protesters gathered, drawing attention to racial profiling, police brutality and the more than 400 Indigenous people who have died in police custody since a royal commission into the problem was held in 1991. \u201cIt\u2019s the same story on different soil,\u201d Ky-ya Nicholson-Ward, 17, told a rally in Melbourne of the similarities between what has been happening in the US and Australia. Victoria Police has confirmed it will fine Melbourne Black Lives Matter rally organisers $1,652 each for breaching the directions of the chief health officer amid the pandemic. A smaller, socially-distanced protest of about 20 people was planned outside the Frankston police station on Sunday morning. In Perth, protesters will gather for a Black Lives Matter rally on Sunday, following the death of an Aboriginal man in custody at Acacia prison. Although Saturday\u2019s protests were sparked after the death of unarmed African American man George Floyd, public outrage was further stoked when a Sydney police officer was caught on camera slamming an Indigenous teenager face-first into the ground this week. Still, some campaigners expressed frustration that it had taken Floyd\u2019s death on the other side of the world to draw attention to the plight of Australia\u2019s First Nations people, who suffer lower life expectancy and are more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous Australians. Protesters fell silent to mourn Indigenous deaths in custody and stopped to take a knee as they marched, while organisers led chants of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d. Another chant involved those at the rally hitting their chests in unison to create the sound of a fading heartbeat. In Sydney, the \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d chant held special significance for the mother of David Dungay Jr, who gasped those words before he died in Long Bay jail in 2015. \u201cThey held my son down for 10 minutes,\u201d Leetona Dungay said told the crowd. Warren Day, the son of Victorian woman Tanya, who died in police custody, said in Melbourne there had been no convictions despite the hundreds of Indigenous deaths in police custody in the past three decades. \u201cAll we want is justice and to be treated as equals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not much to ask for is it? There is no room for racists in this world. We need change and it needs to start happening now.\u201d The protests went ahead despite warnings from Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, that large gatherings risked ruining the progress Australia had made in significantly reducing the number of active coronavirus cases. Protesters in Sydney expected to defy a supreme court order that gave police the right to fine them for breaking social distancing laws but instead erupted in cheers when they learned the court of appeal had overturned the decision. The last-ditch appeal, which was finalised 12 minutes before the rally was scheduled to begin, struck out a late-night court ruling on Friday that said the demonstration would be unlawful because current laws ban gatherings of more than 10 people. The police had sought the court order to ban the protest. Although the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he believed the cause was important, his message earlier in the week to protesters was \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d, citing the existing health advice. But he also questioned those drawing comparisons between Australia and the situation in the United States, where protesters have rallied for several days following Floyd\u2019s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia,\u201d Morrison said. Most protesters heeded a call from organisers to cover their faces, creating a sea of mask-clad faces that was unprecedented in Australia given face coverings are not mandated by state or federal governments. Although protesters sought to keep at least 1.5 metres between them, many struggled to do so closer to the stage. In Melbourne, where the crowd stretched across many blocks, some also began to dance when the African Australian musician Sampa the Great took to the stage to perform two songs. Black lives matter, she said, \u201cbecause I woke up black today, and I\u2019m going to wake up black tomorrow\u201d. Crowds also gathered in Adelaide, where police granted protesters an exemption to allow them to hold a rally, as well as smaller cities such as Hobart, Wagga Wagga, Townsville, Byron Bay. In Sydney the end of the march for most was marked peacefully, although some protestors were caught in frightening scenes at Central Station. A crowd appeared to be pressed together in the underground concourse at the station and police used pepper spray on some. One protester who was inside Central station at the time of the clash told the Guardian it was unclear why police made the decision to use the spray. He said police had been ushering protesters in the vicinity of Belmore Park \u2013 where the march ended \u2013 into Central station, when the incident occurred shortly after 6pm. \u201cI was walking through [the station entrance] and there was some commotion behind me where police had formed a line.\u201d \u201cOut of nowhere they just started macing people, it didn\u2019t look like there was any type of reason to do it,\u201d the protester, who did not wish to be identified, said.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, Britain became only the second country in the world whose official death toll from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52925716\">exceeded</a> 40,000. The scale of the human tragedy is incomprehensible: at the pandemic\u2019s peak, almost 1,000 people were <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/\">losing their lives</a> a day. They have left behind more than 40,000 families who are mourning at a time when they cannot come together to share their grief.</p> <p>This is a pandemic that has tested the public health response of governments in every corner of the world. But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government\u2019s scientific advisers said would be a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-grim-milestone-of-20000\">good outcome</a>\u201d, and, at this point, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c53ab12-d859-4ceb-b262-f6a0221ca129\">one of the worst</a> excess deaths rates in the world.</p> <p>Yet the prime minister has offered no apology for the serious mistakes the government has made so far: its haphazard procurement of protective equipment for frontline workers; the tragedy it did too little to prevent unfolding in Britain\u2019s care homes; its unforgivably slow efforts to build up testing capacity. Last Wednesday, without a hint of contrition, he declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s record on coronavirus, just the day before the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme told staff it would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">not be operating at full speed</a> for another three or four months. All along, there have been worrying signs that this was a government prepared to put politics above pandemic management; in the past two weeks, that sense has only intensified as Johnson has rushed in multiple lockdown relaxations in what looks like an attempt to distract from the rule-breaking of his top adviser. We cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry into what the government has got wrong.</p> <h2>Inadequate capacity to react</h2> <p>Just 10 years ago, Britain was considered to be a world leader in public health and pandemic management. Its public health rapid-response teams have been deployed to assist in emergencies around the world. But over the past decade, cuts in public spending have left local <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts\">public health teams depleted</a>, funding on interventions to cut smoking and obesity has been <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/ending-the-blame-game\">reduced</a> and the tightest funding settlement in its 70-year history has left the NHS stretched beyond capacity.</p> <p>This hollowing-out of the state has left the UK far more vulnerable to the effects of a pandemic. In October 2016, the government ran a three-day simulation of an influenza pandemic. The conclusions were stark: Britain was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">not ready</a> for a pandemic. Comprehensive recommendations were made, from increasing stocks of protective equipment for frontline staff to expanding the capacity of care homes to deal with patients in such an event. It is clear from what has happened since that these recommendations were not adequately implemented.</p> <p>On top of that, the weeks of warning we had when the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/who-cited-human-transmission-risk-in-january-despite-trump-claims\">in late January</a> were wasted. By early March, several other countries had significantly invested in expanding their testing capacity; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/how-did-britain-get-its-response-to-coronavirus-so-wrong\">the UK had not</a>. This forced the government to choose a different strategy from that which the WHO was imploring countries to take \u2013 to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. Instead, it announced it was abandoning efforts to control the spread of the virus through testing and tracing, with its scientific advisers going on the airwaves to suggest that by allowing some spread of the virus they expected the population to build up a natural level of herd immunity. Large sporting and cultural events that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/we-were-packed-like-sardines-evidence-grows-of-mass-event-dangers-early-in-pandemic\">brought together many thousands</a> of people from Britain and abroad, including from virus-stricken countries such as Spain, continued to go ahead in the first half of March, a decision that some scientists now believe will have certainly resulted in avoidable deaths. The official scientific advice that informed this decision betrays an over-reliance on simplistic assumptions about how people interact that could have been counteracted by having more frontline public health specialists at the table. And the UK left it until very late in the day by international standards to impose the level of lockdown needed to reduce the spread of the virus. Both the political decisions and the scientific advice that produced this late decision have rightly come under intense scrutiny.</p> <h2>Logistical errors</h2> <p>These early strategic mistakes have since been compounded by a series of logistical failures. At first, it looked as though the government\u2019s efforts to expand the capacity of the state to deal with coronavirus were going well - the rapid expansion of critical care capacity via the network of Nightingale hospitals was extraordinary - but other problems quickly emerged. In particular, a shambolic failure to ensure adequate supplies of protective equipment for health and care staff exposed serious weaknesses in the NHS\u2019s decentralised procurement structures; it has taken far too long for the government to get a grip on this, allowing the infection to have spread more quickly throughout hospitals and care homes. The government has also been far too slow to increase testing capacity, focusing on meeting arbitrary targets through any means necessary; it has been criticised by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\">continuing to mislead the public</a> on the number of tests being carried out. And the intense focus on increasing the NHS capacity was not extended to care homes, where there have been <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-the-number-of-excess-deaths-in-care-homes-and-hospitals-compared-with-normal-times-is-revealed-11991080\">twice as many deaths as usual</a> for this time of year.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the government\u2019s failure to acknowledge, let alone address, these errors, a similar set of mistakes seems likely with respect to its test-and-trace scheme. The effective operation of this scheme, which would allow local government to track and limit the impact of local outbreaks, will be critical in minimising a second wave of deaths from the virus as lockdown restrictions are relaxed. It is the most complex delivery project of the pandemic yet. But the government was for weeks too reticent to involve local councils, which already have contact tracing and public health expertise, instead choosing to outsource huge parts of the scheme to large contractors, such as <a href=\"https://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/serco-pay-%C2%A323m-after-serious-fraud-office-probe-moj-electronic-tagging-scandal\">Serco</a>, which have a poor track record of delivering government contracts.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Britain became only the second country in the world whose official death toll from coronavirus exceeded 40,000. The scale of the human tragedy is incomprehensible: at the pandemic\u2019s peak, almost 1,000 people were losing their lives a day. They have left behind more than 40,000 families who are mourning at a time when they cannot come together to share their grief. This is a pandemic that has tested the public health response of governments in every corner of the world. But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government\u2019s scientific advisers said would be a \u201cgood outcome\u201d, and, at this point, it has one of the worst excess deaths rates in the world. Yet the prime minister has offered no apology for the serious mistakes the government has made so far: its haphazard procurement of protective equipment for frontline workers; the tragedy it did too little to prevent unfolding in Britain\u2019s care homes; its unforgivably slow efforts to build up testing capacity. Last Wednesday, without a hint of contrition, he declared himself \u201cvery proud\u201d of the government\u2019s record on coronavirus, just the day before the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme told staff it would not be operating at full speed for another three or four months. All along, there have been worrying signs that this was a government prepared to put politics above pandemic management; in the past two weeks, that sense has only intensified as Johnson has rushed in multiple lockdown relaxations in what looks like an attempt to distract from the rule-breaking of his top adviser. We cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry into what the government has got wrong. Inadequate capacity to react Just 10 years ago, Britain was considered to be a world leader in public health and pandemic management. Its public health rapid-response teams have been deployed to assist in emergencies around the world. But over the past decade, cuts in public spending have left local public health teams depleted, funding on interventions to cut smoking and obesity has been reduced and the tightest funding settlement in its 70-year history has left the NHS stretched beyond capacity. This hollowing-out of the state has left the UK far more vulnerable to the effects of a pandemic. In October 2016, the government ran a three-day simulation of an influenza pandemic. The conclusions were stark: Britain was not ready for a pandemic. Comprehensive recommendations were made, from increasing stocks of protective equipment for frontline staff to expanding the capacity of care homes to deal with patients in such an event. It is clear from what has happened since that these recommendations were not adequately implemented. On top of that, the weeks of warning we had when the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency in late January were wasted. By early March, several other countries had significantly invested in expanding their testing capacity; the UK had not. This forced the government to choose a different strategy from that which the WHO was imploring countries to take \u2013 to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. Instead, it announced it was abandoning efforts to control the spread of the virus through testing and tracing, with its scientific advisers going on the airwaves to suggest that by allowing some spread of the virus they expected the population to build up a natural level of herd immunity. Large sporting and cultural events that brought together many thousands of people from Britain and abroad, including from virus-stricken countries such as Spain, continued to go ahead in the first half of March, a decision that some scientists now believe will have certainly resulted in avoidable deaths. The official scientific advice that informed this decision betrays an over-reliance on simplistic assumptions about how people interact that could have been counteracted by having more frontline public health specialists at the table. And the UK left it until very late in the day by international standards to impose the level of lockdown needed to reduce the spread of the virus. Both the political decisions and the scientific advice that produced this late decision have rightly come under intense scrutiny. Logistical errors These early strategic mistakes have since been compounded by a series of logistical failures. At first, it looked as though the government\u2019s efforts to expand the capacity of the state to deal with coronavirus were going well - the rapid expansion of critical care capacity via the network of Nightingale hospitals was extraordinary - but other problems quickly emerged.

The government has also been far too slow to increase testing capacity, focusing on meeting arbitrary targets through any means necessary; it has been criticised by the chair of the UK Statistics Authority for continuing to mislead the public on the number of tests being carried out. And the intense focus on increasing the NHS capacity was not extended to care homes, where there have been twice as many deaths as usual for this time of year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the government\u2019s failure to acknowledge, let alone address, these errors, a similar set of mistakes seems likely with respect to its test-and-trace scheme. The effective operation of this scheme, which would allow local government to track and limit the impact of local outbreaks, will be critical in minimising a second wave of deaths from the virus as lockdown restrictions are relaxed.

      "bodyText": "History teaches that mass protests against oppression can lead either to liberation or brutal repression. This past week, Donald Trump bet his political future on repression. Much of the rest of America, on the other hand, wants to liberate black people from police brutality and centuries of systemic racism. As of this writing, it looks like Trump is losing and America winning, but the contest is hardly over. Trump knows he can\u2019t be re-elected on his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic or on what\u2019s likely to be a tepid economic recovery. But he must believe a racist campaign could work. After all, stoking racism got him into the White House in the first place. The protests against George Floyd\u2019s brutal killing by Minneapolis police seemed like a golden opportunity. \u201cThe nation needs law and order,\u201d Trump responded immediately, repeating the phrase that propelled Richard Nixon to the presidency after a summer of black unrest across the country. His trump card was threatening to send federal troops into American cities. Trump called on states to bring in the military to combat \u201clowlifes and losers\u201d, promising \u201ctotal domination\u201d of protesters and telling governors \u201cif you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d Previous presidents haven\u2019t even used this language to describe invading other countries. But Trump overplayed his hand. He looked like a deranged dictator, an impression made all the more vivid as officers in riot gear used flash grenades and chemical spray (a weapon banned in war) on peaceful protesters to clear a path for Trump to walk from the White House through Lafayette Square to a photo op in front of St John\u2019s church. It was too much even for Trump\u2019s own top military brass. The defense secretary, Mark Esper, insisted military personnel \u201cbe used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations\u201d. Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, reminded the armed services of the rights of their fellow citizens to free assembly, adding: \u201cWe all committed our lives to the idea that is America \u2013 we will stay true to that oath and the American people.\u201d But it was Trump\u2019s own former secretary of defense, James Mattis, whose rebuke cut deepest. \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cInstead he tries to divide us \u2026 We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d It was an \u201cemperor-has-no-clothes\u201d moment that prompted the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski to admit she was considering not voting for Trump and suggest other Senate Republicans felt the same way. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up,\u201d she said. Trump expected white voters to recoil from the rioting and looting. Over the past week, Fox News obliged by mentioning rioting or rioters six times as much as CNN. But 64% of Americans sympathize with the protesters and appear receptive to stopping police brutality and 55% disapprove of Trump\u2019s response. Black Americans are now more committed than ever to defeating him in November. More than 80% believe he\u2019s a racist. If black voters return to the polls at 2012 levels, Joe Biden would win the electoral college 294-244, according to the Center for American Progress. College-educated white people and younger voters have also been galvanized against Trump. The most racially diverse generations in American history, millennials and Gen Z voters could make up as much as 37% of the electorate this year. But although Trump\u2019s response to the protests seems to have backfired, it also raises a troubling question. If Trump loses and refuses to give up the presidency, will the military support him? The possibility is hardly far-fetched. As Trump\u2019s former bagman Michael Cohen warned in congressional testimony in March 2019, \u201cI fear that if he loses the election in 2020 there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\u201d After winning in 2016, Trump claimed without evidence that 3-5m votes were illegally counted for Hillary Clinton.

If that happens, the mass protests against decades of harsh policing and unjust killings of Black Americans will be followed by another uprising, this time against Trump\u2019s murder of American democracy.

This government has chosen lockdown as a deliberate strategy to avoid dealing with the political fallout from early release.</p> <p>Prisons are overcrowded and unhygienic. The secretary of state has publicly accepted that the prison population will need to be reduced and a substantial number of prisoners will need to be released in order to save lives in response to Covid-19. On present accommodation levels, between 10,000 and 15,000 would have to be released to achieve single-cell occupancy.

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it from us tonight. The Guardian will continue live coverage tomorrow morning. Protests carried on across in the nation, in one of the most massive mobilizations since the police killing of George Floyd sparked nationwide demonstrations against police brutality and systematic racism. More than 10,000 people took to the streets in Washington, DC, and in Philadelphia, the crowd radiated for blocks from the city\u2019s art museum. In Atlanta, protesters danced and in Denver, marchers were joined by a brass band. In San Francisco, demonstrators flooded onto the Golden Gate bridge. Although Seattle blocked the use of teargas, officers deployed OC gas and flashbang grenades on protestors. The use of such crowd control tactics have been criticized by public health officials, who warn that chemical weapons and smoke bombs can exacerbate the spread of coronavirus. In Richmond, Virginia, demonstrators tore down the statue of a Confederate general. The state\u2019s governor agreed this week to begin removing Confederate monuments from the capital. The top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer has resigned following an uproar over the headline, \u201cBuildings matter too\u201d. The tone-deaf headline sparked a public protest among staff. The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh has also filed a grievance after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pulled two African American journalists from its coverage of this week\u2019s protests because they were seen as biased for being Black. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey was booed after telling protesters he did not support defunding the police. Activists around the country are calling on officials to defund law enforcement \u2014 in DC, demonstrators even painted \u201cDefund the police\u201d onto a street near the White House. The two Buffalo police officers who were suspended after being captured on video shoving a 75-year-old protester in recent demonstrations, prompting the mass resignation of the department\u2019s entire emergency response team, have been charged with assault. But their colleagues have stood by them, cheering the accused as they left the courthouse after being charged. Artists across the nation have been creating murals on boarded up business. Like this in Portland, Oregon: And these in Oakland: George Floyd\u2019s younger brother Philonise will testify before Congress next week in a hearing on law enforcement reform, the Washington Post reports. Floyd is expected to testify on Wednesday morning before the House Judiciary Committee, a committee spokeswoman told the Post. Floyd has also had a phone call with Trump, who he said \u201cdidn\u2019t give me an opportunity to even speak.\u201d \u201cIt was hard. I was trying to talk to him, but he just kept, like, pushing me off, like \u2018I don\u2019t want to hear what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Floyd told MSNBC last weekend. \u201cAnd I just told him, I want justice. I said that I couldn\u2019t believe that they committed a modern-day lynching in broad daylight.\u201d Demonstrators in Richmond, Virginia have pulled down a statue of Confederate general William Carter Wickham. Earlier this week, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam announced that the state would begin clearing Confederate structures from Richmond, including a towering monument to Robert E. Lee. Nearly 1,300 medical providers and public health experts have signed a petition this week calling for police to stop using the chemical agents \u2014 not just teargas, but also smoke bombs, pepper spray \u2014 over concerns that it will exacerbate the spread of coronavirus. On Friday, Seattle\u2019s mayor announced a 30-day moratorium on the use of teargas during protests after an outcry. But pepper spray, like tear gas, is a lachrymatory agent that causes tears, saliva and mucus to stream from demonstrators\u2019 eyes and noses, Because coronavirus spreads through droplets of mucus and spit that people launch into the air when they cough, sneeze, breathe and talk, teargas and other irritants that cause people to choke, hack and rip off their face masks will help the virus proliferate, according to Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician who helped draft the petition. Gas and pepper sprays also cause tears, saliva and mucus to stream from demonstrators\u2019 eyes and noses, said Chin-Hong. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll cause people to shout and scream, propelling droplets of these fluids \u2013 which could be carrying coronavirus \u2013 and giving them superpowers, to spread much farther than six feet.\u201d In Seattle, police are using flashbangs and pepper spray against protesters, according to footage captured by a reporter for the Seattle Times. The city banned the use of tear gas yesterday \u2014 but it seems officers have found a workaround. Across the nation today, protesters called on officials to \u201cdefund the police\u201d. Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and divestments from police. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. What does it mean to \u2018defund the police\u2019? For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since attempts to reform police practices over the last five years have failed, as evidenced by the brutal killing of George Floyd. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. How much does America currently spend on police? In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a recent analysis. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is significantly greater than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is more than half the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget cuts to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more. But police budgets have grown or gone largely untouched \u2013 until pressure from protests this week In Buffalo, where two officers were charged with the assault of a 75-year-old man amid protests, demonstrators have defied curfew and and returned to the city\u2019s Niagra square for another night of rallying against police brutality. Police officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski were charged and released without bail today. A crowd of off-duty officers, firefighters and others gathered outside the courthouse in a show of support for accused. Here\u2019s a sweet moment from earlier today, in Philadelphia: The city of brotherly love saw one of the biggest showings of protesters yet, with crowds stretching across blocks and blocks around the Philadelphia Art Museum. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast (and taking over from my colleague Bryan Graham in the east). First, let\u2019s check in on the nation\u2019s capital, where more than 10,000 people poured into the streets, gathered near Lafayette Square by the White House, marching down U Street\u2019s historic Black Broadway, coalesced at the feet of Abraham Lincoln giant marble memorial. Donald Trump, who remained fortified behind the two miles of newly erected fencing surrounding the White House, tweeted: \u201cMuch smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated. National Guard, Secret Service, and DC Police have been doing a fantastic job.\u201d Of course, DC saw one of the most massive mobilizations of protesters since demonstrations began nearly two weeks ago. And today, there were markedly fewer tanks and heavily armed federal officers around the city \u2013 following widespread outcry over the presence of militarized law enforcement over the past week. More than 140 scientists funded by Mark Zuckerberg have said Facebook should not be letting US president Donald Trump use the social media platform to \u201cspread both misinformation and incendiary statements\u201d. The researchers, which include more than 60 professors at leading US research institutions and one Nobel laureate, sent the Facebook CEO a letter on Saturday asking him to \u201cconsider stricter policies on misinformation and incendiary language that harms people\u201d and decrying the \u201cdeliberate misinformation and divisive language\u201d as counter to the scientists\u2019 broader goals of eradicating disease. Dear Mark, We are a group of concerned scientists currently or previously funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) or the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Social media platforms, like Facebook, have emerged as primary ways of communicating information. While they have allowed dissemination of information across the globe, they also facilitate the spread of misinformation. The spread of news that is not vetted for factual accuracy leads to confusion and a mistrust of experts. Indeed, Facebook acknowledges this in their own user policies. Thus, like many, we were disconcerted to see that Facebook has not followed their own policies in regards to President Trump, who has used the Facebook platform to spread both misinformation and incendiary statements. For example, his statement \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d is a clear statement of inciting violence. As scientists, we are dedicated to investigating ways to better our world. We are proud to be CZI awardees and to help realize CZI\u2019s mission, which is to \u201cuse technology to help solve some of our toughest challenges \u2014 from preventing and eradicating disease, to improving learning experiences for kids, to reforming the criminal justice system\u201d and \u201cto build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone.\u201d The spread of deliberate misinformation and divisive language is directly antithetical to this goal and we are therefore deeply concerned at the stance Facebook has taken. We urge you to consider stricter policies on misinformation and incendiary language that harms people or groups of people, especially in our current climate that is grappling with racial injustice. The two Buffalo police officers who were suspended after being captured on video shoving a 75-year-old protester in recent demonstrations, prompting the mass resignation of the department\u2019s entire emergency response team, have been charged with assault. Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski, who surrendered Saturday morning, pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault. They were released without bail. As hundreds of thousands march across the country, police in numerous US cities have faced condemnation for their crackdowns on demonstrations, including punching, kicking, teargassing, pepper-spraying and driving vehicles at often peaceful protesters. McCabe, 32, and Torgalski, 39, \u201ccrossed a line\u201d when they shoved the man down hard enough for him to fall backward and hit his head on the sidewalk, said John Flynn, the Erie county district attorney, at a news conference, calling the victim \u201ca harmless 75-year-old man\u201d . The officers had been suspended without pay Friday after a TV crew captured the confrontation the night before. If convicted of the felony assault charge, they face up to seven years in prison. Police officers in Buffalo, however, have stood by their colleagues. On Saturday a crowd of off-duty officers, firefighters and others gathered outside the courthouse in a show of support for the accused officers and cheered when they were released. \u201cIt was tremendous, tremendous to see,\u201d John Evans, president of the Buffalo Police Benevolent Association, told WIVB-TV. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a strong indication of the outrage, basically, over this travesty.\u201d The top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer has resigned following an uproar over a headline bemoaning property damage incurred during the ongoing protests decrying police brutality and racial injustice, the newspaper has announced. The paper said Stan Wischnowski, 58, was stepping down as senior vice president and executive editor after apologizing on Wednesday for the \u201chorribly wrong\u201d decision to use the headline, \u201cBuildings Matter, Too\u201d, on a column Tuesday suggested an equivalence between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans. The tone-deaf headline prompted a public denouncement from staff. Features reporter Brandon Bell wrote on Twitter that he was calling in \u201csick and tired\u201d to work on Thursday. Some 30 members, out of a staff of about 210, skipped work for the same reason, a spokesman said. Bell was among those who distributed an open letter of protest, saying African American journalists were tired of careless mistakes that make it harder to do their jobs and, at worst, put lives at risk. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of shouldering the burden of dragging this 200-year-old institution kicking and screaming into a more equitable age,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being told to show both sides of issues there are no two sides of.\u201d Guardian US reporter Nina Lakhani reports from Harlem: Hundreds of people prayed and protested in Harlem this afternoon, in a peaceful and hopeful mobilization characterized by dignity, anger, resistance, and determination. \u201cGet off our necks,\u201d and \u201cracism is America\u2019s original sin,\u201d were among the hard-hitting truths chanted by protesters as they marched uptown from the National Black Theatre, a historical and cultural landmark situated on the corner of 5th Avenue and West 125th Street. Pastors and other faith leaders gave rousing speeches outside the theatre and other iconic spots including the Schomburg Centre for research in black culture \u2013 an internationally renowned archive for information on people of African descent which is located on the corner of Lennox Avenue and West 135th Street. Jacquelyn Martell, 33, one of the organizers of today\u2019s protest, said: \u201cHarlem is extremely significant when it comes to talking about the disproportionate impact on black and brown communities of so many things for example Covid-19 and police surveillance, but part of this movement is to bring communities together and ammeliorate divisions brought forth by systemic racism and bring some healing as well.\u201d Today\u2019s event, like New York, was multicultural, invigorating and hopeful. Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets in San Francisco, Sacramento, Simi Valley, San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere across California on Saturday as the protest matches over the killing of George Floyd continued into their second week. According to the Associated Press: In Los Angeles, protesters organized by Refuse Fascism LA took over Hollywood Boulevard, chanting \u201cRevolution, nothing less!\u201d In San Diego, more than 3,000 people marched downtown and faced off with officers guarding police headquarters, while a caravan of 300 cars moved past the state university there. In Simi Valley, a protest drawing several thousand demonstrators spilled onto the street and stopped traffic on a major road through the suburban town northwest of Los Angeles. It was there that four white Los Angeles police officers were found not guilty of beating motorist Rodney King, sparking riots in 1992. Roderick Sweeney, 49, who is black, said he was overwhelmed to see the large turnout of white protesters waving signs that said \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d during a demonstration on San Francisco\u2019s famed Golden Gate Bridge, the AP reported. \u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions in our family and among friends that nothing is going to change until our white brothers and sisters voice their opinion,\u201d he said. The large turnout of white protesters \u201cis sending a powerful message. You can see protests are happening around this world, and so I\u2019m hoping change will happen.\u201d Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser delivered a resounding message to Donald Trump with her endorsement of a sprawling Black Lives Matter mural on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House in the city\u2019s downtown. \u201cWe want to call attention today to making sure our nation is more fair and more just, and that black lives and that black humanity matter in our nation,\u201d Bowser told NBC Washington. US satellite imagery company Maxar Technologies has released satellite images of the mural \u2013 and the full impact is striking. A ninth straight day of protests over the killing of George Floyd and the broader issue of racism and police brutality is under way in Seattle, with thousands of doctors, nurses and others in lab coasts and scrubs leading the way on a march to City Hall. Sam Sen, a software engineer originally from Jordan, was one of the estimated 7,000 people who attended the medical workers\u2019 march, which has grown in size throughout the day according to the Seattle Times. \u201cI show up almost every day,\u201c he told the newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing! It shows how closely tied the community is, everybody\u2019s got everybody\u2019s back. I see all kinds of colors, backgrounds, sexual orientations. I\u2019ve lived on Capitol Hill for 11 years, and this just makes me love this city even more.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen things escalate, it\u2019s usually from the police. ... The other day they used tear gas. Punished everyone here because of one asshole who threw a water bottle.\u201d Mayor Jenny Durkan and police chief Carmen Best have imposed a 30-day ban on the department\u2019s use of one kind of tear gas after authorities were widely criticized for using the chemical deterrent to disperse of mostly peaceful crowds last week. Other department policies for crowd control, including the use of chokeholds and pepper spray, will be reviewed by the city\u2019s police accountability groups, according to local media reports. Seattle City councilperson Kshama Sawant issued a statement on Saturday calling for Durkan\u2019s resignation, describing her as responsible for \u201cviolence and brutality\u201d in the city\u2019s response to \u201coverwhelmingly peaceful\u201d demonstrations. Guardian US reporter Jessica Glenza checks in from the ground in Jersey City: Thousands of people have gathered in Jersey City, New Jersey, in one of the city\u2019s largest protests in recent memory. Demonstrators are chanting the names of people killed by police in recent weeks, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, as well as \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d, on a hot and sunny afternoon in New Jersey\u2019s second-most populous city located right across the river from Manhattan. Jersey City police are not wearing riot gear and a peaceful vibe has prevailed with people handing out water and snacks and nearly the entire crowd wearing face masks and practicing social distancing as much as possible. Several apartment buildings have banners unfurled from upper floors reading \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. The protests in Atlanta have entered their ninth day with mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms having officially lifted the citywide 8pm curfew after Friday night\u2019s demonstrations ended with no arrests (and national guardsmen even dancing the Macarena alongside protestors). Saturday\u2019s events have been scattered throughout numerous locations across the metro area and downtown, including City Hall, the Centennial Olympic Park and police headquarters. The curfew was first implemented by city officials after last weekend\u2019s peaceful demonstrations took a violent turn on Friday night, prompting Atlanta\u2019s police chief to say: \u201cWhether it\u2019s by police or other individuals, the reality is we\u2019ve diminished the value on their life.\u201d Players and staff members for the NFL\u2019s Denver Broncos took part in a rally over the death of George Floyd, marching from the state capitol and gathering in Civic Center park downtown. \u201cYour voice is heavy, and it matters,\u201d fifth-year safety Justin Simmons said. \u201cWhy does it matter? For the same reasons you tell and ask each and every one of these athletes to your sons, to your daughters about what it takes to make it professionally, right? It\u2019s that level of equal ground of \u2018he\u2019s an athlete, my son\u2019s an athlete, my daughter\u2019s an athlete. I need you to explain to them what it takes. \u201cWe as a black community need our white brothers and sisters to explain to the rest of the white brothers and sisters out there what it means for \u2018black lives matter.\u2019\u201d The march comes one day after the Jacksonville Jaguars marched from their home stadium to the steps of the local sheriff\u2019s department in protest of inequality, joining an unprecedented groundswell that\u2019s brought together some of the NFL\u2019s biggest stars. The protests are gathering numbers across the country today, but one protester who spoke to CNN in Washington DC sounded a cautious note about how much would change following the recent demonstrations. \u201cIt is something that has to be solved through legislation, through new precedents being set in the legal system, and social change so people\u2019s mindsets change so we don\u2019t keep fostering the sense of... underlying racial bias in the country. It cannot be solved with a couple marches,\u201d Olivia Butler said. Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has taken a hit over the last few weeks due to his response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the protests following the death of George Floyd. But the Guardian\u2019s Simon Tisdall cautions against the view that Trump\u2019s chances of reelection have been dealt a fatal blow. Revived fury over racial injustice may galvanise the black vote \u2013 a crucial 12.5% of the electorate \u2013 against the president. In 2016, black turnout declined for the first time in 20 years. Biden\u2019s appeal among African-Americans, demonstrated in the primaries, could reverse that trend and provide winning margins in swing states. Among all voters, Biden\u2019s current lead is 11%. Yet Trump has been written off before. He has the advantage of incumbency and an enormous war chest. He plays dirty. By autumn, the economy may have revived, and the pandemic subsided. And gaffe-prone Biden carries much baggage. The protests may have scared as many Middle America voters as they energised. Nobody knows how Trump\u2019s Nixonian appeals to the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201claw and order\u201d will play in Peoria. One thing is certain: he\u2019s a long way from beaten. You can read the full article here: Seattle\u2019s mayor, Jenny Durkan, has urged people who have attended demonstrations in the city to be tested for Covid-19 after concerns over the virus spreading in the packed crowds. \u201cOver the last week, residents across Seattle have been gathering to build community and share their anger and frustration about the killing of George Floyd and injustices against black Americans, here in Seattle and across the country. While I believe everyone should exercise their right and speak out, we must also remember we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic,\u201d Durkan said in the statement. Noa Yachot is on the ground at a march in New York City: Thousands marched across the Brooklyn Bridge toward Manhattan\u2019s City Hall on Saturday afternoon in a peaceful protest that began two miles away. The march to the bridge blocked traffic on Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn\u2019s main artery, but was met with motorists honking in support along the way. The route was dotted with mutual aid activists passing out masks, bottled water, and granola bars. Police largely kept their distance from the crowd. Additional protests throughout the city are planned in multiple locations throughout the day. Washington DC\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has spoken at one of the protests in the city. She said she had \u201cpushed the Army away from our city\u201d after she called on Donald Trump to withdraw thousands of national guard soldiers and federal law enforcement officers from the capital on Friday. She also spoke about her young daughter. \u201cI want to grow up in a country where she is not scared to go to the grocery store, not scared to go to work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere she can grow up in an America where she can be a senator in the 51st state, Washington DC.\u201d She finished her speech by talking about telling the crowd to vote against the president in November\u2019s elections. \u201cToday we say no. In November, we say next,\u201d she said. About 100 people have gathered for a demonstration outside Donald Trump\u2019s golf course near Miami. Latinos For Black Lives Matter organized the protest and people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cDon\u2019t Be A Bunker Boy\u201d, a reference to reports the president retreated to a bunker while protests were underway in Washington DC. A larger demonstration is expected for Miami later on Saturday. Police officers in Buffalo have applauded two of their colleagues who were arraigned in court on Saturday on charges of assault. Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were charged with assaulting a 75-year-old during a protest in the city earlier this week. The man was shown bleeding after striking his head as he fell following a confrontation with the two officers. Torgalski and Robert McCabe both pled not guilty to the assault charges on Saturday and will return to court in July. Torgalski and McCabe have both been suspended over the incident, which was viewed millions of times on social media. Buffalo police initially said the man had tripped during a confrontation but the city\u2019s mayor later condemned the incident. \u201cAfter days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, Police leadership and members of the community, tonight\u2019s event is disheartening,\u201d Byron Brown said. \u201cI hope to continue to build on the progress we have achieved as we work together to address racial injustice and inequity in the City of Buffalo.\u201d The district attorney in Queens, New York, says she will not prosecute anyone arrested for breaking curfew or social distancing measures during protests. \u201cWe are proud to be a united front on this issue. Queens DA Katz is committed to reforms in the name of #SocialJustice and has declined to prosecute based on curfew and social distancing violations,\u201d Katz wrote on Twitter. Her counterpart in Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, is pursuing a similar policy. More video from huge protests in Philadelphia: And Chicago: The curfew in Philadelphia for 8pm remains in place, by the way. In New York, thousands of people have marched from outside the National Black Theatre on 5th Avenue in Harlem up Lennox Avenue to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture about a mile away. The crowd have gathered outside the Center chanting George Floyd and Black Lives Matter. The crowd is mostly young and entirely peaceful although police helicopters hover above. Protests in Washington D.C. are beginning to swell. Demonstrations have started on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, outside the White House and throughout downtown DC. The city closed off certain roads from vehicles in anticipation of huge crowds throughout the sweltering summer day. DC has been the site of police violently cracking down on protesters who have demonstrated outside of the White House nearly every day. DC mayor Muriel Bowser has asked Donald Trump to remove federal troops and forces out of the city, saying that the protests have largely been peaceful and additional police presence could cause alarm. A California artist, along with 300 helpers, painted the words \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on strips of lawn that lead to the state\u2019s capitol building in Sacramento. The same words were also painted on a street that leads to the White House yesterday in Washington DC. Sacramento has been the site of daily, largely peaceful protests. On Friday, hundreds of protesters held a \u201cdie-in\u201d outside the mayors\u2019 outside demanding changes to the police department. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who is a long-time critic of Donald Trump and an advocate for civil rights in the US, has given his thoughts on the civil unrest of the last few weeks. Popovich, who has won five NBA titles with the Spurs, said he believes the \u201ccountry is in trouble\u201d as he discussed the death of George Floyd. \u201cIn a strange, counterintuitive sort of way, the best teaching moment of this most-recent tragedy, I think, was the look on the officer\u2019s face [during Floyd\u2019s death],\u201d Popovich said in a video published by the Spurs. \u201cFor white people to see how nonchalant, how casual, just how everyday going about his job, so much so that he could just put his left hand in his pocket, wriggle his knee around a little bit to teach this person some sort of a lesson \u2013 and that it was his right and his duty to do it, in his mind. \u201cI don\u2019t know ... I think I\u2019m just embarrassed as a white person to know that that can happen. To actually watch a lynching. We\u2019ve all seen books, and you look in the books and you see black people hanging off of trees. And you ... are amazed. But we just saw it again. I never thought I\u2019d see that, with my own eyes, in real time.\u201d Popovich added that it the onus was on white people to solve the scourge of racism in the United States. \u201cWe have to do it. Black people have been shouldering this burden for 400 years,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThe only reason this nation has made the progress it has is because of the persistence, patience and effort of black people. The history of our nation from the very beginning in many ways was a lie, and we continue to this day, mostly black and brown people, to try to make that lie a truth so that it is no longer a lie. And those rights and privileges are enjoyed by people of color, just like we enjoy them. So it\u2019s got to be us, in my opinion, that speak truth to power, and call it out, no matter what the consequences. We have to speak. We have to not let anything go.\u201d Surfers off Rockaway Beach in New York paddled out into the Atlantic today in solidarity with protesters across the country demonstrating against police brutality. Two NYPD patrol boats soon showed up to check out the crowd as the surfers chanted \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has sent out an email to the president\u2019s supporters asking them to sign a petition against people who disrespect the American flag. Here\u2019s what they wrote: Our beautiful American Flag should be respected and anyone who thinks otherwise is simply UN-AMERICAN! President Trump wants to send the left a message that protesting the American Flag is absolutely unacceptable, but he can\u2019t do it without you. He\u2019s calling on YOU to step up. He wants to know who had his back during this time, so we\u2019re sending him a list of supporters who publicly sign their name to stand with him and our flag. This is presumably in response to the NFL apologizing on Friday to its players for clamping down against anti-racism protests - most notably that of Colin Kaepernick - in the past. New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees also apologized for criticizing anthem protests last week before reversing his comments. Trump said Brees had nothing to be sorry for on Friday - and Brees disagreed. He wrote in a message addressed to Trump on Instagram: \u201cTo @realdonaldtrump. Through my ongoing conversations with friends, teammates, and leaders in the black community, I realize this is not an issue about the American flag. It has never been,\u201d Brees wrote. \u201cWe can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities.\u201d Adam Gabbatt has looked at how the protests against police brutality have attracted more cases of police brutality: The nationwide anti-police brutality protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd in the US have been marked by widespread incidents of police violence, including punching, kicking, gassing, pepper-spraying and driving vehicles at often peaceful protesters in states across the country. The actions have left thousands of protesters in jail and injured many others, leaving some with life-threatening injuries. From Minnesota to New York, Texas, California, Washington DC and many places beyond, from small towns to big cities, police officers have demonstrated just how problematic law enforcement is in the US, drawing condemnation from international groups as well as domestic civil rights organizations. The International Crisis Group, which monitors unrest around the world, said the police had used \u201cexcessive force\u201d. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, said: \u201cAll police officers who resort to excessive use of force should be charged and convicted for the crimes committed.\u201d Numerous incidents of police violence have been exposed in disturbing videos and press accounts in recent days, with little sign that police are adjusting their tactics. New York City alone has seen numerous incidents. On Saturday 30 May, officers in a police SUV drove at a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn, knocking several to the ground. A day earlier, a police officer was caught on camera violently shoving a woman to the ground during a demonstration. The woman, Dounya Zayer, was taken to hospital and said she suffered a seizure and concussion. You can read the full story below: An additional 1,800 members of the national guard have been called up in response to the protests and Covid-19 pandemic across America, bringing the total to 43,340. \u201cToday, more than 43,300 National Guard members in 34 states and DC are assisting law enforcement authorities with ongoing civil unrest, while more than 37,000 Guard Soldiers and Airmen continue to support the Covid-19 response,\u201d the national guard wrote in a tweet. Members of the public are attending a memorial service for George Floyd in Fayetteville, near where he was born in North Carolina. Hundreds of people are expected to file into a local church to view his casket before a service for family later in the day. A group on horseback and another on motorcycles staged drive pasts in tribute to Floyd, who was killed last month by police in Minnesota. \u201cThe bigotry against somebody just because of who they are and the color of their skin, because if they\u2019re women or a person of color ... we have to stop the hatred and bigotry,\u201d one mourner, Dan Matthews, told the Fayetteville Observer, adding he had driven four hours to attend the service. \u201cWe all have so much to offer in this world and I think people can only reach their full potential when society lets people be equal, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re fighting for.\u201d Protests have already started in Washington DC. More than a dozen separate demonstrations are expected in the capital today, with tens of thousands of people expected to take part. Much of the city\u2019s downtown has been closed to traffic in anticipation of the crowds. \u201cThe kids wanted to make a difference. The fact that they are kids of color, I didn\u2019t just want them to witness history, I wanted them to be a part of history,\u201d Shanise Hamilton, who was attending one protest along with a number of children in her family, told the Washington Post. Protests are planned in cities across America on Saturday, from New York City to Los Angeles. Texas\u2019 Republican governor Gregg Abbott has condemned four of his party\u2019s state chairs for spreading baseless conspiracy theories that George Floyd\u2019s killing was fabricated in order to hurt Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The Texas Tribune has now identified seven more Texas Republican chairs that have spread such theories. Some promoted the trope that George Soros is helping fund the protest movement across the country. Lynne Teinert, the GOP chairperson for Shackelford County, told the Tribune her comments had been \u201cmostly a joke\u201d. Meanwhile, Cindy Weatherby, the Republican chairperson of Reagan County, shared a post asking 21 \u201cpuzzling questions\u201d over Floyd\u2019s death such as \u201cWhy did the kneeling officer appear completely cool and calm, as if he was posing for the camera?\u201d. Weatherby told the Tribune she did not believe Floyd\u2019s death was staged but added that if \u201chumans don\u2019t question, there\u2019s something wrong with us.\u201d County chairs are elected officials whose duties include things such as overseeing local elections. \u201cThis is a disgusting level of ignorance that\u2019s hard to hear from anyone, much less an elected official,\u201d Texas congresswoman Donna Howard told the Tribune. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see Republican state leaders finally start to push back against this nonsense and look forward to a day when we can actually debate fact-based policy instead of constantly refuting conspiracies.\u201d Cuomo says Friday\u2019s protests in New York were \u201cmainly peaceful\u201d. He adds that the protesters \u201cwant an America as good as its promise\u201d a quote from the civil rights activist Barbara Jordan. \u201cNew York will lead the way on this change,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s talk and there\u2019s action. We have a moment when we can make the change.\u201d He says that the state will enact four policies: a transparency of prior disciplinary records for officers; no chokeholds by police officers; prohibiting false race-based 911 reports and making them a crime; and designating the attorney general as independent prosecutor for police murders. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is giving his daily press briefing. He says 35 people died of Covid-19 in the state over the last 24 hours, the lowest number in weeks in a state that has seen nearly 25,000 die from the virus. Two members Buffalo police officers have pleaded not guilty to assault after video emerged of them pushing a 75-year-old to the ground during protests over the death of George Floyd. The man was shown bleeding after striking his head as he fell. Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were arraigned in a Buffalo court on Saturday and both pled not guilty. They will be back in court on 20 July. Torgalski and McCabe have both been suspended over the incident, which was viewed millions of times on social media. Buffalo police initially said the man had tripped during a confrontation but the city\u2019s mayor later condemned the incident. \u201cAfter days of peaceful protests and several meetings between myself, Police leadership and members of the community, tonight\u2019s event is disheartening,\u201d Byron Brown said. \u201cI hope to continue to build on the progress we have achieved as we work together to address racial injustice and inequity in the City of Buffalo.\u201d Meanwhile, in New York City, two police officers have been suspended over incidents with protesters last week. In the first, a woman was pushed to the ground during a demonstration outside Brooklyn\u2019s Barclays Center, in the second an officer pulled down a man\u2019s facemask and pepper sprayed him. \u201cThe actions by these officers stand apart from the restrained work of the thousands of police officers who have worked tirelessly to protect those who are peacefully protesting and keep all New Yorkers safe,\u201d NYPD commissioner Dermot Shea said in the statement. With Washington DC expecting its biggest march on Saturday since the start of the protests, Lauren Aratani has looked at how the city\u2019s mayor, Muriel Bowser, has emerged as an opponent of one of her city\u2019s residents, Donald Trump: Though it has been home to many Republican presidents, Washington DC has historically elected Democratic African American mayors to lead the city. The city has a population of about 700,000 people; African Americans represent about 46%. It is not just the provocative paint-job that Bowser has taken a stand on. She has denounced bringing in the military to quash protests in the city, calling on Trump to withdraw the thousands of national guard soldiers and federal law enforcement officers who have descended into the capital, including a unit that wore no identification. The protests in Washington have largely been peaceful, local police say. \u201cBecause of our lack of statehood, the federal government can encroach on our city streets in the name of protecting federal assets,\u201d Bowser told MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Thursday. Bowser got in a spat with Trump on Thursday when she had members of the Utah national guard, who were deployed to Washington for the protests, removed from their hotel downtown. The mayor clarified that members of that guard unit were staying in hotel rooms paid for by the city via a contract, and were meant for national guard members who were deployed for the Covid-19 response. You can read the full story here: The sheriff of Hoke county, where today\u2019s memorial service for George Floyd will take place, has spoken to CNN about the difficulties of being a black law enforcement official while protests against racial injustice and police brutality take place across the country. \u201cWe\u2019re [being] questioned from the black community: How can you be a part of all this mess,\u201d said Hubert Peterkin. Peterkin added that Floyd\u2019s family had reached out to ask him to help in arranging Saturday\u2019s service. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how Bridget, the sister, was going to receive me as a law enforcement person,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are mad with law enforcement, who\u2019ve never had an incident. Or they just don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on and they should not like what\u2019s going on. But when I walked in front of this woman, and that family, and they embraced me like they did, and hugged me and said thank you. It was tears. I can\u2019t express the feeling. I left there that day saying, wow, you know, that means there\u2019s some hope.\u201d The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has attacked China\u2019s \u201cobscene propaganda\u201d over the killing of George Floyd. In a statement released on Saturday, Pompeo criticized \u201cthe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s callous exploitation of the tragic death of George Floyd to justify its denial of basic human dignity exposes its true colors yet again.\u201d Pompeo said there was a stark contrast between the way China and the US treat their own citizens. \u201cIn China, when doctors and journalists warn of the dangers of a new disease the [Chinese Communist Party] silences and disappears them ... in the United States, we value life and transparent systems.\u201d Some may argue Pompeo\u2019s boss does not exactly value those transparent systems and the press holding the government to account. There will be a public memorial service for George Floyd today in Fayetteville, North Carolina, close to where he was born. Members of the public will be able to view Floyd\u2019s casket between 11am and 1pm at a local church before a private service for family later in the day. Mourners will be allowed in 10 at a time, and will be asked to wear masks. There will be another memorial for Floyd in Houston, where he spent much of his life. Many members of his extended family still live in North Carolina and will attend today\u2019s service. On Friday night, hundreds of people marched down Fayetteville\u2019s Main Street to mark the killing of Floyd by police in Minnesota. \u201cThis is important to do because this is something that is ongoing,\u201d LaToya Gordon of Hoke County Peacemakers, a group that organized the march, told the Fayetteville Observer. \u201cEverybody felt that we wanted people to know that we can be peaceful and be heard.\u201d The Charlotte Observer has details of the scenes in the town as people start to gather for the memorial: People set up chairs along the busy highway as police dogs scanned the conference-center parking lot. Vendors set up across the highway, giving out Black Lives Matter buttons and selling Floyd shirts that read, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Gregg Packer took an overnight train from Long Island in New York, arriving in Fayetteville at 3 a.m. \u201cI felt like I needed to come down here to support the protests and the family of George Floyd,\u201d he said, placing an emphasis on the slain man\u2019s name. \u201cI hope that we can all get along with each other, that we can start treating each other the way we all should.\u201d Some locals found meaning in a global event arriving at their door, feeling compelled to represent their corner of the world. \u201cWith Fayetteville being a small town, it\u2019s a military town but it\u2019s still small, and Raeford is even smaller,\u201d said Gracie Howard. \u201cAll eyes being on this community, it\u2019s opened up a lot of eyes to racial injustice. This has been going on too long. And George, he changed the world.\u201d The NFL, which has willingly acquiesced to Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to peaceful protesting since Colin Kaepernick began kneeling during the national anthem in 2016, changed tack last night. The league\u2019s commissioner, Roger Goodell, put out a statement admitting the league had been wrong not to listen to its players\u2019 opposition to racism (although, significantly, Goodell did not mention Kaepernick, who has been effectively exiled from the league). Melissa Jacobs has written on the significance of Goodell\u2019s statement: Goodell hardly deserves a parade for his change of tone. After all, his NFL is the one that tossed aside its moral compass and turned its back on Kaepernick four years ago and every day since. Goodell\u2019s statement would have been far more powerful had he mentioned Kaepernick by name. Either way, the NFL\u2019s banishment of Kaepernick is a permanent stain on the NFL. Nothing can change that now. Goodell\u2019s statement was not proactive but reactive to a litany of players who drew a line in the sand. But it was quick and decisive and achieved the unthinkable: The NFL gave Donald Trump the middle finger. It finally detached itself from Trump and his crazy, dangerous strategy of exploiting the flag and national anthem to suppress and demonize peaceful protest. You can read the full article below: The Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh has filed a grievance after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette pulled an African American reporter from its coverage of this week\u2019s protests because they believed she lacked objectivity. In a tweet that went viral, Alexis Johnson compared the looting that has taken place at some protests over the police killing of George Floyd to the damage caused by fans at a concert by country singer Kenny Chesney. Members of the Pittsburgh guild subsequently sent identical versions of Johnson\u2019s tweet along with the hashtag #IStandWithAlexis. \u201cWe feel taking a black woman off the most monumental national story about civil rights in the last 50 years is punishment,\u201d the guild\u2019s president, Michael A Fuoco, told the Associated Press. \u201cWe have very few black journalists. Someone who has the contacts and the insights for this story, that is what you want.\u201d The Post-Gazette is yet to comment on the matter. On Friday, Pittsburgh mayor Bill Peduto praised Johnson\u2019s reporting. \u201cI have first account knowledge of her reporting,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cShe has been fair in questioning all sides. She has been critical of me &amp; our administration- when it was necessary. Most importantly, she has been professional in journalistic accepted practices &amp; integrity.\u201d Johnson said on Friday she has been touched by the support she has received. \u201cOkay. Now I\u2019m crying thank you @PGNewsGuild for going to bat for me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you everyone for your support and your words of encouragement, your actions. I am just ... wow. Thank you.\u201d General Charles Q Brown Jr, a nominee to become the US Air Force\u2019s first-ever black service chief, has posted a video to Twitter talking about his experiences as an African American military member. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how full I am with emotion, not just for George Floyd, but the many African Americans who have suffered the same fate as George Floyd. I\u2019m thinking about protests in my country ... The equality expressed in our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution that I\u2019ve sworn my adult life to protect and defend,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking \u2026 about my own experiences, that didn\u2019t always sing of liberty and equality. I\u2019m thinking about living in two worlds, each with their own perspective and views.\u201d Brown logged 130 combat hours as a fighter pilot but said he had to work harder than others in the Air Force to prove himself. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about the pressure that I felt to perform error free, especially for supervisors that I perceived expected less of me as an African American,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about having to represent, to work twice as hard, to prove that their perceptions of African Americans were invalid.\u201d A report last week detailed racial disparities in the Air Force\u2019s justice system. Brown talked in the video how he hopes he can change the service if he is appointed as the service\u2019s new head. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about how my nomination provides some hope but also comes with a heavy burden,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t fix centuries of racism in our country, nor can I fix decades of discrimination that may have affected members of our Air Force.\u201d Reports last week indicated the US attorney general, William Barr, had ordered law enforcement to use gas and horses to clear a group of peaceful protesters who had gathered near the White House so that Donald Trump could hold a photo opportunity outside a local church. Now Barr, like so many Trump allies, is in damage limitation mode and says he did not personally issue any such command \u2013 even if he agreed with it. \u201cI\u2019m not involved in giving tactical commands like that,\u201d Barr told the Associated Press on Friday. \u201cI was frustrated and I was also worried that as the crowd grew, it was going to be harder and harder to do. So my attitude was get it done, but I didn\u2019t say, \u2018Go do it.\u2019\u201d Guardian columnist Lloyd Green has had a deeper look at Barr, and his influence in Trump\u2019s administration: Where Trump has been a bumbling, self-interested and ideologically erratic leader \u2013 a weak man\u2019s strongman \u2013 Barr is smart, dedicated and disciplined. He understands how to wield power and holds a consistent worldview. He\u2019s an aggressive advocate for executive power and the police \u2013 who happens to be America\u2019s top law enforcement officer at the same time as unrest roils the country. You can read the full article here: I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Tom Lutz in New York now, thank you to everyone for reading along and sending in your comments and suggestions. Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn explains why the unrest sparked by the police killing of George Floyd could be a defining moment for racial politics in America, and how the coronavirus pandemic set the backdrop for the protests. Despite warnings from the government to avoid mass gatherings due to Covid-19 restrictions, Parliament Square in London is already full of protesters today. Other protests are planned for around the country, including in Manchester, Leicester, Sheffield and Newcastle Upon Tyne. The home secretary, Priti Patel, urged people not to join the Black Lives Matter protests because \u201cwe must put public health first at this particular time\u201d. She said: I completely understand people\u2019s desire to express their views and have that right to protest, but the fact of the matter is we are in a health pandemic. I\u2019d say that those who want to protest, please don\u2019t. Videos have shown hundreds of protesters kneeling in silence - a gesture used to protest against police brutality and racism. Meanwhile, some people are handing out free personal protective equipment (PPE) to demonstrators - hand sanitiser, gloves and masks. With a knee to his neck and head against the concrete, George Floyd became the face of one of the largest uprisings in modern American history. His final moments at the hands of four Minneapolis police officers was replayed on social media and television all across a country that was already in crisis. America is in economic free fall as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And it is black Americans who have been disproportionately impacted by mounting deaths and crushing job losses, making up a disproportionate number of the 42 million people left unemployed. Black Americans, already subjected to generations of systemic racism, were now more likely to die from the coronavirus and also faced losing their jobs in higher numbers as a result of record unemployment. George Floyd, then, was no exception. State medical examiners confirmed this week that Floyd had contracted the coronavirus by late-April. He had also lost his job. But that didn\u2019t cause his death. Instead, Floyd died from what historian Carol Anderson called \u201cthe longest ongoing saga in American history\u201d. In Paris, police have banned a protest planned for Saturday, citing the risk of spreading Covid-19 and fears of public unrest. The police decree noted that social distancing regulations ban gatherings of more than 10 people. Preparing for the eventuality that protesters would ignore the ban, French police sealed off roads around the US Embassy early on Saturday. The British government urged people not to gather in large numbers and police have warned that mass demonstrations could be unlawful. Though the demonstrations, such as one planned for Saturday on Parliament Square in central London, have not been banned directly, they could fall foul of lockdown restrictions. In England, gatherings of more than six people are not permitted. That restriction didn\u2019t stop thousands gathering on Wednesday in a largely peaceful protest in central London over Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cThe reason that it is vital that people stick to the rules this weekend is to protect themselves and their family from this horrific disease\u201d, British health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. \u201cSo please, for the safety of your loved ones, do not attend large gatherings including demonstrations of more than six people.\u201d In Berlin, where a Black Lives Matter rally was scheduled for Saturday afternoon, police said several store windows were smashed overnight and walls were painted with slogans referring to George Floyd\u2019s death. Donald Trump promised on Twitter this week that \u201cthe United States of America will be designating ANTIFA as a Terrorist Organization\u201d. Legal experts immediately threw cold water on the proposal, arguing that there may be no means by which any domestic entity can be designated in this way. But, perhaps more importantly, experts also say that there is no actual antifa organization for Trump to define in this way. Put simply: antifa does not really exist as a distinct entity. Doctors, nurses and disease experts have warned that dousing crowds with teargas and pepper spray will accelerate the spread of coronavirus as mass demonstrations against police brutality rage on. Nearly 1,300 medical providers and public health experts have signed a petition this week calling for police to stop using the chemical agents, amid scenes of law enforcement officers launching plumes of chemical irritants and smoke to subdue demonstrators in Minneapolis, Philadelphia, New York and many other American cities. Because coronavirus spreads through droplets of mucus and spit that people launch into the air when they cough, sneeze, breathe and talk, teargas and other irritants that cause people to choke, hack and rip off their face masks will help the virus proliferate, according to Dr Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease physician who helped draft the petition. For 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time it took George Floyd, an unarmed black man, to die at the hands of Minneapolis police - cable TV kids channel Nickelodeon\u2019s screen went black on Tuesday to sounds of inhaling and exhaling, as white text flashed \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Pokemon pledged $100,000 in support for Black Lives Matter. Sesame Street is co-hosting a televised town hall meeting with CNN on Saturday morning. These are just a few of the examples of how companies that entertain or sell products for kids are adjusting their messages, as they attempt to deal with this moment in American history and explain the complexities of racism and police brutality to children through action and words. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to try to preserve the innocence of children, but you shouldn\u2019t preserve the ignorance of children in a country that is multiracial that has this bad history,\u201d CNN commentator Van Jones told Reuters in an interview on Friday. Jones and CNN anchor Erica Hill will host an hour-long special on CNN titled Coming Together: Standing Up to Racism in partnership with Sesame Street. The show aims to teach school-aged children how to identify inequality and speak out against it. Experts said parents need help interpreting for children the relentless barrage of messages on social media and on television as peaceful protesters and looters clash with authorities all across the country. \u201cI have seen a spike in anxiety for my black kid clients because they are having access to the news,\u201d said Javonte\u2019 Bass, a clinical mental health counselor. \u201cWhen the parents are watching, they\u2019re listening.\u201d Fear of catching the coronavirus forced families indoors. Fear of dying at the hands of police are keeping kids from going back out, Bass said. One nine-year-old black child even asked Bass, \u201cAm I going to get shot, too?\u201d On CNN\u2019s event, Jones said viewers should not expect a historical rundown of slavery and colonialism in the United States. The show will urge parents to teach their children empathy. \u201cFailing to teach kids about empathy and fairness is always harmful,\u201d Jones said. Guardian reporters in the US and around the world reflect on a week of profound unrest \u2013 and, possibly, change. Chris McGreal, Guardian US reporter, in Minneapolis This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US. I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks. Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Aamna Mohdin, Guardian reporter, in London The killing of George Floyd took place thousands of miles from the UK, but the anger and pain that sparked mass protests in the US has resonated deeply across the Atlantic. Last weekend, protests sprung up sporadically in Cardiff, London, Manchester, and Nottingham to state clearly that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in the UK as well. The protesters, the vast majority of whom were under 30, chanted: \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and \u201cthe UK is not innocent\u201d, in a demonstration that was largely organised through word of mouth and social media away from established anti-racism groups. Teenagers, who said they had grown up with videos of black people dying on their timelines, shouted: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d Julian Borger, world affairs editor, in Washington DC There were different currents inside the crowds outside the White House. The great majority were there for a protest, but there were small groups weaving in and out looking break and burn things. In similar situations of civil unrest I have witnessed elsewhere in the world, there was a sense that being a journalist with credentials around your neck afforded some personal protection. Journalists in the melee outside the White House knew that wasn\u2019t true here. Reporters have been targeted all over the country. It was an unnerving feeling, that a line had been crossed in the relations between the police and press. It seemed to me that the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d rhetoric of the president had been internalised. I think it will be hard to change that back. On Tuesday 9 June at 7pm BST (2pm EDT) the Guardian is holding a live-streamed event about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing, featuring Guardian journalists including US southern bureau chief Oliver Laughland, reporter Kenya Evelyn, writer Chris McGreal and columnist Malaika Jabali. Book tickets here. False social media rumors about so-called antifa activists traveling en masse into rural areas of America have led rightwing vigilantes to carry out armed patrols of small cities and towns in the western United States and beyond. In some cases, local activists planning peaceful protests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and in protest at the killing of George Floyd have been inundated with death threats. Since Donald Trump tweeted recently that antifa would be declared a terrorist group, the term has gained broader currency on the American right and is seen as a dire threat. In fact, it simply means \u201canti-fascist\u201d and is used to describe a wide spectrum of leftist and anarchist groups and individuals. It has no existence as a separate organization. The FBI has said there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of antifa involvement in violence linked to the Floyd protests and NBC News has reported one supposed antifa group posting violent rhetoric on the internet was in fact linked to white supremacists. But in the Idaho city of Coeur d\u2019Alene, groups of 30-50 men armed with semi-automatic weapons have occupied downtown streets on successive evenings this week, guarding against supposed busloads of radical leftists rumored to traveling from cities such as Spokane or Seattle, according to local residents and social media materials obtained by the Guardian. Videos posted to social media by supporters of the vigilante groups showed dozens of people walking up and down a downtown shopping strip, with many open-carrying AR-15s and other semi-automatic long guns, and sporting tactical apparel. Reports coming in of police spraying protesters with pepper spray and at least one arrest after a demonstration in Sydney, Australia. Tens of thousands of people marched through Australian cities and towns for Black Lives Matter protests on Saturday, defying an attempt from the police to ban one demonstration through the courts. In a dramatic turn of events, a massive crowd in Sydney learned just as they were gathering outside the city\u2019s Town Hall that the New South Wales court of appeal had ruled their rally was now lawful. They were drawing attention to racial profiling, police brutality and the more than 400 Indigenous people who have died in police custody since a royal commission into the problem was held in 1991. In Sydney, there were some ugly scenes when police officers used pepper spray on protesters who had flowed into Central station after the rally finished. Some protesters were visibly hurt by the spray, with eyes streaming, and there were accusations that the remaining crowd had been forced together into a small space in the station and unable to move. One journalist who was at the scene in Central station filmed the incident, showing what looks like a man being arrested and some physical altercations between police and protesters, while people chant \u201cblack lives matter\u201d in the background. At least 20,000 people marched in Sydney for the \u2018Stop All Black Deaths in Custody\u2019 rally, which was declared an authorised public assembly minutes before its scheduled start time of 3pm, after a court ruling was overturned. Thousands of protesters rallied in cities and towns across Australia to march against Indigenous deaths in custody and the killing of George Floyd. Hi, welcome to our US politics live blog which will be following the Black Lives Matter protests across the world sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis 12 days ago. I\u2019m Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the blog for the next few hours - feel free to get in touch via email (jessica.murray@theguardian.com) or via Twitter (@journojess_) Protesters are expected to gather in Washington for a huge demonstration on Saturday. \u201cWe have a lot of public, open source information to suggest that the event on this upcoming Saturday may be one of the largest we\u2019ve ever had in the city,\u201d Washington DC police chief Peter Newsham said. North Carolina governor Roy Cooper has ordered that all flags at state facilities be lowered to half-staff from sunrise to sunset on Saturday in honor of Floyd, who was originally from the state\u2019s Fayetteville city. A televised memorial service will also be held in the city. Here is a quick recap of the latest developments in the last day or so: On Friday, marches and gatherings took place in Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Miami, New York and Denver, among other places, while protesters massed again, in the rain, in front of the White House. The night-time protests were largely peaceful but tension remains high even as authorities in several places take steps to reform police procedures. A federal judge in Denver ordered city police to stop using tear gas, plastic bullets and other \u201cless-than-lethal\u201d devices such as flash grenades, with his ruling citing examples of protesters and journalists being injured by police. In Minneapolis, Democratic city leaders voted to end the use of knee restraints and choke-holds, where pressure is applied to the neck, while California governor Gavin Newsom said he would end state police training of carotid restraints similar to the technique used on Floyd. Black Lives Matter activists have called for cities to defund police departments. Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat who in April proposed increasing law enforcement funding, this week reversed course and said he would seek some $150m in cuts to the LA Police Department. National Football League (NFL) commissioner Roger Goodell said the league had made mistakes in not listening to players. The NFL has been locked in a debate with players over kneeling protests during the playing of the national anthem. Two police officers in Buffalo, New York, were suspended without pay on Thursday and placed under investigation after a video showed them shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground. But the decision was met with pushback from the officers\u2019 colleagues, with all 57 members of the police tactical unit quitting in protest at their treatment. Finally, the protests have now spread right across the globe with people in Australia, Japan and South Korea all taking to the streets in solidarity with those in the US and to call out issues of systemic racism in their own countries.",

But rioters left a five-mile long scar through southern Minneapolis as they burned and looted their way along one of the area\u2019s main shopping thoroughfares after ransacking the police station at the centre of the storm over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>From there, a surge of anger radiated across the country, driven in good part by the nature of the nine-minute video of Floyd\u2019s killing, but also the frustration that for all the promises made with each police killing of an unarmed black man they do not stop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When the traumatic video of Floyd begging for his life met the tinder of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, surging unemployment and a tanking economy the fire raced through America. It ignited protests and riots from New York to Los Angeles and the south, and then London, Berlin and beyond.</p> \n<p>Now, as 50 years ago, the national guard were called out to face down the demonstrators, although this time it was also to stand guard over the violent dispersal of a legal and peaceful protest to provide a photo op for Trump. Now, as then, the president accused \u201coutside agitators\u201d \u2013 Trump called them terrorists \u2013 of stirring up trouble.</p> \n<p>But this time, voices from the American establishment spoke up in support of those demands, and warned that the US is at an inflection point.</p> \n<p>So, apparently, was Trump\u2019s presidency, as he flailed while his tested tactic of divide-and-rule proved less effective. The power of the nearly nine minutes of Floyd\u2019s suffering as the police officer charged with his murder, Derek Chauvin, looked into the camera was taken as a statement of police contempt for African American lives and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>It was the moment when many of the doubters in America, the people always prepared to give the police the benefit of the doubt, were confronted with the indisputable evidence that police treat black people differently. If further evidence was required it came in the swirl of recordings of officers beating peaceful unarmed demonstrators that in some cities, including New York, drew accusations of a police riot.</p> \n<p>By the end of the week, the entire culture and practice of policing in America was on trial and not just over Floyd. But it was more than just policing.</p> \n<p>Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, where the protests began, described the uprising as a singular opportunity in his state\u2019s history to break the chain of \u201csystemic racism and the lack of accountability up and down our society that led to a daytime murder of a black man on a street in Minneapolis\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think this is probably our last shot as a state and a nation to fix this systemic issue,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Rev Al Sharpton, a central figure in America\u2019s civil rights movement, put it more succinctly in a rallying cry at the Minneapolis memorial service for Floyd on Thursday. White America, he said, needed \u201cto get off our neck\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he cried to shouts of agreement. \u201cWe could do whatever anyone else could do. But we couldn\u2019t get your knee off our neck. What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were signs that the rest of America is ever more willing to hear that message than ever.</p> \n<p>Almost no one was willing to try to defend Chauvin\u2019s abuse of Floyd.</p> \n<p>Whereas construction workers turned on the anti-war protesters who marched through New York after the national guard shot demonstrators at Kent State University in 1970, this week \u201chard hats\u201d working in the city were seen clapping the demonstrators demanding justice.</p> \n<p>As the police teargassed and shot at people protesting legally from Portland to Kansas City, those on the receiving end included Americans not usually found marching to demand police accountability. Even some Republicans normally quick to defend the police were alarmed enough by the video of Floyd\u2019s death to turn out to march.</p> \n<p>In many places, the violent police response to legitimate protest only strengthened the sense that the problem lies deep in the culture of militarised police departments that act like occupation forces in minority communities.</p> \n<p>Yet there were also glimpses of progress. Police officers in other parts of the country \u2013 in Texas, Kentucky, Florida and other Trump states \u2013 went down on bended knee in a show of solidarity with the demands of demonstrators. Among them was the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 the birthplace of the Black Lives Matters movement six years ago following riots and protests over the police killing of Michael Brown.</p> \n<p>The president instinctively lashed out over a crisis he couldn\u2019t control, with his tested attempts to create division and mayhem. But it proved to be the week when lines began to be drawn on the limits of Trump\u2019s power to subvert.</p> \n<p>The president has already neutralised the US justice department, freeing his allies from prison and compromising investigations. The supreme court is weighted in favour of his agenda, thanks to the highly politicised nomination process placing ideology over competenceunder a Republican-run Senate afraid of Trump.</p> \n<p>That left the military as the remaining branch of government over which his malign influence was not yet decisive.</p> \n<p>Then came what was quickly tagged the Battle of Lafayette Square, a small patch of park in front of the White House.</p> \n<p>A large and noisy group of protesters had gathered there to make known their support for demands that all of the police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death be arrested. Ever sensitive to criticism, Trump was feeling humiliated by a report that he\u2019d bolted for a bunker under the White House a few days previously when demonstrators tried to climb its fence.</p> \n<p>Driven by his inner Putin, Trump decided to prove his courage by wading manfully into Lafayette Square to have his photo taken holding a Bible in front of a church. That would have the added benefit of playing to the evangelical vote.</p> \n<p>But first the peaceful protesters had to be cleared. Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, ordered the police to empty the square, which they did with teargas and baton charges backed by soldiers of the national guard.</p> \n<p>Not long after, the sight of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, in combat fatigues marching behind the president as he strode across Lafayette Square seemed to give a stamp of approval to Trump\u2019s threat to turn out the military against those he was labelling domestic terrorists.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/nfl-decision-to-permit-kneeling-protest-by-players-enrages-donald-trump\">NFL decision to permit kneeling protest by players enrages Donald Trump</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The defence secretary, Mark Esper, had told state governors to \u201cdominate the battle space\u201d by which he meant up the use of force in their cities. The president\u2019s allies in Congress upped the ante, with Senator Tom Cotton proposing to send in the 82nd Airborne or \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d against those he called \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d. Trump, as ever on Twitter, gave that idea the thumbs up.</p> \n<p>Faced with this, America\u2019s military establishment chose a side.</p> \n<p>The first to break cover was James Mattis, the marine general who resigned as Trump\u2019s defence secretary in December 2018 and kept silent until now. He described himself \u201cangry and appalled\u201d at Trump\u2019s response to the protests and called him as a threat to the constitution.</p> \n<p>\u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,\u201d said Mattis. </p> \n<p>Mattis\u2019s specific point of contention was Trump\u2019s use of the military to clear protesters \u201cto provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"59af7e1428e00f863dc59f77673daa033ee1eada\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59af7e1428e00f863dc59f77673daa033ee1eada/0_0_3705_2859/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump holds his Bible in front of St John\u2019s church.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"772\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump holds his Bible in front of St John\u2019s church.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn Thew/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said he was \u201csickened\u201d to see the national guard and other security forces used to \u201cforcibly and violently\u201d clear a path for the president\u2019s \u201cstunt\u201d. He accused Trump of disdain for the right of peaceful protest and said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d that the military will be co-opted for political purposes.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump\u2019s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The head of the national guard, Gen Joseph Lengyel, felt it necessary to stake out a position just in case anyone thought he was siding with the president on the value of black lives. He said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Floyd\u2019s killing and \u201cenraged\u201d at the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of \u201cpolice brutality and extrajudicial violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>Esper retreated. On Wednesday, he disavowed the idea of sending the military in to control the streets of America\u2019s cities. Not long after, the Pentagon began pulling out 1,600 troops moved to the Washington DC area during the protests. Few expect Esper to survive in his job for very much longer.</p> \n<p>But the real damage was inflicted on Trump. His chaotic handling of Covid-19, with deaths close to 110,000 and rising, had already damaged his diminishing prospects for re-election.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has also badly hit the one issue on which many Trump voters were prepared to forgive him all else: the economy. More than 20m jobs were lost in April.

      "bodyText": "America has been here before, split by racial division that left its cities in flames and its citizens demanding a different country. But not for half a century, and never with a president whose responses to demands for basic justice were so belligerent and divisive that even his former top military officials have turned on him. By the end of the week, Donald Trump, who promised to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to protect America, had thrown up a large steel fence around the White House as the sense of a presidency under siege grew. The fires lit in Minneapolis by a police officer squeezing the life out of George Floyd, by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignited the biggest protests since the anti-Vietnam war and civil rights movement of the 1960s. Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, and where they weren\u2019t that was frequently down to the police. But rioters left a five-mile long scar through southern Minneapolis as they burned and looted their way along one of the area\u2019s main shopping thoroughfares after ransacking the police station at the centre of the storm over Floyd\u2019s death. From there, a surge of anger radiated across the country, driven in good part by the nature of the nine-minute video of Floyd\u2019s killing, but also the frustration that for all the promises made with each police killing of an unarmed black man they do not stop. When the traumatic video of Floyd begging for his life met the tinder of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, surging unemployment and a tanking economy the fire raced through America. It ignited protests and riots from New York to Los Angeles and the south, and then London, Berlin and beyond. Now, as 50 years ago, the national guard were called out to face down the demonstrators, although this time it was also to stand guard over the violent dispersal of a legal and peaceful protest to provide a photo op for Trump. Now, as then, the president accused \u201coutside agitators\u201d \u2013 Trump called them terrorists \u2013 of stirring up trouble. But this time, voices from the American establishment spoke up in support of those demands, and warned that the US is at an inflection point. So, apparently, was Trump\u2019s presidency, as he flailed while his tested tactic of divide-and-rule proved less effective. The power of the nearly nine minutes of Floyd\u2019s suffering as the police officer charged with his murder, Derek Chauvin, looked into the camera was taken as a statement of police contempt for African American lives and the Black Lives Matter movement. It was the moment when many of the doubters in America, the people always prepared to give the police the benefit of the doubt, were confronted with the indisputable evidence that police treat black people differently. If further evidence was required it came in the swirl of recordings of officers beating peaceful unarmed demonstrators that in some cities, including New York, drew accusations of a police riot. By the end of the week, the entire culture and practice of policing in America was on trial and not just over Floyd. But it was more than just policing. Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, where the protests began, described the uprising as a singular opportunity in his state\u2019s history to break the chain of \u201csystemic racism and the lack of accountability up and down our society that led to a daytime murder of a black man on a street in Minneapolis\u201d. \u201cI think this is probably our last shot as a state and a nation to fix this systemic issue,\u201d he said. The Rev Al Sharpton, a central figure in America\u2019s civil rights movement, put it more succinctly in a rallying cry at the Minneapolis memorial service for Floyd on Thursday. White America, he said, needed \u201cto get off our neck\u201d. \u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he cried to shouts of agreement. \u201cWe could do whatever anyone else could do. But we couldn\u2019t get your knee off our neck. What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d There were signs that the rest of America is ever more willing to hear that message than ever. Almost no one was willing to try to defend Chauvin\u2019s abuse of Floyd. Whereas construction workers turned on the anti-war protesters who marched through New York after the national guard shot demonstrators at Kent State University in 1970, this week \u201chard hats\u201d working in the city were seen clapping the demonstrators demanding justice. As the police teargassed and shot at people protesting legally from Portland to Kansas City, those on the receiving end included Americans not usually found marching to demand police accountability. Even some Republicans normally quick to defend the police were alarmed enough by the video of Floyd\u2019s death to turn out to march. In many places, the violent police response to legitimate protest only strengthened the sense that the problem lies deep in the culture of militarised police departments that act like occupation forces in minority communities. Yet there were also glimpses of progress. Police officers in other parts of the country \u2013 in Texas, Kentucky, Florida and other Trump states \u2013 went down on bended knee in a show of solidarity with the demands of demonstrators. Among them was the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 the birthplace of the Black Lives Matters movement six years ago following riots and protests over the police killing of Michael Brown. The president instinctively lashed out over a crisis he couldn\u2019t control, with his tested attempts to create division and mayhem. But it proved to be the week when lines began to be drawn on the limits of Trump\u2019s power to subvert. The president has already neutralised the US justice department, freeing his allies from prison and compromising investigations. The supreme court is weighted in favour of his agenda, thanks to the highly politicised nomination process placing ideology over competenceunder a Republican-run Senate afraid of Trump. That left the military as the remaining branch of government over which his malign influence was not yet decisive. Then came what was quickly tagged the Battle of Lafayette Square, a small patch of park in front of the White House. A large and noisy group of protesters had gathered there to make known their support for demands that all of the police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death be arrested. Ever sensitive to criticism, Trump was feeling humiliated by a report that he\u2019d bolted for a bunker under the White House a few days previously when demonstrators tried to climb its fence. Driven by his inner Putin, Trump decided to prove his courage by wading manfully into Lafayette Square to have his photo taken holding a Bible in front of a church. That would have the added benefit of playing to the evangelical vote. But first the peaceful protesters had to be cleared. Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, ordered the police to empty the square, which they did with teargas and baton charges backed by soldiers of the national guard. Not long after, the sight of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, in combat fatigues marching behind the president as he strode across Lafayette Square seemed to give a stamp of approval to Trump\u2019s threat to turn out the military against those he was labelling domestic terrorists. The defence secretary, Mark Esper, had told state governors to \u201cdominate the battle space\u201d by which he meant up the use of force in their cities. The president\u2019s allies in Congress upped the ante, with Senator Tom Cotton proposing to send in the 82nd Airborne or \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d against those he called \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d. Trump, as ever on Twitter, gave that idea the thumbs up. Faced with this, America\u2019s military establishment chose a side. The first to break cover was James Mattis, the marine general who resigned as Trump\u2019s defence secretary in December 2018 and kept silent until now. He described himself \u201cangry and appalled\u201d at Trump\u2019s response to the protests and called him as a threat to the constitution. \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,\u201d said Mattis. Mattis\u2019s specific point of contention was Trump\u2019s use of the military to clear protesters \u201cto provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside\u201d. Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said he was \u201csickened\u201d to see the national guard and other security forces used to \u201cforcibly and violently\u201d clear a path for the president\u2019s \u201cstunt\u201d. He accused Trump of disdain for the right of peaceful protest and said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d that the military will be co-opted for political purposes. \u201cI have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump\u2019s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent,\u201d he said. The head of the national guard, Gen Joseph Lengyel, felt it necessary to stake out a position just in case anyone thought he was siding with the president on the value of black lives. He said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Floyd\u2019s killing and \u201cenraged\u201d at the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of \u201cpolice brutality and extrajudicial violence\u201d. Esper retreated. On Wednesday, he disavowed the idea of sending the military in to control the streets of America\u2019s cities. Not long after, the Pentagon began pulling out 1,600 troops moved to the Washington DC area during the protests. Few expect Esper to survive in his job for very much longer. But the real damage was inflicted on Trump. His chaotic handling of Covid-19, with deaths close to 110,000 and rising, had already damaged his diminishing prospects for re-election. The pandemic has also badly hit the one issue on which many Trump voters were prepared to forgive him all else: the economy. More than 20m jobs were lost in April. May saw 2.5m of those return, although unemployment for African Americans kept rising. Trump\u2019s response to the employment numbers on Friday was to describe it as a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd. \u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing happening for our country. A great day for him, a great day for everybody,\u201d he said. For his critics, the comment was another piece of the president\u2019s casual callousness mixed with self-obsession. But for all his boasts, Trump can no longer make claims for a booming economy, even if stock market growth did not translate into better standards of living for most Americans. \u201cIf 110,000 people have died and there\u2019s been no response, if we can move the national guard in a matter of hours but we can\u2019t keep people safe from a pandemic, it goes to show what the priorities are,\u201d said Annie Isler, a middle school teacher outside the Floyd\u2019s memorial in Minneapolis. Opinion polls put Joe Biden, now officially the Democratic nominee, ahead by 10 points or more. Confronted with this on Fox News, Trump said that four years ago the polls said Hillary Clinton was going to win and they were wrong. In any case, he has his own numbers. \u201cI have other polls where I\u2019m winning, and you\u2019ve seen them, too, I guess,\u201d he said. No one else appeared to know where these polls were. As Minneapolis picked up the pieces, Al Sharpton led the memorial service for George Floyd. Alongside his demand for white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d, and the heart rending glimpses into Floyd\u2019s life from his family, perhaps the most tortuous part for the mourners was when Sharpton asked them to stand in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds to understand just how long Chauvin kept his knee pressing down on the African American man\u2019s neck. \u201cAs you go through these long eight minutes, think about what George was going through, laying there for those eight minutes, begging for his own life. We can\u2019t keep living like this,\u201d he said. But Sharpton is a preacher, and he was not going to leave his audience without a brighter future to cling to. \u201cI\u2019m more hopeful today than ever,\u201d he told the mourners. \u201cWhen I looked this time and saw marchers were in some cases young whites outnumbering the black marchers, I know that it is a different time and a different season.\u201d Sharpton described an incident at a civil rights march years ago and being confronted by a white woman who looked him in the face and said: \u201cNigger go home.\u201d This week he came face-to-face with a young white girl. \u201cI braced myself and she looked at me and said: no justice, no peace,\u201d Sharpton recalled, to a roar of approval from the mourners. \u201cThis is the time. We won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep going until we change the whole system of justice.\u201d",

These are just three examples of ordinary people who have responded in extraordinary ways. Their actions speak of selflessness, defiance and bravery in the face of the invisible threat that hovers around us in the very air that we breathe. But they also provide us with glimpses of the immense human cost of the pandemic, the great well of loss, fear, sadness and grief beneath the mounting statistics.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Britain, as I write, 37,000 people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/coronavirus-uk-map-the-latest-deaths-and-confirmed-cases-near-you\">lost their lives</a> to the Covid-19 virus, while 267,000 have experienced and survived the terrible uncertainty of infection. As a fragile normality slowly returns, many mental health experts are asking the inevitable questions: what will be the long-term emotional and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/urgent-studies-needed-mental-health-coronavirus-lockdown\">psychological cost</a> of such a sudden and seismic disruption of our way of life?</p> <p>\u201cHow the outside impacts on the inside is something that people like me think about all the time,\u201d says psychotherapist and author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susie-orbach\">Susie Orbach</a>. \u201cBut now we are seeing it on a grand scale. The pandemic has been a prolonged assault from outside on our community. The state of uncertainty and unsafety it has created is new and utterly unfamiliar. Unless you are a refugee who has risked their life to get here, or a survivor of childhood abuse that could not be escaped, there is simply nothing to compare it to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eceac7aaf1ea9f3150268c9a61a1682a7ad772fe/0_0_1142_1252/912.jpg\" alt=\"Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell\" width=\"912\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose \u2018Billy\u2019 Mitchell, who died in a nursing home in London.

Leaving aside the probability of another spike, the aftershock of the pandemic is likely to last a long time and leave yet more casualties in its wake.&nbsp;</p> <p>Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical psychoanalyst at the Tavistock and Portman clinic in London, is a specialist in trauma who has worked with survivors of the London terrorist attacks and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/grenfell-tower-fire\">Grenfell Tower</a> disaster. Those kinds of emergencies, she explains, are classed as \u201csingle events that occur within a limited time-frame and affect a defined population\u201d. A global pandemic does not fit that model.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For those with a history of trauma, it has been a particularly difficult time</p> <footer> <cite>Susie Orbach</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/mental-health\">mental health services</a> have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d</p> <p>It is in the coming months and even years, then, that the psychological effects of the pandemic will become most apparent. \u201cTrauma occurs when you are overwhelmed by an event that you cannot process,\u201d says Julia Samuel, grief counsellor and bestselling author, whose latest book is titled <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/12/grief-works-stories-life-death-and-surviving-review-julia-samuel\">Grief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving</a></em>. \u201cWhile the crisis is happening, you are in it and everything is uncertain and unpredictable. You don\u2019t have the emotional freedom to allow yourself to process the trauma, so it is held in the body. The most common reaction is to shut down and just exist somehow. It is only when the external world becomes more safe and predictable again that people may feel able to reach out for support.\u201d</p> <p>Those most at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress are the frontline medical staff who, in the first chaotic weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, may have felt overwhelmed&nbsp;by the dramatically increased levels of patient suffering and deaths, as well as at risk from infection from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/medical-staff-face-weeks-without-protective-gowns\">inadequate PPE</a> and anxious about bringing the virus home with them.&nbsp;</p> <p>Studies have also shown that, in ordinary times,&nbsp;patients who have spent time in intensive care are at a 20% increased risk of developing PTSD. \u201cAlready with some of the support initiatives that have been put in place, we are seeing survivors of Covid-19 showing post-traumatic symptoms,\u201d says Stubley. She explains that there is an accepted timeline for the&nbsp;treatment of post-traumatic stress. \u201cTime zero is the moment the trauma itself ends. In the first months or so afterwards, around 90% of those who experienced trauma will have PTS symptoms including feeling edgy or constantly on guard, sleeplessness, irritability and acute anxiousness. The Nice [National Institute for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">Health</a>&nbsp;and Care Excellence] guidelines state that we should not treat people in that first month as these symptoms can often pass.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f611ba1ff8dc340d8e21e94606dfb86a9129b8a1/0_174_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Radiologists with a patient at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital in east Lancashire. \u2018Nurses and doctors will suddenly be thinking: \u2018My God!

The third stage, PTSD, which will affect around 10% of those who have experienced a traumatic event, is a kind of prolonged shutdown. \u201cPeople&nbsp;dissociate from their feelings, go numb,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cIt can last for years and years.\u201d</p> <p>Her main concern, though, is for those already in the mental health system, for whom lockdown has already had a major impact. It is an anxiety shared by many therapists, who have been unable to see their patients face to face throughout the lockdown period, instead hosting online sessions.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1373921e9634bcb31f010605820acb262eda9f/0_0_3142_4028/780.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by Jacob Stead of a coronavirus wrecking ball\" width=\"780\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by Jacob Stead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFor those with a history of trauma,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cit has been a particularly difficult time, not just because of the loneliness and isolation, but because it may also have re-stimulated past traumas. There is so much about the pandemic that is disturbing and distressing on so many levels.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Surgeons recently carried out research into the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare workers, gathering personal testimonies from nurses and doctors on the frontline. Many reported experiencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, depression as well as panic attacks and bouts of guilt about the amount of people who have died. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this...\u201d said one. \u201cI really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d said another.&nbsp;</p> <p>Writing in the <em>Guardian</em>, lead researcher and NHS doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/28/coronavirus-mental-health-storm-nhs-workers\">Ankur Khajuria</a> noted that even before the pandemic around 50% of doctors and 40% of nurses were suffering from stress-related psychiatric illness. \u201cA perfect storm is gathering,\u201d he warned.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lucy Warner is chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, a confidential service that treats doctors with mental health issues. They expect to treat around 3,500 doctors a year. When I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she said they had already treated about a third of that annual number in the preceding few weeks \u2013 \u201cmostly through online spaces where people can connect, talk to each other, share their feelings and reflect.\u201d</p> <p>In the early stage of the pandemic, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of anticipatory anxiety. It was new and people didn\u2019t really know what was happening or how long it would go on, but they knew it was frightening.\u201d As the weeks have passed in long shifts and rising numbers of the sick and the dead, that gave way to \u201ca lot of emotional fatigue, a kind of mental and physical exhaustion. It was becoming a toil, it was becoming difficult for doctors to go on while not knowing how the pandemic would play out.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the last months, that state of mental and physical fatigue has for many become the default mode. \u201cIn a way, it no longer feels like a break with the norm,\u201d says Warner, \u201cit just feels normal.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a long game. We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff</p> <footer> <cite>Lucy Warner, CEO, NHS Practitioner Health</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Stubley, Warner thinks the psychological fallout of the pandemic will be a huge and protracted challenge for an overstretched and underfunded health system.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a long game. We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff, but over the next year or more we are going to see a lot of people who thought they were OK suddenly realising that they are not. There will be some nurses and doctors suddenly thinking: \u2018My God! What did I go through?\u2019 That\u2019s when we may have to deal with a surge in PTSD symptoms, and those people will need individual support but also support on an organisational level.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>While the government and some media were quick to apply the language of wartime to the pandemic \u2013 heroic British frontline warriors battling an invisible enemy \u2013&nbsp;Jo Stubley told me of her and her colleagues\u2019 discomfort at that kind of distracting rhetoric. \u201cThe NHS is not the military,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand nurses are not soldiers.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Like several others I spoke to, Warner was also uncomfortable with what she called \u201cthe hero narrative\u201d that has taken hold of the public imagination during the long weeks of lockdown. \u201cIt is unhelpful in some ways because you don\u2019t want doctors and nurses to feel they are superheroes, who have to pat themselves on the back when they are on the line and not sleeping or even having time for a pee. What can tend to get overlooked is that they are human beings who are entitled to a rest as much as we all are. They are ordinary people doing their very best, but we need them to be well to do their jobs well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521f0dd019d70b6eb79df121b96e4960290a5608/0_0_6366_4244/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doctors hold a silent protest outside Downing Street on 28 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In response to the emergency of the last few months, several psychotherapists have set up online drop-in support groups for NHS staff, who may be feeling overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I spoke to one who, with a colleague, has created \u201ca support group for clinical staff\u201d in London. She asked for anonymity.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe first thing to stress is that it is drop-in support, not psychotherapy \u2013 the midst of a crisis is not the time to start psychotherapy for clinical staff. What they need is a safe space to come together, share their thoughts and anxieties and listen to others experiencing similar challenges. To this end, everyone uses first names only and they do not have to say where they work. They can also choose to be seen on a screen or not.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly, the take-up rate has been low and almost all those who have used the service are doctors rather than nurses. \u201cI think there are various reasons for that,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, they are in it, and when they get home, they are utterly exhausted. Also, they are perhaps not aware of what help has been made available to NHS staff, even though there is actually a lot of help out there.\u201d</p> <p>The other more positive reason is that they may already be receiving support from their fellow workers, from the strength of being part of a team that is responding well in extremely difficult circumstances. \u201cThe way the nursing profession works is that you tend to get on with it,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cYou are to a degree encouraged to feel that way, so even when the normal rules don\u2019t apply there is the sense that this is what you have been trained for. It\u2019s amazing in many ways, but it means that everybody seems to be coping on the surface, while underneath they may well be struggling.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c42b8375c853090a7e3e4273f60634fb6d232244/0_206_4687_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical staff at the Royal Blackburn teaching hospital.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the first chaotic weeks of the Covid pandemic, many nurses and doctors felt not just overwhelmed, but threatened and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/worrying-event-deaths-of-nhs-doctors-from-covid-19-stark-reminder-of-pandemic\">unsafe</a>. There were serious issues over the lack of adequate PPE,&nbsp;leading to increased anxiety about contracting the virus and passing it on to family members. Both the workplace and the home thus became places that were unsafe and uncertain.&nbsp;</p> <p>The nurse from Sierra Leone quoted at the beginning of this article recalled her feelings of being alone, at risk and anxious. \u201cInitially it was chaos \u2013 we didn\u2019t have equipment, we didn\u2019t have senior support, we were short-staffed.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For two long weeks, she and her colleagues worked in an environment she compared to a war zone, tending to patients who were \u201cvery unwell, very unstable, very sick... We didn\u2019t even have masks. We were tired, dehydrated, thirsty,\u201d she continued, still sounding traumatised. She recalled returning home each night to her daughters, thinking: \u201cWhat is happening? How far will this go?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>That anonymous nurse belongs to the BAME community who make up 20% of the NHS workforce.

More than six out of 10 victims were from BAME backgrounds. One of their number was urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">18-year-old son voiced</a> what many inside the NHS were feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see NHS workers getting the recognition they deserve,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they should not have to give their lives, they should not have to go as martyrs. They did not sign up to battle on the frontline and give up their lives.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming second pandemic of mental health issues, it may well be those we heralded as heroes who will be among the most vulnerable, alongside key workers on low incomes who also toiled through this long emergency at considerable and often unnecessary risk to their health, their lives.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf we were prepared to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/clap-for-our-carers-the-very-unbritish-ritual-that-united-the-nation\">clap for our health workers</a>, we should also be insisting that they are looked after in the wake of this emergency,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cI want to be optimistic about that, but the market economy has been a disaster for the health service and, within it, mental health has always been the poor sibling. I have spent years saying to my managers, we need more resources, too many people are waiting. If there was no room in the system before this began, what will happen when it ends and we are in the middle of another recession?\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Julia Samuel concurs: \u201cThe fear is that the system will be overwhelmed, not least because there is not the parity of resources in mental health that there is in physical health.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way.

In time to come, hard questions must surely be asked about the British death rate and the practical ways many thousands of those deaths might have been prevented. For now, it is the hardest aspect of the pandemic to grasp, much less make sense of. Only months ago, it would have seemed like the stuff of dark imaginings: gothic fiction or apocalyptic sci-fi.

Relatives have not been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/may/05/dying-surrounded-by-family-a-fundamental-right-says-uk-judge\">visit their loved ones in their final days</a> or to be present when they breathed their last.

We don\u2019t live with death, as it were. Instead, we live to a great degree in denial of it, particularly our own death. And suddenly, we are witnessing death on a grand scale. It has in effect cut through our belief systems, our expectations of what life is.\u201d</p> <p>As someone who specialises in grief, what does Julia Samuel think will be the lasting collective impact of so many deaths, but also of our prolonged proximity to the threat of death?</p> <p>\u201cThe impact will by no means be the same for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cFor an older person to lose a long-term partner so suddenly and unexpectedly is a different experience to a family who have lost someone young who was expected to survive. Both traumas will leave a deep and lasting imprint on their family members.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Samuel points out that guilt is often a component of grief, and may be exacerbated by the ways in which people have died during the pandemic. \u201cTo be the only family member permitted to be present in an ICU is heartbreaking of itself, but then to have to be in full PPE, while your loved one is on a ventilator surrounded by medical staff who also look like astronauts. It is as good as it can be, but it is not the death that anyone would wish for.\u201d</p> <p>I ask Julia Samuel&nbsp;if there is any way to accurately predict what the long-term fallout of the pandemic will be\u2026</p> <p>\u201cAs humans, we are born to adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while we are still in it and so much is still uncertain, I don\u2019t think we have a clue what the long-term consequences will be.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2a080c6ffeeaf817dc0dd88aaaf11df66121fb7/186_396_5122_3073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burial plot\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A fresh burial plot in Oxfordshire.

      "bodyText": "On Instagram, a friend posts a photograph of a male nurse in an intensive care ward of an American hospital. He is wearing full protective clothing and holding up a patient questionnaire on which he has scrawled a message for his colleagues. It reads: \u201cJust going to hold his hand for a while, I don\u2019t think he has long.\u201d On an Irish radio station, a woman reads a poem she has written for a loved one lost to the virus. It is called My Sister Is Not a Statistic. It begins: Tomorrow, when the latest Deathometer of Covid is announced in sonorous tones, Whilst all the bodies still mount and curl towards the middle of the curve Heaped one atop and alongside the other My sister will be among those numbers... On Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, a critical care nurse from Sierra Leone, who works in a hospital in the south of England, describes the frantic chaos of the first few weeks of the pandemic. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have equipment at all, but our ordinary aprons and gloves\u2026 I\u2019d go in there praying and hoping I don\u2019t get infected. Then I\u2019d go home, praying and hoping, and trying to isolate myself from my daughters so I am not passing it on to them.\u201d Amid the prolonged stasis imposed by lockdown, as the days drift into one another, the unreal magnitude of what is unfolding is momentarily undercut by acutely personal testimonies from the eye of the storm. These are just three examples of ordinary people who have responded in extraordinary ways. Their actions speak of selflessness, defiance and bravery in the face of the invisible threat that hovers around us in the very air that we breathe. But they also provide us with glimpses of the immense human cost of the pandemic, the great well of loss, fear, sadness and grief beneath the mounting statistics. In Britain, as I write, 37,000 people have lost their lives to the Covid-19 virus, while 267,000 have experienced and survived the terrible uncertainty of infection. As a fragile normality slowly returns, many mental health experts are asking the inevitable questions: what will be the long-term emotional and psychological cost of such a sudden and seismic disruption of our way of life? \u201cHow the outside impacts on the inside is something that people like me think about all the time,\u201d says psychotherapist and author Susie Orbach. \u201cBut now we are seeing it on a grand scale. The pandemic has been a prolonged assault from outside on our community. The state of uncertainty and unsafety it has created is new and utterly unfamiliar. Unless you are a refugee who has risked their life to get here, or a survivor of childhood abuse that could not be escaped, there is simply nothing to compare it to.\u201d Even in the early stages of the lockdown, the World Health Organization issued a statement that noted \u201celevated rates of stress or anxiety\u201d in the general population, before warning that, \u201cas new measures and impacts are introduced \u2013 especially quarantine and its effects on many people\u2019s usual activities, routines or livelihoods \u2013 levels of loneliness, depression, harmful alcohol and drug use, and self-harm or suicidal behaviour are also expected to rise.\u201d On 21 April , it was announced that 42 researchers from around the world had formed the International Covid-19 Suicide Prevention Research Collaboration amid growing concern about the longer-term mental health consequences of the virus. Leaving aside the probability of another spike, the aftershock of the pandemic is likely to last a long time and leave yet more casualties in its wake. Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical psychoanalyst at the Tavistock and Portman clinic in London, is a specialist in trauma who has worked with survivors of the London terrorist attacks and the Grenfell Tower disaster. Those kinds of emergencies, she explains, are classed as \u201csingle events that occur within a limited time-frame and affect a defined population\u201d. A global pandemic does not fit that model. \u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d she says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that mental health services have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d It is in the coming months and even years, then, that the psychological effects of the pandemic will become most apparent. \u201cTrauma occurs when you are overwhelmed by an event that you cannot process,\u201d says Julia Samuel, grief counsellor and bestselling author, whose latest book is titled Grief Works: Stories of Life, Death and Surviving. \u201cWhile the crisis is happening, you are in it and everything is uncertain and unpredictable. You don\u2019t have the emotional freedom to allow yourself to process the trauma, so it is held in the body. The most common reaction is to shut down and just exist somehow. It is only when the external world becomes more safe and predictable again that people may feel able to reach out for support.\u201d Those most at risk of suffering post-traumatic stress are the frontline medical staff who, in the first chaotic weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic, may have felt overwhelmed by the dramatically increased levels of patient suffering and deaths, as well as at risk from infection from inadequate PPE and anxious about bringing the virus home with them. Studies have also shown that, in ordinary times, patients who have spent time in intensive care are at a 20% increased risk of developing PTSD. \u201cAlready with some of the support initiatives that have been put in place, we are seeing survivors of Covid-19 showing post-traumatic symptoms,\u201d says Stubley. She explains that there is an accepted timeline for the treatment of post-traumatic stress. \u201cTime zero is the moment the trauma itself ends. In the first months or so afterwards, around 90% of those who experienced trauma will have PTS symptoms including feeling edgy or constantly on guard, sleeplessness, irritability and acute anxiousness. The Nice [National Institute for Health and Care Excellence] guidelines state that we should not treat people in that first month as these symptoms can often pass.\u201d The second stage is altogether more serious: flashbacks, nightmares, intrusive thoughts or images that are triggered by anything that reminds you of the trauma. The third stage, PTSD, which will affect around 10% of those who have experienced a traumatic event, is a kind of prolonged shutdown. \u201cPeople dissociate from their feelings, go numb,\u201d says Stubley. \u201cIt can last for years and years.\u201d Her main concern, though, is for those already in the mental health system, for whom lockdown has already had a major impact. It is an anxiety shared by many therapists, who have been unable to see their patients face to face throughout the lockdown period, instead hosting online sessions. \u201cFor those with a history of trauma,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cit has been a particularly difficult time, not just because of the loneliness and isolation, but because it may also have re-stimulated past traumas. There is so much about the pandemic that is disturbing and distressing on so many levels.\u201d The Royal College of Surgeons recently carried out research into the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on healthcare workers, gathering personal testimonies from nurses and doctors on the frontline. Many reported experiencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, depression as well as panic attacks and bouts of guilt about the amount of people who have died. \u201cI can\u2019t see how I can keep doing this...\u201d said one. \u201cI really wish I wasn\u2019t a doctor,\u201d said another. Writing in the Guardian, lead researcher and NHS doctor Ankur Khajuria noted that even before the pandemic around 50% of doctors and 40% of nurses were suffering from stress-related psychiatric illness. \u201cA perfect storm is gathering,\u201d he warned. Lucy Warner is chief executive of NHS Practitioner Health, a confidential service that treats doctors with mental health issues. They expect to treat around 3,500 doctors a year. When I spoke to her a few weeks ago, she said they had already treated about a third of that annual number in the preceding few weeks \u2013 \u201cmostly through online spaces where people can connect, talk to each other, share their feelings and reflect.\u201d In the early stage of the pandemic, she says, \u201cthere was a lot of anticipatory anxiety. It was new and people didn\u2019t really know what was happening or how long it would go on, but they knew it was frightening.\u201d As the weeks have passed in long shifts and rising numbers of the sick and the dead, that gave way to \u201ca lot of emotional fatigue, a kind of mental and physical exhaustion. It was becoming a toil, it was becoming difficult for doctors to go on while not knowing how the pandemic would play out.\u201d Over the last months, that state of mental and physical fatigue has for many become the default mode. \u201cIn a way, it no longer feels like a break with the norm,\u201d says Warner, \u201cit just feels normal.\u201d Like Stubley, Warner thinks the psychological fallout of the pandemic will be a huge and protracted challenge for an overstretched and underfunded health system. \u201cThis is a long game. We are seeing the beginnings of a surge in mental health issues among frontline staff, but over the next year or more we are going to see a lot of people who thought they were OK suddenly realising that they are not. There will be some nurses and doctors suddenly thinking: \u2018My God! What did I go through?\u2019 That\u2019s when we may have to deal with a surge in PTSD symptoms, and those people will need individual support but also support on an organisational level.\u201d While the government and some media were quick to apply the language of wartime to the pandemic \u2013 heroic British frontline warriors battling an invisible enemy \u2013 Jo Stubley told me of her and her colleagues\u2019 discomfort at that kind of distracting rhetoric. \u201cThe NHS is not the military,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cand nurses are not soldiers.\u201d Like several others I spoke to, Warner was also uncomfortable with what she called \u201cthe hero narrative\u201d that has taken hold of the public imagination during the long weeks of lockdown. \u201cIt is unhelpful in some ways because you don\u2019t want doctors and nurses to feel they are superheroes, who have to pat themselves on the back when they are on the line and not sleeping or even having time for a pee. What can tend to get overlooked is that they are human beings who are entitled to a rest as much as we all are. They are ordinary people doing their very best, but we need them to be well to do their jobs well.\u201d In response to the emergency of the last few months, several psychotherapists have set up online drop-in support groups for NHS staff, who may be feeling overwhelmed or emotionally exhausted. I spoke to one who, with a colleague, has created \u201ca support group for clinical staff\u201d in London. She asked for anonymity. \u201cThe first thing to stress is that it is drop-in support, not psychotherapy \u2013 the midst of a crisis is not the time to start psychotherapy for clinical staff. What they need is a safe space to come together, share their thoughts and anxieties and listen to others experiencing similar challenges. To this end, everyone uses first names only and they do not have to say where they work. They can also choose to be seen on a screen or not.\u201d Perhaps surprisingly, the take-up rate has been low and almost all those who have used the service are doctors rather than nurses. \u201cI think there are various reasons for that,\u201d she says. \u201cFirst, they are in it, and when they get home, they are utterly exhausted. Also, they are perhaps not aware of what help has been made available to NHS staff, even though there is actually a lot of help out there.\u201d The other more positive reason is that they may already be receiving support from their fellow workers, from the strength of being part of a team that is responding well in extremely difficult circumstances. \u201cThe way the nursing profession works is that you tend to get on with it,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cYou are to a degree encouraged to feel that way, so even when the normal rules don\u2019t apply there is the sense that this is what you have been trained for. It\u2019s amazing in many ways, but it means that everybody seems to be coping on the surface, while underneath they may well be struggling.\u201d In the first chaotic weeks of the Covid pandemic, many nurses and doctors felt not just overwhelmed, but threatened and unsafe. There were serious issues over the lack of adequate PPE, leading to increased anxiety about contracting the virus and passing it on to family members. Both the workplace and the home thus became places that were unsafe and uncertain. The nurse from Sierra Leone quoted at the beginning of this article recalled her feelings of being alone, at risk and anxious. \u201cInitially it was chaos \u2013 we didn\u2019t have equipment, we didn\u2019t have senior support, we were short-staffed.\u201d For two long weeks, she and her colleagues worked in an environment she compared to a war zone, tending to patients who were \u201cvery unwell, very unstable, very sick... We didn\u2019t even have masks. We were tired, dehydrated, thirsty,\u201d she continued, still sounding traumatised. She recalled returning home each night to her daughters, thinking: \u201cWhat is happening? How far will this go?\u201d That anonymous nurse belongs to the BAME community who make up 20% of the NHS workforce. On 25 May, the Guardian reported that 200 healthcare workers had died from Covid-19. More than six out of 10 victims were from BAME backgrounds. One of their number was urologist Abdul Mabud Chowdhury, whose 18-year-old son voiced what many inside the NHS were feeling. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see NHS workers getting the recognition they deserve,\u201d he said, \u201cbut they should not have to give their lives, they should not have to go as martyrs. They did not sign up to battle on the frontline and give up their lives.\u201d In the coming second pandemic of mental health issues, it may well be those we heralded as heroes who will be among the most vulnerable, alongside key workers on low incomes who also toiled through this long emergency at considerable and often unnecessary risk to their health, their lives. \u201cIf we were prepared to clap for our health workers, we should also be insisting that they are looked after in the wake of this emergency,\u201d says Jo Stubley. \u201cI want to be optimistic about that, but the market economy has been a disaster for the health service and, within it, mental health has always been the poor sibling. I have spent years saying to my managers, we need more resources, too many people are waiting. If there was no room in the system before this began, what will happen when it ends and we are in the middle of another recession?\u201d Julia Samuel concurs: \u201cThe fear is that the system will be overwhelmed, not least because there is not the parity of resources in mental health that there is in physical health.\u201d When this is over, how will we acknowledge the haunting presence of the dead, the thousands of lives lost unexpectedly and in often extremely upsetting circumstances for loved ones? In time to come, hard questions must surely be asked about the British death rate and the practical ways many thousands of those deaths might have been prevented. For now, it is the hardest aspect of the pandemic to grasp, much less make sense of. Only months ago, it would have seemed like the stuff of dark imaginings: gothic fiction or apocalyptic sci-fi. How swiftly it has become real; all too real. On Sunday 24 May, The New York Times filled its entire front page with death notices from across America, a bold statement that nevertheless only hinted at the immensity of the human toll: 1,000 victims symbolising around 100,000. Outside of wartime or other historical pandemics like the Spanish flu in 1918, there is no precedent for the number of lives lost within a relatively short period. The global virus has, in the most insidious and cruelly indiscriminate way, turned our world upside down, denting our faith in the infallibility of science and medicine, global capitalism and in progress itself. It has made us fretful for our lives and the lives of those around us, while simultaneously robbing us even of our traditional way of death. Relatives have not been allowed to visit their loved ones in their final days or to be present when they breathed their last. Some have been forced to keep a vigil on their computer screens via live feeds from a Covid ward. Funerals have been limited to small groups of people, all keeping the requisite two metres from one another. If distance and isolation have become the new touchstones of daily life, they have also intruded even on people\u2019s heartbreak and their grieving. \u201cThe thing that makes grief tolerable for many people is the love and affection of others,\u201d says Samuel, \u201cWe need to be held when we feel broken.\u201d In her heartbreaking poem, My Sister Is Not a Statistic, Dorothy Duffy remembered her sister, Rose, who died without the soft touch of a loved one\u2019s hand. Without a feathered kiss upon her forehead. Without the muted murmur of familiar family voices gathered around her bed... In composing that sad, defiant elegy, Duffy found a way to express her tumult of emotions in the face of the virus\u2019s assault on our collective sensibilities. In this, though, she was undoubtedly the exception. Countless others have not found a way to articulate their sorrow, their isolation and their disorientation. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect to lose someone in this way,\u201d says Orbach, \u201cto not be able to say goodbye and then to be forced to grieve alone.\u201d For Orbach, the pandemic has also brutally exposed our culture\u2019s collective denial of the final inevitable. \u201cThe rituals are there to help us get through it,\u201d she elaborates, \u201cbut also because death is such a problematic idea in our culture, an almost impossible idea. We don\u2019t live with death, as it were. Instead, we live to a great degree in denial of it, particularly our own death. And suddenly, we are witnessing death on a grand scale. It has in effect cut through our belief systems, our expectations of what life is.\u201d As someone who specialises in grief, what does Julia Samuel think will be the lasting collective impact of so many deaths, but also of our prolonged proximity to the threat of death? \u201cThe impact will by no means be the same for everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cFor an older person to lose a long-term partner so suddenly and unexpectedly is a different experience to a family who have lost someone young who was expected to survive. Both traumas will leave a deep and lasting imprint on their family members.\u201d Samuel points out that guilt is often a component of grief, and may be exacerbated by the ways in which people have died during the pandemic. \u201cTo be the only family member permitted to be present in an ICU is heartbreaking of itself, but then to have to be in full PPE, while your loved one is on a ventilator surrounded by medical staff who also look like astronauts. It is as good as it can be, but it is not the death that anyone would wish for.\u201d I ask Julia Samuel if there is any way to accurately predict what the long-term fallout of the pandemic will be\u2026 \u201cAs humans, we are born to adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cBut while we are still in it and so much is still uncertain, I don\u2019t think we have a clue what the long-term consequences will be.\u201d When pressed, she mentions one of the possible beneficial effects of our time in lockdown. \u201cOne thing I sense is that many people are questioning how they lived before. The badge of busyness, for instance, has to a degree lost its lustre. Being busy was somehow being important, but maybe people have realised that busyness is essentially an anaesthetic to feeling.\u201d I ask Susie Orbach the same question. She, too, attests to the power of not being frantic. \u201cThe lockdown certainly changed our relationship to time. In the beginning, there was a kind of panic about time running though our hands \u2013 it was two o\u2019clock and suddenly it\u2019s five o\u2019clock. How did that happen? I think not being frantic was a challenge for some people, but for others, the not-doing and simply being became almost mindful. To just be is actually quite liberating.\u201d Will these small epiphanies be enough for the reorientation of our social and political values that some have suggested will be the necessary outcome of this global emergency? Writer and activist Arundhati Roy has described the pandemic as \u201ca portal, a gateway between one world and the next\u201d. We can, she suggested, \u201cchoose to walk through it, dragging the carcasses of our prejudice and hatred, our avarice, our data banks and dead ideas, our dead rivers and smoky skies behind us. Or we can walk through lightly, with little luggage, ready to imagine another world. And ready to fight for it.\u201d Orbach cautiously agrees. \u201cPart of me thinks that this is somehow a moment of possibility. Many of us who believe we need to work together to democratise our institutions saw that actually happen when the doctors and nurses took control on the ground, while management did not have a clue.\u201d She pauses for a moment, gathering her thoughts. \u201cIn terms of our political culture, we entered the pandemic with a government born of fright. Brexit was essentially an act of fright, and the climate of fear that was created left so many people feeling marginalised in this swashbuckling, Darwinian, self, self, self culture. And yet, against all that, when the pandemic happened and real fear spread among us, people wanted to make a contribution, they wanted to be decent.\u201d The experts agree that the psychological fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for some time to come and that, as ever, the most vulnerable, no matter their recent sacrifices, will be most at risk. In the new normal, will we find ways to be fairer, kinder, more decent when this is all over, if it can ever be said to be truly over? Or will today\u2019s \u201cheroes\u201d become tomorrow\u2019s overlooked victims like the traumatised veterans of so many wars we willed ourselves so quickly to forget? Will we hold our political leaders to account when the coming economic crisis inevitably takes precedence over the psychological one and already limited resources are channeled away from a beleaguered NHS that nevertheless saved us from an even deeper, darker abyss? Or will we simply get on with it as before, finding ways to forget that, for a long, uncertain time, when time itself seemed out of joint, we lived amid the mounting dead in a world turned upside down. Ultimately, how we respond to this looming second pandemic may be the measure of how much the first one really taught us about ourselves and the kind of world we want to live in. \u2022 In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Airlines and car manufacturers are among the major beneficiaries.</p> <p>That list was disclosed amid revelations that the government has been pondering car industry demands for a \u201cmarket stimulus\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/uk-car-industry-pushes-for-scrappage-scheme-to-help-buy-new-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\" title=\"\">scrappage scheme</a>, that would not discriminate between diesel and electric vehicles.</p> <p>With the chill winds of an economic reckoning ahead, once the lockdown spring and summer is over, it could be tempting to simply boost demand and preserve any and all jobs. Right now, simply to restore a functioning economy and society might appear a sufficiently worthwhile and ambitious target for government. But the hard truth is that when the pandemic is over, the climate emergency will loom ever closer and larger \u2013 as even Boris Johnson acknowledged on Friday\u2019s World Environment Day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1268843310162022402\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s tweets</a> had the scent of a Green New Deal, talking of a recovery that would help shape more resilient, relevant industries for the future. The world economy has now seen how its foundations can be rocked by a natural disaster \u2013 and, sooner or later, there will be another one. But few will now have faith that the government\u2019s actions will match its environmental rhetoric.</p> <p>So far, the only condition imposed on emergency funding appears to be demanding fare rises on Transport for London\u2019s public services. It would be perverse indeed now to refrain from the tough love of attaching environmental conditions to private firms. Any scrappage scheme that simply allowed the UK taxpayer to subsidise the purchase of more fossil-fuel cars, and did not attempt to significantly alter emissions and infrastructure, would be an appalling missed opportunity.</p>",

This crisis must not become a reason to postpone climate action For those hoping the coronavirus crisis might be the moment to steer Britain towards a greener, cleaner future, the publication of the list of companies who have benefited from the Bank of England\u2019s cheap Covid-19 loans will have made depressing reading. Airlines and car manufacturers are among the major beneficiaries. That list was disclosed amid revelations that the government has been pondering car industry demands for a \u201cmarket stimulus\u201d, or scrappage scheme, that would not discriminate between diesel and electric vehicles. With the chill winds of an economic reckoning ahead, once the lockdown spring and summer is over, it could be tempting to simply boost demand and preserve any and all jobs. Right now, simply to restore a functioning economy and society might appear a sufficiently worthwhile and ambitious target for government. But the hard truth is that when the pandemic is over, the climate emergency will loom ever closer and larger \u2013 as even Boris Johnson acknowledged on Friday\u2019s World Environment Day. The prime minister\u2019s tweets had the scent of a Green New Deal, talking of a recovery that would help shape more resilient, relevant industries for the future. The world economy has now seen how its foundations can be rocked by a natural disaster \u2013 and, sooner or later, there will be another one. But few will now have faith that the government\u2019s actions will match its environmental rhetoric. So far, the only condition imposed on emergency funding appears to be demanding fare rises on Transport for London\u2019s public services. It would be perverse indeed now to refrain from the tough love of attaching environmental conditions to private firms. Any scrappage scheme that simply allowed the UK taxpayer to subsidise the purchase of more fossil-fuel cars, and did not attempt to significantly alter emissions and infrastructure, would be an appalling missed opportunity.",

You might be having to test once a week in care homes.\u201d Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said that while there was an issue around the transfer of some patients over a small number of days in March, there was no mass movement of patients into care homes without tests and that hospitals worked closely with homes. \u201cThey were trying to balance two priorities - how on the one hand do we get patients discharged [to create capacity for possible Covid-19 patients], but also, how do we protect the care sector?\u201d Layla Moran, the Lib Dem MP, warned: \u201cVulnerable care home residents and workers were effectively abandoned without adequate access to testing or PPE. This has become the biggest scandal of the whole pandemic. Those responsible will need to be held to account in an inquiry once the crisis is over.\u201d",

However, by doing that, the criticism we\u2019re open to is: you\u2019ve disadvantaged the advantaged kids.\u201d</p> <p>He has not received any of the devices he has requested, just emails from the Department for Education saying: you\u2019ll be contacted about how to order them. \u201cMy direct network would be about 50 heads from all over the country. None of them have heard anything different to that.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>A further six headteachers told the <em>Observer</em> they had not yet received any devices. Steve Howell, headteacher at the City of Birmingham School, is one of them. \u201cMore than three-quarters of our year 10 pupils do not have access, regularly and consistently, to a device or the internet at home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a big announcement was made about this before there was a practical mechanism for rollout. The most disadvantaged pupils are hardest hit with IT poverty, and the fact this has taken so long is really making things worse.\u201d </p> <p>The government\u2019s failure to deliver is effectively putting children without any tech under pressure to take greater health risks and return to school earlier than their peers, warned Jolyon Maugham, a barrister and founder of the <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/\">Good Law Project</a>.&nbsp;\u201cPoorer families are overwhelmingly the victims of the pandemic. It\u2019s extraordinary to me that the government should make matters worse by denying those families a choice the middle class have, to educate their children at home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1f29d49ab7fe4bb865fdd0daf9c522296f7707c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1f29d49ab7fe4bb865fdd0daf9c522296f7707c/0_2_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Williamson announced that the government would be given free laptops and tablets during a coronavirus briefing on 19 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gavin Williamson announced that the government would be given free laptops and tablets during a coronavirus briefing on 19 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/Crown Copyright/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are already signs that the partial return of schools will exacerbate the attainment gap between rich and poor, as new data obtained by the <em>Observer </em>shows greater numbers of primary school pupils returned to the classroom last week in affluent areas than in poorer neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Teachers at different schools were asked to identify whether less than a fifth of eligible pupils had returned to classrooms last week.

It\u2019s actually quite dramatic. We know that the home environment is unequal, but we also now know that who is coming to school is unequal.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said Williamson had promised to deliver the devices at the end of May and throughout June, and its \u00a3100m programme to support pupils with remote education was \u201con track\u201d. \u201cThe Department is prioritising the delivery of devices to the most vulnerable children first \u2013 children with a social worker and care leavers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do whatever we can to make sure no child, whatever their background, falls behind as a result of coronavirus. \u201d</p> <h2><em><strong>James Johnson, a year 1 teacher in Kent shares his diary from the first week back at school with nine of his usual class of 30</strong></em></h2> <h2> <br></h2> <h2>Monday</h2> <p>Before the children arrive, I feel anxious about the day ahead. I wonder how the gap in their education is going to present itself and what has happened to them over the past 10 weeks. But my biggest anxiety is: is this going to work? Are we going to be able to keep everybody safe? Will all the children manage to stay in one \u201cbubble\u201d throughout the week?</p> <p>At the same time, I\u2019m feeling very, very excited. I always form such a strong connection to the children I teach and the thought that keeps going through my mind is: I\u2019m going to see some of them again. And the moment that I do, I feel overwhelmed with emotion. It was such a beautiful sunny day, and when each child came round the corner and we saw each other\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Those were moments of complete and utter joy.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I feel much less anxious today. The steps my leadership team has put in place have been very successful. The children may be only five or six years old, but they have learned to line up two metres apart, put hand gel on when they arrive and sit at individual desks spread out around the room. Normally, I teach the children through play, we don\u2019t have formal desks at all. But they are now taking pride in their desks and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep it tidy\u201d.</p> <p>Throughout the week, the children seem fully aware of the virus and what\u2019s been happening. Today, when we speak about the continent of Asia, straightaway one of the children says: \u201cThat\u2019s where the coronavirus comes from.\u201d My teaching assistant and I look at each other. Asia has such a rich culture and history. For a child to immediately think of that\u2026 This is how the real world is imprinting itself on our young children.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>The children are learning about Saint George, so I get them to describe and draw their own dragons.</p> <p>Normally, I teach a mixed class of 30 Year 1 and Year 2 pupils, but only nine of them have come into school this week. We are all in one <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">\u201cbubble\u201d</a> together. My teaching assistant supervises them when I have my lunch or a break, and vice versa, so no other adult ever enters our bubble.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to keep your distance from a small child \u2013 sometimes they just want to come up to you and hold your hand. My biggest concern is to keep the children\u2019s anxieties to a minimum. That comes first, for me, so I am prepared to let them get a bit close.</p> <p>After a socially distanced ice-cream on the school playing field with other staff members, I hear on the news the death toll is rising again. My mother calls me to say she wouldn\u2019t have sent her child back to school this week \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have a choice. I find myself hoping, beyond anything, that going back was the right decision.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>We play socially distanced golf this morning. It\u2019s not a sport I\u2019ve taught before, it\u2019s not on our normal curriculum but it was fantastic. When the children\u2019s balls land in the \u201cpond\u201d I have created from a big water tray, they have to whack them out of the water \u2013 and they can\u2019t stop laughing.</p> <p>I can tell one little boy is missing his best friend though. Usually, they\u2019re inseparable \u2013 but his friend isn\u2019t coming in, so he seems a bit lost. I try my best to help. I miss the other children in the class, too.</p> <p>From the news that evening, I learn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\">face masks will soon be compulsory on public transport</a>. Yet the government is happy for teachers to be confined in classrooms with up to 15 children all day long. That was interesting.</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>Today the children re-enact the Roman invasion of the hometown of Boudica, the warrior queen. Normally, we dedicate a whole term to a single topic or theme, but this week I\u2019ve been trying to spark their curiosity about learning again. There are no end of year assessments, like there usually are, so I can use this time to really explore and fill the different gaps in their knowledge.</p> <p>It takes a lot of energy to teach young children and when I leave, I am tired. I want to collapse on the sofa. But I have been back in the classroom, where I should be, seeing children smile again and having an impact on their learning. And that has felt incredible.</p>",

Steve Howell, headteacher at the City of Birmingham School, is one of them. \u201cMore than three-quarters of our year 10 pupils do not have access, regularly and consistently, to a device or the internet at home,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a big announcement was made about this before there was a practical mechanism for rollout. The most disadvantaged pupils are hardest hit with IT poverty, and the fact this has taken so long is really making things worse.\u201d The government\u2019s failure to deliver is effectively putting children without any tech under pressure to take greater health risks and return to school earlier than their peers, warned Jolyon Maugham, a barrister and founder of the Good Law Project. \u201cPoorer families are overwhelmingly the victims of the pandemic. It\u2019s extraordinary to me that the government should make matters worse by denying those families a choice the middle class have, to educate their children at home.\u201d There are already signs that the partial return of schools will exacerbate the attainment gap between rich and poor, as new data obtained by the Observer shows greater numbers of primary school pupils returned to the classroom last week in affluent areas than in poorer neighbourhoods. Teachers at different schools were asked to identify whether less than a fifth of eligible pupils had returned to classrooms last week. That was true of 24% of the poorest schools but only 10% of the richest. Laura McInerny, the co-founder of TeacherTapp, which conducted the survey of just under 2,000 teachers, said: \u201cThe data is showing us that far fewer pupils are attending in the poorest areas. It\u2019s actually quite dramatic. We know that the home environment is unequal, but we also now know that who is coming to school is unequal.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department for Education said Williamson had promised to deliver the devices at the end of May and throughout June, and its \u00a3100m programme to support pupils with remote education was \u201con track\u201d. \u201cThe Department is prioritising the delivery of devices to the most vulnerable children first \u2013 children with a social worker and care leavers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do whatever we can to make sure no child, whatever their background, falls behind as a result of coronavirus. \u201d James Johnson, a year 1 teacher in Kent shares his diary from the first week back at school with nine of his usual class of 30 Monday Before the children arrive, I feel anxious about the day ahead. I wonder how the gap in their education is going to present itself and what has happened to them over the past 10 weeks. But my biggest anxiety is: is this going to work? Are we going to be able to keep everybody safe? Will all the children manage to stay in one \u201cbubble\u201d throughout the week? At the same time, I\u2019m feeling very, very excited. I always form such a strong connection to the children I teach and the thought that keeps going through my mind is: I\u2019m going to see some of them again. And the moment that I do, I feel overwhelmed with emotion. It was such a beautiful sunny day, and when each child came round the corner and we saw each other\u2026 I just couldn\u2019t stop smiling. Those were moments of complete and utter joy. Tuesday I feel much less anxious today. The steps my leadership team has put in place have been very successful. The children may be only five or six years old, but they have learned to line up two metres apart, put hand gel on when they arrive and sit at individual desks spread out around the room. Normally, I teach the children through play, we don\u2019t have formal desks at all. But they are now taking pride in their desks and saying \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep it tidy\u201d. Throughout the week, the children seem fully aware of the virus and what\u2019s been happening. Today, when we speak about the continent of Asia, straightaway one of the children says: \u201cThat\u2019s where the coronavirus comes from.\u201d My teaching assistant and I look at each other. Asia has such a rich culture and history. For a child to immediately think of that\u2026 This is how the real world is imprinting itself on our young children. Wednesday The children are learning about Saint George, so I get them to describe and draw their own dragons. Normally, I teach a mixed class of 30 Year 1 and Year 2 pupils, but only nine of them have come into school this week. We are all in one \u201cbubble\u201d together. My teaching assistant supervises them when I have my lunch or a break, and vice versa, so no other adult ever enters our bubble. It\u2019s hard to keep your distance from a small child \u2013 sometimes they just want to come up to you and hold your hand. My biggest concern is to keep the children\u2019s anxieties to a minimum. That comes first, for me, so I am prepared to let them get a bit close. After a socially distanced ice-cream on the school playing field with other staff members, I hear on the news the death toll is rising again. My mother calls me to say she wouldn\u2019t have sent her child back to school this week \u2013 but she didn\u2019t have a choice. I find myself hoping, beyond anything, that going back was the right decision. Thursday We play socially distanced golf this morning. It\u2019s not a sport I\u2019ve taught before, it\u2019s not on our normal curriculum but it was fantastic. When the children\u2019s balls land in the \u201cpond\u201d I have created from a big water tray, they have to whack them out of the water \u2013 and they can\u2019t stop laughing. I can tell one little boy is missing his best friend though. Usually, they\u2019re inseparable \u2013 but his friend isn\u2019t coming in, so he seems a bit lost. I try my best to help. I miss the other children in the class, too. From the news that evening, I learn face masks will soon be compulsory on public transport. Yet the government is happy for teachers to be confined in classrooms with up to 15 children all day long. That was interesting. Friday Today the children re-enact the Roman invasion of the hometown of Boudica, the warrior queen. Normally, we dedicate a whole term to a single topic or theme, but this week I\u2019ve been trying to spark their curiosity about learning again. There are no end of year assessments, like there usually are, so I can use this time to really explore and fill the different gaps in their knowledge. It takes a lot of energy to teach young children and when I leave, I am tired. I want to collapse on the sofa. But I have been back in the classroom, where I should be, seeing children smile again and having an impact on their learning. And that has felt incredible.",

It is heading in the wrong direction.\u201d However, he said councils wouldn\u2019t be able to ask people in Greater Manchester, where there are over 10,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, to stay at home without a local furlough scheme to ensure families had enough to live on. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say to people in a designated area \u2018you cannot go to work\u2019. A lot of people would not be able to afford to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is just one of the implications of a local lockdown policy. We need clear answers quickly. All the government has done is throw an idea out there without the accompanying detail.\u201d Burnham added he would only consider such a measure if all else had failed and ministers demonstrated they were not trying to pass the buck. \u201cI would need to be convinced that it isn\u2019t just a lazy way for national government to dump its problems on local government, he said.\u201d The other region in England where the virus infection rate is growing is the south-west. Although it has the lowest number of cases in the country, the PHE and Cambridge University team calculated it might currently have a reproduction rate of one. North Somerset Council has experienced a recent spike in infections, following an outbreak in Weston General Hospital in Weston-super-Mare, although PHE analysis suggests this has not spread into the wider community. Hancock twice claimed on Friday that a successful local lockdown had been in place in the seaside town over \u201cthe past weeks\u201d. But Mike Bell, the council\u2019s deputy leader, said Hancock was being misleading because only the hospital was shut, with new patients sent elsewhere since the 25 May. \u201cWhat most people understand by a local or regional lockdown is that we go back to the days when we can\u2019t go out and we can\u2019t travel freely. That absolutely did not happen in Weston-super-Mare,\u201d he said. He added he did not have powers to impose a local lockdown in the town if it ever became necessary. \u201cIn terms of forcing people to stay at home, forcing businesses to close, we haven\u2019t got the powers to do that,\u201d he said. Bristol\u2019s deputy mayor, Asher Craig, said the council would be prepared to lock down the city if the threat increased substantially. Despite a rising R rate, Bristol has a lower than average number of cases, with 153 infections per 100,000 people. \u201cIf it worsened, we would have to lock down,\u201d she said. But she added that the city lacked the necessary powers and was facing a growing deficit amid falling revenues. Sunderland has the highest rate of infection in England, with 448 cases per 100,000 residents. Although the latest reproduction rate suggests the virus is starting to recede in the north-east and Yorkshire, many fear a resurgence. The council leader, Graeme Miller, said : \u201cHow can we possibly be opening society up when this this infection rate is so stubbornly high across the country?\u201d A government spokesperson said that the new test and trace service would play an important role in limiting the spread of the virus. \u201cAs always has been the case, a specialist team from the local authority or PHE manages any local outbreaks and we are making \u00a3300 million available to local authorities to develop local outbreak control plans.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2020 to clarify that it was referring to the situation in England, and that Sunderland has the highest Covid-19 infection rate in England, not in the UK.",

To date, more than six million people have been infected and an estimated 400,000 have died, a toll that will inevitably continue to rise for years to come.</p> \n<p>Our world has been transformed in the process. Lockdowns have been imposed, borders have been closed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/care-home-dead-government-systematic-ageism-uk-covid-19\">care homes</a> for the elderly have been ravaged by illness, and national economies placed under extreme strain.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"134c6037-2f86-41ab-a672-1986189fb60e\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus\">1918 influenza pandemic</a>&nbsp;that killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet we have only reached the halfway point of the disease\u2019s progress towards its first anniversary, timing that raises a host of concerns and questions about our ability to navigate our way through this pandemic. What exactly have we learned about Covid-19 over the past six months? How quickly and how well have we responded to the challenges posed by it?</p> \n<p>And, much more importantly, what questions do we most urgently need to answer over the next six months? Answers from researchers and doctors should tell us how we might survive one of the worst crises to affect humanity in modern times.</p> \n<p><strong>Were we ready?</strong></p> \n<p>One emphatic response from scientists stresses that it is now clear we were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/britain-emergency-planners-pandemic-government\">very badly prepared</a> for the arrival of Covid-19. \u201cThis disease has turned out to be much worse than any of the pandemics that we had been anticipating and making plans to counter,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt has a 1% death rate and it is highly transmissible, features that were considered to be highly unlikely for any new emerging disease we thought we might face. Such features represent the worst possible realistic scenario that we could envisage and lie at the very limit of what we thought we should expect. So the pandemic we have got now is about as bad as we thought it could ever get. It is a very sobering prospect.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was also stressed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/dont-bet-on-vaccine-to-protect-us-from-covid-19-says-world-health-expert\">David Nabarro</a>, professor of global health at Imperial College London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19. \u201cWhen we first encountered this disease, we thought it was just a respiratory illness that affected the upper part of the chest. Now it is clear that it can cause illnesses of the sinus; can affect the lining of blood vessels and can lead to blood clots developing. The disease has also been linked to extreme fatigue, kidney damage and heart attacks \u2013 and quite often&nbsp;in relatively young people. This is not a disease to be underestimated.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8569ed7f4f390fd696665c02d99d5d15205fb1/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On 13 March, huge crowds gathered at the Cheltenham Festival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacob King/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor is it likely to disappear in the near future, added Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. \u201cHaving lived with Covid-19 for six months now, the most important thing we have learned is that we are going to have to live with it for an awful lot longer. Essentially we are six months into a lifelong relationship.\u201d</p> \n<p>In such circumstances, lockdown \u2013 which Woolhouse described as \u201ca panic measure\u201d but a necessary one \u2013 is no longer sustainable and the problem we face over the coming months is to find ways to keep the disease at bay without recourse to imposing lockdown restrictions and their associated economic and emotional harm. And that will not be easy \u2013 as has been made clear from other lessons learned over the past six months, Woolhouse added.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>Disease of old age</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cThe one key feature that we have come to appreciate about Covid-19 is that it is a disease of old age,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chance that a person over 75 will die from it is actually 10,000 times greater than it is for a 15-year-old who gets infected. It is really striking.\u201d</p> \n<p>The problems concerning the disease\u2019s impact on adults start when a person reaches 50 and get exponentially greater for each additional year of age. \u201cThat means a significant proportion of our population \u2013 those over 75 \u2013 need protecting from this virus because its consequences for them are extremely serious,\u201d added Woolhouse. \u201cBut is it right to lock up grandchildren to save their grandparents? In a sense that is what we have been doing up until now.\u201d</p> \n<p>One idea would be to put extremely strict biosecurity systems around care homes to ensure the coronavirus never gets into them. Staff \u2013 from cleaners to carers \u2013 would be tested constantly for the presence of the virus. \u201cNobody would be allowed to enter without a same-day test,\u201d said Woolhouse. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d</p> \n<p>But as Woolhouse acknowledged, the vast majority of those over 75 don\u2019t live in care homes. They live in their own houses. \u201cThat means we are going to have to invent the concept of household biosecurity for these people. That is one of the most urgent tasks we now face.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Test, test, test</strong></p> \n<p>Implementing such ideas has only become feasible because <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/us-germ-warfare-lab-creates-test-for-pre-infectious-covid-19-carriers\">virus testing technology</a> has improved both in accuracy and scale over the past couple of months. And that offers other advantages and opportunities to understand other questions about Covid-19, said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cUntil now we have been relying heavily on mathematical models to try to understand how the virus is behaving and spreading through communities. However, mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them.\u201d</p> \n<p>With the development of new virus and antibody tests, there should therefore be far greater, data-based understanding of the appearance and spread of Covid-19 cases in Britain. She said: <strong>\u201c</strong>Simple details of time, place and person \u2013 we are crying out for that information in order to really understand this epidemic. We have got to be forensic in our efforts to pinpoint chains of transmission so we can stamp them out.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anne Johnson</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A major problem in trying to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/covid-19-second-wave-may-be-avoided-with-track-and-trace-says-uk-science-chief\">track and control</a> Covid-19 has arisen because infections are often being spread by symptomless carriers, Johnson added. \u201cAt first we did not realise that people could be transmitting unwittingly. That has been a key lesson of the past few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Collecting detailed epidemiological data should now be a priority for coming months, said Johnson. \u201cWhat is the age, gender, ethnicity and the postal code of people who test positive? And is that infected person a healthcare worker, or are they a relative of one, or are they living with one? Once you can establish these facts quickly, then you will make an enormous difference in closing down the disease. In effect, we are entering the realm of the bug detective.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Immunity</strong></p> \n<p>And then there is the critical issue of the kind of immunity that has been acquired by those already infected by the virus. \u201cStudies suggest antibodies are raised in patients\u2019 blood after they are infected and these could provide protection against future Covid-19 infections,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cReasonable estimates suggest protection might last for periods of between six months to a couple of years.

      "bodyText": "Covid-19 has now been afflicting humans for six months \u2013 first in China and later in other nations as the virus embarked on its global conquest. The experience has been a grim one for our species. To date, more than six million people have been infected and an estimated 400,000 have died, a toll that will inevitably continue to rise for years to come. Our world has been transformed in the process. Lockdowns have been imposed, borders have been closed, care homes for the elderly have been ravaged by illness, and national economies placed under extreme strain. Yet we have only reached the halfway point of the disease\u2019s progress towards its first anniversary, timing that raises a host of concerns and questions about our ability to navigate our way through this pandemic. What exactly have we learned about Covid-19 over the past six months? How quickly and how well have we responded to the challenges posed by it? And, much more importantly, what questions do we most urgently need to answer over the next six months? Answers from researchers and doctors should tell us how we might survive one of the worst crises to affect humanity in modern times. Were we ready? One emphatic response from scientists stresses that it is now clear we were very badly prepared for the arrival of Covid-19. \u201cThis disease has turned out to be much worse than any of the pandemics that we had been anticipating and making plans to counter,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt has a 1% death rate and it is highly transmissible, features that were considered to be highly unlikely for any new emerging disease we thought we might face. Such features represent the worst possible realistic scenario that we could envisage and lie at the very limit of what we thought we should expect. So the pandemic we have got now is about as bad as we thought it could ever get. It is a very sobering prospect.\u201d This point was also stressed by David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19. \u201cWhen we first encountered this disease, we thought it was just a respiratory illness that affected the upper part of the chest. Now it is clear that it can cause illnesses of the sinus; can affect the lining of blood vessels and can lead to blood clots developing. The disease has also been linked to extreme fatigue, kidney damage and heart attacks \u2013 and quite often in relatively young people. This is not a disease to be underestimated.\u201d Nor is it likely to disappear in the near future, added Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University. \u201cHaving lived with Covid-19 for six months now, the most important thing we have learned is that we are going to have to live with it for an awful lot longer. Essentially we are six months into a lifelong relationship.\u201d In such circumstances, lockdown \u2013 which Woolhouse described as \u201ca panic measure\u201d but a necessary one \u2013 is no longer sustainable and the problem we face over the coming months is to find ways to keep the disease at bay without recourse to imposing lockdown restrictions and their associated economic and emotional harm. And that will not be easy \u2013 as has been made clear from other lessons learned over the past six months, Woolhouse added. Disease of old age \u201cThe one key feature that we have come to appreciate about Covid-19 is that it is a disease of old age,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chance that a person over 75 will die from it is actually 10,000 times greater than it is for a 15-year-old who gets infected. It is really striking.\u201d The problems concerning the disease\u2019s impact on adults start when a person reaches 50 and get exponentially greater for each additional year of age. \u201cThat means a significant proportion of our population \u2013 those over 75 \u2013 need protecting from this virus because its consequences for them are extremely serious,\u201d added Woolhouse. \u201cBut is it right to lock up grandchildren to save their grandparents? In a sense that is what we have been doing up until now.\u201d One idea would be to put extremely strict biosecurity systems around care homes to ensure the coronavirus never gets into them. Staff \u2013 from cleaners to carers \u2013 would be tested constantly for the presence of the virus. \u201cNobody would be allowed to enter without a same-day test,\u201d said Woolhouse. \u201cIt is as simple as that.\u201d But as Woolhouse acknowledged, the vast majority of those over 75 don\u2019t live in care homes. They live in their own houses. \u201cThat means we are going to have to invent the concept of household biosecurity for these people. That is one of the most urgent tasks we now face.\u201d Test, test, test Implementing such ideas has only become feasible because virus testing technology has improved both in accuracy and scale over the past couple of months. And that offers other advantages and opportunities to understand other questions about Covid-19, said Anne Johnson, professor of epidemiology at University College London. \u201cUntil now we have been relying heavily on mathematical models to try to understand how the virus is behaving and spreading through communities. However, mathematical models are only as good as the data that underpins them.\u201d With the development of new virus and antibody tests, there should therefore be far greater, data-based understanding of the appearance and spread of Covid-19 cases in Britain. She said: \u201cSimple details of time, place and person \u2013 we are crying out for that information in order to really understand this epidemic. We have got to be forensic in our efforts to pinpoint chains of transmission so we can stamp them out.\u201d A major problem in trying to track and control Covid-19 has arisen because infections are often being spread by symptomless carriers, Johnson added. \u201cAt first we did not realise that people could be transmitting unwittingly. That has been a key lesson of the past few months.\u201d Collecting detailed epidemiological data should now be a priority for coming months, said Johnson. \u201cWhat is the age, gender, ethnicity and the postal code of people who test positive? And is that infected person a healthcare worker, or are they a relative of one, or are they living with one? Once you can establish these facts quickly, then you will make an enormous difference in closing down the disease. In effect, we are entering the realm of the bug detective.\u201d Immunity And then there is the critical issue of the kind of immunity that has been acquired by those already infected by the virus. \u201cStudies suggest antibodies are raised in patients\u2019 blood after they are infected and these could provide protection against future Covid-19 infections,\u201d said Hibberd. \u201cReasonable estimates suggest protection might last for periods of between six months to a couple of years. However, we need to find out exactly how long such protection will last because it will have an important bearing on how the disease progresses through a population.\u201d The longer that antibodies provide protection then the slower the disease will spread. As a result, scientists are asking that those individuals who were among the first to be infected have their blood sampled and their antibody levels tested. \u201cHave numbers of antibodies in their blood held steady or have they started to go down after only a few months? That is key research and it needs to be done now,\u201d said Hibberd. For those who were on the front line dealing with Covid-19 cases when significant numbers began to arrive in hospitals in April, the battle to save patients overwhelmed by critical breathing difficulties was a fraught and often bewildering business. Slowly doctors and nursing staff have improved treatments, however. \u201cWe are much better now at pinpointing those who will need intensive care and those who can be sent home,\u201d said Tom Wingfield, a clinician based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cAnd some promising techniques have emerged in the interim \u2013 such as the potential for continuous positive airway pressure machines, respirators that fit round your face, to help patients breathe. These are showing encouraging results.\u201d However, Wingfield stressed there were still many unknowns about the impact of Covid-19 on patients. \u201cFor example, it has become clear that many patients are having blood clots, and the sicker you are the more likely it is you have one. But what we don\u2019t know yet is which patients should be given blood thinners from the day they arrive to counter this clotting. Nor do we know how long we should continue that treatment. \u201cThe crucial point is that we are gathering data all the time \u2013 from blood tests, oxygen levels, respiratory rates \u2013 and hopefully that will help us to predict who is likely to have the worst reaction to the virus and who should be given the most intense treatments. In another six months, we should be much better informed.\u201d Room for optimism In the long term a vaccine may emerge as humanity\u2019s saviour. However, most scientists believe it is a relatively far-off prospect \u2013 one that is unlikely to reach us for a year or two at best. As Woolhouse put it: \u201cA vaccine is a hope, not a strategy.\u201d This point was also stressed by Nabarro: \u201cWe have got to get out of this mirage sense that all will be resolved when a vaccine appears at the end of this year to save us.

I heard that the US Open is also thinking about another of our ideas, which is on-court coaching, so that\u2019s great. My goal is to help make tennis transition to what\u2019s coming next and to be able to continue to grow rather than falling down, because no new fans come to our sport.

      "bodyText": "In the chaos of a pandemic and scenes in the United States of police brutality against protesters protesting against police brutality, clarity can arise from unexpected places. On Wednesday afternoon it came at the Delray Beach City Hall in the form of a 16-year-old tennis player. With a microphone, a mask and a bottle of water in her hand, Coco Gauff stood and let the world hear her message. Unlike the vague platitudes often offered in speech by her elders, in her two-and-a-half-minute speech Gauff did not waste a word. She projected determination, anger and solutions. She finished defiantly: \u201cBlack lives have always mattered. They mattered then, they matter now and they will matter in the future.\u201d Then she marched from the stage. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d says Patrick Mouratoglou, whose academy is affiliated with Gauff. \u201cShe\u2019s just different. It\u2019s something I have known since I met her \u2013 she came to my academy at 10. I spoke to her, I had an individual one-on-one discussion with her. I said: \u2018Guys, she\u2019s different.\u2019 \u201cWhen you meet people who are exceptional, you know it. I feel it straight away. Since that day, she\u2019s been surprising me all the time, even though I know she\u2019s so special. At 14 she was more mature than women on tour who are 25. That\u2019s incredible. She has an inner strength that is completely unusual. She has a self-confidence that serves her in her tennis, but to be able to come and make a speech at 16 the way she did? You don\u2019t see that. Again, she surprised me. I\u2019m not surprised that I am surprised, but I\u2019m surprised.\u201d As Gauff and Naomi Osaka protest in the US, tennis this summer has morphed into a complex labyrinth of non-sanctioned tournaments.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has rolled the dice. Last Monday, schools and some non-essential shops reopened. On 15 June more children will go back to class and many more shopkeepers will raise their shutters. The prime minister is gambling that easing the lockdown will not lead to another outbreak. Soon we will find out if he was right, if infections and deaths continue to fall, two weeks after the measures were lifted.&nbsp;But if he\u2019s wrong, are we ready?</p> <p>Senior clinicians, frontline NHS staff and public health experts agree that Britain needs a plan to deal with a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections. But the most senior leaders, who talk regularly to the government, are not convinced there is one.</p> <p>\u201cI think the criticism that we can\u2019t see a strategy is a legitimate criticism,\u201d said Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a criticism at all of thoughtful people trying to do their best, but it is a criticism of the political agenda.\u201d</p> <p>In England, the relentless focus by Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on meeting their self-imposed target of 100,000 then 200,000 daily tests has got in the way of practical matters, according to Marshall and some of his counterparts at the royal colleges. Developing a strategy is now a matter of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a strategy for test and trace, for PPE, for the use of technology, for maintaining Covid services and opening up non-Covid services,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cClinicians working on the ground find it tiresome and difficult to work in an environment where things are changing every day and there\u2019s no sense of direction as to where we\u2019re heading.\u201d</p> <p>The official death toll passed 40,000 last week but new infections have been dropping substantially.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has rolled the dice. Last Monday, schools and some non-essential shops reopened. On 15 June more children will go back to class and many more shopkeepers will raise their shutters. The prime minister is gambling that easing the lockdown will not lead to another outbreak. Soon we will find out if he was right, if infections and deaths continue to fall, two weeks after the measures were lifted. But if he\u2019s wrong, are we ready? Senior clinicians, frontline NHS staff and public health experts agree that Britain needs a plan to deal with a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections. But the most senior leaders, who talk regularly to the government, are not convinced there is one. \u201cI think the criticism that we can\u2019t see a strategy is a legitimate criticism,\u201d said Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a criticism at all of thoughtful people trying to do their best, but it is a criticism of the political agenda.\u201d In England, the relentless focus by Johnson and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on meeting their self-imposed target of 100,000 then 200,000 daily tests has got in the way of practical matters, according to Marshall and some of his counterparts at the royal colleges. Developing a strategy is now a matter of urgency. \u201cWe need a strategy for test and trace, for PPE, for the use of technology, for maintaining Covid services and opening up non-Covid services,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cClinicians working on the ground find it tiresome and difficult to work in an environment where things are changing every day and there\u2019s no sense of direction as to where we\u2019re heading.\u201d The official death toll passed 40,000 last week but new infections have been dropping substantially. Is the latest figure, of 1,650 positive tests released on Friday, low enough? No, according to Prof Maggie Rae, president of the Faculty of Public Health. \u201cThe number is falling, but it\u2019s still high,\u201d she said, saying the objective needs to be zero infections spread in the community. She is most concerned that the joint biosecurity centre, intended to be part of NHS test and trace and designed as an early warning system, will not be working for some time.

On the other hand, I think we absolutely don\u2019t want any more relaxation till we are confident that the test and trace system is working both at national and local level.\u201d A second wave may not arrive and some epidemiologists, such as Prof Sir Hugh Pennington, believe the Covid-19 will not come in waves as the Spanish flu did, but may be more like Sars, which disappeared after a public health campaign. Yet many believe there is a serious risk that Covid-19 will either remain endemic with local outbreaks, or come back harder as a second epidemic. Even without any escalation in cases, the NHS faces many immediate pressures, and emergency departments are starting to fill up again. \u201cI don\u2019t think the public understand that capacity in the NHS is dropping dramatically,\u201d said Dr Katherine Henderson, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and a consultant at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London.

      "body": "<h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>I get in to parliament early for a remote TV interview with Sky TV\u2019s Kay Burley. She cuts me off saying \u201cChris Bryant loves to have the last word but I\u2019m not going to let him!\u201d Afterwards Twitter points out the record of Eartha Kitt singing I\u2019m Still Here behind my left shoulder. I then battle with uncooperative IT before remotely chairing the standards committee.</p> <p>Then to the chamber. There are signs everywhere saying \u201ckeep left\u201d (insert your own joke here) and \u201ckeep moving\u201d. So the corridors of power are transitory. No huddles allowed. One of the whips quips: \u201cHow can you plot when you have to keep two metres apart?\u201d</p> <p>The big issue of the day is whether MPs should be allowed to participate remotely from in front of their bookcases. Those with shielding responsibilities understandably don\u2019t want to be excluded, but the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, winds us all up by saying we have to \u201creturn to work\u201d, as we all feel as if we\u2019ve been working 24/7 for weeks.</p> <p>We have two votes \u2013 on how to vote \u2013 which involve MPs traipsing round the bend for more than kilometre. Kevin Brennan calls it the \u201cMogg Conga\u201d but none of us will qualify for Strictly. We lose the votes, but afterwards two members of the cabinet scold me: \u201cWe hoped you\u2019d win.\u201d&nbsp;Another tells me: \u201cKeep on calling votes all the time, and they\u2019ll give in pretty quickly.\u201d Back home, I catch the appalling news from America.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>Everyone looks about a decade older than when I last saw them. Or maybe it\u2019s just their hair. Edward Timpson is sporting a bouffant in search of a medallion. Robert Courts boasts that his wife has cut his hair rather beautifully. Ed Miliband says his wife has had three goes at his, but he still looks very Desert Island. My No 4 clipper-cut doesn\u2019t seem to impress anybody.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since only 50 of us are allowed in the chamber at any one time, I sit in my office for a series of video meetings via Zoom, Teams and Skype. One is about the local after-effects of Storm Dennis. Lots of homes were flooded and parts of a coal tip slipped into the river. The council now have to find a new home for 60,000 tonnes of slag. I also catch up with local police, who tell me the Cummings saga has made enforcement of the lockdown 10 times more difficult.</p> <p>The rest of the day is taken up with trying to overturn the previous day\u2019s votes. Ten minutes after I leave the Commons I hear the government has caved in. Some MPs can now participate remotely after all.</p> <h2>Thursday&nbsp;</h2> <p>I spend most of the morning in the chamber, asking questions about support for theatres and how coronavirus has hit the poor. Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl. </p> <p>The Commons tearoom is open because it\u2019s classed as a staff canteen. It\u2019s a real luxury to eat food that I haven\u2019t cooked myself.</p> <p>I drive back to the Rhondda.&nbsp;</p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I am inundated with emails and Facebook messages. Should people be camping on the top of the Rhigos mountain? Why is there a 5-mile limit in Wales? Should people cancel their summer holiday?</p> <p>One good thing. The Welsh government is giving a \u00a3500 bonus to care workers. Initially that left out ancillary staff, but now cooks and cleaners are getting it as well, so we just have to persuade Rishi Sunak not to tax it.</p> <p>I chat to a lady who is desperate to visit her husband, who is in a local care home. My heart goes out to her.&nbsp;The weekly catch-up with the council leader focuses on reopening schools and the campaign to keep the local A&amp;E. In the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Trealaw Scouts Zoom meeting I am asked about chlorinated chicken and whether Boris Johnson needs a haircut.</p> <p>My mother-in-law Jo hasn\u2019t seen a soul since lockdown began, so she was really looking forward to popping round to sit in the garden with us.&nbsp;It rained, so we huddled under separate trees.</p>",

There are signs everywhere saying \u201ckeep left\u201d (insert your own joke here) and \u201ckeep moving\u201d. So the corridors of power are transitory. No huddles allowed. One of the whips quips: \u201cHow can you plot when you have to keep two metres apart?\u201d The big issue of the day is whether MPs should be allowed to participate remotely from in front of their bookcases. Those with shielding responsibilities understandably don\u2019t want to be excluded, but the leader of the house, Jacob Rees-Mogg, winds us all up by saying we have to \u201creturn to work\u201d, as we all feel as if we\u2019ve been working 24/7 for weeks. We have two votes \u2013 on how to vote \u2013 which involve MPs traipsing round the bend for more than kilometre. Kevin Brennan calls it the \u201cMogg Conga\u201d but none of us will qualify for Strictly. We lose the votes, but afterwards two members of the cabinet scold me: \u201cWe hoped you\u2019d win.\u201d Another tells me: \u201cKeep on calling votes all the time, and they\u2019ll give in pretty quickly.\u201d Back home, I catch the appalling news from America. Wednesday Everyone looks about a decade older than when I last saw them. Or maybe it\u2019s just their hair. Edward Timpson is sporting a bouffant in search of a medallion. Robert Courts boasts that his wife has cut his hair rather beautifully. Ed Miliband says his wife has had three goes at his, but he still looks very Desert Island. My No 4 clipper-cut doesn\u2019t seem to impress anybody. Since only 50 of us are allowed in the chamber at any one time, I sit in my office for a series of video meetings via Zoom, Teams and Skype. One is about the local after-effects of Storm Dennis. Lots of homes were flooded and parts of a coal tip slipped into the river. The council now have to find a new home for 60,000 tonnes of slag. I also catch up with local police, who tell me the Cummings saga has made enforcement of the lockdown 10 times more difficult. The rest of the day is taken up with trying to overturn the previous day\u2019s votes. Ten minutes after I leave the Commons I hear the government has caved in. Some MPs can now participate remotely after all. Thursday I spend most of the morning in the chamber, asking questions about support for theatres and how coronavirus has hit the poor. Rees-Mogg tells us no MP should be too grand to queue, which makes me wonder when he last queued at Lidl. The Commons tearoom is open because it\u2019s classed as a staff canteen. It\u2019s a real luxury to eat food that I haven\u2019t cooked myself. I drive back to the Rhondda. Friday I am inundated with emails and Facebook messages. Should people be camping on the top of the Rhigos mountain? Why is there a 5-mile limit in Wales? Should people cancel their summer holiday? One good thing. The Welsh government is giving a \u00a3500 bonus to care workers. Initially that left out ancillary staff, but now cooks and cleaners are getting it as well, so we just have to persuade Rishi Sunak not to tax it. I chat to a lady who is desperate to visit her husband, who is in a local care home. My heart goes out to her. The weekly catch-up with the council leader focuses on reopening schools and the campaign to keep the local A&amp;E. In the 1st Trealaw Scouts Zoom meeting I am asked about chlorinated chicken and whether Boris Johnson needs a haircut. My mother-in-law Jo hasn\u2019t seen a soul since lockdown began, so she was really looking forward to popping round to sit in the garden with us. It rained, so we huddled under separate trees.",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets, in big cities and small towns, from coast to coast, marking one of the the most expansive mobilizations yet in the nationwide protests against police violence and systemic racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Demonstrations, now in their second weekend, were largely peaceful \u2013 and included moments of levity and jubilance. It was a notable shift from the weekend prior, when police beat back demonstrators with force, using teargas and pepper spray to suppress the unrest. Mourners paid their respects to Floyd in North Carolina, his birthplace. Hundreds filed past his coffin, lining up outside Free Will Baptist church in Raeford in the searing heat to say a last goodbye. In Minneapolis, where Floyd was killed, marchers asked city officials to defund the police, a rallying cry at protests across America that has begun to gain concrete pledges. The city council voted on Friday to ban officers from using chokeholds and neck restraints, but Mayor Jacob Frey would not commit to defunding the police. \u201cI do not support the full abolition of the police department,\u201d Frey told protesters. They responded by booing him away, chanting \u201cGo home, Jacob, go home\u201d and \u201cshame\u201d. Demonstrations continued into the early morning in Seattle, where police threw stun grenades to disperse protesters and reported several officers were injured with rocks, bottles and improvised explosives. Meanwhile, thousands gathered in New York\u2019s Central Park and hundreds more gathered in Harlem for prayers and protest. Demonstrators chanted \u201cget off our necks\u201d and \u201cracism is America\u2019s original sin\u201d as they marched uptown from the National Black Theatre in Harlem. Pastors and other faith leaders gave rousing speeches outside the theatre and other celebrated spots, including the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture \u2013 an internationally renowned archive for information on people of African descent. \u201cHarlem is extremely significant when it comes to talking about the disproportionate impact on black and brown communities of so many things \u2013 for example, Covid-19 and police surveillance,\u201d said Jacquelyn Martell, 33, one of the protest organizers. \u201cBut part of this movement is to bring communities together and ameliorate divisions brought forth by systemic racism and bring some healing as well.\u201d In the nation\u2019s capital, more than 10,000 people poured into the streets, gathered near Lafayette Square by the White House, marched down U Street\u2019s historic Black Broadway, and coalesced at the feet of Abraham Lincoln at his giant marble memorial. Although the White House remained fortified behind newly erected metal fencing, there were markedly fewer tanks and heavily armed federal officers around the city \u2013 following widespread outcry over the presence of militarized law enforcement over the past week.

Nearby, demonstrators painted an additional message on the streets: \u201cDefund the police.\u201d Trump, who has threatened to send in the military to quash demonstrations, tweeted on Saturday to praise various branches of law enforcement. In Philadelphia, which saw one of the largest mobilizations of demonstrators in the city since protests began, activists demanded that the mayor cut at least 10% from the police department budget, which is due to receive more money even as other programs face cuts. The showing came as the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned, following an uproar over a headline bemoaning property damage that read: \u201cBuildings Matter, Too.\u201d Local residents had also been shaken by a showing of an armed group of mostly white men in the city\u2019s Fishtown neighborhood on Monday. Among the Philadelphians who rallied on Saturday were members of the 76ers basketball team and a couple who married amidst the demonstration. In Louisville, a city mourning the police killing of Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson called on lawmakers to pass an anti-lynching law and eliminate protections for police officers from lawsuits. In California\u2019s Simi Valley, where four white Los Angeles police officers who brutally beat Rodney King were acquitted in 1992, sparking riots, about 2,000 people marched to the city hall, demanding an end to police violence. Thousands of demonstrators flooded on to San Francisco\u2019s Golden Gate Bridge with the acquiescence of authorities. Tow trucks held off car traffic in both directions, and police directed vehicles caught in the middle of the bridge to go around protesters.

Nobody knows why.</p> <p>The puzzle is not just Italian. From the beginning, Covid-19 struck unevenly across the globe, and scientists have been trying to understand the reasons. Why are some populations or sectors of a population more vulnerable than others?

That could shape how governments manage the risks of a second wave.</p> <p>One thing seems clear: there are many reasons why one population is more protected than another. Theoretical epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta of the University of Oxford thinks that a key one is immunity that was built up prior to this pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s been my hunch for a very long time that there is a lot of cross-protection from severe disease and death conferred by other circulating, related bugs,\u201d she says. Though that cross-protection may not protect a person from infection in the first place, it could ensure they only experience relatively mild symptoms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d27b70020325f359f4aeef2a9c4c2bb5d9b78bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d27b70020325f359f4aeef2a9c4c2bb5d9b78bd7/0_252_4623_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Actors on stilts performing for locked-down residents in a Munich neighbourhood last month.

Antibody testing, as we know, was slow to get going and unreliable to begin with, and the results to date suggest that the percentages of populations carrying antibodies to the Covid-19 virus are often in single or low-double digits. New, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/public-health-england-approves-roche-test-for-coronavirus-antibodies\">more sensitive antibody tests</a> that have become available in recent weeks could soon provide a much more accurate picture if deployed widely enough, but there are already hints that the results to date may be underestimates.</p> <p>First there was evidence based on diagnostic testing of postmortem samples from patients who died in December that the virus was circulating in western countries \u2013 notably France and the US \u2013<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52526554\"> about a month earlier than was initially thought</a>. New research shows that another component of the human immune response \u2013 T cells, which help orchestrate the antibody response \u2013 show memory for coronavirus infection when exposed to Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3\">a paper published in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30610-3\">Cell</a></em> on 14 May, researchers at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California reported that T cells in blood drawn from people between 2015 and 2018 recognised and reacted to fragments of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. \u201cThese people could not have possibly seen Sars-CoV-2,\u201d says one of the paper\u2019s senior authors, Alessandro Sette. \u201cThe most reasonable hypothesis is that this reactivity is really cross-reactivity with the cousins of Sars-CoV-2 \u2013 the common cold coronaviruses which circulate very broadly and generally give rather mild disease.\u201d</p> <p>The finding supported an <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20061440v1.full.pdf\">earlier one</a> from a group at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin, detecting T cell reactivity to proteins in the Sars-CoV-2 virus in 83% of Covid-19 patients but also in 34% of healthy volunteers who had tested negative for the virus itself.</p> <p>David Heymann, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advises the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says these results are important, but cautions that cross-reactivity doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into immunity. To determine whether it does would involve following a large number of people who show such cross-reactivity to see if they are protected, if not from infection with Covid-19, then at least from severe forms of the disease.</p> <p>It is, however, a reasonable hypothesis that exposure to other coronaviruses could confer protection, Sette says. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it before, for example with the 2009 H1N1 flu.\u201d Older people fared well compared to other age groups in that pandemic, he says, probably because their immune systems had been primed by exposure to similar flu strains from decades before. That could be the reason the 2009 pandemic was less lethal than other flu pandemics in history, killing <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841239/\">an estimated 200,000 people globally</a>.</p> <p>If exposure to other coronaviruses does protect against Covid-19, Gupta says, then variability in that exposure could explain much of the difference in fatality rates between countries or regions. Exposure to the related virus that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002-4 might have afforded some protection to east Asians against Covid-19, for example.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2af1c135c072892cfc480e464f1c400dd688d70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2af1c135c072892cfc480e464f1c400dd688d70/0_0_5500_5500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The H1N1 flu virus, which hit older people less hard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The H1N1 flu virus, which hit older people less hard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: K-Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late March, Gupta\u2019s group published a paper that drew attention because it generated very different forecasts from those of epidemiologist Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London and his colleagues \u2013 to whom the UK government was listening most closely. The Oxford group suggested that up to half of the UK population could already have been infected by Sars-CoV-2, meaning the infection fatality rate (IFR) \u2013 the proportion of infected people who went on to die \u2013 was much lower than Ferguson\u2019s group was indicating, and the disease was therefore less dangerous. Neither group had much data at that point, and Gupta says that her intention was to highlight that, in the absence of data, a wide range of scenarios should be considered.</p> <p>Two months on, she stands by her model, but wishes that she had made its implications clearer. \u201cThe truth is that the IFR is not a hardwired property of the virus or of our interaction with the virus,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the vulnerable fraction [of the population] that is determining the average overall risk of dying.\u201d Once an elderly care home is infiltrated by the virus, for example, the virus spreads rapidly through it and is often lethal, pushing up the IFR. This means it is critical to understand why some people are resistant and others are not, so that those who are vulnerable can be protected.</p> <p>We know some of those vulnerability factors. Age is the most obvious one. Unlike with the 2009 flu, elderly people are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 \u2013 a fact that might reflect the history of exposure to coronaviruses of different age cohorts. Comorbidity is another, and a third is being male. According to Garima Sharma of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, who with colleagues recently published <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666084920304332\">a paper on sex differences in Covid-19 mortality</a>, women are protected by virtue of having a \u201cbackup\u201d X chromosome. \u201cX chromosomes contain a high density of immune-related genes, so women generally mount stronger immune responses,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Socioeconomic status, climate, culture and genetic makeup could also shape vulnerability, as could certain childhood vaccines and vitamin D levels. And all of these factors can vary between countries. The Japanese might have been afforded some protection, for example, by their custom of bowing rather than shaking hands. And though most of the disparity between the sexes is down to biology, Sharma says some of it is due to social and behavioural factors, with women being more likely to wash their hands and seek preventive care.</p> <p>It is also becoming clear that protecting the vulnerable has made a big difference to outcomes so far. Italy and Germany, for example, have similar proportions of over-65-year-olds \u2013 just over 20% of the population in both cases \u2013 and yet the two have reported strikingly different fatality rates. The case fatality rate (CFR) \u2013 the proportion of the sick who go on to die \u2013 is less informative but easier to measure than the IFR, because sick people are more visible than merely infected ones, and as at 26 May the CFR in Italy was <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid\">a</a><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid\">bout </a><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/mortality-risk-covid\">14%</a>, compared to 5% in Germany.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4eadd48baa8822c551abd15a04551944509cdb83\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4eadd48baa8822c551abd15a04551944509cdb83/0_28_5243_3148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Thai moto-taxi driver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Thai moto-taxi driver.

Many Italians in their 20s and 30s live at home with their extended families, which meant that transmission to the elderly was high and, when critical care units were overwhelmed, so were deaths. This is rarer in Germany, where many elderly care homes also enacted a strict isolation regime. In Germany, says Heymann, \u201cthey did a better job in keeping the elderly protected\u201d. Some estimates suggest that <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-why-is-germanys-fatality-rate-so-low-135496\">only 20</a><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-why-is-germanys-fatality-rate-so-low-135496\">% of German Covid-19 cases were over 60</a>, as compared to <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/27/covid-19-coronavirus-breakdown-of-deaths-and-infections-worldwide\">more than 90%</a> in Italy.</p> <p>The UK, which has recorded <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4c784e-c259-4ca4-9a82-648ffde71bf0\">the second highest death rate from Covid-19 after Spain</a>, has not looked after its elderly so well \u2013 deciding at one point <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/29/care-homes-refusing-to-take-in-patients-discharged-nhs-hospitals-coronavirus-risk\">to discharge patients from hospitals back to care homes</a> without testing them for the disease. The government\u2019s advice to 1.5 million UK citizens with underlying health conditions to self-isolate for three months from late March may have helped protect those people, but for Gupta the UK\u2019s high death rate reflects a deeper problem \u2013 years of erosion of community support services that provided pastoral care. \u201cThere is just not enough investment in the NHS and in that GP or other frontline individual who advises the vulnerable person,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Holding to her hunch, she believes that lockdown was an <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/\">over</a><a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/\">reaction</a> and that frontline care and protection of the vulnerable \u2013 which should have been a priority from the beginning \u2013 should be prioritised now. She also thinks that the worst is behind us, and that while subsequent waves can\u2019t be ruled out, they will probably be less bad than what we have experienced so far. The disease will settle into an endemic equilibrium, in her view, perhaps returning each winter like a seasonal flu.</p> <p>Friston\u2019s models also suggest that immunity in the population is higher than data indicates, but for him it\u2019s not clear how long that immunity will last \u2013 and he argues that test-and-trace protocols should be put in place now, ahead of any possible second wave that might erupt once that immunity drops off. Heymann remains wary of models, which he says have too often been mistaken for reality in this pandemic, and he awaits more data: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody can predict the destiny of this virus at this point in time,\u201d he says.</p>",

The racialisation of the drug made black people the face of addiction and led to calls for more severe punishment for possession of crack.

In short, the drugs that had claimed so many black lives came for white people \u2013 with different responses.&nbsp;</p> <p>And yet here we are again.

The reason George Floyd and so many others are dead is because they are black. And being black in my country is treated, by some police officers and vigilantes alike, as probable cause to harass, detain and kill.</p> <p>Consider black people as canaries in the coal mine. What happens to them in this country matters for everyone. Those who would seek to raise the canard of black on black crime as a riposte to the charges of systemic racism in this country have not been paying attention. And focusing on the deaths of those harmed at the hands of the police ignores the many violences black people experience on a daily basis in the US. Forget the term \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2013 let\u2019s call them \u201cmacroaggressive\u201d. It\u2019s probably not going to be the Knight Rider at your door, but maybe the other \u201cgood\u201d white people who come armed with guns demanding to search your home.</p> <p>Yet black people are made to feel ashamed for saying they have been victims. To be a victim simply means that you have been harmed by the actions of another. Yet black people have been told over and over again that the mere mention of racism is unfair. They\u2019re playing the \u201crace card\u201d or adopting a loser\u2019s mentality.</p> <p>That\u2019s a myth we tell so that black people don\u2019t dwell on the many ways they have been damaged.

      "bodyText": "The UK health secretary has said there is undoubtedly a risk there will be an increase in coronavirus cases following the Black Lives Matter protests this weekend, while denying Britain is a racist country. Matt Hancock repeated his calls for people not to attend protests if physical distancing cannot be observed, as further demonstrations were planned for Sunday. \u201cI support very strongly the argument that is being made by those who are protesting \u2026 but the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He said about one in 1,000 people have the virus so when groups of thousands come together that risks spreading the disease, which could then risk lives. Asked whether he thought the UK was a racist country, Hancock insisted it was not. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t, but I do think there\u2019s injustice that needs to be tackled and I\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality.\u201d He subsequently struggled when asked how many black people were in the cabinet, pointing to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and Priti Patel, the home secretary, who are of British-Asian backgrounds. Hancock also said further action would be taken to address the root causes of why people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds were disproportionately affected by coronavirus, after a Public Health England (PHE) study was criticised for failing to make recommendations on how the issue could be addressed. Thousands of anti-racism protesters gathered peacefully across the UK on Saturday, defying calls from ministers and police chiefs to avoid mass gatherings. Crowds of mostly young people heard speeches in Parliament Square, London, declaring the beginning of the end of institutional racism, and observed a minute\u2019s silence on one knee to commemorate black people killed by police in the UK. There were a small number of violent clashes between protesters and police, , which the Metropolitan police chief, Cressida Dick, condemned as \u201cshocking and completely unacceptable\u201d. The protests have been sparked by demonstrations in the US in response to the killing by a police officer of George Floyd, a black man, who was filmed repeatedly saying \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d as the officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. One of Hancock\u2019s Conservative colleagues, Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, said the government had to do more to address racial inequality in society. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid \u2013 who also previously served as home secretary \u2013 said the UK must not pretend that it does not have substantial obstacles to overcome in regard to integration and opportunity. \u201cThere are still parts of society that are more concerned about the status quo than justice and humanity,\u201d he wrote. He said racism could occur anywhere in the world, and that new ambition was needed to break down barriers in Britain. \u201cThe government can and must do more to address racial inequalities in our society,\u201d Javid wrote. \u201cAs with all large-scale, systematic challenges, only the prime minister is capable of driving real change, and I know he cares deeply.\u201d He said there was a greater disproportionality of black people in prisons in the UK than in the US, and that while abuse directed at officers was unacceptable, the police service \u201cstill has a way to go\u201d. Government ministers have urged people not to go out to protest, but Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, said she was proud of those who had taken to the streets to demand change. Nandy said the UK government could not remain silent on racism in the US or the UK. Also appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, she said she had \u201cno idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist\u201d, but believed his response to the mass protests after the police killing of George Floyd was an election strategy. \u201cIn the run-up to the American elections, this is one of the ways that politicians try to activate their base,\u201d said Nandy. \u201cThey divide people in order to try to advance their own cause and that\u2019s actually one of the things that is so damaging about it. \u201cThat\u2019s crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and we\u2019re seeing under the cover of Covid.

      "bodyText": "They were 48 minutes of mayhem that shook the republic. With a bizarre pageant of riots shields, a Bible and a designer handbag, they also represented what could be Donald Trump\u2019s last best chance of clinging to power. Before sunset last Monday, the US president stood in the White House Rose Garden, threatened to turn the American military on the American people and declared: \u201cI am your president of law and order.\u201d Beyond the perimeter fence, park police and national guard troops fired teargas and chased away peaceful protesters so Trump could cross the road to the fire-damaged St John\u2019s church. Trump was joined by officials including his daughter and senior adviser, Ivanka, clutching a $1,540 handbag. The self-anointed strongman posed for the cameras while awkwardly holding aloft a Bible \u2013 or was it the Richard Nixon playbook? This was the moment that Trump finally found a re-election campaign strategy in his comfort zone. Like his idol Nixon during the turmoil of 1968, he promised to put out the fires in American cities and assuage the fears of white suburbs. It is a framing that portrays Democrats as soft on crime while selling Trump as the national security president \u2013 less \u201cKeep America Great\u201d than \u201cKeep America Safe\u201d. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats new theme is \u2018Defund the Police\u2019,\u201d the president tweeted. \u201cRemember that when you don\u2019t want Crime, especially against you and your family.

Last week, the government announced it would fund grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m. With federal parliament set to resume for three days this week, government sources confirmed on Sunday the program would be rolled out within existing partnership agreements with the states, obviating the need to bring enabling legislation before the House. The scheme will be delivered through state revenue offices. Labor\u2019s deputy leader Richard Marles told the ABC on Sunday \u201cparliament should be having a say in the way in which stimulus is rolled out\u201d. The program has attracted criticism from some economists, and backbench MPs are also growing restive about the amount of expenditure being promised in an effort to counter the economic shock associated with the coronavirus pandemic. A number of civil society groups argue the government would have been better off investing in social housing rather than funding renovations in private dwellings that may have been in train without assistance from taxpayers. But the government says funds are estimated to be spent on 20,000 new home starts and 7,000 renovations. This was necessary because of an anticipated drop-off in new home starts in the second half of 2020. Marles said on Sunday the government\u2019s program needed improvement. \u201cRight now, we say it could be done better, and we make this point, there was forecast to be 160,000 houses built in this country before Covid struck, and with the advent of Covid, that\u2019s now 100,000 \u2013 a gap of 60,000\u201d. \u201cBy the government\u2019s own figures, this measure is only going to add 10,000 houses to that pool,\u201d he said. \u201cThis should be done a whole lot better, and we\u2019ve been talking over the last few weeks about a range of measures about spending more on social housing, trying to bring that spending forward, and around removing the cap on the first homeowner grant scheme \u2013 all of those are measures that could be done to get a better outcome here\u201d.",

He also disputed the idea that the R value was above 1 anywhere in the UK, even though PHE is part of his own department. He said Sage overall believed every region had an R value of less than 1. The government is bringing in tougher restrictions on air travel from Monday, with inbound travellers asked to quarantine for 14 days. Ministers are, however, considering replacing this with a plan for reciprocal waiving of quarantine arrangements with countries that have low infection rates at the earliest opportunity. Hancock said he still hoped people may be able to travel abroad this summer. \u201cI really hope that people are going to be able to fly to go on summer holiday, but we\u2019ve got to take an approach that starts with caution,\u201d he said.",

In a more generous interpretation of the 10-person quota, he planned to allow 10 families in at once. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to create an ambience in the church, just to give people a little refuge, that it\u2019s not a police state,\u201d Beuther said. \u201cWe\u2019re not gonna be patrolling, you know what I mean?\u201d Although the three churches have come to disparate conclusions about reopening, they have rallied round their people during a time of incredible need. Through food vouchers, grocery deliveries and a new food pantry, they have been feeding members of the community. And as pastors blessed bodies, contacted the local hospital chaplain, or held intimate funerals, they cared for both the dead and the living, even amid a crippling public health emergency. \u201cWe are essential,\u201d said Vergara. \u201cWe aren\u2019t closed. And we continue to do the work of the church.\u201d",

People mainly buying weed and benzos,\u201d said DWtripadvisor. \u201cMy weed is grown in the UK so the price has stayed the same for now.\u201d Drugs sold online over the darknet have seen a significant uptick in activity.

Their top sellers are synthetic drugs such as MDMA, ecstasy, which can be produced in local laboratories. </p> <p>The National Crime Agency has scored<strong> </strong>significant successes in slowing down the traffic in class-A drugs (chiefly cocaine). Since lockdown, it has seized<a href=\"https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/millions-of-pounds-and-tonnes-of-drugs-seized-during-lockdown\"> 25 tonnes and \u00a315m in cash</a>,<strong> </strong>which is notably more than during the first three months of the year. \u201cCovid-19 restrictions have made criminal groups take additional risks in moving cash around,\u201d according to an NCA statement. \u201cThe closure of many cash-based businesses in recent weeks has robbed OCGs [organised crime groups] of an opportunity to stash or launder their cash, making it harder for criminals to conceal the proceeds of their crimes.\u201d</p> <p>When it became clear how serious Covid-19 was, there was an immediate drop in the level of organised criminal activity in <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-crime-rate-fall-latest-update-a9460846.html\">the UK</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/de/corona-kriminalit\u00e4t-in-der-krise/a-53094260\">Germany</a> and <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-france-records-sharp-drop-in-crime-during-lockdown\">France</a> of around 20%. \u201cCriminals are humans too,\u201d said Graeme Biggar, economic crimes lead at the NCA, \u201cand they are abiding by the rules.\u201d He added that a disproportionately high percentage of the agency\u2019s organised crime targets suffer from underlying medical conditions and are taking self-isolation seriously.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the first sign that organised crime was adjusting to the new circumstances was to be found on the internet. Online crime has been rising steadily for some years now but Covid-19 is accelerating the trend. Just two weeks into lockdown the NCA reported a huge increase in <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52310804\">Covid-19-related scamming sites</a>: 70,000 sprang up, selling everything from personal protective equipment and hand gel to snake-oil remedies. These goods were either stolen, counterfeit or non-existent, ie simple scams to lure cash from people desperate to protect themselves from the virus.</p> <p>The shift to working from home has placed a strain on IT security teams. A company office will have a well-defined network perimeter that security engineers can monitor easily. At home, employees may be sharing sensitive data with their main system across routers through which their teenagers are downloading dodgy content. This drastically multiplies the vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit to enter a company\u2019s system. This in turn increases the threat from ransomware, malware that can lock computer files and open them only on payment of a ransom.</p> <p>In Italy, where the lockdown was much more rigorously enforced than here, Covid-19 contributed to an unexpected success in the fight against organised crime. On 12 March, police noticed a car driving to an abandoned house near Locri on the Calabrian coast. That evening they spotted the light from a cigarette and <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11175733/wanted-mafia-godfather-busted-coronavirus-lockdown-smoke/\">raided the property</a> to discover 42-year-old Cesare Antonio Cord\u00ec, a senior boss of Calabria\u2019s notorious crime group, the \u2018Ndrangheta, and one of Europe\u2019s most wanted men.</p> <p>Law enforcement officers around the world need no reminding that the initial hiatus in activity was always going to be temporary: major political or economic crises represent a huge opportunity for organised crime. A pandemic with a cataclysmic impact on the global economy is the jackpot. There is massive disruption to supplies of all manner of goods and services both licit and illicit, which leads to dizzying growth in the black market.

While officers are busy stopping members of the public from congregating in parks, they have less time to track down criminals.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of Paris has opened up a strong lead in her bid to be reelected after forging an alliance with the city\u2019s ecologists. An opinion poll put the Socialist Anne Hidalgo at 44% of intentions to vote, well ahead of her closest rival, the centre-right candidate Rachida Dati, a former justice minister under Nicolas Sarkozy. The governing LREM party candidate, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, is third with 20% according to the survey by Ifop-Fiducial published in the Journal du Dimanche. The mathematician C\u00e9dric Villani, standing as an independent candidate, is trailing behind the three leading women. Only 3% of those polled said they would consider voting for a candidate apart from Hidalgo, Dati and Buzyn. Hidalgo appears to be enjoying a boost from popular post-lockdown measures. While Paris remains \u201corange\u201d on the Covid-19 map amid concerns the virus is still circulating in the French capital, the mayor has allowed restaurants and cafes still banned from serving customers inside their premises to spread out over pavements and parking spaces. She has also introduced an extra 50km (31 miles) of temporary cycle lanes across the capital, some of which are likely to become permanent. After the first-round poll on 15 March, in which Hidalgo obtained 29.33% of the vote, a similar poll gave her 41% of votes if in alliance with the green Europe Ecologie Les Verts party led by David Belliard, an alliance that was sealed last Monday. More than half of those questioned by pollsters said environmental issues would determine how they voted. Hidalgo is standing on an ambitious programme promoting the idea of the \u201c15 minute city\u201d, where essential services are on or near residents\u2019 doorstep, enlarging green spaces in the densely populated capital and lowering pollution by reducing road space for private vehicles. \u201cDuring the lockdown, Paris was very quiet and we rediscovered birdsong but it was a pause and we wouldn\u2019t want it to last, but that relief from fewer cars less pollution is good,\u201d Hidalgo told France Inter radio last week. Regarding the temporary cycle lanes, she said: \u201cThey have shown themselves useful, for mobility and reduction of pollution. I hope they can continue,\u201d adding that the measures would be subject to a democratic vote. The second round of the municipal elections across France was postponed as the country went into a strict eight-week coronavirus lockdown in March. It will be held on 28 June. The Ifop poll is the first in Paris since the candidates officially submitted their election lists last week.",

The head of civil liberties group<strong> </strong>PEN America called it a \u201c<a href=\"https://pen.org/press-release/cnn-arrests-took-place-for-no-fathomable-reason/\">dystopian spectacle</a>\u201d. On social media, the accompanying indignation to his arrest was that: \u201cThis is America, arresting journalists for doing their job doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d But the list of things that don\u2019t supposedly happen in America continues to grow. Peaceful protesters don\u2019t get teargassed: this is America.

The Trump administration is simply suspending convention, ditching the pretence of pious protocol and ritual that has always been central to the survival of the \u201cnot in America\u201d myth. This has always been America, what\u2019s different is that it no longer feels the need to hide its true nature.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/this-time-the-promise-of-change-has-to-be-realised-black-americans-have-had-enough\">This time, the promise of change has to be realised. Black Americans have had enough | Niambi Michele Carter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Since Donald Trump became president, non-Americans&nbsp;have taken&nbsp;to drawing <a href=\"https://www.esquireme.com/content/44937-donald-trump-mistakenly-tags-a-saudi-man-leaving-twitter-in-splits\">tongue-in-cheek comparisons</a> between America and Arab dictatorships \u2013 its fetishising of the military, its president\u2019s clumsy and vulgar stabs at religiosity, its centuries-old ethnic tension erupting in clashes \u2013 but even these jokes now wear thin.&nbsp;Because&nbsp;since George Floyd\u2019s death, since the government and institutions of sanctioned violence have bared their teeth, the US\u2019s flattering view of itself has taken such a battering that jokes are no longer needed to do the job.</p> \n<p>Those clutching their pearls at assaults on the media and police brutality hold dear the belief that America\u2019s inherent virtue will prevail, even as police officers hammer it with batons on mobile phone footage. American exceptionalism is the proverbial cockroach weathering a nuclear attack \u2013 it survives everything. It survives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/teachers-call-for-ban-on-shooter-drills-in-us-schools\">school shootings</a>, the suspension of due process in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the torture and killing of millions of innocent civilians from Vietnam to Iraq. It is&nbsp;at&nbsp;this moment surviving despite the US having the highest coronavirus death toll in the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>American exceptionalism is at its most robust when faced with the reality of its structures of racial oppression, the central challenge for which it was designed.

      "bodyText": "When a black CNN reporter was arrested live on air last week while covering the protests in Minneapolis, it was met with denunciation that something like this could happen in the US. It was \u201ca sign of American disintegration\u201d, wrote the Washington Post. The head of civil liberties group PEN America called it a \u201cdystopian spectacle\u201d. On social media, the accompanying indignation to his arrest was that: \u201cThis is America, arresting journalists for doing their job doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d But the list of things that don\u2019t supposedly happen in America continues to grow. Peaceful protesters don\u2019t get teargassed: this is America. Presidents don\u2019t threaten to unleash troops on those protesting against killing and oppression: this is America. For black and minority ethnic people, the country has always been the America of an immune police force, white supremacy and a legal system that protects only those who can afford it. The Trump administration is simply suspending convention, ditching the pretence of pious protocol and ritual that has always been central to the survival of the \u201cnot in America\u201d myth. This has always been America, what\u2019s different is that it no longer feels the need to hide its true nature. Since Donald Trump became president, non-Americans have taken to drawing tongue-in-cheek comparisons between America and Arab dictatorships \u2013 its fetishising of the military, its president\u2019s clumsy and vulgar stabs at religiosity, its centuries-old ethnic tension erupting in clashes \u2013 but even these jokes now wear thin. Because since George Floyd\u2019s death, since the government and institutions of sanctioned violence have bared their teeth, the US\u2019s flattering view of itself has taken such a battering that jokes are no longer needed to do the job. Those clutching their pearls at assaults on the media and police brutality hold dear the belief that America\u2019s inherent virtue will prevail, even as police officers hammer it with batons on mobile phone footage. American exceptionalism is the proverbial cockroach weathering a nuclear attack \u2013 it survives everything. It survives school shootings, the suspension of due process in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the torture and killing of millions of innocent civilians from Vietnam to Iraq. It is at this moment surviving despite the US having the highest coronavirus death toll in the world. American exceptionalism is at its most robust when faced with the reality of its structures of racial oppression, the central challenge for which it was designed. In the founding years of the US, a belief in its inherent morality, godliness and superiority to its European origins had to be squared with its savage cruelty toward, and exploitation of, black slaves on an industrial scale. The closer the threat of abolition came, the more elaborate the excuses became. In order to defend slavery, John C Calhoun, seventh vice-president of the US, leaned on Aristotle\u2019s theory of natural slavery, the history of Greek democracy and the glory of the Roman empire. The argument was that not only was slavery a positive good, it was a feature of successful civilisations and not bad at all for the slaves themselves who, according to Calhoun, had never \u201cattained a condition so civilised and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually\u201d. The reconciling of moral mutual exclusivities continues to reproduce the same denial: racism without racists to pin it on to when black Americans die at disproportionately high rates of Covid-19; police killings without murderers when their perpetrators aren\u2019t charged; and a president who exploited racial animus for support but for whom no racists voted, only the \u201cleft behind\u201d. But Trump is a challenge to this robust tradition of normalising evil through eloquent guile. Vulgar and relishing conflict, he seems to be ushering it closer to some endgame. There is something old and something new in this latest racial conflagration. Its global resonance and its national traction is a result not of its uniqueness, but its intensity following an escalation of events. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the bloodlust of Republicans spoiling for a fight, police with clear orders and appetite to stifle protest, and emboldened white supremacists, have heaped provocation on a nation that was already a tinderbox after three years of Trump related polarisation. It will inevitably be a wasted opportunity if the recent entrants to the race war, Trump and his emboldened cohort, are seen as too central to the crisis. Too often, the US is cast as a protagonist in a morality play, wrestling with demons that will eventually be defeated if only the right conditions are met. If only the Democrats hadn\u2019t nominated Hillary Clinton, if only Joe Biden can win the election, if only another messianic Barack Obama figure would appear and heal the nation.

      "bodyText": "Christian leaders have welcomed the government\u2019s announcement that places of worship in England will be allowed to reopen for individual prayer from 15 June, but Muslim and Jewish leaders said the move was not appropriate for the way they practise their faith. The decision, confirmed on Sunday by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, followed growing pressure on the government, particularly from the Catholic church. Most mosques, synagogues and temples, however, are likely to remain shut until communal prayer is permitted. Communal services are included in third phase of the government\u2019s recovery plan for England, to be implemented on 4 July at the earliest. Only individual private prayer inside a place of worship will be permitted from next Monday. The government said \u201ccommunally led prayer, worship or devotion such as services, evensong, informal prayer meetings, mass, jummah or kirtan will not be possible at this stage\u201d.

      "body": "<p>\u2018Sometimes,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/david-shrigley\">David Shrigley</a>, \u201cI feel like a monk transcribing the Bible.\u201d The artist, speaking by phone from lockdown in Devon, is referring to the meditative form of creativity he has been practising ever since isolation began. His aim is to produce a set number of drawings each day. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s quite hard,\u201d he says. \u201cYou just have to focus on it, like yoga or something.\u201d</p> <p>Shrigley\u2019s entire lockdown life has a monkish feel to it. He is on the 16:8 diet, which involves fasting for 16 hours, and has been having 45-second swims in the sea, which he finds restorative but \u201cballs cold\u201d.

      "body": "<p>For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d</p> <p>That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/travel/destinations/lockdown-effects-mt-everest-visible-from-kathmandu-after-decades-as-pollution-level-goes-down/as75802249.cms\">make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades</a>), Manila (where the <a href=\"https://news.mongabay.com/2020/04/manila-gets-its-skyline-back-as-air-quality-improves-amid-covid-19-lockdown/\">Sierra Madre became visible again</a>) or dozens of other cities across the world.</p> <p>Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year.</p> <p>Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons \u2013 on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership \u2013 that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three.</p> <h2>Copenhagen</h2> <p>Copenhagen has the world\u2019s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world.</p> <p>Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in R\u00e5dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles.</p> <p>Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. \u201cIt feels good to walk around Copenhagen,\u201d he says, adding that in some areas of the city \u201cpedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.\u201d The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world.&nbsp;This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent\u2019s shifts for schools runs on \u201cminibus-like\u201d bicycles that can take up to six children at a time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/092c89d06533c44221a0defd163b9382de17190d/0_224_3872_2325/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HC Andersens boulevard in Copenhagen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Forsberg/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Copenhagen\u2019s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator.</p> <p>Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor\u2019s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. \u201cFrom 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by&nbsp;more than 50%, so we are on our way,\u201d he says.&nbsp;</p> <p>These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20/why-danes-happily-pay-high-rates-of-taxes\">an investment in health and quality of life</a>. The city\u2019s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour \u2013 something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">Danes are consistently </a><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20200419-coronavirus-five-countries-with-the-best-healthcare-systems\">ranked among the world\u2019s healthiest and happiest people</a>.</p> <p>The municipality also wants to completely phase out combustion engines by electrifying the bus fleet and banning petrol and diesel cars within five years. After that plan ran into opposition from the national government, local environmental NGOs lobbied for a revolutionary new traffic management scheme that hugely decreases the convenience of car use. The \u201cdistribution plan\u201d, which was pioneered in the Belgian town of Ghent, divides the urban centre into a handful of zones and prohibits drivers from going directly from one to another. Instead, they have to go via the suburbs. \u201cIt means there is no such thing as a short drive to the bakery or wherever in this system,\u201d says Jens M\u00fcller, the air quality manager of the Transport &amp; Environment NGO. As a result, walking, cycling and public transport become more appealing. \u201cIt\u2019s the most radical thing you can do apart from creating a no-car zone,\u201d says Juul.</p> <p>Copenhagen is in a group of European cities, including Amsterdam, Paris, London and Oslo, that are trying to set the global pace for air quality improvements. M\u00fcller says London is a leader on ultra-low emission zones, Oslo on promoting use of electric cars, while Paris is exploring radical plans for \u201ca city of 15 minutes\u201d that aims to ensure every resident can get the shops and services they want within a short walk or bicycle ride. Cities in Germany are pioneering pop-up infrastructure and tactical urbanism that allow communities to block roads at certain times for certain events. In Brussels, residents now have a say in when to close roads for children\u2019s parties and barbecues. M\u00fcller says this reduces pollution because people spend more time outside their homes.</p> <p>The foundation, he says, is community activism by previous and current generations. Amsterdam may now be aiming for zero-carbon boats and yet more bikes, but \u2013 like Copenhagen \u2013 the origins of its strong air-quality ambition was the parents\u2019 movement in the 1970s, which campaigned against the number of road traffic accidents with banners demanding: \u201cStop murdering our children.\u201d More recently, Madrid has seen a fierce political contest for control of the streets, with 20,000 people rallying last year to oppose plans by the ruling rightwing coalition to reopen the city centre to cars. The \u201cMadrid Central\u201d zone in the Spanish capital had achieved more <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/news/people-power-and-courts-fight-first-ever-attempt-scrap-low-emissions-zone\">nitrogen dioxide reductions than any city in Europe</a>. So far, people power has kept the cars out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6b2b9062e178fe60d7165966216fb4edfc8b200/0_125_4171_2503/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oakland \u2026 harnessed the power of environmental activism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Melpomenem/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>California (Oakland and Los Angeles)</h2> <p>The importance of grassroots activism has recently been enshrined into law in California, where campaigners have persuaded the government that if it wants to improve air quality it needs to empower low-income BAME neighbourhoods, which are worst affected because they often live closest to pollution sources.</p> <p>California has made impressive strides since the 1980s, when Los Angeles, Oakland and San Jose were notorious for a toxic haze that blanketed the city for more than 200 days of the year. These days, thanks to tighter regulations, higher petrol standards and less reliance on coal, there are usually fewer pollutants in the air and about 60 more days of blue skies a year. Several cities have also launched \u201cgreen new deals\u201d. Even the car capital of the world, Los Angeles, is trying to nudge commuters on to an upgraded public transport system.</p> <p>But perhaps the most impressive work is being done at the community level by local activists in hotspots of pollution.

Air quality activists hope this will also address the tendency for wealthy white communities to go low carbon by offloading pollution towards poorer black and Latino areas. Of the two north-south highways in Oakland, it is no coincidence that trucks are banned only on the 580, which passes through a more affluent part of the city. Gordon says the goal is environmental equality.</p> <h2>Mexico City</h2> <p>Among air quality wonks and urban planners, perhaps the greatest buzz of excitement is about Mexico City.

      "bodyText": "For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic. As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades), Manila (where the Sierra Madre became visible again) or dozens of other cities across the world. Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year. Having seen the shroud lift, there is a growing clamour not to let it fall again. Cities across the world are exploring ways to permanently reduce pollution. Chafe says there is no quick, one-case-fits-all solution, but there are lessons \u2013 on environmental justice, community activism, urban design, climate ambition, technological innovation and municipal leadership \u2013 that can be learned from the cities and states that were making progress even before the lockdown. Here are three. Copenhagen Copenhagen has the world\u2019s most ambitious plan to cut emissions: carbon neutral by 2025. This is pushing the Danish capital to go beyond the existing model of smart, clean urban design and cycle-centred transport that has turned it into one of the cleanest cities in the world. Grassroots activism, pragmatic government and high taxes have been the drivers for change. Old photographs prove the city had as much of a car culture as any European city in the 1970s, when more than 100,000 citizens demonstrated in R\u00e5dhuspladsen (City Hall Square) to demand their streets back. Since then, town planners have steadily reduced parking spaces and widened areas for pedestrians and bicycles. Jeppe Juul, of the Danish Eco Council, says it is a question of priorities. \u201cIt feels good to walk around Copenhagen,\u201d he says, adding that in some areas of the city \u201cpedestrians have more space than bikes, and bikes have more space than cars.\u201d The city now vies with Amsterdam for being the most bicycle-friendly city in the world. This means traffic lights with resting bars that riders can hang on to without touching the ground, take-away coffee containers designed for bikes, and groups that organise parent\u2019s shifts for schools runs on \u201cminibus-like\u201d bicycles that can take up to six children at a time. Copenhagen\u2019s 2025 target depends largely on replacing coal-fired heating with biomass, wind and geothermal energy. A new district-heating infrastructure will allow neighbourhoods to scrap home boilers. Urban planners aim to use carbon capture and storage technology to trap emissions from the main municipal waste incinerator. Some still doubt the city will be zero-carbon within five years, but Mikkel Krogsgaard Niss, from the mayor\u2019s office, says sceptics have been proved wrong in the past. \u201cFrom 2014-20, we reduced carbon dioxide by more than 50%, so we are on our way,\u201d he says. These shifts will create up to 35,000 jobs, with most of the money coming from public coffers. Residents already pay some of the highest rates of tax in the world, but this is seen as an investment in health and quality of life. The city\u2019s wastewater plant was also expensive, but now that it is operational, residents can swim in the harbour \u2013 something unthinkable in urban waterways elsewhere. Danes are consistently ranked among the world\u2019s healthiest and happiest people.

So is recovery followed by frequent relapses. Here are the stories of four women who are struggling to return to normal life.</p> <p><strong>Iulia Hammond</strong><strong>, 39, junior doctor in Manchester<br></strong>\u201cI went down with Covid on 19 March. I had a fever, chills and a very mild dry cough. I took to bed, feeling like I couldn\u2019t do much of anything. After three or four days I had really severe respiratory symptoms. It felt as if there were shards of glass in my lungs. It was the most horrendous thing I have ever experienced. I was absolutely terrified.</p> <p>\u201cFor the past 10 weeks I have been sleeping sitting upright in bed. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019m able to breathe. I developed pharyngitis and at one point I thought they were going to have to intubate me. I made two trips to A&amp;E and had tests. I chatted to my GP who says patients look OK and yet feel the worst they have ever felt. It\u2019s such a horrible virus. It seems quite different in each person. There\u2019s not a standard progression.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had a slew of symptoms. I got the worst headache I have ever had, like an electric cord over my temples and the back of my head. I get an odd crawling sensation on the left side of the face, including when I brush my hair. I\u2019ve had abdominal issues and stomach pain and sensory things like pins and needles in my arms and legs. The illness comes around in two-week cycles. This has happened four times.</p> <p>\u201cEvery day I am still short of breath.<strong> </strong>In week six I got a left-sided stabbing chest pain. I now have an abnormal heart rate. This is something you can get with viruses and I\u2019m hoping it will go. You wonder why is this happening? As a physician I have been reading articles. We are learning about coronavirus in real time. The virus is completely novel, akin to HIV/Aids in the 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m now on day 74 and not at work. Essentially I go bed, kitchen, sofa. There are weeks when I feel I have ridden the wave, and others where I\u2019m back in the wave. I would like to get back to normal life sooner rather than later. It feels very endless.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Dr Tracy Briggs, 42, clinical academic and geneticist at the </strong><strong>University of Manchester<br></strong>\u201cI got symptoms on 13 March. We had been in London on holiday for half-term and rode the tube and went to museums. I felt short of breath. My chest was tight and my heart was racing. I have very mild asthma and I thought maybe it was an attack. It was strange. The inhaler didn\u2019t work and after a few hours I went to A&amp;E. I was told to go home and isolate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a2d9f8d628c02a1bf2a4f51f55dfaa9fdcd5ac3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a2d9f8d628c02a1bf2a4f51f55dfaa9fdcd5ac3/0_300_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tracy Briggs, at home in Chorlton, south Manchester, still struggles with symptoms 84 days after first contracting Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tracy Briggs, at home in Chorlton, south Manchester, still struggles with symptoms 84 days after first contracting Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get out of bed or eat. I felt absolutely rough, sweaty, with a horrible sore throat and struggling to breathe. After 10 days I started to do a little bit more. I went for a walk with the family and pottered around the house. Then I seemed to step back and struggle again. Climbing one flight of stairs would send my heart racing. I would cough and be short of breath.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been such a rollercoaster. You start to question yourself and your own sanity. You wonder what tomorrow is going to be. It\u2019s quite tough. My 12-year-old son had no appetite for three weeks, a sore throat and vomiting. My husband had a sore throat for a week and a mild chicken pox-like rash. My stepson had Covid symptoms and was coughing, but not as badly as me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy tongue and the back of the throat are red, white and inflamed. I\u2019ve lost quite a lot of weight. I find myself choking on food and short of breath when I eat. I\u2019ve been taking Gaviscon and today started on a course of proton pump inhibitors. I\u2019ve had a feeling of burning in my sternum and my throat.</p> <p>\u201cI felt hot and sweaty but didn\u2019t have a documented high temperature. I think there is a need to recognise that the clinical symptoms are much wider than cough and fever. This isn\u2019t necessarily something which lasts seven or 14 days. Absolutely acute patients are the priority. But we need to be aware that for a number of people, even those who don\u2019t need to go to hospital, it\u2019s going on for a long period. We need support.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Jo Platt, 46, former Labour MP for Leigh</strong><strong><br></strong>\u201cI lost my seat in the December election. I wasn\u2019t going to work or down to London. The only thing I can think of is I picked up the virus while shopping. The first symptoms began on 24 March. It was like flicking a light switch. I was at my computer and felt I was going to faint. I had nausea, dizziness and a burning temperature. Then the fatigue set in. I couldn\u2019t move and went to bed for two days.</p> <p>\u201cI recovered and thought I had something really mild. For two more days I was shaky. The next day I really went down with it. I had shortness of breath, an unproductive cough. It felt like something was in my chest. I had a horrific headache. I could not get out of bed for a full week. By the Easter weekend I thought I was out of it. But that Monday the symptoms returned. I called my GP. They were very nice, but said you haven\u2019t got the usual symptoms and should rest.</p> <p>\u201cThe gastro thing is really worrying me. I lost a stone in weight and could not eat. My blood tests were normal apart from a vitamin D deficiency. I couldn\u2019t get a test. It\u2019s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The government says if you haven\u2019t got a cough or temperature or loss of taste it\u2019s not Covid. That\u2019s not true. My GP now says they\u2019ve had numerous cases similar to mine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c42647c763007ba362866c6e6d48d00d9772484\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c42647c763007ba362866c6e6d48d00d9772484/0_89_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Labour MP Jo Platt, who lost her seat at the 2019 general election, is slowly recovering from Covid-19 but still experiencing various symptoms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Labour MP Jo Platt, who lost her seat at the 2019 general election, is slowly recovering from Covid-19 but still experiencing various symptoms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is week 10. I get back pain, like an inflammation. It\u2019s not as severe as it\u2019s been. I have a really strange sensation in my legs, as if I\u2019ve been hill walking. I wake up with sore joints in my fingers. I\u2019ve had gastrointestinal issues and acid reflux. Seeing food on TV makes me feel nauseous. This is manageable. For me the scary thing is the shortness of breath. We still don\u2019t know how long this goes on for and that\u2019s the frightening bit.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a bottom-up approach. There are a lot of voices out there and we are not being listened to. More and more people are joining [\u2018long haul\u2019 covid] Facebook support groups. We have got a lot to say and want to get the message out to GPs and public health directors.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Ginevra Read,</strong><strong> 42, psychiatrist, Bristol</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt started on 16 March. I had a slight cough and a terrible headache. The next morning my temperature was 38.3C. A week later, I was feeling worse and developed shortness of breath but it passed after a day or so. After another week I felt completely well. I went out for a short jog and felt fine. Normally I run 25km a week, swim and do yoga. But then later that week, after another short run, I was hit by extreme fatigue lasting four days. This happened another three to four times, after much less exertion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cAround week seven there was a big deterioration. It was my son\u2019s birthday and I was busy, making him a cake, and we went on a short family bike ride too. A few days later, it all came back but much worse. I had lots of symptoms, including tingling on the right side of my body, and a sensation of heat on my left foot, as well as shortness of breath, chest pain and fevers. People talk about internal shaking. I had that and a feeling like my stomach was vibrating, deeply unpleasant and as if I was being poisoned.</p> <p>\u201cIt was very frightening to feel so unwell. Going into week nine I was exhausted. Staying in bed really helped with fatigue but in week 11, I still have low grade fevers, chills, malaise and odd neurological symptoms. I am resting a lot but my improvements have plateaued.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know what is causing prolonged Covid. Is it the ongoing initial illness, or is it an inflammatory reaction or is it a post-viral syndrome? We don\u2019t know what the prognosis is or what the long-term consequences are. I wonder how many people are having prolonged illness and what the impact is on the workforce, for example. It\u2019s scary to have an illness for which there isn\u2019t any treatment and that doesn\u2019t seem to be going away.\u201d</p>",

This is something you can get with viruses and I\u2019m hoping it will go. You wonder why is this happening? As a physician I have been reading articles. We are learning about coronavirus in real time. The virus is completely novel, akin to HIV/Aids in the 1980s. \u201cI\u2019m now on day 74 and not at work. Essentially I go bed, kitchen, sofa. There are weeks when I feel I have ridden the wave, and others where I\u2019m back in the wave. I would like to get back to normal life sooner rather than later. It feels very endless.\u201d Dr Tracy Briggs, 42, clinical academic and geneticist at the University of Manchester \u201cI got symptoms on 13 March. We had been in London on holiday for half-term and rode the tube and went to museums. I felt short of breath. My chest was tight and my heart was racing. I have very mild asthma and I thought maybe it was an attack. It was strange. The inhaler didn\u2019t work and after a few hours I went to A&amp;E. I was told to go home and isolate. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to get out of bed or eat. I felt absolutely rough, sweaty, with a horrible sore throat and struggling to breathe. After 10 days I started to do a little bit more. I went for a walk with the family and pottered around the house. Then I seemed to step back and struggle again. Climbing one flight of stairs would send my heart racing. I would cough and be short of breath. \u201cIt has been such a rollercoaster. You start to question yourself and your own sanity. You wonder what tomorrow is going to be. It\u2019s quite tough. My 12-year-old son had no appetite for three weeks, a sore throat and vomiting. My husband had a sore throat for a week and a mild chicken pox-like rash. My stepson had Covid symptoms and was coughing, but not as badly as me.\u201d \u201cMy tongue and the back of the throat are red, white and inflamed. I\u2019ve lost quite a lot of weight. I find myself choking on food and short of breath when I eat. I\u2019ve been taking Gaviscon and today started on a course of proton pump inhibitors. I\u2019ve had a feeling of burning in my sternum and my throat. \u201cI felt hot and sweaty but didn\u2019t have a documented high temperature. I think there is a need to recognise that the clinical symptoms are much wider than cough and fever. This isn\u2019t necessarily something which lasts seven or 14 days. Absolutely acute patients are the priority. But we need to be aware that for a number of people, even those who don\u2019t need to go to hospital, it\u2019s going on for a long period. We need support.\u201d Jo Platt, 46, former Labour MP for Leigh \u201cI lost my seat in the December election. I wasn\u2019t going to work or down to London. The only thing I can think of is I picked up the virus while shopping. The first symptoms began on 24 March. It was like flicking a light switch. I was at my computer and felt I was going to faint. I had nausea, dizziness and a burning temperature. Then the fatigue set in. I couldn\u2019t move and went to bed for two days. \u201cI recovered and thought I had something really mild. For two more days I was shaky. The next day I really went down with it. I had shortness of breath, an unproductive cough. It felt like something was in my chest. I had a horrific headache. I could not get out of bed for a full week. By the Easter weekend I thought I was out of it. But that Monday the symptoms returned. I called my GP. They were very nice, but said you haven\u2019t got the usual symptoms and should rest. \u201cThe gastro thing is really worrying me. I lost a stone in weight and could not eat. My blood tests were normal apart from a vitamin D deficiency. I couldn\u2019t get a test. It\u2019s been a bit of a rollercoaster. The government says if you haven\u2019t got a cough or temperature or loss of taste it\u2019s not Covid. That\u2019s not true. My GP now says they\u2019ve had numerous cases similar to mine. \u201cThis is week 10. I get back pain, like an inflammation. It\u2019s not as severe as it\u2019s been. I have a really strange sensation in my legs, as if I\u2019ve been hill walking. I wake up with sore joints in my fingers. I\u2019ve had gastrointestinal issues and acid reflux. Seeing food on TV makes me feel nauseous. This is manageable. For me the scary thing is the shortness of breath. We still don\u2019t know how long this goes on for and that\u2019s the frightening bit. \u201cWe need a bottom-up approach. There are a lot of voices out there and we are not being listened to. More and more people are joining [\u2018long haul\u2019 covid] Facebook support groups. We have got a lot to say and want to get the message out to GPs and public health directors.\u201d Ginevra Read, 42, psychiatrist, Bristol \u201cIt started on 16 March. I had a slight cough and a terrible headache. The next morning my temperature was 38.3C. A week later, I was feeling worse and developed shortness of breath but it passed after a day or so. After another week I felt completely well. I went out for a short jog and felt fine. Normally I run 25km a week, swim and do yoga. But then later that week, after another short run, I was hit by extreme fatigue lasting four days. This happened another three to four times, after much less exertion. \u201cAround week seven there was a big deterioration. It was my son\u2019s birthday and I was busy, making him a cake, and we went on a short family bike ride too. A few days later, it all came back but much worse. I had lots of symptoms, including tingling on the right side of my body, and a sensation of heat on my left foot, as well as shortness of breath, chest pain and fevers. People talk about internal shaking. I had that and a feeling like my stomach was vibrating, deeply unpleasant and as if I was being poisoned. \u201cIt was very frightening to feel so unwell. Going into week nine I was exhausted. Staying in bed really helped with fatigue but in week 11, I still have low grade fevers, chills, malaise and odd neurological symptoms. I am resting a lot but my improvements have plateaued. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is causing prolonged Covid. Is it the ongoing initial illness, or is it an inflammatory reaction or is it a post-viral syndrome? We don\u2019t know what the prognosis is or what the long-term consequences are. I wonder how many people are having prolonged illness and what the impact is on the workforce, for example. It\u2019s scary to have an illness for which there isn\u2019t any treatment and that doesn\u2019t seem to be going away.\u201d",

The Surrender of Breda, a significant moment in the Dutch war of independence immortalised in Diego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s eponymous painting, was brought to life by a historical reenactment group to mark the 395th anniversary of the event, and the Spanish painter\u2019s 421st birthday \u2013 both on 5 June, albeit 26 years apart. It was staged a day after the anniversaries, outside the mid-16th-century house where Vel\u00e1zquez was born, and which is being turned into a learning centre and museum dedicated to the artist and his life. The recreation, which the house\u2019s owners hope will become an annual event, was slightly complicated by Spain\u2019s coronavirus restrictions. Enrique Bocanegra, the man behind the museum project, said: \u201cWe did it for the first time last year but we wanted to make it a bit bigger this year, with two horses and a little cannon.

He and others have already begun creating hi-tech copies of some of Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s best-known works \u2013 including An Old Woman Cooking Eggs, which sits in the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. But before the copies can be exhibited in the house where their creator was born, the property needs a thorough renovation. \u201cWe\u2019re just waiting for permission to start the restoration works and we\u2019re hoping to begin later this month,\u201d said Bocanegra. \u201cWe\u2019re going to start with the roof but the problem with renovating a 16th-century house is that it\u2019s like opening up a melon \u2013 you just never know what you\u2019re going to find inside.\u201d",

Merseyside police have said they have no objections to policing any matches in Liverpool during the pandemic and Anderson believes the derby should be contested at Goodison Park. \u201cWe are in a better place than we were four weeks ago and we\u2019ve been able to convey why it\u2019s so important nobody congregates outside or near grounds,\u201d the mayor told The Athletic. \u201cWe have had the opportunity since then to speak to fans and the clubs have done their part and got the message across that the supporters need to stay away. Both clubs have made it clear. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has made it clear. \u201cSo I would have no objection to the games being played at our clubs\u2019 home grounds, both the derby at Goodison and Liverpool\u2019s games at Anfield.\u201d Anderson did admit reports that the R rate had risen above one in the north-west were a concern. \u201cThe government only moved towards the relaxing of lockdown when the R rate dropped below one and the figures we\u2019ve got is that it has climbed back above that in our city now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is clearly a big concern \u2013 but if people abide by what we are asking them to do, the games should be all right \u2026 Merseyside police have made it clear they support the derby going ahead and they are the ones responsible for policing outside the ground and maintaining social distancing.\u201d If City do not lose against Arsenal, Liverpool could become champions by beating Everton and then Crystal Palace in their following match, at Anfield, on 24 June.",

On Saturday, an estimated 23,000 people, according to official figures, demonstrated in support of the BLM movement across France in defiance of a coronavirus ban on public meetings of more than 10 people. The public prosecutor\u2019s office is investigating a private Facebook group, which has 7,240 members, most of them serving police or gendarmes, for \u201cinsults of a racist nature\u201d and \u201cpublic provocation of racial hatred\u201d. The website StreetPress, which says it offers \u201copen, aware and engaged\u201d journalism, published the comments after reporting that it had infiltrated the FB group TN Rabiot Police Officiel.

<p>Dick said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d that a \u201cminority of protesters\u201d had been violent towards officers. The day\u2019s protests were mostly peaceful but there were disturbances \u2013 including fireworks being thrown at a police line \u2013 in the evening after many demonstrators had left.</p> \n  <p>She said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. The number of assaults is shocking and completely unacceptable.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. There is no place for violence in our city. Officers displayed extreme patience and professionalism throughout a long and difficult day, and I thank them for that.</p> \n   <p>\u201cI would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face this deadly virus.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T08:05:28.735Z\">at 9.05am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edc9a708f083999a26db7b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:48:15.429Z\">8.48am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the government continuing to ease lockdown measures despite studies suggesting the UK\u2019s coronavirus infection rate has grown to above 1 in some regions, Hancock said they took into account several models on infections through Sage. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat you shouldn\u2019t do is look at one particular report, and say that is the answer right across the board.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere are some areas where we think the R rate is a bit higher than elsewhere, including the north-west of England, and we\u2019ve got to make sure wherever our localised outbreaks are we absolutely tackle those working with local directors of public health,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p>He added that the government\u2019s coronavirus alert level remained at four\u2013 the second highest level \u2013 ahead of shops reopening on 15 June. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe proceed with caution, we proceed with safety first, making sure that as those shops do reopen that it is safe to do so.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:56:45.902Z\">at 8.56am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edc99ba8f0883ec2fc1c390\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-07T07:42:27.433Z\">8.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"243ac871-36eb-4cd2-908a-f2631b17baf7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3qZUG61PfWk?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Hancock also urged people not to gather in more than groups of more than six people to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, after thousands of people gathered for demonstrations in cities including London and Manchester yesterday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI support very strongly the argument is being made by those who are protesting for more equality and against discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules, precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cSo I would urge people to make their argument, and I will, I will support you in making that argument.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s a roundup of today\u2019s key UK coronavirus updates. The UK\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen by 77 \u2013 the lowest daily figure since the lockdown began. The official death toll of people who tested positive for Covid-19 across all settings now stands at 40,542, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Scotland and Northern Ireland have reported no new coronavirus deaths. However, the Scottish health secretary warned people that it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that more deaths would be recorded in the coming days, reiterating that there is often a lag in the registration of deaths over the weekend. Thousands of people have continued to attend anti-racism protests across the UK. In London, demonstrators gathered outside the US embassy before marching towards Downing Street. Protests also took place in cities including Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham. The Met police confirmed that 29 people had been arrested at protest in the capital yesterday. Protesters in Bristol have pulled down a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it in the River Avon. It happened after at least 5,000 people packed into the College Green area to hear from speakers and hold an eight-minute silence in memory of George Floyd, who was killed by police in the US. The nationwide lockdown \u201cshould have started earlier\u201d, according to a Sage expert. The epidemiologist professor John Edmunds said he believed the government\u2019s \u201csituational awareness\u201d in March would have made it difficult to impose measures sooner, but that the delay had \u201ccost a lot of lives\u201d. In response, Matt Hancock said he was \u201csure\u201d the decision to impose lockdown on 23 March had not cost lives. Hancock said the government had \u201cmade the right decisions at the right time\u201d, but said lockdowns could be reimposed locally or nationally if infections rose significantly. Thousands of protesters in London, who earlier gathered outside the US embassy, are now marching towards Downing Street. My colleague, Jason Rodrigues, captured the density of crowds outside the embassy in Battersea earlier. In case you missed it, health secretary Matt Hancock repeated calls this morning for people not to attend protests if physical distancing could not be observed. The statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston, which was pulled down by anti-racism protestors in Bristol earlier, has been dumped in the River Avon. It had been situated in the city\u2019s centre since 1895, and was subject to an 11,000-strong petition to have it removed. Videos of the event, which took place minutes ago, are now circulating on social media. Although many protestors are wearing masks and gloves, few are adhering to social distancing measures. Potential regional lockdowns are cause for \u201cserious concern\u201d as some council leaders fear they would be unenforceable, two city mayors have said. Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram have called for government assistance after new data suggested the coronavirus reproductive rate was around 1 in the north-west of England. In a joint statement on Sunday, they said the rise of the R value \u2013 the number of people an infected person passes the virus onto \u2013 was a \u201csignificant development\u201d and that a \u201cmuch more considered response\u201d to the pandemic was now needed. \u201cAt present, there is very little information available to local authorities on the Government\u2019s policy of \u2018local lockdowns\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cBut what we do know gives us cause for serious concern and in the view of some our local council leaders it is simply unenforceable.\u201d They added that if the Government was determined to proceed with the policy, it would be \u201cimperative\u201d that significant support was put in place for those affected. A further 77 people have died in the UK after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed. The official death toll across all settings \u2013 including hospitals \u2013 now stands at 40,542. Although there is usually a delay in the reporting of deaths over weekends, the latest figure is one of the lowest since the lockdown began. As of 9am today, 286,194 people in the country have tested positive for coronavirus. A total of 29 people were arrested during yesterday\u2019s anti-racism protests in London. The Metropolitan police said that \u201cwhile the majority of demonstrators were peaceful and left central London after the planned event\u201d a number had remained in Whitehall and became violent towards officers. The 29 arrests were for offences including violent public disorder, public order offences and assault on emergency service workers. A total of 14 officers were injured \u2013 two seriously. A female police officer who fell off her horse after hitting a traffic light remains in hospital in a stable condition after undergoing surgery. Supt Jo Edwards said: \u201cThe violent and hostile scenes officers faced yesterday were completely unacceptable. It is shocking that a number were attacked and injured. \u201cToday, officers are out across the capital preparing for another day of demonstrations. I want to be clear that violence towards them will not be tolerated.\u201d NHS England have announced that a further 72 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of hospital deaths in England to 27,430. Those who died included six people aged between 40 and 59, while 18 were between 60 and 79 and the remaining 48 people were aged 80 or above. The anti-racism protest in the capital, which started at 2pm outside the US embassy in Battersea, is on the move with demonstrators heading towards central London. My colleague, Mattha Busby, is live-tweeting from the scene. Crowds have also gathered in Manchester\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Square for a second day of protest. Earlier, many knelt in silence as a mark of respect for George Floyd, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck on 25 May. More than half of pregnant women recently admitted to UK hospital with coronavirus were from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, a new study has found. Peer-reviewed research, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at data for pregnant women admitted to 194 obstetric units in the UK who had tested positive for Covid-19 between March 1 and April 14. It found that of the 427 pregnant women in hospital during that period, 233 (56%) were from BAME backgrounds, of which 103 were Asian and 90 were black. The high proportion of pregnant women from BAME groups remained after excluding major urban centres from the analysis. Researchers, led by Professor Marian Knight from the Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, said the findings now require \u201curgent investigation and explanation\u201d. In Bristol, where thousands of people have marched through the city centre to protest against racism, protestors have pulled down a statue of the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston. A crowd of at least 5,000 people had earlier packed into the College Green are to hear from speakers and hold an eight-minute silence to represent the time George Floyd was filmed on the ground during an arrest in which a policeman knelt on his neck in Minneapolis. Although many protestors are wearing masks and gloves, the majority have been unable to adhere to the 2 metre social distancing guidance amid huge crowds in the city\u2019s narrow streets. Five more people have died after contracting Covid-19 in Wales, taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 1,398. Figures from Public Health Wales also showed there were 40 new recorded cases of the virus, taking the total number of infections to 14,396. The true number of coronavirus cases is likely to be higher as not everyone in Wales is tested, while most of the recorded deaths took place in hospitals. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has warned that \u201cwe can\u2019t read too much into a single day\u2019s figures\u201d after Scotland reported no deaths for the first time since lockdown began. \u201cWe know registration of deaths are relatively low at weekends,\u201d said Sturgeon. During the Scottish government\u2019s daily press conference, health secretary Jeane Freeman said it was \u201cvery likely\u201d that more deaths would be recorded in the next few days. The latest figures, released by the Scottish government on Sunday afternoon, show that a total of 2,415 patients have died in Scotland after testing positive for coronavirus, no change on Saturday\u2019s figure. A further 18 people have tested positive for Covid-19, taking the country\u2019s total infections to 15,621. A major teachers\u2019 union is warning local authorities in the north-west of England not to open schools in their areas without taking further precautions, after reports suggest the Covid-19 reproduction R rate in the region has risen above one and authorities in greater Manchester and Lancashire advised their schools not to reopen on Monday. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, said he has written to local authorities and mayors in Manchester, Oldham, Salford, St Helens, Stockport and Warrington to warn that the increase in the R rate \u201cposes unacceptable risks\u201d to the health and safety of staff and pupils. \u201cEmployers have statutory responsibilities to protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees at work and to minimise the risks to which employees are exposed. Given the reports that the R rate has now risen above one in the north-west, meaning that the virus may be growing again, the NASUWT believes these local authorities must fulfil their duty of care to staff and pupils by rethinking plans for the wider reopening of schools in their region. \u201cSome local authorities and employers in the region have already suggested that schools in their borough postpone the wider reopening of schools in response to the increase in the R rate. The NASUWT believes their neighbours should now do likewise,\u201d Roach said. \u201cIn the absence of new risk assessments being provided to the NASUWT and in the light of the increase in the R rate, the union must insist that these local authorities demonstrate how they intend to keep pupils and staff safe and if they cannot, they must pause their plans for the wider reopening of schools.\u201d Blackburn with Darwen council emailed schools on Friday evening, advising them not to reopen on Monday, while officials in Tameside, greater Manchester, advised schools to delay reopening until 22 June other than for vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers . Steve Rotherham, the Liverpool city mayor, tweetedon Sundaythat the rise of the R rate \u201cis a worrying development. It is a warning sign that must be taken seriously.\u201d Similarly, no new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland. Total deaths of those who tested positive for the virus in the country stands at 537, according to the Department of Health. There have been another six confirmed cases of Covid-19, bringing the total recorded since the outbreak began to 4,796. No new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Scotland for the first time since lockdown began, Scottish government figures show. A huge gathering is taking place outside the US embassy in South London as anti-racism protests continue across the UK. Peaceful demonstrators \u2013 the majority of whom are wearing face coverings \u2013 are taking part in chants including \u201cno justice, no peace\u201d while the road leading to the embassy in Nine Elms has been closed off. In Bristol, Black Lives Matter protestors have covered the city\u2019s controversial statue of slave trader Edward Colston with black fabric. British Airways has started legal proceedings against the government in its bid to overturn quarantine rules due to take effect in the UK from Monday. BA\u2019s owner IAG has sent a pre-action protocol letter setting out why it believes the moves, which will force air passengers arriving from abroad to self-isolate for 14 days, are illogical and unfair. Airlines and travel firms have protested in vain against the new Home Office-led regulations, which they have said come months late to stop the transmission of coronavirus and will kill off any nascent recovery in their industries. You can read the full report from our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham here: The government have announced a new support package for British overseas territories during the pandemic. It includes repurposed military oxygen machines and funding for testing facilities and will be available across 14 overseas territories. A 24/7 hotline to connect medics in the territories with global health experts will also be established. \u201cIn times of crisis, the UK family always stands together and our package of support for the overseas territories not only benefits communities in the fight against coronavirus, but also in the long term,\u201d said overseas territories minister Baroness Sugg. \u201cWhether that is helping them test for viruses, such as Zika and dengue, or supplying critical medical equipment to provide life-saving support to British people who live in some of the most remote locations in the world.\u201d Previously, tests had to be shipped overseas from territories including the Falkland Islands and Anguilla to be processed, including to the UK. It is hoped the new testing machines and extra medical equipment will enable health services to receive same-day results. The method of voting in the House of Commons last week resembled a \u201cGilbert and Sullivan farce rather than serious Westminster processes\u201d, Dame Margaret Hodge has said. Her comments come after MPs joined a 90-minute queue on Tuesday to vote to prevent the resumption of virtual voting. The senior Labour backbencher told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday: I think watching last week, it was a Gilbert and Sullivan farce rather than serious Westminster processes that were taking place. What\u2019s happening this week, which makes me so angry, [is] I\u2019m now allowed a vote but I can\u2019t take part in debates around legislation. \u201cSo tomorrow there is a debate on virtual access and I would like to virtually take part in that debate. I\u2019ve been told I can\u2019t do that so I am being disenfranchised and discriminated against in a debate which is discussing my disenfranchisement and my discrimination. It\u2019s just a nonsense.\u201d The Barking MP, 75, is currently shielding as she is in the age group that is most at risk from Covid-19. Thousands of people have also gathered for an anti-racism protest under Arthur\u2019s Seat in Edinburgh. Our Scotland editor, Severin Carrell, is on the scene speaking to demonstrators. Continued demonstrations are underway after the health secretary Matt Hancock said there is undoubtedly a risk there will be an increase in coronavirus cases as a result of the mass gatherings. I\u2019m Amy Walker, back from lunch, and ready to guide you through the afternoon\u2019s UK coronavirus updates. There are more Black Lives Matter protests today and at least one is already under way in Nottingham. Here\u2019s a roundup of the key UK coronavirus developments from this morning. The nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19 \u201cshould have happened earlier\u201d, according to a Sage expert. Epidemiologist professor John Edmunds said he thought the government\u2019s \u201csituational awareness\u201d would have made it difficult to impose the measures sooner, but that the delay \u201chas cost a lot of lives\u201d. In response, Matt Hancock said he was \u201csure\u201d the decision to lock down on 23 March had not cost lives. Speaking on BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Hancock said the government had \u201cmade the right decisions at the right time\u201d but said lockdowns could be reimposed locally or nationally if infections rise significantly. Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, has said she was \u201cshocked\u201d that a minority of people at an anti-racism protest in the capital had been violent towards officers yesterday. Shortly afterwards, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged those gathering at today\u2019s demonstration to \u201cdo so safely\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups has been deemed \u201castonishing\u201d by critics of a Public Health England review. The comments came after a PHE report confirmed the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME communities but did not mention air pollution. That\u2019s it from me, Amy Walker, for a short while. I\u2019ll be handing over to my colleague Haroon Siddique during lunchtime. The failure to consider air pollution as a factor in the higher rates of coronavirus deaths among minority ethnic groups is \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cwholly irresponsible\u201d, according to critics of a Public Health England review. The PHE report released on Tuesday confirmed the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on people from ethnic minorities but did not mention air pollution. Minorities in the UK, US and elsewhere are known to generally experience higher levels of air pollution, and there is growing evidence around the world linking exposure to dirty air exposure to increased coronavirus infections and deaths. Scientists said air pollution should \u201cabsolutely\u201d be considered and that it could have a double effect, with long-term exposure weakening lungs and hearts and short-term exposure potentially making viral infection more likely. You can read the full report from our environment editor, Damian Carrington, here: Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has cautioned that \u201cCovid-19 is still a very real threat\u201d and asked people to \u201cconsider ways of making your voice heard that doesn\u2019t put yourself and others at risk\u201d ahead of an anti-racism protest in the capital this afternoon. In a Twitter post, Khan said: Londoners of all ages, races and backgrounds joined millions of people around the world yesterday to come together peacefully. I stand with you. George Floyd\u2019s brutal killing must lead to immediate and lasting change everywhere. \u201cThe vast majority of protesters in London were peaceful. But this vital cause was badly let down by a tiny minority who turned violent. This is simply not acceptable, will not be tolerated and will not win the lasting and necessary change we desperately need to see.\u201d He urged those planning to protest today to \u201cdo so safely, peacefully and within the law\u201d as well as to use hand-sanitiser, wear a face covering and to keep 2 metres apart from others. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, and the Liverpool city region mayor, Steve Rotheram are holding a joint press conference following a report that suggested the R value had tipped above 1 in the north-west of England. Burnham has said the mayors were not \u201cconducting a blame exercise\u201d but believed the new data was linked to the loosening of lockdown measures. He also reemphasised his call for a regional mayor to sit on Cobra meetings, and said Greater Manchester was not in support of potential localised lockdowns because of the detrimental economic effects. On Friday, the report from scientists at Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge put R at 1.01 for the north-west and 1 for the south-west. The north-west \u2013 including Liverpool and Manchester \u2013 is viewed as particularly concerning due to higher numbers of infections there, which would be projected to continue at the current rate. Manchester Evening News\u2019 politics and investigations editor, Jennifer Williams, is posting live updates from the conference. You can follow her here: Single parents and workers from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have experienced the worst financial shocks as a result of the pandemic, analysis has revealed. Research by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex shows that the earnings of households across the UK have fallen, with lowest earners suffering disproportionately. Approaching half \u2013 44% - of non-BAME individuals whose working hours have declined during the crisis have been furloughed, while 7% have found themselves unemployed. By contrast, only 31% of BAME workers who have experienced a drop in the hours they are working have been furloughed, while more than 20% have lost their jobs. You can read the full report from Observer reporter Jamie Doward here: Protests against racial inequality in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd are to continue in the UK today, despite warnings that the mass gatherings posed \u201csome risk\u201d of new coronavirus infections. Demonstrators are set to gather at the US embassy at 2pm in London, while thousands of people are also expected at a Black Lives Matter march in Bristol at the same time. Events are also scheduled to take place in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Nottingham this afternoon. Earlier, health secretary Matt Hancock said British police were \u201cnot like\u201d their American counterparts after thousands of people protested in London yesterday. He told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI think the police did a fantastic job, and I\u2019m very proud of the British police for their professionalism, their restraint in the face of the tiny amount of violence \u2013 and I would stress it was a very small amount of violence \u2013 later on in the day. \u201cAnd I think that we can all be proud that the British police are not like the American police in this way and I think that\u2019s a very good thing.\u201d Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has said the government cannot remain silent on police brutality in the United States. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Nandy said she had \u201cno idea whether Donald Trump is a racist or not a racist\u201d, but believed his response to mass protests after the police killing of George Floyd was an \u201celection strategy\u201d. \u201cIn the run-up to the American elections, this is one of the ways that politicians try to activate their base,\u201d said Nandy. \u201cThey divide people in order to try to advance their own cause and that\u2019s actually one of the things that is so damaging about it. \u201cThat\u2019s crept into our politics in Britain in the last few years and we\u2019re seeing under the cover of Covid; other countries trying to do something similar \u2013 rowing back on people\u2019s freedoms, human rights, the rule of law, democracy.\u201d She added that she supported peaceful protesters against racism and police brutality in the UK, saying that demonstrations were \u201cone of the most important things about living in a free society\u201d. \u201cYou cannot be silent in the face of racism and police brutality, and I think those young people are right to raise their voices and to demand change,\u201d said Nandy. Matt Hancock has said he is sure that the government \u201cmade the right decisions at the right time\u201d on implementing the coronavirus lockdown. In response to Andrew Marr, who asked if the health secretary was \u201csure locking down when you did and not earlier did not cost lives\u201d, he said \u201cI\u2019m sure\u201d. \u201cAs I keep looking back on that period I\u2019m sure that taking into account everything that we knew at that moment, my view is that we made the right decisions at the right time,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cThere\u2019s a broad range on SAGE of scientific opinion and we were guided by the science which means guided by the balance of that opinion as expressed to ministers through the chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser. That\u2019s the right way for it to have been done.\u201d He added that the government would reimpose a lockdown nationally or locally if the rate of new infections increased significantly. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to do that, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re taking a cautious approach and a safety first approach.\u201d Although Hancock said the government had finished delivering coronavirus tests to all care homes yesterday, he admitted that this didn\u2019t mean all residents and carers had been tested. It comes as a new analysis suggests that care home residents are on course to make up more than half the deaths caused directly or indirectly by the coronavirus crisis in England. Hancock also dismissed as \u201cnot true\u201d comments by the UK statistics authority chairman Sir David Norgrove that testing figures are designed to show the largest possible number of tests. Epidemiologist professor John Edmunds, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), has said there is \u201csome risk\u201d of new infections of coronavirus as a result of anti-racism protests in the UK. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, Edmunds said that because around one in a thousand people were infectious, \u201cit is a risk to have thousands of people congregating together\u201d. He added that the fact that they were being staged outdoors, and many people were wearing face coverings, did reduce the risk of infection. Edmunds also said that the nationwide coronavirus lockdown \u201cshould have happened earlier\u201d to avoid the loss of many lives. I think it would have been hard to do it, I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March and our kind of situational awareness was really quite poor,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point but I wish we had - I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.\u201d He added that the epidemic \u201cwill end via herd immunity\u201d. \u201cVia vaccination is how we want it to be achieved, but that\u2019s how all epidemics come to an end. We\u2019ll be under these restrictions in some way until levels of immunity are such in the population that we don\u2019t have to take extra precautions to stop chains of transmission,\u201d he said. More from health secretary Matt Hancock, ahead of his appearance on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show this morning. He told Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday that the UK was \u201cwinning the battle\u201d against coronavirus, as more lockdown restrictions are set to be eased. \u201cSadly there are still people dying but the number of people dying each day is also falling, the number of people admitted to hospital is falling, the number of people in hospital is falling,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cWe are winning the battle against this disease and that allows us to release more of the restrictions \u2013 including putting in place this local action supported by the test and trace system. Seeking to push back on reports of a conflict between the government\u2019s need to get the recharge the economy and public health, Hancock said the \u201cworst thing\u201d for the economy would be a second spike in infections. He added: \u201cI care deeply about getting the economy going, and the best way to get the economy going is to ensure that we get the number of new infections right down.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some of today\u2019s newspapers, many of which lead with images from yesterday\u2019s huge protests against racism and police brutality. The Observer splashes on senior NHS figures urging the prime minister Boris Johnson to plan for a second wave of coronavirus infections. It also features a photograph of champion boxer Anthony Joshua joining Black Lives Matter protesters in his hometown of Watford. The Sunday Times leads on the prime minister signing off the continued easing of the coronavirus lockdown in order to avoid the possible loss of three million jobs. There\u2019s also a stark warning from the former chancellor Sajid Javid that rich Britons are more concerned with preserving their own advantages than with \u201cjustice and humanity\u201d. The Sunday Telegraph leads with a report on Boris Johnson ordering ministers to speed up the construction of new hospitals in order to rebuild the country in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, the Mail on Sunday splashes with an image of a policewoman who was knocked off her horse by a traffic light as officers charged at protesters in London yesterday. The government has reportedly warned parents that exams for secondary school pupils may be delayed again next summer. Exam regulator Ofqual has begun making contingency plans for next summer\u2019s exams as pupils attempt to regain months of lost learning, according to the Sunday Times. It is considering pushing exams from May to as late as July and continuing this year\u2019s emergency marking system. An Ofqual spokeswoman told PA Media that the regulator recognised pupils, parents and teachers were concerned about disruptions caused by the pandemic. She said: \u201cOur overriding aim is to ensure exams and assessments are as fair as possible and we are working closely with the Department for Education, exam boards and groups representing teachers, schools and colleges, to carefully consider a range of possible measures. \u201cWe will provide further information in the coming weeks.\u201d The report comes as more schools shelve plans to reopen on Monday after new data suggested coronavirus could still be spreading in the north-west of England. The commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Cressida Dick, has issued a statement in response to yesterday\u2019s anti-racism demonstration in London, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Dick said she was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d that a \u201cminority of protesters\u201d had been violent towards officers. The day\u2019s protests were mostly peaceful but there were disturbances \u2013 including fireworks being thrown at a police line \u2013 in the evening after many demonstrators had left. She said: I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening. This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. The number of assaults is shocking and completely unacceptable. \u201cI know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. There is no place for violence in our city. Officers displayed extreme patience and professionalism throughout a long and difficult day, and I thank them for that. \u201cI would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face this deadly virus.\u201d On the government continuing to ease lockdown measures despite studies suggesting the UK\u2019s coronavirus infection rate has grown to above 1 in some regions, Hancock said they took into account several models on infections through Sage. \u201cWhat you shouldn\u2019t do is look at one particular report, and say that is the answer right across the board. \u201cThere are some areas where we think the R rate is a bit higher than elsewhere, including the north-west of England, and we\u2019ve got to make sure wherever our localised outbreaks are we absolutely tackle those working with local directors of public health,\u201d he said. He added that the government\u2019s coronavirus alert level remained at four\u2013 the second highest level \u2013 ahead of shops reopening on 15 June. \u201cWe proceed with caution, we proceed with safety first, making sure that as those shops do reopen that it is safe to do so.\u201d Hancock also urged people not to gather in more than groups of more than six people to prevent the further spread of Covid-19, after thousands of people gathered for demonstrations in cities including London and Manchester yesterday. \u201cI support very strongly the argument is being made by those who are protesting for more equality and against discrimination,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules, precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus. \u201cSo I would urge people to make their argument, and I will, I will support you in making that argument. But please don\u2019t spread the virus, which has already done so much damage, and which we\u2019re starting to get under control.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, is on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday speaking about anti-racism demonstrations in the UK sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in the US. He starts of by saying he does not think Britain is racist, but that \u201cthere is injustice that needs to be tackled.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality and diversity and I think that we\u2019re one of the most tolerant and open societies in the world,\u201d said Hancock. \u201cThankfully, this is all based in response to events in America, rather than here, but we also must continue to drive here for tolerance and genuine quality of opportunity.\u201d When asked how many people in the cabinet are black, Hancock said there was \u201ca whole series of people from a BAME background\u201d and named the chancellor Rishi Sunak and home secretary Priti Patel. Good Morning. The prime minister has been urged to plan for a second wave of coronavirus infections by senior NHS figures, amid a drop in public confidence over his handling of the pandemic. Health chiefs have said there should be no further easing of lockdown measures before a comprehensive test and trace system has been proved to work, as they accuse the government of lacking a strategy and dodging an \u201chonest and open\u201d debate about Britain\u2019s plight. The latest figures from the Department of Health and Social Care show that another 204 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus as of 5pm on Friday, taking the official death toll to 40,465. This number does not include all deaths involving Covid-19 across the UK, which is thought to have passed 50,000. As suggestions emerge that the infection rate is increasing in some areas, including north-west England, health secretary Matt Hancock is likely to face difficult questions about the easing of lockdown when he appears on Sky News\u2019 Sophy Ridge on Sunday at 8.30am. Meanwhile, protests against police violence and systemic racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in the US are set to continue in cities including London, Bristol, Edinburgh and Nottingham today. Yesterday, thousands of people joined the anti-racism demonstrations across the country despite officials advising against mass gatherings due to Covid-19.

      "body": "<p>Charities providing emergency food supplies to people with a limited immigration status known as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d have expressed concern at the prime minister\u2019s refusal to offer support to a group pushed into destitution by the lockdown.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here but prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent; many face losing their homes once restrictions on evictions are lifted.</p> <p>In east London, volunteers have been feeding hundreds of families unable to buy food because work has dried up. Lakmini Shah, a Labour councillor in East Ham, where about 57% of the population were born outside the UK, has been distributing boxes of food and essential items donated by businesses to about local 40 families every week since the end of March.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a perception that immigrants come here to get benefits from the government and that\u2019s not true. These are people who have always worked but who lost their employment as soon as lockdown began, and that\u2019s when their difficulties began,\u201d Shah said, sorting boxes of pasta and rice in her front yard.</p> <p>\u201cMost people feel too embarrassed to talk about this and they don\u2019t know where to go for help. Everyone is worried about how they are going to pay the rent.\u201d</p> <p>MPs have attempted to push this issue on to the political agenda in the past fortnight.

      "bodyText": "Charities providing emergency food supplies to people with a limited immigration status known as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d have expressed concern at the prime minister\u2019s refusal to offer support to a group pushed into destitution by the lockdown. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here but prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent; many face losing their homes once restrictions on evictions are lifted. In east London, volunteers have been feeding hundreds of families unable to buy food because work has dried up. Lakmini Shah, a Labour councillor in East Ham, where about 57% of the population were born outside the UK, has been distributing boxes of food and essential items donated by businesses to about local 40 families every week since the end of March. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception that immigrants come here to get benefits from the government and that\u2019s not true. These are people who have always worked but who lost their employment as soon as lockdown began, and that\u2019s when their difficulties began,\u201d Shah said, sorting boxes of pasta and rice in her front yard. \u201cMost people feel too embarrassed to talk about this and they don\u2019t know where to go for help. Everyone is worried about how they are going to pay the rent.\u201d MPs have attempted to push this issue on to the political agenda in the past fortnight. During questions from the liaison committee 10 days ago, the prime minister appeared to be uncertain about the details of this status and promised to review the policy, saying: \u201cPeople who\u2019ve worked hard for this country who live and work here should have support of one kind or another.\u201d Informed about a Children\u2019s Society estimate that there are more than 100,000 children in this situation, with no safety net, he said: \u201cWe will see what we can do to help.\u201d However, asked again at prime minister\u2019s questions last week about the growing numbers of migrants who are living and working here lawfully, who have been pushed into extreme poverty because of having no recourse to public funds, Johnson appeared to have been briefed on the immigration category. He declared that \u201ceverybody knows\u201d that no recourse to public funds is a policy that applies to people who have temporary immigration status, adding: \u201cBut it is a term of art; it does not mean that they are necessarily excluded from all public funds.\u201d Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham who raised the issue with the prime minister last week, rejected this explanation. \u201cFor very many of those affected that\u2019s exactly what it means,\u201d he said, calling on the government to suspend the condition for the duration of the crisis, at least for families with children. He said: \u201cMany hard-working families in East Ham have leave to remain, but no recourse to public funds. They are suffering severe hardship as a result. I agree with the prime minister\u2019s point at the liaison committee, that people in this position \u201cshould have support of one kind or another\u201d. Ali and Noreen (who asked for their full names not to be printed, because they were nervous about complicating their immigration applications) moved to the UK from Pakistan 15 years ago, and were among those collecting emergency food supplies from Shah\u2019s yard to help feed their family. Ali has worked here and paid taxes since arriving, and until lockdown was running his own business assisting international students hoping to study in the UK. His work has dried up as international travel has come to a virtual halt, and he and his wife have been unable to pay rent and have found it difficult to buy food for their three teenage children. Visa renewals for a family of five cost about \u00a312,000, which must be paid every two-and-a-half years, until they are eligible to apply for British citizenship, after a process that lasts 10 years. Putting aside money for visa costs has meant that they have no savings and are struggling to pay rent on their one-bedroom flat. They will need to renew their visas again this October, and are wondering who they can borrow money from and which belongings they can sell to help meet the cost. Although landlords are prevented from evicting tenants during lockdown, the family have been told that they will face eviction later this summer if they are unable to make up their arrears. \u201cWe came here legally.

Charities supporting people with this immigration status say getting an exemption is extremely difficult because it requires individuals to prove that they are destitute.

My social media feeds are awash with posts of friends hugging, sharing lifts to McDonald\u2019s drive-throughs, and normalising flouting the rules. With data showing that the health risk to our age group is minimal, it seems many have taken this to mean they are safe. Yet aside from the risks for older or ill people around us, we have so much to lose; a longer lockdown means further disruption to our education, and it will be us who bear the brunt of a damaged economy.</p> <p>Seeing large groups of teenagers selfishly breaking guidelines is heartbreaking and massively hypocritical. Social media posts on protecting the NHS and outrage at the care home crisis seem like nothing more than overcompensating when the same friends suddenly become unconcerned when it suits their personal plans.</p> <p>I hate feeling like an outsider, and a judgmental one at that, among my peers, but I do not understand how an age group who can be so understanding about other social issues can act so selfishly on a matter as serious as this. <br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "As a 19-year-old, I am disappointed in my peers\u2019 attitude to lockdown. My social media feeds are awash with posts of friends hugging, sharing lifts to McDonald\u2019s drive-throughs, and normalising flouting the rules. With data showing that the health risk to our age group is minimal, it seems many have taken this to mean they are safe. Yet aside from the risks for older or ill people around us, we have so much to lose; a longer lockdown means further disruption to our education, and it will be us who bear the brunt of a damaged economy. Seeing large groups of teenagers selfishly breaking guidelines is heartbreaking and massively hypocritical. Social media posts on protecting the NHS and outrage at the care home crisis seem like nothing more than overcompensating when the same friends suddenly become unconcerned when it suits their personal plans. I hate feeling like an outsider, and a judgmental one at that, among my peers, but I do not understand how an age group who can be so understanding about other social issues can act so selfishly on a matter as serious as this.

What are the new restrictions on international arrivals and how will they be enforced?</p>\n    <p><b>How will arrivals be tracked?</b><br>Most people arriving in the UK will need to fill in an online form with contact and travel details and the address where they will be staying in quarantine for the next 14 days. Self-isolating people can shop for essentials such as food and medicine. Random checks will be carried out by Public Health England.</p>\n    <p><b>Who is exempt?</b><br>A large list of people, including anyone on government or defence business, foreign diplomats, regular international commuters, lorry drivers, medical workers and fruit pickers. By and large, the exemptions are international key workers.</p>\n    <p><b>How it will be enforced?</b><br>In England, fines start at \u00a3100 for not filling in the form, \u00a31,000 for breaching self-isolation and possible deportation for foreign nationals not complying. However, the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have yet to say if and how they will enforce the rules for any arrivals in their jurisdictions \u2013 an anomaly that IAG and others argue undermines the process.</p>\n    <p><b>Given people can\u2019t travel anyway, why do airlines and travel firms object?</b><br>Although lockdown rules prevent overnight stays in the UK, and the Foreign Office has warned against all non-essential foreign travel, signs of progress had led airlines to plan more flights over the next two months, after grounding fleets in March. Holiday firms hoped people would start booking trips. They argue that imposing the rules so late in the pandemic is ineffective, illogical, and will deter visitors and potential outward bookings long after the quarantine rules are lifted.</p>\n    <p><b>Why does the government say they are necessary?</b><br>The government says the measures are backed by science and will help prevent a second wave of Covid-19 cases imported from abroad, as other countries move out of lockdown, with restrictions on work and movement potentially eased further in the UK in coming weeks.</p>\n    <p><b>Have other countries imposed similar quarantine measures?</b><br>Yes, many either ensured arrivals self-isolated or closed borders to foreign visitors. However, Britain decided against doing so early in the crisis and is now bringing in quarantine just as other EU countries are in the process of opening up.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The letter, the first step in an application for judicial review, was sent on Friday.

The director general of Border Force, Paul Lincoln, said officials were \u201cprepared and ready for the new measures which are being enacted at the UK border today\u201d. The quarantine row comes amid further uproar over BA\u2019s plans to sack about 12,000 staff and lower the terms and conditions of remaining employees. The pilots union Balpa told members on Saturday the airline had increased the number of pilot redundancies it was seeking by another 125 to almost 1,300, more than a quarter of the workforce. It warned that BA had said it would \u201cforce changes by terminating the employment of all pilots and offering individuals new contracts with associated new terms and conditions\u201d if they could not find agreement. The airline appears to have made concessions on a possible voluntary redundancy scheme, which it initially ruled out, saying it would pay only the statutory minimum to longserving staff. BA may also start furloughing senior pilots from the grounded A380 and 747 fleets, who had agreed to effectively halve their pay by taking unpaid leave at the start of the crisis to allow for a possible quick return to flying. The flag carrier\u2019s actions have been condemned by ministers and unions. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, which represents cabin crew, said: \u201cBA and its owners IAG can afford to see out this crisis without such drastic cuts.

The extraordinary cruelty of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\" title=\"\">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p> <p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston\" title=\"\">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <p>But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/01/family-of-david-dungay-who-died-in-custody-express-solidarity-with-family-of-george-floyd\" title=\"\">David Dungay</a>, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/26/deportation-escorts-training-safter-restraint-methods-jimmy-mubenga\" title=\"\">Jimmy Mubenga</a> as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat.</p> <p>\u201cThe UK is not innocent,\u201d read one placard at a London protest, invoking both its present and past. Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/11/lets-end-delusion-britain-abolished-slavery\" title=\"\">prefers to remember</a> its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day.</p> <p>BAME people <a href=\"https://www.inquest.org.uk/bame-deaths-in-police-custody\" title=\"\">die disproportionately</a> as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\" title=\"\">Windrush scandal</a>, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-race-and-criminal-justice-inequality-is-unfair-to-all\" title=\"\">Lammy report</a>, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\" title=\"\">to die of Covid-19</a>. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal.</p> <p>It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/03/met-police-twice-as-likely-to-fine-black-people-over-lockdown-breaches-research\" title=\"\">twice as likely to be fined</a> for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people.</p> <p>To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.</p>",

But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests. But though they honour the African American experience, they also recognise the commonality of black struggles elsewhere, and more broadly the fight for human rights. The words \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d are chillingly familiar. In Australia, they evoke the death of David Dungay, an Indigenous man who uttered those words 12 times as he was restrained by prison guards. In Britain, they were cried out by Jimmy Mubenga as security guards pinned the deportee to his plane seat. \u201cThe UK is not innocent,\u201d read one placard at a London protest, invoking both its present and past. Britain prefers to remember its abolition of the slave trade to its role in industrialising slavery. It finished paying the bill for reparations to slave owners only five years ago. Many people still see empire as a conduit for the spread of cricket and railways. A broader curriculum, which is surely needed, would reveal it as a system of exploitation and white supremacy, with repercussions felt to this day. BAME people die disproportionately as a result of the use of force or restraint by police, but not one officer has been convicted of manslaughter or murder in decades. Protesters in the UK have highlighted the shooting of Mark Duggan, the Metropolitan police\u2019s growing use of stop-and-search, the Windrush scandal, the disproportionate exclusion of black boys from schools and the failure to act on the Lammy report, which highlighted glaring disparities in the criminal justice system. But they have also raised the impact of austerity, the Grenfell fire and the fact that BAME people are so much more likely to die of Covid-19. Racism is structural, and state neglect can be as deadly as state abuse. It does not always take a knee on the neck to kill someone. Poverty, overcrowding, and unequal access to healthcare can be fatal. It is the increased threat from coronavirus which has driven many to the streets. Though protesters have largely been assiduous in their use of face masks and hand gel, there is a real danger that these gatherings will spread infection. Subsequent self-isolation by participants would help to reduce the risks. But when Dominic Cummings got a free pass for his drive to Durham, the leader of the house has forced MPs to return to a crowded chamber, and the government is ignoring warnings that lockdown is being relaxed too quickly, they must not be scapegoated for any rise in infections. Already, black people in London are twice as likely to be fined for breaching coronavirus regulations as white people. To say that black lives matter is not only to demand that they are not stolen, but to insist that they are truly valued. No one expects this to be realised overnight; but nor are they willing to wait. The breadth of the protests is testament to what has gone wrong, but also a promise that change is possible. The protests are black-led but multiracial, showing the growing breadth of support. As in the US, white people are seeking to be allies. Other people of colour are identifying with black experience, while recognising that they too may benefit from racial hierarchies, and may themselves discriminate. Mistakes will be made. But progress can and must be made, too.",

      "bodyText": "Tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday \u2013 including one where a statue of a slave trader was pulled down \u2013 after a week in which growing numbers defied calls from politicians and police to avoid mass gatherings to rally against racial injustice. In London, thousands gathered outside the US embassy in south London in solidarity with demonstrators in the United States, where protests against police violence and systemic racism sparked by the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis continued into a second weekend. Later, an anti-racism protest was held at Parliament Square in Westminster. Among those present was the rapper Stormzy. He did not speak, but listened as speakers talked about the struggle for equality. The statue of Winston Churchill in the square was graffitied with a line spray painted through the wartime prime minister\u2019s name and \u201cis a racist\u201d written below. Around 8pm there were clashes on Whitehall between police and a small crowd of protesters throwing objects including bottles and traffic cones. There were tussles as police held back demonstrators near the Foreign Office. Shortly after 11pm, the Metropolitan police said there had been 12 arrests and eight officers had been injured. Warwickshire police said the southbound carriage of the M6 was closed for an hour from 6pm while pedestrian protesters blocked it at junction 3 before they \u201cheaded into Coventry at junction 2\u201d. On Sunday evening, Boris Johnson tweeted: \u201cPeople have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery \u2013 and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account.\u201d Earlier, in Bristol, protesters at a rally attended by tens of thousands cheered as they pulled down a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston before pushing the bronze into the harbour. The home secretary, Priti Patel, called the action \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d, saying it detracted from the message of peaceful protesters. The Avon and Somerset police superintendent, Andy Bennett, thanked organisers for their efforts to encourage demonstrators to follow government guidance, and said the majority had protested peacefully. But he added that officers had launched an investigation to identify the protesters who had pulled down the statue. In London, crowds gathered at the US embassy in Vauxhall soon after 2pm, in a peaceful assembly of predominantly young demonstrators from all ethnic backgrounds. People chanted \u201cGeorge Floyd\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace, no racist police\u201d and directed ire at the prime minister, before marching to Westminster, while officers looked on. Many carried posters listing the names of black victims of police violence in Britain over the past 40 years or more, with one young black man asking, \u201cAm I next?\u201d Daniel Oderinde, 23, said he had never seen protests like these in the UK before, where \u201cwhite people and black come together in support of the struggles that we\u2019ve been going through. If I can share that message and we can come together as one, then I can be part of something monumental.\u201d In Edinburgh and Glasgow, demonstrations were lively but peaceful, with many in the crowds wearing masks on the advice of organisers. In Scotland\u2019s capital, hundreds of protesters spread up the hill leading to Arthur\u2019s Seat, while scores of motorists \u2013 many with Black Lives Matter placards in their car windows \u2013 sounded their horns in support. The police kept a low profile, with only a handful of officers visible around the edges of the demonstration. The pop singer Lewis Capaldi was pictured with the protesters. Faith and Niall Dewar, a mixed-race couple sitting with their daughter, Hazel, on a hill overlooking the demonstration, said they had debated whether to join the protest because of the physical distancing regulations. But the park was large enough to avoid close contact with other demonstrators and the protest was vital. \u201cIt needs to be seen,\u201d said Niall. Thousands on the streets of Manchester knelt in protest at worldwide racial inequality, while former footballer Rio Ferdinand, his wife, Kate, and his three children joined the crowds. In Nottingham, people gathered at the Forest Recreation Ground, chanting, \u201cEnough is enough\u201d, and held placards carrying slogans such as \u201cI stand on the shoulders of our ancestors\u201d and \u201cStop killing us\u201d. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said there was \u201ca better way\u201d for Black Lives Matter protesters to express their feelings, as thousands of people across Wales gathered to rally against racism. Northern Irish police said they had issued \u201ca significant number\u201d of fines on Saturday following gatherings. There were demonstrations big and small in towns and cities throughout the UK: in Cardiff, Sheffield and Newcastle, in Carlisle and Dumfries, in Derby, in Chester, Wolverhampton, Middlesborough, Lytham, and Wrexham among others. Many more people took part in virtual protests. Black Lives Matter London said thousands had joined an online protest to show their support on Sunday, in which rapper and poet George the Poet, the MAMA Youth Project, Dope Black Dads and BLM UK gave speeches interspersed with live streams of the London BLM protest. BLM said 22,000 people from across the world used Zoom, Facebook Live and Instagram to take part in the online rally. Apollo Sankara of BLM London said of the protests: \u201cThis isn\u2019t just a moment, this is a movement.\u201d It was the second day of mass protests across the UK, after thousands gathered on Saturday to call for the end of institutional racism, and observe a minute\u2019s silence on one knee to commemorate black people killed by police in the UK. After a day of largely peaceful protest, including speeches in London\u2019s Parliament Square, there were skirmishes in the early evening when a small number of protesters threw bottles and flares at police, and officers on horseback advanced on protesters at about 6pm. One officer was taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries after her horse panicked and hit a traffic light. A total of 29 arrests were made on Saturday.

The health secretary, Matt Hancock, earlier urged protesters not to gather, saying that, with an estimated one in 1,000 people being infectious with the coronavirus, the protests risked spreading the disease.

It\u2019s a great way of improving your contact base and being really time efficient, and just getting to speak to a lot of clubs.\u201d</p> <p>The summit was the latest to be held under the auspices of the online player trading platform Transfer Room, which allows clubs to make transfer and loan deals online. The message to those clubs from Jonas Ankersen, its founder and chief executive, is seductive: they can take back control when it comes to transfers. The pitch seems to be working: more than 500 clubs are involved, paying a monthly subscription of \u00a3165 to \u00a32,500 depending on whether they are League Two level or in the Champions League.</p> <p>The site lets clubs see which players are available and to gather information by direct message \u2013 without the often tortuous and expensive process of going through agents and intermediaries. The first deal on the platform was for \u00a33m in 2017, between two Championship clubs, and Ankersen is expecting well over 100 more this summer.</p> <p>\u201cThe big benefit is that some deals can go faster,\u201d says the Dynamo Dresden sports director, Kristian Walter, who described the site as a \u201cquiet revolution\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to contact three, four or five agents. You can go straight to the club. If I need a player and I don\u2019t have direct contact with the club the agent has the power. He will say: \u2018I will try to work on the deal but I need this and this.\u2019 You cannot save the agent fee in the end, but the contact between the clubs will save some money.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email</figcaption> </figure>  <p>You cannot blame them, either.

At Feyenoord we have 300 people \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to tell them you have had to reduce your income, only to then buy this player and that player. For me it is very important to re\u2011sign the players that are out of contract. If we can do that we will be strong. But we will probably only bring in two or three loan players, because we can\u2019t spend a lot of money.\u201d</p> <p>Arnesen, who was previously at Tottenham and Chelsea, raised another pertinent point. \u201cEveryone is hoping things will be back to normal in a year\u2019s time but it will be interesting to see how long it will take for football to recover,\u201d he says. \u201cOwners of many clubs own big companies and a lot of them will have lost money. Sponsorship, tickets and TV income is not there any more at the same level. So maybe it will be longer than everyone thinks.\u201d</p> <p>But Ivan Kepcija, the sporting director of Hajduk Split, says the disruption may help smarter clubs with less money to progress up the pyramid quicker than they otherwise may have done. \u201cWe hope the big leagues will continue spending as planned because from them it trickles down to clubs like ours,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if the owner of a top club is financially hit in his personal business that may well affect his team. So you might see some powerhouses going down, some mid-level clubs emerging to be in the top standings.</p> <p>\u201cYou will maybe see clubs that have good recruitment practices and are savvy, and have worked on the markets, improved as a result. It will be a big transition for some and this will be an opportunity for smaller clubs to rise up.\u201d</p> <p>The Rangers sporting director, Ross Wilson, says it is too early to make predictions. \u201cWe are in such an uncertain place, the only thing we can guarantee is that things will be different. Transfer fees, wages and agents\u2019 fees will go down \u2013 we can see that already. It is a very different market place than it was four months ago.\u201d</p> <p>Walter hopes the events of the past few months will make football\u2019s powerbrokers reset the relationship with supporters and reassess the game\u2019s place in wider society.</p> <p>\u201cThe corona pandemic is a good chance for all the clubs to focus on what football really is,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it has become more a business: about money, money, money. That is OK to an extent but some of the financial payments almost now come from another universe. A player can be transferred to a country for \u20ac200m but in that same city there are people that cannot even buy food.

Asked whether he thought the UK was racist, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t, but I do think there\u2019s injustice that needs to be tackled and I\u2019ve spent my political life fighting for equality.\u201d</p> \n<p>Priti Patel, the home secretary, also called on police to investigate the \u201cutterly disgraceful\u201d toppling of Colston\u2019s statue, adding: \u201cSheer vandalism and disorder is completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Sunday evening<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1269724206440370178\"> Boris Johnson tweeted</a> that the Black Lives Matter protests had been \u201csubverted by thuggery \u2013 and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve\u201d.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the prime minister repeated the phrase \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d in the House of Commons, but ministers warned people not to protest because of the risk of spreading coronavirus.

In this historical, critical time, to deal with the enormous challenges, our first step must be honesty and then action.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut if there\u2019s a denial of the very problem, then you can\u2019t act. I would welcome&nbsp;a direct conversation with the secretary of state [Hancock],&nbsp;because I\u2019m 100% convinced that he knows there are deep-seated racial inequalities in this country that we have to fix. So we can put the \u2013 what he may see as \u2013 emotive language aside and get on with closing the disparities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Zubaida Haque, interim director of the Runnymede Trust, the race equality thinktank, said: \u201cI think Matt Hancock\u2019s comments are deliberately trying to deflect responsibility from public institutions and government with regards to the extent to which they have discriminated against and held back black and ethnic minority communities.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cEvery member of the public will be thinking, \u2018I\u2019m not racist he\u2019s right\u2019,&nbsp;but actually the accusation of Black Lives Matter protest is not about the public, it is about the police, it is about the criminal justice system. It is about education and it\u2019s about the government.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the public that are detaining and deporting black and ethnic minority people. It\u2019s not the public that are&nbsp;stopping and searching black young people 10 times more than white young people.\u201d</p> \n<p>As the government came under fire over its response, Sajid Javid, the Conservative MP and former chancellor, said the government had to do more to address racial inequality in society. Writing in the Sunday Times, Javid \u2013 who also previously served as home secretary \u2013 said the UK must not pretend that it does not have substantial obstacles to overcome in regard to integration and opportunity.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are still parts of society that are more concerned about the status quo than justice and humanity,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>He said racism could occur anywhere in the world, and that new ambition was needed to break down barriers in Britain.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government can and must do more to address racial inequalities in our society,\u201d&nbsp;Javid&nbsp;went on.&nbsp;\u201cAs with all large-scale, systematic challenges, only the prime minister is capable of driving real change, and I know he cares deeply.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>However, he later agreed with Patel about the Colston statue.

The Argentinian psychoanalyst was 16 and pregnant when she was kidnapped in mid-1977 by the military dictatorship. Careaga was tortured but survived. Her mother, Esther de Careaga, a close friend of Jorge Bergoglio, the Jesuit who would later become Pope Francis, was herself kidnapped and murdered by the regime. The relentlessly rising death toll from police violence and the instinctive resort to military force by a demagogic US president fills her with alarm. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is very dangerous in a way similar to the dictatorships we had to endure in South America,\u201d Careaga, who is co-director of the Instituto Espacio Memoria dedicated to the memory of victims, warned. \u201cTrump is shielding himself behind religious symbols while trying to seduce people to vote for him in the name of freedom, when it is precisely their freedom that leaders like him plan to abolish.\u201d Miriam Lewin is one of only around 150 survivors of the ESMA death camp, where some 5,000 people were murdered over the seven years of the dictatorship. \u201cI think Americans are not aware, or don\u2019t have the experience, to realise what it means for the military to be out on the streets in charge of domestic security,\u201d Lewin said. \u201cIn Latin America, unfortunately, we do have a lot of experience with how that can lead to an authoritarian regime irrespective of the fact that Trump was democratically elected.\u201d The events of the past week in America have had reverberations around the world. For years, part of the daily work of the US state department was to issue denunciations of police brutality, suppression of dissent, and instability in far-flung corners of the globe. In recent days it has been the other way round. Friendly nations have expressed concern, less friendly governments have revelled in Washington\u2019s discomfort. In South Africa, where there have also been sporadic demonstrations, the ruling African National Congress party called for calm in the US. \u201cWe are convinced that America \u2013 a beacon of freedom for many worldwide \u2013 has the ability to directly focus on healing and peace and achieve an outcome that prioritises respect for and promotion of fundamental freedoms for all Americans,\u201d Naledi Pandor, the country\u2019s international relations minister, said. The Nelson Mandela Foundation was less restrained, arguing that systemic violence towards black Americans could justify a violent response. \u201cWhen communities are confronted by both resilient structural violence and attacks on their bodies, violent responses will occur,\u201d the foundation said in a statement. Among those most delighted about the scenes being played out in US cities are governments with the worst human rights records, which have been the most criticised over the decades by the US.

Many Brazilians fear Bolsonaro \u2013 who is facing mounting public anger over Brazil\u2019s political, economic and public health crises \u2013 could use Trump\u2019s actions to help justify a crackdown of his own. \u201cTrump\u2019s discourse over the protests in the US is a really significant stimulus for Bolsonaro.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on 8 June 2020.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Mathias Cormann has been told to listen to First Nations people after describing Australian Black Lives Matter protests as</strong>&nbsp;<strong>reckless, selfish and self-indulgent.</strong> The finance minister attacked protesters demanding an end to Indigenous deaths in custody, saying they posed an unacceptable risk to the community due to Covid-19. The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said it&nbsp;was the responsibility of elected leaders to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/australian-black-lives-matter-protests-incredibly-selfish-mathias-cormann-says\">\u201clisten to the cries\u201d of people protesting against institutional racism and deaths in custody</a>. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has warned that protests could generate a new cluster of Covid-19 infections and urged participants to get tested if they developed any symptoms.&nbsp; Kelly said: \u201cBlack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling.\u201d&nbsp;Meanwhile, the US attorney general, William Barr, has denied that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/07/george-floyd-protests-anti-racism-demonstrations-donald-trump-black-lives-matter-live-updates?page=with:block-5edd03818f083999a26dbab3#block-5edd03818f083999a26dbab3\">US police are systemically racist</a>. </p> \n<p><strong>A 14-year-old boy who was allegedly driving a stolen vehicle that crashed, killing four other teenagers, in suburban Townsville has been charged. </strong>Two girls and two boys, believed to be aged between 14 and 18, died at the scene early on Sunday morning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/08/boy-14-charged-over-townsville-crash-that-killed-three-teenagers\">Police say the car was on the wrong side of the road</a> when it clipped a roundabout, rolled and struck a light pole. \u201cAt no stage did the police pursue that vehicle or try to intercept that vehicle,\u201d Superintendent Assistant District Officer Glen Pointing told reporters.</p> \n<p><strong>Labor says the government\u2019s homebuilder scheme and other coronavirus stimulus measures need greater scrutiny by parliament. </strong>Last week the government announced it would&nbsp;fund grants worth $25,000&nbsp;for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/07/government-stimulus-measures-should-be-subject-to-scrutiny-labor-says\">with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on 8 June 2020. Top stories Mathias Cormann has been told to listen to First Nations people after describing Australian Black Lives Matter protests as reckless, selfish and self-indulgent. The finance minister attacked protesters demanding an end to Indigenous deaths in custody, saying they posed an unacceptable risk to the community due to Covid-19. The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, said it was the responsibility of elected leaders to \u201clisten to the cries\u201d of people protesting against institutional racism and deaths in custody. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has warned that protests could generate a new cluster of Covid-19 infections and urged participants to get tested if they developed any symptoms. Kelly said: \u201cBlack lives do matter, all lives matter. I absolutely understand the depth of feeling.\u201d Meanwhile, the US attorney general, William Barr, has denied that US police are systemically racist. A 14-year-old boy who was allegedly driving a stolen vehicle that crashed, killing four other teenagers, in suburban Townsville has been charged. Two girls and two boys, believed to be aged between 14 and 18, died at the scene early on Sunday morning. Police say the car was on the wrong side of the road when it clipped a roundabout, rolled and struck a light pole. \u201cAt no stage did the police pursue that vehicle or try to intercept that vehicle,\u201d Superintendent Assistant District Officer Glen Pointing told reporters. Labor says the government\u2019s homebuilder scheme and other coronavirus stimulus measures need greater scrutiny by parliament. Last week the government announced it would fund grants worth $25,000 for eligible singles and couples planning to build or renovate homes between June and the end of December, with the uncapped program estimated to cost taxpayers $688m. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, said: \u201cParliament should be having a say in the way in which stimulus is rolled out.\u201d Civil society groups have argued that the $688m would have been better spent building social housing. A professional services firm, Ernst &amp; Young, has found that stimulus programs backing clean energy would create nearly three times as many jobs for every dollar spent on fossil fuel developments. Australia Tony Abbott, Marcia Langton and Michael Clarke are among the Australians recognised in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours. Abbott was made a Companion of the Order of Australia due to \u201csignificant contributions to trade, border control, and to the Indigenous community\u201d. Labor\u2019s deputy leader, Richard Marles, says Australia must help Hong Kong residents who are living in fear of China\u2019s security crackdown. Marles told the ABC on Sunday if the UK put out a call for assistance, \u201cI actually think that that is a call that we need to take very seriously\u201d. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has asked Australia and other partners to consider \u201cburden-sharing if we see a mass exodus from Hong Kong\u201d. Hundreds of private images of Australian female journalists and celebrities have been posted without consent on a sexist internet forum. Female journalists say they feel \u201cviolated\u201d by the forum, which has been posting personal images and lewd comments about women in the Australian media industry for more than a decade. . The world Black Lives Matter protesters in the UK city of Bristol have toppled a statue of a slave trader, Edward Colston. The 18ft bronze statue, erected in 1895, has long been a focal point for anger about the city\u2019s role in the slave trade. The German suspect in the Madeleine McCann case has been linked to the disappearance of two more children. The father of a six-year-old German boy who vanished in Portugal in 1996 now hopes to finally learn what happened to his son. Brazil\u2019s far-right government has stopped releasing coronavirus data and wiped an official site clean of swaths of data. Health ministry insiders said the president, Jair Bolsonaro, ordered the move, which was met with widespread outrage. The omission of the effects of air pollution and race on a review of Covid-19 by Public Health England has been described as \u201castonishing\u201d. Minorities are known to experience higher levels of air pollution, and there is growing evidence linking exposure to dirty air to increased coronavirus infections and deaths. Recommended reads James Clark is the owner, editor, journalist, photographer and advertising salesman of the outback newspaper the Warrego Watchman. \u201cWhen you sit down to write the stories, you feel the locals peering over your shoulder,\u201d he says of his work at a newspaper that informs the town of Cunnamulla, Queensland, population 1,140. Clark says he writes 20 stories a week, earning less than a cadet reporter, but refuses to shut down his printing press. With News Corp closing more than 100 regional titles, the Watchman now covers an area larger than the UK \u2013 it\u2019s the only local paper for 500km in any direction. \u201cI just do feel duty-bound to keep it going because there\u2019d be nobody out here doing those stories,\u201d Clark said. \u201cThe day I chuck it in and decide to go and get a real job, no one is going to be keeping an eye on these places.\u201d. Guardian Australia\u2019s political editor, Katharine Murphy, argues that Australia does not need to import divisive leadership strategies from overseas.

With international students representing more than a quarter of all students and paying high fees, what does the future look like for universities? In today\u2019s Full Story podcast, we examine the value of these jobs by talking to one of the people to lose university work. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

      "body": "<p><strong>What&nbsp;was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>Mikel Arteta\u2019s positive test <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/mikel-arteta-tests-positive-coronavirus-arsenal-head-coach-premier-league\">for Covid-19 late on 12 March</a> led a rapidly-unfolding series of events that brought the league to halt hours later. We will never know just how consequential that was to wider public health; for their part, Arsenal were already on red alert after several players had been forced to self-isolate, causing their match at Manchester City the previous day to be postponed. Casting this as the latest twist in a turbulent season seems slightly tawdry, but Arsenal were already at the point where one wondered what on earth could come next.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/unai-emery-arsenal-couldnt-protect-me-truth-is-i-felt-alone\">Unai Emery: 'Arsenal couldn\u2019t protect me.

The appointment of Arteta struck a more positive note and results, if not always performances, improved markedly. Before the shutdown an eight-game unbeaten run in the league had sparked hope of a late salvage operation for the European spots. But the manner of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/27/arsenal-olympiakos-europa-league-match-report\">Europa League exit</a> to a mediocre Olympiakos was a reminder that, in keeping with everything about their past 12 months, all bets are off regarding what happens next.</p> <p><strong>What about now? </strong>Arteta\u2019s case of coronavirus was, thankfully, mild and he was soon back to work. In some ways the hiatus has been a blessing: Arsenal played 15 games in the two and a half months since his arrival and there had been scant time to communicate his ideas at length. Players were given instruction on footballing and cultural matters, individually and collectively, before training restarted and Arteta spoke of the need to \u201chave a big reflection on all the departments we have across the club\u201d. As long as Lucas Torreira and Kieran Tierney have an uneventful next 10 days, Calum Chambers should be the only long-term injury when football restarts. But uncertainty lingers. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka are yet to be tied to new contracts, while Arsenal will hope they will not need to request further financial sacrifices of their squad after a 12.5% pay cut was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/17/arsenal-first-team-players-set-to-agree-125-salary-cuts-in-next-48-hours\">uneasily agreed</a> by the majority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Fiver\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? </strong>There is no dancing around it: the stakes could be no higher for Arsenal in the next 10 games. If qualification for the Europa League, at the barest minimum, was imperative before the ravages of Covid-19 it is hard to overstate how problematic a failure would be now. A \u00a3230m wage bill is, with or without the agreed cuts, impossible to sustain if they fall short and there will be further issues if the 2020-21 season proceeds without crowds; matchday revenues were \u00a396m during 2018-19. There is a reason for Arteta\u2019s admission that there are \u201cone, two, three different scenarios\u201d for which he must plan ahead. So picking up where they left off is a must, and what a boost it would be if they can claim an early scalp at the Etihad. By March Arsenal were finding ways to win tight games and that knack simply must continue across the summer. The shape of their medium-term future depends on it.</p> <p><strong>Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? </strong>There have been some exasperating lapses. David Luiz, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, Granit Xhaka and Alexandre Lacazette were all censured for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/23/arsenal-david-luiz-lacazette-pepe-and-xhaka-ignore-coronavirus-rules-physical-distancing\">violating social distancing rules</a> in April and Lacazette, whose long-term position looks distinctly uncertain, was spoken to by the club last month after appearing to be videoed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/17/alexandre-lacazette-in-hot-water-with-arsenal-after-balloon-stunt\">inhaling nitrous oxide</a>.</p> <p><strong>Any unsung/community heroes? </strong>Arsenal\u2019s work in Islington continues to do them enormous credit. As soon as lockdown was imposed they made sizeable donations to local charities and offered a range of assistance to schools, youngsters and NHS staff. They have helped to deliver 15 tonnes of emergency coronavirus supplies, including 30,000 meals, throughout the borough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f767e413b058b7f150a17754908e1cc0b46e4f08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f767e413b058b7f150a17754908e1cc0b46e4f08/0_320_3766_2648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang back in training at the end of May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"703\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang back in training at the end of May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Key player in the run-in? </strong>There is no question. If Aubameyang is firing then Arsenal always have a chance. He has rediscovered the love under Arteta, who is cautiously optimistic about talking him into a new deal. A crucial late miss against Olympiakos cut deep but was mainly noticeable for its rarity.</p> <p><strong>End-of-season-prediction</strong>&nbsp;Sixth place and Europa League qualification, maybe with an FA Cup win thrown in. But will that be enough to head off the vultures circling around Aubameyang, Saka and more of their young stars?</p> <p><strong>Remaining fixtures (all times BST): Weds 17 June </strong>Manchester

      "bodyText": "What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? Mikel Arteta\u2019s positive test for Covid-19 late on 12 March led a rapidly-unfolding series of events that brought the league to halt hours later. We will never know just how consequential that was to wider public health; for their part, Arsenal were already on red alert after several players had been forced to self-isolate, causing their match at Manchester City the previous day to be postponed. Casting this as the latest twist in a turbulent season seems slightly tawdry, but Arsenal were already at the point where one wondered what on earth could come next. A campaign that began with Mesut \u00d6zil and Sead Kolasinac\u2019s carjacking had continued with the messy demise of Unai Emery\u2019s tenure and the extraordinary Granit Xhaka fallout. The appointment of Arteta struck a more positive note and results, if not always performances, improved markedly. Before the shutdown an eight-game unbeaten run in the league had sparked hope of a late salvage operation for the European spots. But the manner of their Europa League exit to a mediocre Olympiakos was a reminder that, in keeping with everything about their past 12 months, all bets are off regarding what happens next. What about now? Arteta\u2019s case of coronavirus was, thankfully, mild and he was soon back to work. In some ways the hiatus has been a blessing: Arsenal played 15 games in the two and a half months since his arrival and there had been scant time to communicate his ideas at length. Players were given instruction on footballing and cultural matters, individually and collectively, before training restarted and Arteta spoke of the need to \u201chave a big reflection on all the departments we have across the club\u201d. As long as Lucas Torreira and Kieran Tierney have an uneventful next 10 days, Calum Chambers should be the only long-term injury when football restarts. But uncertainty lingers. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka are yet to be tied to new contracts, while Arsenal will hope they will not need to request further financial sacrifices of their squad after a 12.5% pay cut was uneasily agreed by the majority. What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? There is no dancing around it: the stakes could be no higher for Arsenal in the next 10 games. If qualification for the Europa League, at the barest minimum, was imperative before the ravages of Covid-19 it is hard to overstate how problematic a failure would be now. A \u00a3230m wage bill is, with or without the agreed cuts, impossible to sustain if they fall short and there will be further issues if the 2020-21 season proceeds without crowds; matchday revenues were \u00a396m during 2018-19. There is a reason for Arteta\u2019s admission that there are \u201cone, two, three different scenarios\u201d for which he must plan ahead. So picking up where they left off is a must, and what a boost it would be if they can claim an early scalp at the Etihad. By March Arsenal were finding ways to win tight games and that knack simply must continue across the summer. The shape of their medium-term future depends on it. Have players and staff behaved during lockdown? There have been some exasperating lapses. David Luiz, Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, Granit Xhaka and Alexandre Lacazette were all censured for violating social distancing rules in April and Lacazette, whose long-term position looks distinctly uncertain, was spoken to by the club last month after appearing to be videoed inhaling nitrous oxide. Any unsung/community heroes? Arsenal\u2019s work in Islington continues to do them enormous credit. As soon as lockdown was imposed they made sizeable donations to local charities and offered a range of assistance to schools, youngsters and NHS staff. They have helped to deliver 15 tonnes of emergency coronavirus supplies, including 30,000 meals, throughout the borough. Key player in the run-in? There is no question. If Aubameyang is firing then Arsenal always have a chance. He has rediscovered the love under Arteta, who is cautiously optimistic about talking him into a new deal. A crucial late miss against Olympiakos cut deep but was mainly noticeable for its rarity. End-of-season-prediction Sixth place and Europa League qualification, maybe with an FA Cup win thrown in. But will that be enough to head off the vultures circling around Aubameyang, Saka and more of their young stars?

private firms and medical associations ahead of a probable scenario where public hospitals run out of critical care beds. <br></p> \n  <p>Providers will be able to charge a daily fee of up to 16,000 rand ($950) for Covid-19 patients that get treated in critical care beds in private hospitals, <strong>Anban Pillay</strong>, the health ministry\u2019s deputy director-general for national health insurance, told Reuters. <br></p> \n  <p>The fee includes the cost of using the bed, paying a team of specialists to treat the patient and additional services including pathology and radiology. <br><br> Estimates vary widely as to how many critical care beds there are in the country. A ministry presentation in April put the total at around 3,300, with two-thirds of those in the private sector, while Healthcare provider Netcare estimates there are some 6,000 beds, with around 3,800 in private hospitals. <br></p> \n  <p>South Africa had recorded 45,973 coronavirus cases as of Saturday, the most in Africa, with the number rising more steeply in recent weeks. <br></p> \n </div>

The National Campaign for the Arts\u2019 Arts Index survey, compiled in association with the Creative Industries Federation (CIF) and King\u2019s College London, reveals that public funding for the arts per head of population fell by 35% since 2008, with local government investment decreasing by 43%. As well as the drops in public funding and local government money, the report found that business sponsorship of the arts is down 39% since 2013, which it says equates to \u201ctens of millions of pounds\u201d disappearing from the arts economy. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, known coronavirus deaths worldwide currently number 401,564. The sombre milestone comes as cases approach 7 million, with 6,973,195 currently confirmed.

In the UK, a campaign for a new investigation into Dominic Cummings over alleged breaches of the lockdown rules has been launched by lawyers with the backing of health workers and some families of coronavirus victims. Read Matthew Weaver\u2019s report here. Some 25,000 jobs could be under threat at London\u2019s Heathrow Airport, its chief executive has warned, as new quarantine measures for international arrivals come into force. Passengers arriving in the UK from Monday will need to self-isolate for 14 days under the latest government measure to reduce the spread of coronavirus. There has been widespread concern that this will cause huge damage to the travel and aviation sectors as they recover from pandemic. Speaking to the City AM podcast, The City View, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye said he was now having to consider job cuts at the west London airport. \u201c76,000 people are employed at Heathrow,\u201d he said. \u201cThat represents one-in-four households in the local community, so if we start cutting jobs on mass that has a devastating impact on local communities, including the Prime Minister\u2019s own constituency, which is only a few miles from the airport. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard already from the airlines is that they are cutting around a third of all employees, so that would be 25,000 people out of work. That would be a devastating blow to west London and the Thames Valley.\u201d Chile revised its death toll linked to the coronavirus outbreak sharply higher on Sunday, adding deaths from databases that previously had not been included. Health minister Jaime Ma\u00f1alich said 653 additional deaths linked to Covid-19 had to be counted, bringing the total number to 2,290. That included 96 new deaths announced in the Sunday daily report. Chile has one of the highest numbers of cases in Latin America, which has become an epicentre of the pandemic even as countries worldwide have begun to reopen. Brazil, Peru and Mexico have also been hard hit by the virus. Ma\u00f1alich said that databases on deceased persons certified by the civil registry had been reviewed and along with information from laboratories doing PCR tests for the virus had been consolidated into a single list. Ma\u00f1alich added that death certificate information would now be included if \u201cin any way, directly or indirectly, it may be linked to Covid-19 as a cause associated with death.\u201d Chile had reported 134,150 confirmed cases of the coronavirus as of Sunday, health ministry data showed. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has said Black Lives Matter demonstrations have been subverted by \u201cthuggery\u201d, and those responsible will be held to account. This comes as tens of thousands of people attended protests across the UK on Sunday, after a week in which growing numbers defied calls from politicians and police to avoid mass gatherings to rally against racial injustice. Poland has recorded 575 new cases. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Poland has increased by 575 and reached 26,561, the ministry of health announced on Sunday. Four more people have died, bringing the death toll to 1,157. US death toll is approaching 110,000, according to the CDC. The centre reported 1,920,904 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 29,214 cases from its previous count, and said Covid-19 deaths in the US had risen by 709 to 109,901. India has recorded nearly 10,000 new cases. India on Sunday registered 9,971 new coronavirus cases, taking the country\u2019s tally to 246,628 cases, with 6,929 deaths. The case numbers lags behind only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain. The country is preparing to reopen malls, restaurants, hotels and places of worship on Monday. France has registered 13 new deaths. The country\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 13 on Sunday to reach 29,155, while the number of confirmed cases increased by 343 to 153,977. The number of people in hospital and ICU has continued to decline. Canada has reported 722 new cases. Canada has confirmed 722 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total to 95,057. The country has recorded 70 deaths, taking the death toll to 7,773, the Public Health Agency announced \u2013 an increase of 0.9%. Italy has reported 197 new cases, with the majority concentrated in the Lombardy region. The country has reported 53 Covid-19 deaths, against 72 the previous day, and 197 new cases, down from 270 the day before, the Civil Protection department said. Lombardy accounted for 125 of the 197 new cases reported despite making up just 16% of Italy\u2019s population. Saudi Arabia has passed 100,000 confirmed cases. The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has passed 100,000, according to official figures. The ministry of health reported 3,045 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 101,914, the BBC reports. No new coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland or Scotland for first time since lockdown. No new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland or Scotland for the first time since lockdown began. In Northern Ireland, the total deaths of those who tested positive for the virus stands at 537, while the number is 2,415 in Scotland. However, the Scottish health secretary cautioned it was \u201cvery likely\u201d deaths would be registered in upcoming days, as there is often a delay in the recording of deaths over the weekend. A US senator has accused China of slowing down vaccine efforts. The Republican senator Rick Scott has claimed the US has evidence China is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a Covid-19 vaccine by Western countries. He declined to give details of the evidence, saying it had come through the intelligence community. Gym owners and trainers in several Indian cities held protests over the weekend demanding the re-opening of fitness centres as many other lockdown restrictions are set to ease. As of Monday, shopping malls, restaurants, hotels and places of worship will be allowed to re-open, over 10 weeks after a nationwide shutdown was imposed in late March. Gyms, however, will remain shut. The lockdown\u2019s relaxation comes as India records a rising number of new daily virus cases. The South Asian country has reported almost 250,000 cases so far including nearly 7,000 deaths. \u201cWe are running in losses for last three months and there is no clarity when the government plans to open the gyms,\u201d Amritsar Gym Owners Association\u2019s president, Dharminder Verma, told AFP on Sunday. Gym owners were still paying rent and staff salaries despite being shut, Verma said. Similar protests were held in neighbouring Ludhiana district on Saturday, where topless bodybuilders did push-ups and flexed their pumped-up muscles. The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Poland has increased by 575 and reached 26,561, the ministry of health announced on Sunday. Four more people have died, bringing the death toll to 1,157, local sources report. This follows 576 new infections on Saturday - the highest daily level since the start of the pandemic - and 16 deaths. The spike is being linked to outbreaks in coal mines in the southern region of Silesia. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday reported 1,920,904 cases of the coronavirus, an increase of 29,214 cases from its previous count, and said Covid-19 deaths in the US had risen by 709 to 109,901. The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by individual states. UK charities providing emergency food supplies to people with a limited immigration status known as \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d have expressed concern at the prime minister\u2019s refusal to offer support to a group pushed into destitution by the lockdown, Amelia Gentleman reports. Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the UK have an immigration status that allows them to work here but prevents them from accessing most benefits should they become unemployed. Many have lost their jobs because of the Covid-19 pandemic and are struggling to feed their families and pay rent; many face losing their homes once restrictions on evictions are lifted. France\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 13 on Sunday to reach 29,155. The number of confirmed cases has increased by 343 to 153,977, while the number of people in hospital has fallen by 18 to 12,461. There has also been a decrease of six in the number of people in ICU, down to 1,053. You can reach me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti, or by email with any tips, feedback or suggestions for coverage. Cheers. \u201cThe word most often used is \u2018unprecedented\u2019,\u201d Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and clinical psychoanalyst in London says, \u201cand it looks increasingly likely that the long-term consequences will also be unprecedented in scale. Given that mental health services have been starved of resources for years, one can only imagine the impact that a deep recession will have on an already beleaguered sector. So there is a lot of concern among health care professionals like myself about what will happen next.\u201d Liberia will open its international airport and hotels on 21 June, the government has said. President George Weah announced that the state of emergency that was declared in April will not be renewed. Restrictions such as a night-time curfew would remain in place, though it would start later, according to the statement released on Friday. There were fears that the west African nation of some 4.8 million people would struggle to handle a large outbreak. The country was badly hit during the 2014-16 Ebola crisis, which killed more than 4,800 people in the country. However, it has so far recorded only 334 coronavirus cases and 30 deaths from coronavirus. Canada has confirmed 722 new coronavirus cases, bringing its total to 95,057. The country has recorded 70 deaths, taking the death toll to 7,773, the Public Health Agency announced \u2013 an increase of 0.9%. Canada\u2019s 10 provinces have all started to reopen their economies and relax restrictions on social gatherings. Italy has reported 53 Covid-19 deaths, against 72 the previous day, and 197 new cases, down from 270 the day before, the Civil Protection department said. The total death toll now stands at 33,899, the agency said, the fourth highest in the world after those of the US, the UK and Brazil. The number of current infections fell to 35,262 from 35,877 the day before. There were 287 people in intensive care on Sunday, down from 293 on Saturday, maintaining a long-running decline. The northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak was first identified, remains by far the worst affected region, accounting for 125 of the 197 new cases reported on Sunday. Lombardy accounts for just 16% of Italy\u2019s population. The agency said some 2.627 million people had been tested for the virus as of Saturday, against 2.599 million on Saturday, out of a population of around 60 million. Here\u2019s an analysis from Reuters as the number of confirmed cases in the US approaches 2 million: The coronavirus has killed more than 110,000 people in the United States, according to a Reuters tally on Sunday. About 1,000 Americans have died on average each day so far in June, down from a peak of 2,000 a day in April, according to the tally of state and county data on Covid-19 deaths. Total US coronavirus cases are approaching 2 million, the highest in the world followed by Brazil with about 672,000 cases and Russia with about 467,000. Several southern U.S. states reported sharp increases in Covid-19 infections, with Alabama, South Carolina and Virginia all seeing new cases rise 35% or more in the week ended 31 May compared with the prior week. Globally, coronavirus cases are approaching 7 million with about 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began. Of the 20 most severely affected countries, the US ranks eighth based on deaths per capita, according to a Reuters tally. The US has 3.3 fatalities per 10,000 people. Belgium is first with eight deaths per 10,000, followed by the UK, Spain, Italy and Sweden. The EU is preparing to reveal a series of measures to better combat child sexual abuse following an increase in online demand for child abuse images during the coronavirus lockdowns, an EU commissioner has said. Ylva Johansson, the EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, told Germany\u2019s Die Welt daily that she wanted to lead \u201ca more efficient fight\u201d against the scourge of child abuse, including through closer cooperation with social media companies. \u201cSince the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the demand for material showing the sexual abuse of children has risen by 30% in some member states,\u201d she said. The new plan, which Johansson said would be presented \u201csoon\u201d, would include the creation of a new EU centre to help member states \u201cinvestigate, prevent and combat child sex abuse\u201d and facilitate cross-border information sharing. She also called for tougher action against perpetrators. \u201cWe need prevention strategies but we can\u2019t rely on that alone,\u201d Johansson said. \u201cWe also need to enforce our laws when they are broken and show that our values prevail, both on the internet and in real life.\u201d The internet is \u201csadly a decisive factor\u201d for potential perpetrators looking for victims, she added, underscoring that more cooperation with internet companies was needed. Ireland\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen by one to 1,679, according to PA media. An additional 25 cases have also been confirmed, bringing the country\u2019s total to 25,201, the Irish Times reports. Saudi Arabia has passed 100,000 confirmed cases. The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has passed 100,000, according to official figures. The ministry of health reported 3,045 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 101,914, the BBC reports. No new coronavirus deaths in Northern Ireland or Scotland for first time since lockdown. No new coronavirus deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland or Scotland for the first time since lockdown began. In Northern Ireland, the total deaths of those who tested positive for the virus stands at 537, while the number is 2,415 in Scotland. However, the Scottish health secretary warned it was \u201cvery likely\u201d deaths would be registered in upcoming days, as there is often a delay in the recording of deaths over the weekend. Philippines death toll has passed 1,000. The Philippines reported nine more fatalities from coronavirus on Sunday, taking its total death toll to 1,003. The country also recorded 555 more infections, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 21,895, the department of health said in a bulletin. A US senator has accused China of slowing down vaccine efforts. The Republican senator Rick Scott has claimed the US has evidence China is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a Covid-19 vaccine by Western countries. He declined to give details of the evidence, saying it had come through the intelligence community. Infections in Afghanistan have climbed above 20,000. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Afghanistan stands at 20,342, after the country recorded its biggest daily rise in the number of deaths from Covid-19 on Sunday. The health ministry has detected 791 new cases from 1,427 tests, according to the latest update. Rock fans in Thailand watched their favourite bands play via video-conferencing platform Zoom on Sunday as a live music festival went online, Reuters reports. Public gatherings have been banned in Thailand since mid-March as part of the country\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, but Sunday\u2019s six-hour-long show gave people a chance to see and interact with artists from a distance. \u201cMy favourite band hasn\u2019t had a live performance during the lockdown, so being able to see them today will make me happy,\u201d 21-year old Siriyagorn Aimchomchid told Reuters. Some music fans gathered in small groups - allowed under the country\u2019s restrictions - to watch the event, for which about 3,000 tickets were sold at 499 baht ($15.84) each. \u201cA virtual music festival allows audiences and artists to interact, and they can sing along and talk to each other,\u201d said Samkwan Tonsompong, managing director of festival organiser What The Duck Music. \u201cI think this is closer than being at an actual concert.\u201d But Sirinapa Darathum, a 15-year-old student who was watching with three friends, said the online format did not compare to the excitement of a live gig. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m watching artists close up on the screen, I am still far apart from them because we are in different locations,\u201d Hello, I\u2019ll be running the live blog for the next few hours. If you have any tips or feedback, please do message me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti or drop me an email. I won\u2019t always be able to reply but will read them all. Thanks in advance! Iran\u2019s spike in new infections is due to increased testing, the health ministry said on Sunday. The government appeared to have brought the virus under control a month ago, but a second wave of the virus has steadily been gathering pace. \u201cThe main reason for rising numbers is that we started identifying [people] with no or light symptoms,\u201d said the health ministry\u2019s head epidemiologist Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya. There have been 171,789 confirmed cases in Iran, and the country\u2019s death toll stands at 8,281, according to Johns Hopkins tracker. For those not directly affected, the ability to breathe more easily and see further has perhaps been the greatest consolation amid the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic. As city after city begins to emerge from lockdown, urban planners and environmental campaigners are grappling with how to keep the clean air and blue skies that have transformed our view of the world. \u201cCitizens around the world can see change is possible,\u201d says Zoe Chafe, an air quality specialist with the C40 group of global megacities. \u201cJust put yourself on the rooftop and imagine seeing mountains for the first time, and thinking how amazing it feels to realise this is possible.\u201d That rooftop could be in Kathmandu (where residents were astonished to make out Mount Everest for the first time in decades), Manila (where the Sierra Madre became visible again) or dozens of other cities across the world. Not everywhere has seen air quality improvements in recent months. In some Asian cities, such as Hanoi and Jakarta, pollution has become worse. But, for the most part, people across the world are experiencing a healthier alternative to the smoke and smog that are responsible for an estimated 3 million deaths a year. The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has passed 100,000, according to official figures. The ministry of health reported 3,045 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 101,914, the BBC reports. The number of new daily cases exceeded 3,000 for the first time on Saturday. The official number of deaths from the virus is 712, according to the Sunday figures. For the first time since 20 March the country has reported zero deaths of people with Covid-19. Scotland\u2019s official death toll stays at 2,415, but adding suspected cases the most up-to-date figure is 3,964, STV News reports. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, urged people to digest the news with caution. \u201cWe can\u2019t read too much into a single day\u2019s figures \u2013 and we know registration of deaths are relatively low at weekends \u2013 but nevertheless this is a headline we\u2019ve all longed to see,\u201d Sturgeon tweeted. Singapore won\u2019t return to the open and connected global economy that existed before the island nation went into a partial lockdown two months ago, Bloomberg reports. Singaporeans will have to prepare for a different, tougher future with rising unemployment as companies work to cope with slowing demand and movement restrictions from various governments, prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a televised address on Sunday. Loong hinted that the city state might distance itself from its previously open, globalist approach that helped it become a hub for trade, investment and the financial market. \u201cCountries will have less stake in each other\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one.\u201d The Philippines reported nine more fatalities from coronavirus on Sunday, taking its total death toll to 1,003. The south-east Asian country also recorded 555 more infections, bringing its total number of confirmed cases to 21,895, the department of health said in a bulletin, according to Reuters. The city of New Delhi on Sunday ordered many of its hospital beds to be reserved solely for residents of the Indian capital, as the number of Covid-19 infections continued to rise, Reuters reports. India on Sunday registered 9,971 new coronavirus cases, taking the country\u2019s tally to 246,628 cases, with 6,929 deaths. The case numbers lags behind only the US, Brazil, Russia, UK and Spain. New Delhi city alone has registered more than 10% of the country\u2019s infection cases, making it the third worst-affected part of the country after the western state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital Mumbai, and southern Tamil Nadu state. \u201cDelhi is in big trouble \u2026 corona cases are rising rapidly,\u201d state chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video message on Twitter, where he announced that private and city government-run hospitals will be reserved for Delhi residents. \u201cIf we open Delhi hospitals for patients from all over, where will Delhi residents go when they get infected with coronavirus?\u201d Typically about 60-70% of patients admitted to hospitals in Delhi are people traveling from other states to get treatment as the city\u2019s hospitals. A Delhi government coronavirus mobile app showed the city of more than 20 million people had 8,049 Covid-19 beds, but more than half were already occupied. Of the 60 hospitals, 11 had no beds available, the app showed on Sunday. The Delhi city government has issued an order saying hospitals must admit every patient from the city with coronavirus symptoms, following complaints from some people on social media that people were being refused treatment. Malta reluctantly allowed 425 migrants held offshore for more than a month to disembark on Sunday after a group of them threatened to kidnap the crew of the chartered boats where they were being held, authorities said, according to Reuters. Prime minister Robert Abela said the government had been forced to act after the crew of one of the boats called him directly for help. \u201cThey gave us half an hour to act or they would kidnap the crew,\u201d he said in a televised interview. He said authorities decided against boarding the vessel by force and subduing the migrants after the military warned of the risk of injury to migrants and service personnel. State-broadcaster TVM said the vessel was escorted to Valletta harbour by two army patrol boats. Malta\u2019s government started putting rescued migrants on chartered tourist boats at the end of April after insisting that Malta\u2019s harbours were closed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. AstraZeneca has approached its rival Gilead Sciences about a potential merger, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. Any merger, which would be the biggest healthcare deal on record, would bring together two of the companies leading the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s efforts to develop a vaccine and treatments for Covid-19. A combination of the two would be valued at about \u00a3200bn. AstraZeneca, which is valued at \u00a3110bn, recently overtook Royal Dutch Shell to become the UK\u2019s largest company by market value. Gilead was valued at about $96bn (\u00a374bn) at Friday night\u2019s closing price. Pope Francis has warned Italians to not let their guard down against coronavirus, now that infection rates have fallen, and urged them to obey government rules on social distancing and the wearing of masks. Francis, addressing several hundred people in St. Peter\u2019s Square for his Sunday blessing, reacted to applause that broke out when he said their presence, albeit reduced, was a sign that Italy had overcome the acute phase of the pandemic. \u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t cry victory too soon,\u201d he cautioned them, departing from his prepared text, Reuters reports. Nearly 34,000 people have died in Italy from the coronavirus, the fourth highest toll in the world after the United States, Britain and Brazil. The number of daily deaths in Italy has fallen from nearly 1,000 several months ago to 72 on Saturday. Italy entered the latest phase of an easing of restriction on 3 June, when people were allowed to travel between regions again. However, some Italians, particularly young people, have flouted remaining rules on social distancing and wearing masks in public places. Authorities have warned of the danger of a second wave. \u201cWe still have to follow the rules,\u201d Francis said. \u201cThank God, we are leaving the worst part, but always by obeying the rules that the authorities have stipulated,\u201d he said. Istanbul residents flocked to the city\u2019s shores and parks on the first weekend with no coronavirus lockdown measures in place since 10 April, prompting a reprimand from the country\u2019s health minister who warned that the pandemic still poses a threat, the Associated Press reports. Images on social media and in the news media showed crowds picnicking and partying Saturday night without heeding social distancing or wearing masks. Health minister Fahrettin Koca urged people to wear masks and keep their distance. Restaurants, cafes, gyms, parks, beaches and museums began reopening Monday and domestic flights resumed. Turkey has reported 4,669 deaths from Covid-19 and 169,218 confirmed infection cases. A decision by the Interior Ministry to continue a weekend curfew in 15 provinces, including Istanbul, was overturned Friday by president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In a series of tweets, the president said he was reversing the decision on grounds that it would lead to different negative social and economic consequences. Turkey opted for short weekend and holiday curfews during the pandemic instead of a total lockdown, fearing the negative effects on its already troubled economy. People aged 65 and older and minors are still barred from leaving their homes except for allotted times during the week. While sports around the world are emerging from coronavirus lockdowns with televised competitions, horseracing resumed in Beirut this week with no audience at all, Reuters reports. Eight races went ahead on Thursday at the city\u2019s Hippodrome with fans unable to watch or bet. For general director Nabil Nasrallah, it marked a new low point in a dramatic history since the track hosted monarchs and movie stars in the 1960s. The grandstand was destroyed in fighting when Israel occupied Beirut in 1982 and stood on the frontline between warring factions during the country\u2019s 15-year civil war. The really tough times began late last year, when Lebanon\u2019s currency began to slide, hiking prices and pushing many into poverty, Nasrallah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lived through a lot \u2026 and this is the toughest time,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we\u2019re fighting to keep going.\u201d The jockeys had to wear masks and were sanitised before entering the track, which had closed for more than two months. Lebanon, which has recorded 29 deaths from Covid-19, is now gradually lifting movement restrictions, allowing businesses to open at lower capacity and with safety guidelines. Britain\u2019s failure to impose a nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of the coronavirus sooner has cost many lives, one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers said on Sunday. Britain is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, with a death toll that is estimated to top 50,000 already. Critics from a broad spectrum including medical professionals, scientists, and lawmakers, say the government has botched its response to the outbreak by being too slow in imposing crucial measures such as the lockdown and protecting the elderly in care homes. Despite reservations from some of its own scientific advisers, the government is now easing nationwide lockdown measures that were introduced on 23 March. John Edmunds, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), told the BBC: \u201cWe should have gone into lockdown earlier.\u201d While the World Health Organization has signalled that Latin America is the new centre of the pandemic, cases in Cuba have fallen for two months. My colleague Ed Augustin reports from Havana. The South African government has struck a deal with private hospitals and medical practitioners, on whom it will have to rely in the treatment of severely ill Covid-19 patients if public hospitals run out of space. The government has been in talks for months with private firms and medical associations ahead of a probable scenario where public hospitals run out of critical care beds. Providers will be able to charge a daily fee of up to 16,000 rand ($950) for Covid-19 patients that get treated in critical care beds in private hospitals, Anban Pillay, the health ministry\u2019s deputy director-general for national health insurance, told Reuters. The fee includes the cost of using the bed, paying a team of specialists to treat the patient and additional services including pathology and radiology. Estimates vary widely as to how many critical care beds there are in the country. A ministry presentation in April put the total at around 3,300, with two-thirds of those in the private sector, while Healthcare provider Netcare estimates there are some 6,000 beds, with around 3,800 in private hospitals. South Africa had recorded 45,973 coronavirus cases as of Saturday, the most in Africa, with the number rising more steeply in recent weeks. Anti-racism protests attended by thousands of people in London and other major British cities \u201cundoubtedly\u201d risk causing an increase in the number of Covid-19 cases again, the British health minister Matt Hancock said on Sunday. Thousands of people attended protests on Saturday to voice their anger at police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, ignoring restrictions that forbid gatherings of more than six people outside. Asked during an interview on Sky News whether the number attending protests made an increase in infections more likely, Hancock said: \u201cIt is undoubtedly a risk.\u201d \u201cI support very strongly the argument that is being made by those who are protesting \u2026 but the virus itself doesn\u2019t discriminate and gathering in large groups is temporarily against the rules precisely because it increases the risk of the spread of this virus,\u201d he said. John Edmunds, a member of the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said that while the risk of spreading the virus is lower outside, the current estimate is that around one in 1,000 people in the country are infectious. \u201cIf you have a crowd of a few thousand people then you would expect some of those people to be infectious \u2026 so it is a risk to have thousands of people congregating together,\u201d he told the BBC. With further protests planned for Sunday, London police chief Cressida Dick urged protesters to \u201cfind another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London\u201d due to the coronavirus risk. Kim Willsher in Paris The French government has announced it intends to increase the fine for littering from \u20ac68 to \u20ac135, after complaints from street cleaners that people are throwing masks, gloves and tissues possibly contaminated with Covid-19 on to the streets. A bill is expected to be presented to the lower house, the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, in the next 10 days as part of a clam down on littering and dumping, including throwing cigarette ends into the streets, another headache in French cities. The move comes as the government is under pressure to ease restrictions further across the country ahead of the end of its three-week progressive deconfinement programme, after the country\u2019s scientific advisory committee announced the epidemic is \u201cunder control\u201d in France. France has introduced measures to deal with the pandemic in three-week blocks, the next of which ends on 21 June. Prof Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Delfraissy, who heads the scientific committee, said there was a low circulation of the virus but advised the authorities to use the respite time to \u201cprepare different state structures for an eventual return of the epidemic\u201d. Specialists cannot agree on the likelihood of a coronavirus \u201csecond wave\u201d. On Saturday, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles opened to the public for the first time in 82 days; about 70% of the ch\u00e2teau\u2019s revenue comes from visitor ticket sales, but 80% of the visitors are tourists and France\u2019s borders remain closed except for essential business and personal reasons. Ch\u00e2teau staff said there was a rush on the place on Saturday, but even so they have 4,000 visitors instead of the 20,000 a day on a normal June weekend. France reported 31 new deaths from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the total to 29,142 since March. The number of patients in intensive care with the virus is down to 1,059. Poland\u2019s attempts to contain the virus are hampered by outbreaks in coal mines in the southern region of Silesia, the Financial Times reports. Like most of central Europe, Poland reacted quickly to the pandemic, closing its borders, shutting non-essential businesses and banning large gatherings, and suffered far fewer deaths (1,155) and infection cases (26,249) than many countries in western and southern Europe as a result. But for the past six weeks, Poland has recorded roughly 300-400 new infections a day, and more than 50% of these have come from Silesia, which accounts for just 12% of the population. More than 400 migrants disembarked in Malta overnight on Saturday from four tourist boats after the government U-turned and allowed them to land after nearly 40 days onboard. The 425 migrants, who had been picked up in the Mediterranean during various rescue operations, had been in limbo since April on the chartered boats held outside Maltese waters, Agence France-Presse reports. Malta had refused them entry, pointing to the closure of its ports due to the coronavirus emergency and also to its full detention centres. But in an about-face late on Saturday, Malta\u2019s government said it was not prepared \u201cto endanger lives of both the migrants and the crew, due the lack of solidarity shown by European Union member states in terms of relocation\u201d. \u201cNo European country accepted these migrants despite talk of solidarity,\u201d the government said in a statement. Sources told AGI news service the decision was taken because the crew feared for their safety, with the government saying the situation became \u201cvery difficult and commotions arose\u201d. In the late hours of Saturday and early Sunday, the boats docked at Boiler Wharf in Senglea and the migrants disembarked. It was not immediately clear where they were taken. Malta had come under fire from humanitarian groups for holding the migrants on the tourist boats, which are not designed for lengthy stays. Africa\u2019s long-distance truckers say they are facing stigma as they are increasingly accused of being carriers of coronavirus, the Associated Press reports. While hundreds of truckers have tested positive for the virus in recent weeks, the drivers say they are being stigmatised and treated like criminals, and being detained by governments. One side-effect is slowed-down cargo traffic, which has created a challenge for governments in much of sub-Saharan Africa, where many borders remain closed due the pandemic, on how to strike a balance between contagion and commerce. Abdulkarim Rajab, a Kenyan who has been driving trucks for 17 years, said: \u201cWhen I entered Tanzania, in every town that I would drive through, they would call me, \u2018You, corona, get away from here with your corona!\u2019\u201d, and recalls the times in which drivers were being accused of spreading HIV during that outbreak. Rajab and his load of liquefied gas spent three days at the Kenya-Tanzania border, where the line of trucks waiting to be cleared stretched into the distance and wound around the lush hills overlooking the crossing at Namanga. Tanzania closed the border there this week, the second time the frontier was closed in less than a month, after many Tanzanian truckers with negative results started testing positive at the border. The Republican senator Rick Scott claimed on Sunday the US has evidence China is trying to slow down or sabotage the development of a Covid-19 vaccine by Western countries. \u201cWe have got to get this vaccine done. Unfortunately we have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down,\u201d he said during a BBC interview. \u201cChina does not want us \u2026 to do it first, they have decided to be an adversary to Americans and I think to democracy around the world.\u201d Asked what evidence the US had, Scott declined to give details but said it had come through the intelligence community. \u201cThis vaccine is really important to all of us getting our economy going again. What I really believe is whether England does it first or we do it first, we are going to share. Communist China, they are not going to share,\u201d he said. Last week, Scott had described China as \u201can adversary\u201d, and called for a boycott of Chinese products, while urging his followers to \u201cbuy American\u201d. Indonesia reported 672 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, taking the total to 31,186, according to a health ministry official. There were 50 new deaths, taking the total to 1,851, while 10,498 people have recovered, the official, Achmad Yurianto, said. My colleague Robin McKie has taken stock of the world\u2019s attempts to get a grip on the pandemic, six months into a crisis that has killed an estimated 400,000 people, saw 6 million people get infected and has changed the world. The Australian government said on Sunday it will continue to underwrite domestic flights through September, extending its aid for airlines such as Qantas Airways and Virgin Australia Holdings hurt by the Covid-19 pandemic. Deputy prime minister and transport minister Michael McCormack said the initial backing, due to expire on Monday, will be extended to cover shortfalls in operating flights on top domestic routes, even as airlines start to rebuild crushed capacity, according to Reuters. Australia has barred its citizens from almost all outbound travel in order to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. \u201cThe Australian government is doing everything possible to ensure the aviation industry is sustained throughout the pandemic so that it can rebound on the other side,\u201d McCormack said in a statement. With border closures and social distancing since March, Australia has avoided the high infections and casualties of many nations, reporting 102 deaths and 7,255 infections so far. Malaysia will lift most coronavirus restrictions on businesses on Wednesday, including a ban on travel between its states, after a lockdown of nearly three months. The country\u2019s international borders will remain closed, however, Reuters reports. Prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced in a televised address on Sunday that the coronavirus outbreak was under control and Malaysia would begin a new recovery phase that would last until 31 August. Malaysia had gradually allowed businesses to reopen with social distancing guidelines over the past month, after shutting all non-essential businesses and schools, banning public gatherings and restricting travel on 18 March. Malaysian health officials reported 19 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the cumulative total to 8,322. So for, 117 deaths have been recorded. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Afghanistan has topped 20,000 as the country recorded its biggest daily rise in the number of deaths from Covid-19 on Sunday. The health ministry has detected 791 new cases from 1,427 tests, according to the latest update, bringing the total number of infections to 20,342. Thirty patients died overnight, taking the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll to 357. There have been 1,875 recoveries. The capital Kabul has recorded its worst day of the crisis after 23 patients died in the last 24 hours to Sunday and 313 new cases were detected. The capital is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 8,030 confirmed cases and 66 deaths. Mohammad Yaghoub Heidari, the governor of Kabul, warned that the actual number of infections in the capital may be much higher than official figures show. \u201cThere is a catastrophe going on in Kabul,\u201d Heidari said, adding that the city had started carrying out burials during the night. From Saturday, masks must be worn in public places, two-metre physical distancing must be maintained and gatherings of more than 10 people should be avoided, the health ministry announced. Elderly people have been advised not leave their homes and workplaces must be disinfected. The exodus of migrant workers from big cities is plunging India\u2019s factories into a crisis, Agence France-Presse reports. An acute shortage of workers has turned the roar of machines to a soft hum at a footwear factory near New Delhi, just one of thousands in India struggling to restart after migrant workers decided to leave town during the virus lockdown. India is slowly emerging from strict containment measures that were imposed in late March as leaders look to revive the battered economy, but manufacturers don\u2019t have enough workers to man the machinery. The big cities, once an attractive destination for workers from poor, rural regions, have been hit by reverse migration as millions of labourers flee back to their home villages, some uncertain if they will ever return. Sanjeev Kharbanda, a senior executive with Aqualite Industries, which owns the footwear factory in the northern state of Haryana, said: \u201cSixty per cent of our labourers have gone back. How can we run a production unit with just one-third of our workforce?\u201d Kharbanda said the company\u2019s sports shoe unit had been sitting idle as there were no skilled workers to operate the high-tech machines. \u201cWe are running just one shift now. The cost of production has gone up and our profits are going down,\u201d he said, a conveyor belt carrying semi-finished flip-flops running slowly in the background. In Gujarat state\u2019s Surat city \u2013 where 90% of the world\u2019s diamonds are cut and polished \u2013 many factories have been unable to open after more than two-thirds of workers fled, Surat diamond association president Babu Kathiriya told AFP. Meanwhile, the state\u2019s salt refineries have started doubling salaries to lure staff back. But experts say the workers may not return anytime soon. There are an estimated 100 million migrant workers \u2013 nearly a fifth of the labour force and contributing to an estimated 10% of GDP - across the nation of 1.3 billion people. Many are employed as cheap labour across a vast range of sectors including textiles, construction, mines and small businesses. Russia has reported 8,984 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours to Sunday, pushing the total number of infections to 467,673. Officials said 134 people had died during the same period, bringing the official nationwide death toll to 5,859. The coronavirus lockdown in Greece\u2019s overcrowded migrant camps has been extended for another two weeks, while the rest of the country gears up to revive its tourism-dependent economy, Agence France-Presse reports. \u201cFor residents of the reception and identification centres across the country, measures against the propagation of the Covid-19 virus are extended until 21 June,\u201d the official Government Gazette said. Greece has fared better than most of its European partners in the pandemic, with 180 deaths and 2,980 cases. The country was quick to introduce strict confinement measures on migrant camps on 21 March and imposed a more general lockdown on 23 March. More than 33,000 asylum seekers live in the five camps on the Aegean islands, with a total capacity of 5,400 people, and some 70,000 in other facilities on the mainland. While no Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the camps so far and only a few dozen infections, the measures have since been extended a number of times. Rights groups have expressed concern that migrants\u2019 rights could be eroded by the anti-virus restrictions. Massive virus screening in the camps only started in early May. Millions of people across the globe have relied on daily or even hourly updates from various media outlets during the pandemic, which saw new laws introduced, borders closed and restrictions amended, often overnight. CNN reports on how people without internet access have been affected. Taiwan will further ease its coronavirus restrictions, the government said on Sunday, as the island has kept the pandemic well in hand with only six active cases and no local transmission for 56 days. Taiwan has never gone into total lockdown and life has continued largely as normal due to its early and effective prevention work and a first rate public health system, but has promoted social distancing and ensured broad public access to face masks, Reuters reports. Taiwan\u2019s Central Epidemic Command Centre said that it would lift restrictions limiting the number of people who could participate in \u201cdaily life and leisure events\u201d, though people should continue to wear face masks if they were unable to socially distance. However, border entry restrictions remain, with authorities wary of a second wave of infections coming in from countries where the pandemic is still raging, such as the United States and Britain. Taiwan has reported 443 cases, the majority of which were in people who got infected overseas, and just seven deaths. Hello everyone, I\u2019m taking over from Rebecca Ratcliffe for the next few hours. If you have any updates to flag, please feel free to message me, either via email, or you can get me on Twitter @JedySays. I can\u2019t always respond to every email but I read them all and appreciate every tip. That\u2019s all from me - I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague in London, Jedidajah Otte, who will keep you updated with the latest coronavirus developments from around the world. China has released a lengthy report on the country\u2019s response to Covid-19, while officials have rejected allegations that information about the virus was withheld, the country\u2019s state television channel CGTN reports. The report praises officials\u2019 response to the pandemic as a thorough and comprehensive effort. China\u2019s relations with other countries have been strengthened rather than undermined by the pandemic, Ma Zhaoxu, the country\u2019s vice minister of foreign affairs, said, according to CGTN. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly has said authorities could be forced to ask Australians who attended Black Lives Matter protests over the weekend to self isolate if clusters emerge among attendees, reports Elias Visontay in Canberra. Kelly said he was encouraged by the sight of masks at Saturday\u2019s protests and said he understood the right to protest, but reiterated the different state governments and the Australian Health Protection and Principal Committee had strongly suggested people not attend any of the mass gatherings. He said that while people who attended the protests do not have to isolate or get tested if they don\u2019t have symptoms, \u201cif we were to start seeing cases crop up in the next week for example, then we might need to change that message\u201d. He also said the CovidSafe contact tracing app could help locate possible cases if there are reports of clusters among attendees. Black Lives do matter, all lives matter, and I absolutely understand the depth of feeling that people expressed in those protests yesterday and are expressing in other ways over this matter. It does bring people from widely dispersed parts of a city or a state that may not know each other into close proximity, which allows that virus to spread from person to person and then for people to widely scatter to within the city or the state...This is of concern if there was someone in one of those large protests yesterday with COVID-19, and they were infectious. Kelly made the announcement during a national Covid-19 update. As of Sunday afternoon, there have been six new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking Australia\u2019s total to 7260. However the number of active cases is now below 460, with less than 20 people in hospital and three people in intensive care units. The death rate remains at 102. Care home residents are on course to make up more than half the deaths caused directly or indirectly by the coronavirus crisis in England, according to a new analysis. The study warns that the death toll by the end of June from Covid-19 infections and other excess deaths is \u201clikely to approach 59,000 across the entire English population, of which about 34,000 (57%) will have been care home residents\u201d. The estimate, produced by the major healthcare business consultancy LaingBuisson, includes people who list a care home as their primary residence, wherever they died \u2013 including those who died in hospital. It is based on data from the Office for National Statistics, as well as the analyst\u2019s own modelling of the number of care home resident deaths likely to have occurred in the absence of the pandemic. The new study coincides with mounting concerns over the failure to protect care homes earlier in the pandemic. Senior care industry figures point to the decision to move some hospital patients back to care homes in mid-March. There have also been complaints that non-Covid-related healthcare became less accessible to homes during the height of the pandemic, leading to extra deaths. Fujifilm Holdings Corp\u2019s research on Avigan as a potential treatment for COVID-19 may drag on until July, a further setback in the Japanese firm\u2019s race to find a vaccine, reports Reuters. \u201cThere is a possibility that clinical trials will continue in July,\u201d a Fujifilm spokesman said, responding to a Nikkei report that any approval will be delayed until July or later, due to a lack of patients for trials. After the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave up on getting approval for the drug by the end of May, the aim was to complete clinical trials this month. But researchers have only been able to get around 70% of the patients needed for the trials, and because it takes 28 days to get results, the process will continue until at least July, the Nikkei business daily said, citing an unnamed source. The spokesman said Fujifilm does not make public details of the progress of clinical trials but it has expanded the number of medical institutions that are cooperate in the trials. \u201cWe aim to complete clinical trials as soon as possible.\u201d A further Black Lives Matter protest is planned for Western Australia\u2019s capital, Perth, next weekend after yet another Indigenous death in custody on Friday. Australian Associated Press has this report: An Aboriginal prisoner who died in Western Australia had suffered health problems, the state government says, while urging people who plan to attend another Black Lives Matter protest in Perth to abide by Covid-19 rules. The 40-year-old Acacia prison inmate was found collapsed on Friday but could not be revived and was pronounced dead in hospital. Police said his death did not appear to be suspicious, but they are investigating and an inquest will be held given it is a death in custody. The Department of Justice will also conduct an internal review. \u201cThe initial advice we have is there were some health issues associated with this poor man,\u201d premier Mark McGowan told reporters on Sunday. He then called on the organisers of a Black Lives Matter rally planned for Hyde Park on Saturday to comply with coronavirus rules. The death toll from the coronavirus worldwide is approaching 400,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. In total, 6,891,213 cases have been confirmed worldwide. Roughly a third of those cases, almost 2 million infections, are in the US. The health ministry in Brazil, which has the world\u2019s second-largest coronavirus outbreak, has removed data from a website that had documented the epidemic. The total number of cases, which have passed 672,000, and the death toll, almost 36,000, are now hidden from view. Australia\u2019s finance minister Mathias Cormann has condemned Saturday\u2019s mass protests to demand an end to Indigenous deaths in custody as reckless, selfish and self-indulgent. The deputy leader of the opposition, Richard Marles, said Cormann\u2019s rebuke was \u201ctone deaf\u201d. Scientists working on a potential coronavirus vaccine have almost reached a breakthrough on an antibody treatment which could saves the lives of the elderly and vulnerable. An injection of cloned antibodies that counteract Covid-19 could prove significant for those in the early stages of infection, according to the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Panama\u2019s government on Saturday said it would reintroduce restrictions on the movement of people in two provinces following increases in new cases. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 3,593 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 341 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 113,619 cases and 13,511 deaths. In the UK, places of worship will open for individual prayer from 15 June. The Covid-19 response in part of Northeast China\u2019s Jilin Province has been downgraded to a low level, meaning the country no longer considers any of its regions to be at high risk of the virus. Australian Associated Press has more on the concerns Victorian health authorities have about cases potentially spreading as a result of a Black Lives Matter protest yesterday in Melbourne, parts of which have had several recent cases of community transmission. The deputy chief health officer Annaliese van Diemen said on Sunday the Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne had increased the risk for cases. \u201cIn terms of potential outbreaks related to the protest, it really will be at least a week and probably closer to two weeks before we have an idea of whether there\u2019s been any transmissions or outbreaks related to that,\u201d van Diemen said. The impact will take its time to show due to incubation periods, people developing symptoms, getting tested and waiting for results, she said. More than 10,000 protesters flooded Melbourne\u2019s CBD on Saturday in a show of solidarity for the US Black Lives Matter movement and to call for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. Victoria police will fine the Melbourne organisers $1,652 each for breaching the directions of the chief health officer amid the pandemic. Organisers Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance posted online they were touched by supporters\u2019 offers to pay their fines, but preferred the money be directed to families directly affected by deaths in custody. Dr van Diemen urged people not to attend gatherings of more than 20 people as per the health directions. She didn\u2019t attend the rally and refused to comment on the cause. \u201cI am not going to make comment on the cause,\u201d she said. Van Diemen previously issued a controversial tweet where she likened the impact of Covid-19 to Captain Cook\u2019s arrival in Australia. Here is Press Association\u2019s full report on the antibody treatment that is being developed by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. Scientists say an injection of cloned antibodies could help treat people already infected. Thailand has reported eight new coronavirus cases, taking its total to 3,112 infections. The new cases are all among returnees who remain in quarantine. Since the start of the outbreak, 58 fatalities have been recorded. No new deaths were reported on Sunday. Manufacturing output across the UK increased last month from its record low as firms started to emerge from the coronavirus lockdown, Press Association reports. Business advisers BDO LLP said its resesarch suggested manufacturers regained some of the losses sustained between March and April as they benefited from the easing of lockdown measures. Despite the news, output remained at historically low levels, with businesses expecting a \u201clong and difficult\u201d path to recovery, said the report. Firms are grappling with social distancing restrictions while attention begins to re-focus on Brexit negotiations and international trade relationships, said the report. Kaley Crossthwaite, of BDO LLP, said: \u201cWhile the jump in manufacturing output offers a glimmer of hope, early signs point to this being a long road to recovery. The UK is experiencing the deepest economic contraction in living memory, and possibly in its history. \u201cOutput remains drastically below where it would be in ordinary times, but the latest readings suggest we have passed the rock bottom of this crisis.\u201d China\u2019s exports and imports fell in May as the economic slowdown abroad started to take its toll, and after a surprise jump driven by increased demand for anti-epidemic supplies, Agence France-Presse reports. The country has worked to restart its economy after bringing activity to a standstill to curb the coronavirus spread, but consumer demand has remained muted and China\u2019s key overseas markets are suffering downturns. Exports from the manufacturing powerhouse fell 3.3 percent on-year last month, better than the 6.5 percent slide expected by a Bloomberg poll of analysts. But the return to negative territory came after a surprise 3.5 percent jump in April, which was partly due to medical exports. Analysts have warned of signs that a larger downturn awaits. Press Association has the following update on efforts to find a coronavirus treatment. Scientists working on a potential coronavirus vaccine have almost reached a breakthrough on an antibody treatment which could saves the lives of the elderly and vulnerable, it has been reported. An injection of cloned antibodies which allows the body to counteract Covid-19 could prove hugely significant for those in the early stages of infection, according to British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. The company has already started to manufacture the Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine to ensure, if it does pass human trials, it can be made available in the autumn. On Thursday, AstraZeneca signed a deal with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) to help manufacture 300 million globally accessible doses of the coronavirus vaccine candidate being developed by the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford. One member of the coalition is the Serum Institute of India, which The Sunday Telegraph reports is considering other \u201cparallel\u201d partnerships with AstraZeneca that may lead to the antibody treatment being funded as a stand-alone treatment. AstraZeneca\u2019s chief executive Pascal Soriot told the newspaper that the treatment being developed is \u201ca combination of two antibodies\u201d in an injected dose \u201cbecause by having both you reduce the chance of resistance developing to one antibody\u201d. It comes as trials of the potential vaccine have started in Brazil, a new epicentre of the pandemic, to ensure the study can be properly tested as transmission rates fall in the UK. The Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began development on a vaccine in January, using a virus taken from chimpanzees. Meanwhile, UK-based vaccine manufacturer Seqirus announced it is working in partnership with parent company CSL, CEPI and the University of Queensland to help develop a candidate Covid-19 vaccine in Australia. Its manufacturing base in Liverpool is producing an adjuvant, an agent which improves the immune response of a vaccine. Western Australia has recorded no new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The state\u2019s total remains at 599, of which 31 are considered active cases. Of the active cases, 10 are Western Australians, one is from interstate and 20 are crew members from the Al Kuwait live export ship. The state Department of Health says there have been 115,507 COVID-19 tests performed in WA to date. Of those tested, 20,193 were from regional areas. Germany has reported 301 new coronavirus cases, bringing the country\u2019s total to 183,979, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The reported death toll has also risen by 22 to 8,668. The Australian Capital Territory has recorded its first Covid-19 case since 4 May, after a man in his 40s who had recently returned from overseas tested positive. ACT Health says he has been in quarantine since his arrival from overseas. A small number of close contacts have been identified and are also in quarantine. The man is the only known active case in the territory, which has had 104 cases in total. The ACT\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, said this most recent case would be recorded as overseas-acquired. \u201cWe are confident there has been no risk to the broader ACT community,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cThe case is, however, a good reminder of the ongoing pandemic and the need for our community to continue to observe physical distancing and hygiene measures, and for people to stay home if they are unwell. The case is also a demonstration of how important it is for us to maintain a high level of testing in the community.\u201d The ACT has conducted 20,379 negative tests to date. \u201cWe expect that as restrictions are lifted and the movement of people around Australia increases, it is likely that cases will continue to be diagnosed around Australia, including in the ACT,\u201d Coleman said. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has for the second time vetoed emergency legislation passed to regulate the Central American country\u2019s coronavirus policy and usher in a gradual reopening of its economy, Reuters reports. Bukele\u2019s legal counsel, Conan Castro, said Bukele had vetoed the law backed on May 30 by Congress because it breached a number of constitutional guarantees including the rights and health of workers and cooperation between organs of government. Castro was speaking to reporters at a news conference in San Salvador with other members of Bukele\u2019s legal team. Bukele, who has been at loggerheads with Congress for weeks over coronavirus policy, had vetoed a similar law in May on the grounds it put the public\u2019s health at risk. He had said he would do the same with the law passed last weekend. Bukele has imposed some of the toughest measures in the Americas against the pandemic, repeatedly clashing with lawmakers over the scope of the lockdown he is pursuing. Bukele\u2019s administration is also ready to sanction any companies that restart operations on Monday without proper authorization, Labor Minister Rolando Castro told reporters at a separate news conference in the capital. The country has recorded 2,934 coronavirus cases and 53 related fatalities. The coronavirus crisis is battering media outlets across Africa that were already struggling for cash and often facing pressure from hostile authorities, Agence France-Presse reports. In Kenya some media houses slashed wages by up to half, in Uganda a leading weekly halted printing, and in Namibia hours have been reduced and redundancy schemes fast-tracked. Qasim Akinreti, the chairman of the Lagos Union of Journalists said Nigeria had \u201clost hundreds of jobs in the past four months.\u201d The speed and severity of the current crunch has sparked calls for government bailouts - with private papers in Cameroon even holding a \u201cdead press\u201d day to denounce a lack of action. Authorities in some countries have heeded the pleas for help. Kenya\u2019s national regulator on Friday unveiled what it called a \u201chistoric\u201d fund worth just under $1 million to help some 150 broadcasters weather the storm. \u201cThis challenge of COVID-19 has squeezed life from television and radio stations,\u201d said David Omwoyo, the head of the Media Council of Kenya. Officials from Nigeria\u2019s journalist union said it had appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to provide emergency aid to distressed media. But there are fears that state aid would only increase political interference in sectors around Africa that are already often dominated by powerful vested interests. Just as the spread of the virus has caused revenues to dwindle, it has also posed unprecedented logistical challenges to media outlets. While the official figures - more than 170,000 infections and 4,700 deaths across the continent - have risen slower than elsewhere on the planet, governments have still imposed tough restrictions. Lockdowns have hampered reporting, social distancing has forced journalists to work remotely with poor internet or electricity supplies, and protective equipment has added new costs. A man who flew to Queensland, Australia, while infectious with Covid-19 appears to have not yet caused an outbreak, Australian Associated Press reports. The number of active coronavirus cases statewide has dropped to three and there have been no new positive tests overnight. The 24-year-old flew to Brisbane on Monday, where he socialised with friends and family, before flying to Bundaberg, checked into shared accommodation and worked a shift at a strawberry farm. Health officials are trying to track down everyone he came in contact with during his flight and while in Brisbane and Bundaberg. Contact tracing is under way for anyone who travelled from Melbourne to Brisbane on Virgin VA313 on Monday and from Brisbane to Bundaberg on Virgin VA2905 on Tuesday. Queensland\u2019s borders remain closed, but the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is making a pitch for intrastate travel with the slogan - \u201cgood to go\u201d. \u201cOne in 10 Queenslanders work in the tourism industry and they\u2019ve been doing it tough, but because of our health response, we can now open up Queensland and Queensland is good to go.\u201d Fengman district in Northeast China\u2019s Jilin Province has downgraded its Covid-19 response level to low, meaning the country no longer considers any of its regions to be at high risk of the virus, according to the state-backed Global Times. The Global Times quoted a health expert who warned sporadic infections were still possible, however, and that people should not lower their guard. \u201cWe should adapt to anti-epidemic normality in daily life,\u201d Wang Peiyu, deputy head of Peking University\u2019s School of Public Health, told Global Times. Australia\u2019s finance minister, Mathias Cormann, this morning called Black Lives Matter protesters reckless, selfish and self-indulgent, after tens of thosands took to the streets across the country. Cormann used an interview on Sky News to launch a full-throated attack on participants in yesterday\u2019s rallies in several Australian cities because the protests proceeded in contravention of current health advice to avoid mass gatherings. \u201cIt\u2019s quite irresponsible what we\u2019ve seen there,\u201d Cormann said. \u201cAs I think about the heartbreak of families who haven\u2019t been able to attend funerals for their loved ones because they were doing the right thing by taking the health advice, my heart just goes out to them. \u201cI mean, as they see people going recklessly to these sorts of demonstrations, that must be just awful for them to watch. I think it is incredibly selfish. It\u2019s incredibly self-indulgent. And yes, it does impose unnecessary and unacceptable risk onto the community.\u201d The deputy leader of the opposition, Richard Marles, acknowledged that protests in the middle of a pandemic were a \u201cvexed issue\u201d but he said Cormann\u2019s rebuke on Sunday was \u201ctone deaf\u201d. Marles said he would not attend any mass gathering in contravention of the Covid-19 health advice, but he said prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s suggestion that anxiety about institutional racism was being imported from the US \u201cis patently ridiculous\u201d. \u201cTo say to those who are standing up against it and to do something about it, that this is an act of selfishness and indulgence, is wrong,\u201d Marles said on the ABC\u2019s Insiders program this morning. An International Cricket Council board meeting on Wednesday could see the global governing body uphold a recommendation to prohibit the use of saliva in order to stop the transmission of the coronavirus, Agence France-Presse. Bowlers traditionally get the ball to move or swing in the air, thereby making it harder for batsmen to hit, by applying shine to one side via sweat - which can still be used - or saliva. However, as a temporary measure to combat COVID-19, the ICC\u2019s cricket committee has suggested banning the use of saliva. It seems unlikely cricket chiefs will row back from the saliva ban but former South Africa paceman Shaun Pollock, even though he is a member of the ICC cricket committee, gave current swing bowlers a glimmer of hope by suggesting health checks in place for next month\u2019s behind closed doors three-Test series between England and the West Indies might make it redundant. \u201cI think the environment that\u2019ll end up being created is almost going to be like a bubble,\u201d Pollock told the Following On Cricket Podcast. \u201cPeople will get tested, they\u2019ll go into a two-week camp where they\u2019re just going to sit and monitor how the conditions of their bodies change. \u201cAnd if there are no symptoms, it doesn\u2019t really matter about shining the ball then, because you\u2019re in the bubble and no one you come into contact with will have coronavirus. \u201cSo you can just get on with normal proceedings.\u201d My colleagues Luke Henriques-Gomes in Melbourne and Elias Visontay in Sydney have the following update on the Australian Black Lives Matter protests: Tens of thousands of people marched through Australian cities and towns for Black Lives Matter protests yesterday, defying an attempt from the police to ban one demonstration through the courts and despite pleas from the prime minister and state leaders for people to stay home. This morning, New South Wales police confirmed they had made an arrest and used pepper spray on protesters at Sydney\u2019s Central Station after the rally finished. Police said a 21-year-old man had been charged with offensive behaviour and resisting police, after he allegedly \u201cbecame violent\u201d when officers \u201cattempted to move a group of people through the station\u201d last night. Police said after he was arrested, the surrounding group of people in the station \u201cbecame increasingly aggressive\u201d, at which point \u201cOC [pepper] spray was deployed\u201d, and five people were treated at the scene from the effects of the spray. The Guardian has contacted NSW police for further comment about the decision to use pepper spray. There is concern that the use of pepper spray could intensify the risk of coronavirus transmission by causing mucus, saliva, and tears to leave the nose, mouth, and eyes. Here is a further update from Reuters on Brazil, which has removed from public view months of data on its Covid-19 epidemic. The health ministry in Brazil - which has the world\u2019s second-largest coronavirus outbreak - removed the data from a website that had documented the epidemic over time and by state and municipality. The ministry also stopped giving a total count of confirmed cases, which have shot past 672,000, more than anywhere outside the United States, or a total death toll, which passed Italy this week, nearing 36,000 by Saturday. \u201cThe cumulative data ... does not reflect the moment the country is in,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Twitter, citing a note from the ministry. \u201cOther actions are underway to improve the reporting of cases and confirmation of diagnoses.\u201d Bolsonaro has played down the dangers of the pandemic, replaced medical experts in the health ministry with military officials and argued against state lockdowns to fight the virus, hobbling the country\u2019s public health response. Neither Bolsonaro nor the ministry gave a reason for erasing most of the data on the covid.saude.gov.br website, which had been a key public resource for tracking the pandemic. The Australian state that has been the second hardest-hit by coronavirus, Victoria, has reported four new cases, taking it to a total of 1,685, Merran Hitchick reports from Sydney. Victoria has 70 active cases, including two in intensive care. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said there was ongoing evidence of community transmission in north and west Melbourne. He urged anyone who attended a Black Lives Matter protest yesterday to get tested if they developed any symptoms at all. \u201cWhile our testing message applies to all Victorians, it is especially relevant to residents in the north and west,\u201d Sutton said on Sunday. \u201cOur clear advice was not to attend yesterday\u2019s protest as thousands of people flooding the city was a risk. If you attended and go on to develop any symptoms no matter how mild - it is critically important that you go and get tested.\u201d Of the new cases, Sutton said, one was a household contact linked to an outbreak last month at Fawkner McDonald\u2019s. The three other cases were in returned travelers in hotel quarantine. Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, has reported no new cases in the past 24 hours from 9,207 coronavirus tests. One previously counted case has now been ruled out, so the state has had a total of 3,109 cases altogether. There are 70 active cases and no Covid-19 patients in intensive care. NSW Health says testing clinics are open across the June long weekend, though there is reduced availability at some sites, and urges residents to get tested even if they only have mild symptoms. Locations and opening hours are available here. Panama\u2019s government on Saturday said it would reintroduce restrictions on the movement of people in two provinces following increases in new cases, Reuters reports. From Monday, Panama will re-apply restrictions to stem the transit of people in the provinces of Panama, which includes the capital city, and Panama Oeste, the government said. The curbs will alternate between men and women, as well as in accordance with the numbers on identification cards. Nadja Porcell, director general of health, said in a televised address that the country was tightening its containment measures because the public was failing to uphold sanitary guidelines amid a recent surge in internal travel. Panama still has the chance to win the battle against Covid-19 because the health system has not collapsed, but if the behavior observed this week were to continue... essential resources could run out,\u201d Porcell said. The curbs are a setback for Panama, which on June 1 switched from applying a total lockdown to a night curfew and began reopening the economy, allowing non-metals mining operations to restart, as well as public-sector construction. During the past 24 hours, Panama\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus infection increased by 541 to 16,004, while fatalities rose by 16 to 386 in total, the government said. China reported six new cases of the novel coronavirus on Sunday, three more than the previous day, Reuters reports. Five of the new cases, recorded by late Saturday, involved travellers arriving from abroad, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on its website. One locally transmitted case was found in the southern island province of Hainan. The NHC also confirmed five new asymptomatic cases, or people who are infected with the virus but do not show symptoms, compared with two the previous day. The total number of infections in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, stands at 83,036. With no new deaths reported, the death toll remained 4,634. In Australia, the government is extending its support to the aviation sector to ensure the industry is sustained during the Covid-19 pandemic, Australian Associated Press reports. More than $1.2bn of measures have been provided to support the air industry, while the government said it would ensure Australians have access to domestic air travel as coronavirus restrictions are relaxed. Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said the funding would \u201censure Australian airlines and operators can maintain essential air services as we map out our economic recovery.\u201d The Domestic Aviation Network Support program will be extended to September 30, to maintain major domestic air routes and the Regional Airline Network Support program will be extended from September 30 to December 31, to ensure essential flights continue to regional communities. The government will also allow leased federal airports to seek partial relief from land tax charges to December 31 in line with state government land tax relief arrangements. Brazil reported an additional 904 coronavirus deaths and 27,075 new cases over the last 24 hours, Reuters reports. On Saturday, the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, threatened to pull out of the World Health Organization (WHO) over \u201cideological bias\u201d. This follows US president Donald Trump announcement at the end of May that the US would sever all ties with the WHO. Bolsonaro criticised the World Health Organization for suspending clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 - a decision it reversed this week - and threatened to follow in Trump\u2019s footsteps by quitting. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, the United States left the WHO, and we\u2019re studying that, in the future. Either the WHO works without ideological bias, or we leave, too,\u201d he said. Bolsonaro has followed the US president in his handling of the pandemic, downplaying its severity, attacking stay-at-home measures and touting the purported effects of hydroxychloroquine against Covid-19. Brazil is the second harest hit country for coronavirus cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. It has registered 35,930 total coronavirus deaths and 672,846 confirmed infections. More than half of Australians have felt challenged by their living situation during the Covid-19 outbreak, with many feeling very lonely, Australian Associated Press reports. A survey of more than 730 people conducted in May by support provider Relationships Australia looked into how people\u2019s relationships have been affected by the coronavirus restrictions. The data suggests that 45% of people either agreed or strongly agreed they felt very lonely during May. The survey suggests relationships with partners were more likely to be negatively affected during this time, with 42% of people experiencing a negative change in their relationship with their partner. Just over half (55%) of respondents were challenged by their living arrangements. The data, published today, suggests people who lived with their family reported an increase in the time and effort spent on their family relationships with 83% of respondents saying it had been necessary at the time. Meanwhile, more than 90% of people reported no significant changes in their relationships with friends, children, parents, neighbours and colleagues. One of Thailand\u2019s most popular tourist destinations, Phuket, will reopen its beaches next week as the country continues to ease its lockdown measures, the Bangkok Post reports. The country has avoided a major outbreak, recording a total of 3,104 cases since January, and no community transmission for almost two weeks. Thailand\u2019s tourism industry, however, has been hard hit by the suspension of global travel, and it is feared that the country\u2019s economy could contract by as much as 6% this year. Phuket airport will reopen for domestic travel on 15 June, but Thailand remains shut to international travellers. The government has said it is liaising with hotels to provide an additional 9,000 rooms to use as quarantine facilities for Thai citizens who are returning from abroad. All returnees are required to spend 14 days in state quarantine and undergo two coronavirus tests. In addition to the standard state quarantine process, which can involve staying in military or relatively basic hotel facilities, some high-end hotels are now offering luxury quarantine packages. Opec, Russia and allies have agreed to extend record oil production cuts until the end of July, prolonging a deal that has helped crude prices double in the past two months by withdrawing almost 10% of global supplies from the market, Reuters reports. The group, known as Opec+, also demanded countries such as Nigeria and Iraq, which exceeded production quotas in May and June, compensate with extra cuts in July to September. Opec+ had agreed in April that it would cut supply by 9.7m barrels per day (bpd) during May-June to prop up prices that had collapsed due to the coronavirus crisis. Those cuts were due to taper to 7.7m bpd from July to December. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 3,593 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 341 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 113,619 cases and 13,511 deaths, Reuters reports. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. The number of coronavirus cases globally now stands at 6,852,810, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Social-distancing guidelines have been increasingly challenged by global protests over the killing of George Floyd, prompting concerns that cases could surge in some areas. Hundreds of thousands have marched in the US, while in Australia, tens of thousands of people turned out for protests across Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and elsewhere. Public health officials have voiced concern that demonstrators and police at anti-police brutality protests could spur Covid-19\u2019s spread. Heavily criticized police techniques, such as using teargas and pepper spray on protesters, intensify this risk. Some of the hardest hit countries are beginning to ease their lockdown measures. In the US, which has the highest number of confirmed cases globally, (1,917,080) some tourist hubs are reopening, including Universal Orlando and Las Vegas\u2019s famed casinos. Meanwhile, in the UK, places of worship will open for individual prayer from 15 June. In other developments: Brazil\u2019s president Jai Bolsonaro has defended his decision to withhold some of the official data on country\u2019s coronavirus pandemic. OPEC members and other oil producing nations have agreed to extend their output cuts through July. World number one tennis player Novak Djokovic has shed doubt on whether the US Open tournament will go ahead as planned in September, saying coronavirus restrictions would make it impossible. California is planning to allow film, television and music production to resume from June 12, depending on coronavirus conditions at that time. The organisers of anti-racism demonstrations in Northern Ireland will be reported to the public prosecution service for breaking coronavirus locked rules, police have said. It comes after thousands turned out for protests across the UK following the death of George Floyd.
